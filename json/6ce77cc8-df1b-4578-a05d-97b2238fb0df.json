She was called Ravenhair....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>LONDON, ENGLAND</p> <p>OCTOBER 1737</p><p>The daughter of a duke learns early in life the proper etiquette for nearly everything. What dish to serve roasted larks in. When to acknowledge a rather risqu\u00e9 dowager countess and when to give her the cut direct. What to wear while boating down the Thames, and how to fend off the tipsy advances of an earl with very little income at the picnic afterward.</p><p>Everything, in fact, Lady Hero Batten reflected wryly, but how to address a gentleman coupling vigorously with a married lady not his own.</p><p>\u201cAhem,\u201d she tried while gazing fixedly at the molded plaster pears on the ceiling overhead.</p><p>The two people on the settee appeared not to hear her. Indeed, the lady gave a series of loud animal squeals from under the skirts of her atrocious puce-and-brown-striped gown, which had been flipped up to cover her face.</p> <p>Hero sighed. They were in a dim little sitting room off the library of Mandeville House, and she was regretting choosing this particular room in which to fix her stocking. Had she picked the blue Oriental room, her stocking would be straight by now and she\u2019d already be back in the ballroom\u2014far away from this embarrassing predicament.</p><p>She lowered her eyes cautiously. The gentleman, wearing an anonymous white wig, had discarded his embroidered satin coat and was laboring atop the lady in his shirtsleeves and a brilliant emerald waistcoat. His breeches and smallclothes were loosened to facilitate his endeavors, and every now and again a flash of muscled buttock was visible.</p><p>Sadly, she found the sight mesmerizing. Whomever the gentleman was, his physical attributes were quite... astonishing.</p><p>Hero tore her gaze away to look longingly at the door. Really, few would find fault with her should she turn and tiptoe from the room. That was exactly what she would\u2019ve done when she\u2019d first entered had she not passed Lord Pimbroke not two minutes before in the hallway. For, as it happened, Hero had noted the atrocious puce-and-brown-striped gown earlier in the evening\u2014on Lady Pimbroke. Much as Hero was loath to embarrass herself, her own feelings were not, in the end, as important as the possibility of a duel and subsequent injury or death to two gentlemen.</p><p>Having come to this conclusion, Hero nodded once, took off one diamond earbob, and lobbed it at the gentleman\u2019s backside. She\u2019d always quietly prided herself on her aim\u2014not that she used it much in everyday life\u2014and she was rather gratified to hear a yelp from the male.</p><p>He swore and turned, looking at her over his shoulder with the most glorious pale green eyes she\u2019d ever seen. He wasn\u2019t a handsome man\u2014his face was too broad across the cheekbones, his nose too crooked, and his mouth too thin and cynical for true masculine beauty\u2014but his eyes would draw any female, young or old, from across a room. And once drawn, their gaze would linger on the look of arrogant male virility he wore as naturally as he breathed.</p> <p>Or perhaps it was merely the, er, circumstances that gave him the look.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you mind, love?\u201d he drawled, the anger in his expression having changed to faint amusement when he\u2019d caught sight of her. His voice was gravelly and completely unhurried. \u201cI\u2019m busy here.\u201d</p><p>She could feel heat suffusing her cheeks\u2014really, this was an impossible situation\u2014but she met his gaze, making quite sure hers did not wander lower. \u201cIndeed. I had noticed, but I thought you should know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re the type who likes to watch?\u201d</p><p>Now her face was aflame, but she wasn\u2019t about to let this... this wretch get the better of her verbally. She allowed her gaze to drop swiftly and scornfully down over his rumpled waistcoat and shirt\u2014fortunately the tail hid his open breeches\u2014and back up. She smiled sweetly. \u201cI prefer entertainments in which I\u2019m not in danger of falling asleep.\u201d</p><p>She expected her insult to anger him, but instead the rogue tutted.</p><p>\u201cHappens a lot to you, does it, sweetheart?\u201d His voice was solicitous, but a sly dimple appeared beside his wide lips. \u201cFalling asleep just as the fun\u2019s about to begin? Well, don\u2019t blame yourself. Like as not, it\u2019s the gentleman\u2019s fault, not yours.\u201d</p><p>Good God, no one ever spoke to her like this!</p> <p>Slowly, awfully, Hero arched her left brow. She knew it was slow and awful because she\u2019d practiced the movement in front of a mirror for hours on end at the age of twelve. The result made seasoned matrons tremble in their heeled slippers.</p><p>The devilish man didn\u2019t turn a hair.</p><p>\u201cNow, as it happens,\u201d he drawled obnoxiously, \u201cmy ladies don\u2019t have that problem. Stay and watch\u2014it\u2019ll prove instructive, I guarantee. And if I have any strength left over after, maybe I\u2019ll demonstrate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Pimbroke is in the hallway!\u201d she blurted before he could finish his dastardly thought.</p><p>The mound of puce-and-brown-striped skirts quaked. \u201cEustace is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite. And heading this way,\u201d Hero informed Lady Pimbroke with only a touch of satisfaction.</p><p>The gentleman exploded into action. He was up and off the lady and throwing down her skirts to hide her pale, soft thighs before Hero could even blink. He caught up his coat, made one swift, appraising glance about the room, and turned to Hero, his voice still unhurried. \u201cLady Pimbroke has torn a ribbon or lace or some such thing, and you\u2019ve kindly consented to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He placed his forefinger against her lips\u2014warm, large, and quite shockingly inappropriate. At the same time, a male voice called from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cBella!\u201d</p><p>Lady Pimbroke\u2014or Bella\u2014squeaked in fear.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl,\u201d the rogue whispered to Hero. He turned to Lady Pimbroke, bussed her on the cheek, and murmured, \u201cSteady on, darling,\u201d before disappearing under the settee.</p><p>Hero had only a moment to watch Lady Pimbroke\u2019s pretty, insipid face go ashen as she realized fully the peril she was in, and then the door to the sitting room crashed open.</p><p>\u201cBella!\u201d Lord Pimbroke was big, reddened, and quite obviously intoxicated. He glanced belligerently around the room, his hand on his sword, but froze in consternation when he saw Hero. \u201cMy lady, what\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Pimbroke.\u201d Hero casually stepped in front of the settee, obscuring a large masculine heel with her wide skirts.</p><p>She employed her left eyebrow.</p><p>Lord Pimbroke actually backed up a step\u2014quite gratifying after the reception her eyebrow had received from the rogue\u2014and stammered. \u201cI... I...\u201d</p><p>Hero turned to Lady Pimbroke, touching lightly the horrid yellow braiding on the elbow of her gown. \u201cThat\u2019s fixed, I think, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lady Pimbroke started. \u201cOh! Oh, yes, thank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Hero murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done here, m\u2019dear,\u201d Lord Pimbroke said, \u201cthen perhaps you\u2019re ready to return to the ball?\u201d</p><p>His words may have been a question, but his tone of voice most certainly was not.</p><p>Lady Pimbroke took his arm rather sulkily. \u201cYes, Eustace.\u201d</p><p>And with a perfunctory good-bye, the two left the room.</p><p>Almost immediately, Hero felt a tug upon her skirts. \u201cHist! I can hardly breathe under here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may return,\u201d she said serenely.</p><p>\u201cI think I can see up your skirt.\u201d</p><p>She moved back hastily.</p><p>The rogue rolled out from under the settee and stood, towering over her.</p><p>Nonetheless, she glared down her nose at him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now. If I was, do you really think I\u2019d tell you?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, sounding rather like Cousin Bathilda at her most priggish. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019d boast of it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, grinning. \u201cDoes the thought have you all hot and bothered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your wig growing tight?\u201d she asked politely.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I would think your swelled head would make it quite uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>His smile became a trifle grim. \u201cMy head isn\u2019t the only thing out of proportion, I assure you. Maybe that\u2019s why you came in here? To sneak a peek?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou have no trace of shame, do you? Most men at least pretend to be abashed when caught in wrongdoing, but you\u2014you strut about like a feckless cockerel.\u201d</p><p>He paused in the act of donning his coat, one arm thrust out, the sleeve half on, and widened his beautiful green eyes at her. \u201cOh, of course. Moralizing. Naturally you must hold yourself superior to me when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you engaging in adultery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw me engaging in a pleasant fuck,\u201d he said with slow emphasis.</p><p>She flinched at the crudity but stood her ground. She was the daughter of a duke, and she would not flee from a man such as he. \u201cLady Pimbroke is married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Pimbroke has had numerous lovers before me and will have numerous lovers after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does not forgive your sin.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014slow and deep. \u201cAnd you are a woman without sin, is that it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have to consider the matter. \u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted cruelly. \u201cSuch certainty.\u201d</p><p>She stared, affronted. \u201cDo you doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, far from it. I believe absolutely that the thought of sin has never once crossed your perfect little mind.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin, feeling a thrill of excitement\u2014she\u2019d never before argued with a gentleman, let alone a strange one. \u201cAnd I begin to wonder if any thought of righteousness has ever crossed your shameless little mind.\u201d</p><p>He watched her a moment, a muscle twitching in his jaw. Then he bowed abruptly. \u201cI thank you for going against your own inclinations and saving me from having to kill Lord Pimbroke.\u201d</p><p>She nodded stiffly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I hope most fervently that our paths never cross again, my Lady Perfect.\u201d</p><p>Unaccountably, Hero felt a pang of hurt at his dismissive words, but she made sure not to let the weak emotion show. \u201cI will certainly pray that I never have to suffer your presence again, my Lord Shameless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we are in agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she stared at him, her breasts pressing against her stays with each too-fast breath, her cheeks hot with emotion. They\u2019d drawn closer in the heat of their argument, and his chest nearly brushed the lace of her bodice. He stared back, his eyes very green in his loathsome face.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her mouth.</p><p>Her lips parted and for an endless second, she forgot to breathe.</p><p>He turned and strode to the door, disappearing into the dim hallway beyond.</p><p>Hero blinked and inhaled with a shudder as she looked dazedly around the room. There was a mirror hanging on the wall, and she crossed to it to peer at her reflection in the glass. Her red hair was still elegantly coiffed, her lovely silvery-green dress properly in place. Her cheeks were a little pinkened, but the color was becoming. Strangely, she didn\u2019t appear all that changed.</p><p>Well. That was good.</p><p>She threw back her shoulders and swept from the room, her step graceful but quick. Tonight of all nights, it was important she present a serene, lovely, and perfect aspect, for tonight her engagement to the Marquess of Mandeville was to be announced.</p><p>Hero tilted her chin at the remembered sneer of the stranger as he\u2019d mouthed the word perfect. What could he possibly have against perfection anyway?</p><p>GODDAMN ALL SELF-SATISFIED, perfect women\u2014and that red-haired wench in the sitting room in particular!</p><p>Lord Griffin Reading, strode toward his brother\u2019s ballroom in a foul mood. Damnable chit! She\u2019d stood there disapproving and priggish and dared to look down her narrow nose at him. She\u2019d probably never felt an honest human urge in her entire, too-sheltered life. The only sign of her embarrassment had been the pink blotches climbing her delicately pale throat as she stared at him. Griffin grunted. That censorious face should have caused any man\u2019s pride to wilt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except, as it happened, he\u2019d had just the opposite reaction\u2014and it wasn\u2019t because he\u2019d not reached completion with Bella, either. No, the prospect of being discovered by an irate husband, followed speedily by a bloody duel at dawn had cooled his ardor quite thoroughly, thank you. By the time he\u2019d rolled out from under the settee, he\u2019d been calm in both body and mind. Until, that is, he\u2019d exchanged heated words with that holier-than-thou madam. His cock had seemed to look upon the argument as some kind of bizarre preamble to bedsport, despite the lady\u2019s obvious respectability, her hostility to him, and his own instant dislike of her.</p><p>Griffin paused in a shadowed corner, trying to calm himself as he fingered the diamond earring in his pocket. He\u2019d found the thing under the settee and had meant to give it back to Lady Perfect before her tart tongue had made him forget the trinket altogether. Well, served her right to lose her pretty earring if that was how she talked to gentlemen.</p><p>He rolled a shoulder. When he\u2019d entered the ballroom half an hour ago, he\u2019d not even had time to greet his mother and sisters before Bella had waylaid him with her naughty suggestion. Had he known her husband was attending the ball as well, he\u2019d never have let himself be drawn into such a dangerous tryst.</p><p>Griffin sighed. But it was too late now for self-recriminations. Better to simply file the embarrassing episode under Things Best Forgotten as Soon as Possible and move on. Megs and Caroline probably didn\u2019t care one way or the other that he\u2019d disappeared, but Mater would no doubt be keeping an eagle eye out for him. No use in putting it off. With a last tug at his neckcloth to make sure it was straight, Griffin entered the ballroom.</p> <p>Lights blazed from crystal chandeliers high overhead, illuminating a veritable crush. This would be the event of the season, and no member of London society wanted to miss it. Griffin began to weave his way through the mass of colorfully dressed bodies, his progress made slower by the frequent need to greet old friends and curious acquaintances.</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to attend, darling,\u201d a dry voice said at his elbow.</p><p>Griffin turned from a duet of simpering young matrons blocking his way and leaned down to kiss his mother on the cheek. \u201cMa\u2019am. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>The words were rote, but not the sudden emotion behind them. He hadn\u2019t been to London in almost a year, and it had been over eight months since his mother had visited him at the family estate in Lancashire. He tilted his head, studying her. Her fine hair, knotted elegantly under a lace cap, might have a few more gray threads, but otherwise her dear face was unchanged. Her brown eyes, bracketed with crinkled laugh lines, were far too intelligent, the soft-bowed mouth pursed to hide a fond smile, and the straight eyebrows were faintly arched in a perpetual amusement that matched his own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as brown as a nut,\u201d she murmured, reaching up to touch one finger to his cheek. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve been out riding the lands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerceptive as always, my dear mater,\u201d he said, offering his arm.</p><p>She linked her elbow with his. \u201cAnd how is the harvest?\u201d</p><p>A point of pain throbbed in his temple, but Griffin answered cheerfully, \u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>He felt her worried look. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a dry summer, so the harvest was smaller than anticipated.\u201d A pretty gloss on what in fact had been an abysmal harvest. Their land was not particularly fertile to begin with\u2014something his mother already knew\u2014but there was no point in making her fret. \u201cWe\u2019ll do well with the grain, never fear.\u201d</p><p>He was deliberately vague about what exactly he\u2019d be doing with the grain. That was his burden to bear for his mother and the rest of the family.</p> <p>His answer seemed to reassure her. \u201cGood. Lord Bollinger is showing interest in Margaret, and she\u2019ll need new gowns this season. I don\u2019t want to overstretch our funds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he replied, even as he swiftly calculated in his head. It would be a near thing as always, but he should be able to get the monies\u2014providing he suffered no further losses. The pain in his temple intensified. \u201cBuy Megs all the fripperies she wants. The family purse can stand it.\u201d</p><p>The line of worry between her brows eased. \u201cAnd, of course, there\u2019s Thomas.\u201d</p><p>He was braced for the subject of his brother, but somehow he wasn\u2019t able to prevent the slight stiffening of his muscles.</p><p>Naturally Mater sensed it. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came, Griffin. Now is the time to put that little contretemps behind you two.\u201d</p><p>Griffin snorted. He hardly thought his brother considered the matter a \u201clittle contretemps.\u201d Thomas acted with propriety in all things, and he\u2019d not have argued with Griffin over anything trivial. To have done so would be to let emotion rule him, which for someone as proper as Thomas was anathema. For a moment, Lady Perfect\u2019s wide gray eyes came to mind. She, no doubt, would\u2019ve gotten on famously with his priggishly correct brother.</p><p>Griffin made an attempt to appear pleased at the prospect of seeing Thomas again. \u201cOf course. It\u2019ll be wonderful to talk to Thomas.\u201d</p><p>Mater frowned. Obviously he needed to work on his pleased expression. \u201cHe misses you, you know.\u201d</p> <p>He shot her an incredulous look.</p><p>\u201cTruly, he does,\u201d she insisted, though he noticed two spots of color had flown into her cheeks\u2014even Mater had doubts about Thomas\u2019s reception of him. \u201cThis estrangement must end. It\u2019s not good for the family, it\u2019s not good for you both, and it\u2019s not good for me. Why it ever dragged on this long, I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>Griffin caught a flash of moss green out of the corner of his eye, and he turned, his pulse picking up. But the lady wearing the dress had already disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cGriffin, pay attention,\u201d his mother hissed.</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cSorry, thought I saw someone I wanted to avoid.\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are any number of disreputable ladies you wish to avoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, this one is rather too reputable,\u201d he said easily. His hand had drifted to his coat pocket, and he fingered the little diamond earring. He ought to return it to her, he supposed.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d For a moment, he thought his mother might be diverted from her harangue. Then she shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t try to change the subject. It\u2019s been three years since you and Thomas began this wretched argument, and my nerves are terribly frayed. I don\u2019t think I can take one more freezing letter between the two of you or dinner watching my every word for fear I\u2019ll raise the wrong topic of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPax, Mater.\u201d Griffin chuckled and bent to kiss her outraged cheek. \u201cThomas and I shall shake hands and make up like good little boys, and you shall dine with the both of us while I\u2019m in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my honor.\u201d He held his palm to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m going to be so pleasant and thoroughly nice that Thomas won\u2019t be able to stop himself from falling on me with protestations of fraternal love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in the world,\u201d he assured her blithely, \u201ccan possibly stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHAPPY?\u201d</p><p>Hero turned at the deep male voice and saw her dear elder brother, Maximus Batten, the Duke of Wakefield. For a moment, her mind blanked at the question. In the two months it had taken to arrange her engagement to the Marquess of Mandeville, Maximus had asked her several times if she was content with the match, but he had never asked her if she was happy.</p><p>\u201cHero?\u201d Maximus\u2019s straight dark brows drew together over his rather arrogant nose.</p><p>She\u2019d often thought that Maximus\u2019s looks suited his rank perfectly. If one closed one\u2019s eyes and tried to paint the perfect duke in one\u2019s mind, Maximus would appear. He was tall, his shoulders broad but not heavy, his face long and lean and just a tad too coldly commanding to be truly handsome. His hair was dark brown\u2014though he cropped it close, as he habitually wore immaculate white wigs\u2014and his eyes were brown as well. Brown eyes were often thought warm, but one impatient glance from Maximus was enough to disabuse anyone of that notion. Warmth was the last thing one would associate with the Duke of Wakefield. But despite all that, he was still her brother.</p><p>Hero smiled up at him. \u201cYes, I\u2019m quite happy.\u201d</p><p>Was that relief she saw in those stern eyes? For a moment, she felt a traitorous flash of irritation. Maximus had shown no sign before this moment that her happiness might be a factor in the match. The consolidation of lands and interests, the strengthening of his parliamentary alliance with Mandeville, those were the important considerations. Her feelings, as she well knew, played no part at all in the negotiations. And that was fine with her. She was the daughter of a duke, and she\u2019d known from the cradle what her purpose and place in life was.</p><p>Maximus compressed his lips, surveying the crowded ballroom. \u201cI wanted you to know that there is yet time for you to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d She glanced about the ballroom. Mandeville House was exquisitely decorated. Blue and silver swags\u2014the Batten family colors\u2014intertwined with Reading scarlet and black. Vases of flowers stood on every table, and the marquess had hired and outfitted a veritable platoon of footmen. Hero looked back at her brother. \u201cThe contracts are settled and signed already.\u201d</p><p>Maximus frowned in ducal displeasure. \u201cIf you truly wished to escape this engagement, I could break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous of you.\u201d Hero was touched by Maximus\u2019s gruff words. \u201cBut I am quite pleased with my engagement.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen I think it time we joined your intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her voice was steady, but her fingers trembled just a bit as she laid them on her brother\u2019s deep blue sleeve.</p><p>Fortunately, Maximus didn\u2019t seem to notice. He led her toward one side of the ballroom, moving unhurriedly but with his usual determination. Sometimes Hero wondered if her brother even realized that his way was made smoother because people were quick to step out of his path.</p><p>A man stood by the dance floor, his back to them. He wore somber black, his wig a snowy white. He turned as they approached, and for a moment Hero\u2019s heart stuttered in disbelief. Something in the set of his shoulders and the jut of his chin in profile reminded her of the rogue she\u2019d argued with just minutes before. Then he faced her, and she curtsied gravely to the Marquess of Mandeville, chiding herself for her silly imagination. It was hard to think of anyone less like Lord Shameless than her betrothed.</p><p>Mandeville was tall and appropriately handsome. If Mandeville smiled more often, his looks would come perilously close to beautiful. But one felt somehow that beauty in a marquess would be gauche, and gauche was the last thing one could call the Marquess of Mandeville.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace. Lady Hero.\u201d Mandeville executed an elegant bow. \u201cYou are even more lovely tonight than usual, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d Hero smiled up at him and was pleased to see a faint softening of his usually somber lips.</p><p>Then his gaze moved to the side of her head. \u201cMy dear, you\u2019re wearing only one earring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Hero automatically felt both earlobes, her face heating as she remembered what had happened to the missing earring. \u201cGoodness, I must have lost one.\u201d</p><p>Hastily she removed the lone diamond earring and gave it to her brother to place in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d Mandeville said, nodding approvingly. \u201cShall we?\u201d he asked the question of her but glanced at Maximus.</p><p>Maximus nodded.</p><p>Mandeville signaled to his butler, but already the room was growing quiet as the guests turned toward them. Hero pasted a serene smile on her face, standing straight and still as she\u2019d been taught from the nursery. A lady of her rank never fidgeted. She disliked being the center of attention, but it rather went with being the daughter of a duke. She glanced at Mandeville. And a marchioness would draw even more stares. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Naturally.</p><p>Hero suppressed a small sigh and inhaled and exhaled slowly, softly, and imagined she was a statue. It was an old trick to get through events such as these. She was a hollow, perfect facade of a duke\u2019s daughter. Really she\u2014the woman within\u2014didn\u2019t have to be here at all.</p><p>\u201cMy friends,\u201d Mandeville boomed. He was well known for his oratory in parliament, his voice rich and deep. Hero rather thought there was a touch of the theatrical about it as well, but of course she\u2019d never say so to his face. \u201cI welcome you all here tonight for a very important celebration: the engagement of myself to Lady Hero Batten.\u201d</p><p>He turned and took her hand, bending and kissing her knuckles very prettily. Hero smiled and curtsied to him as their guests applauded. They straightened and were immediately surrounded as the guests surged forward to offer their congratulations.</p> <p>Hero was thanking a rather deaf elderly countess when Mandeville called behind her. \u201cAh, Wakefield, Lady Hero, I\u2019d like to introduce you to someone.\u201d</p><p>She turned and met wickedly amused light green eyes. Hero could only stare, speechless, as Lord Shameless bowed and took her hand, brushing smooth, warm lips over her skin.</p><p>Distantly she heard Mandeville say beside her, \u201cMy dear, this is my bother, Lord Griffin Reading.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Queen Ravenhair had ruled her kingdom fairly and peacefully ever since the death of her husband, the late king. But it is not an easy thing for a woman to wield power in a world of men. For though she had advisors and ministers and men of letters, she could not fully trust any of them. Which was why every night Queen Ravenhair stood upon her balcony and held a little brown bird between her cupped palms. She would whisper her secrets and worries to the bird and then, opening her hands, let him fly free, high into the night, carrying her cares with him....</p> <p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>Hero took a deep, steadying breath and fixed a social smile\u2014neither too wide nor too small\u2014upon her face. It was a very middling expression that in no way revealed the shock of finding out that Lord Shameless would soon be her brother-in-law. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you, Lord Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He was still half bent over her hand so only she could hear his murmur.</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Her middling smile became a bit rigid as she hissed under her breath, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare cause a scene!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA scene? Me?\u201d His eyes narrowed, and she realized that she might have made a tactical error.</p><p>Hero tried to retrieve her hand, but the awful man tightened his hold as he straightened unhurriedly. \u201cHow delightful to finally meet my new sister. You don\u2019t mind if I call you \u2018sister,\u2019 do you, my lady? I feel as if we already know each other. Soon we\u2019ll be rubbing shoulders at every family gathering\u2014dinners, breakfasts, tea, and the odd snack here and there. The prospect simply takes my breath away, dear little sister. What a jolly family we\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>He grinned wickedly at her.</p><p>Hero\u2019s soul revolted at this rogue using such a familiar term. He was in no way fraternal to her. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She grit her teeth and surreptitiously yanked on her hand. His grip held firm.</p><p>\u201cLord Griffin, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut pray will you dance with me, my lovely new sister-to-be?\u201d he asked with jaw-dropping innocence.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at her words, his green eyes sparkling with sly mirth.</p><p>\u201c\u2014believe,\u201d she gritted, \u201cthat would be a good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He bowed his head, his eyes downcast. \u201cWhy would such a proper lady wish to dance with a wastrel such as I? I\u2019m so sorry to have importuned you.\u201d</p><p>His lips actually trembled. Hero felt her face heating. Somehow he had made her the villain of this piece.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty offer, Hero. What do you say?\u201d Maximus rumbled beside her.</p><p>She started, just a little bit, but Reading squeezed her fingers in warning. Good Lord! She\u2019d almost forgotten they were in the midst of a crowded ballroom. Such a thing had never happened to her before. No matter where she was, Hero was always completely conscious of being a duke\u2019s daughter, completely conscious of how she should act.</p><p>She looked at Reading in consternation and saw that he had lost his mocking smile. In fact, there was no expression at all on his face as he turned to his brother. \u201cWith your permission, of course, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>Standing together, she could see now the similarities between the brothers. They were of the same height, but beyond that they both tilted their square chins in a certain way, as if challenging any other man in the room. Studying the brothers, Hero thought that Reading\u2019s countenance looked the older of the two, though she knew he was the younger by several years. Lord Reading\u2019s eyes were deeper set, more lined, and much more cynical. He looked as if he\u2019d experienced lifetimes more than Mandeville.</p><p>Mandeville had not answered his brother, and the pause was growing awkward. The dowager marchioness stood between the men and was looking anxiously at her elder son. Perhaps she communicated something silently to him.</p><p>Mandeville nodded abruptly at his brother and smiled, though only his lips moved.</p><p>Reading immediately turned and started leading her toward the dance floor. His pace seemed unhurried, but Hero found herself halfway across the room before she knew it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cA minuet, I believe.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a speaking glance at the childish witticism.</p><p>\u201cNow, now, dear sister, mine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, sister?\u201d</p><p>They were on the dance floor now, and he pivoted to face her as other couples took their places around them.</p><p>Hero narrowed her eyes. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will soon be my sister,\u201d he said slowly and patiently, as if talking to a not-very-bright toddler. \u201cThe wife of my elder brother, above me in rank if not in age, always to be deferred to. What else should I call you but sister?\u201d He widened his eyes so guilelessly she nearly laughed.</p><p>Fortunately she was able to restrain herself. Lord knew what Mandeville\u2014let alone her brother\u2014would think if she giggled like a schoolgirl at her engagement ball. \u201cWhyever did you ask me to dance?\u201d</p><p>He feigned hurt. \u201cWhy, I thought to celebrate your wondrous engagement to my brother, of course.\u201d</p><p>She raised her left eyebrow, sadly ineffective though it was.</p><p>He leaned toward her and whispered hoarsely, \u201cOr perhaps you\u2019d like to discuss the particulars of our meeting in front of both our families?\u201d</p><p>The music began and Hero sank into a curtsy. \u201cWhy would I mind? It seems to me that you have more to lose than I should the circumstances of our meeting be made public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne would think so,\u201d he replied as they circled each other. \u201cBut that supposition does not take into account my brother\u2019s incredibly stodgy personality.\u201d</p><p>Hero frowned. \u201cWhat are you trying to insinuate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stating,\u201d Reading murmured, \u201cthat my brother is a narrow-minded ass who, if he had discovered you in that sitting room with Belle and me, would have immediately leaped to several unfortunate and wrong conclusions.\u201d</p><p>The movements of the dance parted them for a moment, and Hero tried to grapple with the notion of a man with a mind so blackened he would think the absolute worst of his own brother.</p><p>When they again met, she said softly, \u201cWhy are you saying these things to me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI merely speak the truth.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI think not. I think you strive to alienate my affections from your brother, which is a very wicked thing to attempt indeed.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, though a muscle jerked under his right eye. \u201cLady Perfect, we meet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI do not think Mandeville is as ill-willed as you seem to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hesitate to contradict a lady, of course, but you have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>She glared. \u201cYou are insulting, sir, both to your brother and to me. I cannot think what your brother has ever done to you to deserve such infamous treatment.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, so close she caught the scent of lemons and sandalwood. \u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t repress a shiver at the implied threat of his proximity. She wasn\u2019t a small woman\u2014in fact, she stood taller than many of her female acquaintances\u2014but Reading was male and loomed at least a foot over her. He was using that physical fact to intimidate her.</p><p>Well, she wasn\u2019t so easily intimidated. She snorted softly and turned to look him in the eye. \u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t conceive of a wrong so terrible that you would vilify your brother\u2019s character to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, then, your imagination is defective,\u201d he said, his eyes hooded.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps it is you who is defective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your eyes I probably am. After all, I do not possess the perfections of my brother. I am not a leading member of parliament, and I do not have his beauty or his grace. And\u201d\u2014he leaned close again\u2014\u201cI do not have his lofty title.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she stared at him in disbelief; then she laughed softly under her breath. \u201cAre you so jealous of him that you think I\u2019m marrying your brother only for his title?\u201d</p><p>She was gratified to see him jerk his head back, a scowl on his face. \u201cI am not jealous\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she interrupted him sweetly. \u201cThen perhaps you\u2019re merely a fool. Mandeville is an honorable man. A good man. And, yes, a man respected by his peers and by everyone he deals with, as well as my brother\u2019s friend and ally. I am proud to be his fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>The dance broke them apart, and when they rejoined, he nodded stiffly. \u201cPerhaps you are right. Perhaps I\u2019m merely a fool.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, caught off guard. The rogue she\u2019d thought him would not admit so readily to a human failing.</p><p>He glanced at her, a corner of his mouth quirking up as if he knew her thoughts. \u201cWill you tell Thomas about our meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t even have to think about it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wise. As I\u2019ve said, my brother would not think the better of you for your involvement.\u201d</p><p>Uncertainty whispered in her mind. As much as Hero didn\u2019t want to believe it of Mandeville, her fianc\u00e9 might just jump to the wrong conclusion.</p><p>She shook off the thought and looked Reading in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s your reputation that I seek to preserve with your brother.\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed, the sound rich and masculine, drawing stares from the other dancers. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know? I don\u2019t have a reputation to preserve, my Lady Perfect. Put away your shield and sword; lay down your shining armor. There is no dragon to slay for me. Nothing to protect at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she asked, sudden curiosity making her speak without forethought. She\u2019d heard a few whispered rumors about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s mysterious brother, but they\u2019d been maddeningly vague. \u201cAre you so irredeemable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a veritable blackguard.\u201d He circled her, pacing slowly to the music, whispering so only she could hear. \u201cA seducer, a rake, the worst sort of profligate. I am notorious for my pleasures\u2014I drink too much, wench with abandon, and belch in mixed company. I have no discretion, no morals, and no desire for either. I am, in short, the devil himself, and you, my dearest Lady Perfect, would do well to avoid my company at all costs.\u201d</p><p>A BURST OF male laughter made Thomas Reading, the Marquess of Mandeville, glance at the dance floor. Griffin had thrown his head back as he laughed with unbecoming abandon at something Lady Hero had said. Fortunately, the lady appeared less amused. Still, Thomas couldn\u2019t help the instinctive tightening of his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn Griffin to hell.</p><p>\u201cYour brother seems to be enjoying his dance with my sister,\u201d Wakefield murmured.</p><p>Thomas looked at the duke and met cool brown eyes. It was always deucedly hard to puzzle out what Wakefield was thinking, but at the moment the man could\u2019ve modeled for a male sphinx.</p><p>Thomas grunted and turned his gaze back to where Griffin paced about his intended bride. \u201cHe does indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Wakefield folded his arms across his chest. \u201cHero has been sheltered all her life\u2014as is proper for her station\u2014but her personal morals are of the highest. I know she will not fall even if presented with temptation.\u201d</p><p>Thomas nodded, feeling a flush of mortification creep up his neck. He had an urge to tug at his neckcloth at the duke\u2019s veiled admonition. \u201cI believe you, Your Grace. Lady Hero has my complete faith, and I shall never treat her in any way other than with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Wakefield clasped his hands behind his back and was silent a moment as they both watched the dancers. Then he said quietly, \u201cThe clause is ineffective.\u201d</p><p>Thomas glanced at him sharply. In an effort to act against the scourge of gin drinking among the poor of London, they\u2019d attached a gin clause to parliament\u2019s Sweets Act last June. The clause gave a bounty to informers who brought in illegal gin sellers.</p><p>\u201cEvery day more gin sellers are hauled before the magistrates,\u201d Thomas said slowly. \u201cHow is this ineffective?\u201d</p> <p>Wakefield shrugged. His voice was low and controlled, but his ire was plain. \u201cThey drag in the poor women who sell that devil\u2019s drink in wheelbarrows. Wretches who make only pennies a day. What we need is to catch the men distilling the gin. The powerful ones who hide in the shadows growing rich off the backs of those poor women.\u201d</p><p>Thomas pursed his lips. On the dance floor, Lady Hero was frowning at Griffin and the sight relieved him. \u201cCatch enough of the gin sellers and it will impact the makers as well\u2014I assure you. The clause is only months old. We must give it time, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t time,\u201d Wakefield replied. \u201cLondon is wasting under this plague. More citizens die than are born in our great city. Bodies litter the streets and garrets of the East End. Wives are deserted by their drink-destroyed husbands, babes killed by their drunken mothers, children abandoned to die or prostitute themselves. How can England prosper if the workers deteriorate in mind and body? We will wither and fail as a nation if gin is not eradicated from our city.\u201d</p><p>Thomas knew that Wakefield was concerned about the gin problem, but to care so deeply about this one cause? Such passion didn\u2019t fit the man he knew.</p><p>A movement from the other side of the dance floor caught his eye and scattered his thoughts. A woman stepped to the edge of the crowd. Her skirts were a flaming orange over primrose petticoats. Her hair was a deep, impossible wine-red, her lips and cheeks artificially rouged. Every man on that side of the dance floor watched her as she flirtatiously rapped her male companion\u2019s arm with her folded fan. He said something, and she arched her white throat and laughed, making her breasts jiggle.</p><p>\u201c... only if a man of substance is brought to account for gin making,\u201d Wakefield said.</p> <p>Thomas blinked, realizing that he\u2019d missed most of what his companion had said. He turned his head to the duke, but out of the corner of his eye he could still see the woman playfully drawing her fingers across the slopes of her breasts. \u201cWanton baggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Damn, he\u2019d spoken aloud and now Wakefield waited for an answer.</p><p>Thomas grimaced. \u201cMrs. Tate.\u201d He jerked his chin to indicate the woman across the room. \u201cEvery time I see her, she has a different beau, all younger than herself. The woman should be hauled up on indecency charges. Anyone can see that she\u2019s five and thirty if she\u2019s a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight and thirty,\u201d Wakefield murmured.</p><p>Thomas turned to look incredulously at him. \u201cYou know her?\u201d</p><p>Wakefield\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cI believe most of London society knows her.\u201d</p><p>Thomas glanced back at Mrs. Tate. Was Wakefield speaking of biblical knowledge? Had the duke bedded the woman?</p> <p>\u201cShe has a quick wit and an easy manner,\u201d Wakefield was saying lightly. \u201cBesides, she married a man three times her age. I don\u2019t begrudge her a little merriment now that she\u2019s widowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe flaunts herself,\u201d Thomas gritted. He could feel Wakefield\u2019s look.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but only with unmarried gentlemen. She is careful not to dally with a man otherwise engaged.\u201d</p><p>As if she\u2019d heard the word engaged, Lavinia Tate suddenly looked up, her eyes meeting his across the distance that separated them. He knew, even though he could not see them now, that her eyes were a plain brown. That, he thought with satisfaction, was something she couldn\u2019t change. Her eyes were and always would be ordinary brown, no matter how much paint she employed.</p><p>She held his eyes and lifted her chin in a challenge that would bring any red-blooded man to attention. It was a look as old as Eden, as old as Eve daring Adam with a bit of over-ripened fruit.</p><p>Thomas deliberately looked away from her proud gaze. He\u2019d tasted that fruit once, and though it had been difficult, he\u2019d weaned himself from its heady sweetness. The woman was a jade, plain and simple. And if there was one thing he\u2019d had enough of in this lifetime, it was jades.</p><p>LADY HERO\u2019S FACE was calm and grave and almost beautiful\u2014and she looked not at all impressed by Griffin\u2019s dramatic recitation of his sins.</p><p>\u201cI had already decided you were a rake,\u201d she said as he halted before her. She sank into a graceful curtsy. \u201cBut as you are to be my brother-in-law, Lord Reading, I think avoiding your company entirely may be somewhat difficult.\u201d</p><p>The woman certainly knew how to prick a man\u2019s illusions about himself. Once again he was hit with the awful irony that this woman out of all the women at the ball should be the one Thomas had chosen as his bride. A woman who made no bones about her displeasure with Griffin. A woman who had seen him at his very worst\u2014and showed no signs of forgetting the sight. A woman who was proud of her snowy-white soul.</p><p>Lady Perfect\u2014a perfect lady for his perfect brother.</p><p>He eyed her with disfavor, watching as she arched her damned left eyebrow in pointed query. She wasn\u2019t quite a beauty, his brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Instead she had that sort of elegance that was found sometimes among the upper crust of English society\u2014creamy pale skin, a slightly overlong face, properly neat features, and hair that was red without going so far as to be gauchely ginger.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her type a hundred times before, and yet... something about Lady Hero was decidedly different. For one thing, most of the ladies of her rank would\u2019ve simply left him to his fate in the sitting room. Yet she had gone against her own rigid morals to save both him and Bella. Had she acted out of compassion for two strangers? Or merely a stolid code of ethics that superseded even her own distaste for what she\u2019d found in the sitting room?</p><p>Griffin looked about. The music had halted, the dance was at an end, and he was supposed to escort her back to stodgy Thomas. Which he would do, of course\u2014just not yet.</p><p>He bowed, proffering his elbow in feigned docility. \u201cSad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She looked at his arm with sudden suspicion, but was forced by her own rigid propriety to take it. Griffin tamped down a surge of triumph.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she asked, her voice wary.</p><p>\u201cOh, that a woman as pious as you should have to put up with the company of a rake like me merely because of polite convention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She lifted her chin as he led her slowly through the crowd. \u201cI hope I know my duty.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cBuck up. Enduring my presence in your life will surely give you points toward sainthood.\u201d</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t turned to look at her at that very moment, he would\u2019ve missed the twitch of her soft, pink lips. Egad. Lady Perfect had a sense of humor! He\u2019d seen her smile, but the expression had been fixed and immobile. What would a genuine smile look like on her face? What would happen if she actually laughed?</p><p>Intrigued, he bowed his head toward hers, inhaling the scent of flowers. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t marrying my brother for his title, then why?\u201d</p><p>Wide gray eyes looked up, startled, into his. She was so near he only had to lean an inch or so closer and his lips would touch hers. He could find out what she tasted like, if she would break under his tongue and run soft and sweet like honey.</p><p>Good God! Griffin jerked his head back.</p><p>Fortunately, she seemed to have missed his confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled and glanced away. They were nearly across the room now and moving in the opposite direction from Thomas, though she didn\u2019t seem to notice. He was playing with fire, but he\u2019d always found danger terribly tempting.</p><p>\u201cWhy marry Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother and he are friends. Maximus urged me to make the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. My brother would not have considered Mandeville for me if the marquess weren\u2019t well regarded, kind, and a man of substance.\u201d She rattled off his brother\u2019s attributes as if listing the points of a breeding ram.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love him?\u201d he asked with honest curiosity.</p><p>She knit her brows as if he\u2019d burst into Swedish. \u201cI have no doubt that I will someday have affection for him, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d he murmured, feeling again that idiotic triumph. \u201cRather like a favorite spaniel, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>She stopped dead, and if she hadn\u2019t been restrained by her propriety, he had the feeling she would\u2019ve set her hands on her hips like an irate fishwife. \u201cMandeville isn\u2019t a spaniel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Great Dane, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Griffin...\u201d</p><p>He tugged her forward, leading her toward the outside edge of the ballroom. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve always thought it would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be in love with one\u2019s wife\u2014or in your case, one\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened for a moment, her gray eyes going a little foggy, her sweet lips parting. Griffin found himself drawn to her fleeting emotion. Was this a glimpse of the true Lady Hero?</p><p>Then she was back to being Lady Perfect, her spine erect, her lips firm, and her eyes giving nothing away. The change was rather fascinating. What had made her into such a chameleon?</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d she drawled in a bored, social voice that set his teeth on edge, \u201cto think that love has anything to do with marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause marriage at our rank is a contract between families\u2014as you well know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can\u2019t it be more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deliberately being obtuse,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me to explain society\u2019s rules to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re being deliberately thickheaded. My parents had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d he said, trying to keep the irritation from his voice. \u201cThey loved each other. I know it\u2019s rare, but it is possible, even if you\u2019ve never seen it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents, too.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to look confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her head was bent so that he saw only her mouth, curved down in sadness. \u201cMy parents. I have memories of... of a deep affection between them.\u201d</p><p>He remembered suddenly\u2014awfully\u2014that her parents had been killed. It had been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre over fifteen years before\u2014the Duke and Duchess of Wakefield murdered outside a theater by common footpads. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled and glanced up, her face unbearably vulnerable for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t be. Hardly anyone mentions them to me. It\u2019s as if they\u2019d never existed. I was in the schoolroom when they died, but I have a few fond memories of them, before... before it happened.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded, feeling a protective tenderness for this proud, prickly woman. They strolled in silence for a moment, the crowd surging around them, but making no contact. It was as if they were strangely apart. Griffin inclined his head to one or two people as they met, but he kept walking, forestalling conversation.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right,\u201d she said after a bit. \u201cMarriage with love between the partners is surely the ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why settle for less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove may grow between a husband and a wife after marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt also may not grow.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, looking pensive. \u201cAll marriages are gambles of a sort. One tries to even the odds by choosing wisely\u2014a man who is well liked, comes from a good family, and is kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Readings do have a lack of madness in the family that is somewhat refreshing in aristocratic lineages,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose up at him. \u201cWould you rather I marry into a family with a history of madness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d He frowned, trying to articulate why her rather cold-blooded decision to marry his brother bothered him. Lord knew he wasn\u2019t worried about Thomas\u2019s heart. \u201cYou said yourself that a love match is ideal. Why not wait to make one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have waited. I\u2019ve been out for over six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking for true love all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She shrugged, obviously irritated. \u201cOr something like true love. Besides, how long would you have me wait? Months? Years? I\u2019m four and twenty. I have an obligation to marry and marry well. I cannot wait forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn obligation.\u201d The words were sour on his tongue, though the thought wasn\u2019t new. Didn\u2019t all ladies of her rank have an \u201cobligation\u201d to make a good match?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat if I met my true love at sixty? What if I never meet him? There is no guarantee that I will. Would you have me remain a spinster on some faint hope?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her curiously. \u201cYou believe that you do have one true love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not one true love, but someone, surely. I think... yes, I think that we are each certainly capable of falling in love\u2014perhaps deeply in love\u2014and that somewhere out there is a person who will reciprocate that love.\u201d She wrinkled her nose, suddenly looking self-conscious. \u201cYou no doubt find talk of true love foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I do know romantic love is real. I\u2019ve seen it, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think a rake such as you could fall madly, deeply in love with one woman?\u201d Her words were meant to mock, but her tone was serious.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps, though it sounds a deucedly uncomfortable state to find oneself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve never been in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cNor have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d he said, pursing his lips. \u201cI wonder how it would feel? To be swept away by a grand passion? To give everything for only one person in the world?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips curved wryly. \u201cSo idealistic for a rake. Really, you do spoil my prior understanding of what the word entailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my social face,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse it with the animal beneath.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him searchingly for a moment before nodding as if coming to a conclusion. \u201cI\u2019m hardly likely to do that considering how I first found you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled to cover a twinge of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re so idealistic, my lord,\u201d she said, \u201cabout the connubial state, then why aren\u2019t you happily married with a score or more of offspring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m idealistic about love, my lady, not marriage. To be tied to one lady for the rest of my life, surrounded by small, grubby urchins?\u201d He shuddered in mock horror. \u201cNo, I shall gladly cede the matrimonial state and all its attendant duties to my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you do one day find yourself in love?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWhat then, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, then, all shall be lost, my lady. A rake\u2019s life crumbled to ruins, a splendid specimen of the bachelor state brought low by the bonds of matrimony and a delicate hand. But\u201d\u2014he lifted an admonishing finger\u2014\u201cthat is, as you yourself have pointed out, very, very unlikely. My one true love may be a lady living in farthest China. She might be a crone of ninety or a babe of two. I may never meet her in this lifetime, and I thank God in advance for that fact.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d teased a slight smile onto those soft lips, and his heart beat faster at the sight. A smile\u2014a genuine smile\u2014from this woman was like total nudity from another. And what a very odd thought that was.</p><p>\u201cWhy, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u201d\u2014he bent so close that his breath moved a wayward red curl by her ear\u2014\u201cwhile I may be far from perfect in your eyes, I do assure you that my life is perfect as it is. I enjoy my rakish ways, my freedom, and my ability to, er, dally with as many ladies as I might want. For me, true love would be a complete and utter catastrophe.\u201d</p><p>HERO STARED UP into Reading\u2019s roguish light green eyes. He\u2019d used a euphemism instead of the crudity he\u2019d employed in the sitting room, but his words were no less shocking because of that.</p><p>She swallowed, imagining a legion of ladies sprawled across his bed, his well-muscled buttocks thrusting in that mesmerizingly rhythmic movement. Dear Lord, she should be offended at the vision, but instead she wanted to press her palms to her cheeks to cool the heat rising there. She watched as Reading\u2019s eyelids drooped and his wide mouth opened to say something that would no doubt scandalize her even more.</p><p>Fortunately, they were interrupted.</p><p>\u201cMight I have my fianc\u00e9e back?\u201d Mandeville said in a voice that was a little too hard-edged to be jovial.</p><p>The teasing gleam left Reading\u2019s eyes, taking with it any softness in his face. What remained was an expressionless and rather daunting mask. Without his habitual humor, Reading might have been the type of man others followed into near-hopeless battle: a leader of men, a statesman, a visionary.</p><p>What a very odd thought to have about an admitted rake!</p><p>Hero blinked and realized that Mandeville was offering his arm. \u201cMy dear?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, dropping a curtsy for Reading before taking her fianc\u00e9\u2019s arm.</p><p>Reading swept into a bow so extravagant it verged on mocking. \u201cMy congratulations to you, Thomas, on your engagement. Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>He nodded rather more curtly to her and then turned to disappear into the crowd.</p><p>Hero let out a breath she did not know she was holding.</p><p>\u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t too trying,\u201d Mandeville murmured as he led her toward the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said, nodding to a passing matron.</p><p>She felt more than saw his sharp look. \u201cSome ladies find him very enticing.\u201d His tone was so neutral it might as well have been a warning shout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they do,\u201d she said gently. \u201cThe hint of danger and that wicked grin no doubt have many a feminine breast aflutter. But I\u2019ve always found a man who knows his responsibilities and keeps them far more attractive than one who spends his life playing.\u201d</p><p>The arm beneath her hand relaxed fractionally. \u201cThank you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor seeing so clearly what others do not,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, would you care to dance with your betrothed?\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, liking how the lines about his brown eyes crinkled when he looked at her. \u201cI\u2019d be delighted.\u201d</p><p>They danced a minuet and a country dance, and then Hero professed herself in need of refreshment. Mandeville led her to several chairs arranged by the side of the room and found her a seat before going in search of punch.</p><p>Hero watched him thread his way through the crowd, admiring his wide shoulders and firm stride. As always, he was stopped every few feet by well-wishers and those who merely wanted to be seen talking to the Marquess of Mandeville. She sighed, content. Really, Maximus had made the perfect choice of husband for her.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>Bathilda Picklewood\u2014or, as she was better known in the Batten household, Cousin Bathilda\u2014settled her substantial frame into a chair next to Hero. A distant relation on her mother\u2019s side, Cousin Bathilda had raised Hero and her younger sister, Phoebe, ever since the death of their parents. Cousin Bathilda\u2019s white hair was crimped into tiny curls about her forehead and was topped by a lacy triangular cap. She wore her favorite plum color, and her magnificent bosom was framed by white lace and black ribbons. From the crook of her arm peered a small black, brown, and white face. Mignon, Cousin Bathilda\u2019s tiny, elderly spaniel, accompanied her wherever she went.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, I must talk to you!\u201d</p><p>Since Cousin Bathilda nearly always spoke in exclamations, Hero merely raised her eyebrows. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t dance with Lord Griffin Reading ever again!\u201d Cousin Bathilda said with as much urgency as if she were importing state secrets. Mignon barked once as if to emphasize her mistress\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he and Lord Mandeville loathe each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Hero murmured, absently scratching Mignon behind her silky ears. \u201cI had noticed a certain strain between them, but I don\u2019t know if I would go so far as to call it loathing. Perhaps a general dislike...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much, much worse than dislike, my dear! Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d Cousin Bathilda lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cLord Griffin seduced Mandeville\u2019s first wife!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Far below the queen\u2019s balcony lay the royal stables. There, the little brown bird would come to roost at night after it had tired of flying. Early every morning, the stable master personally groomed the queen\u2019s favorite mare. As he curried the horse\u2019s chestnut coat, the little bird would sing above him in the stable rafters. And sometimes if the stable master listened hard enough, the bird seemed to be singing these words:</p><p>\u201cHigh, high on the castle walls</p><p>A sweet lady weeps alone at night.</p><p>Oh, will no one comfort her?...\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>It was times like this that being an unmarried lady was particularly galling, Hero thought later that night as she and Cousin Bathilda rode home in the carriage.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t anyone have told me about the scandal involving Mandeville\u2019s first wife?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a proper topic of conversation for a maiden.\u201d Cousin Bathilda waved a vague arm, nearly clipping Mignon\u2019s nose where it peeked out from her lap. \u201cSeduction and affairs and all that. Besides, how was I to know that you\u2019d go off and dance with the man as soon as you met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me in front of Maximus,\u201d Hero said for the third or possibly the fourth time. \u201cMandeville gave his permission!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t very well have done otherwise, could he?\u201d Cousin Bathilda replied with irritating logic. \u201cWell, what\u2019s done is done. You\u2019ll just have to be more careful in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Hero asked rebelliously. \u201cYou don\u2019t seriously think I\u2019d let myself be seduced by a rake, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Cousin Bathilda sounded scandalized at the mere notion. \u201cBut everyone will be watching you closely when the man is anywhere near you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d Hero crossed her arms on her chest. \u201cHow do we know Lord Griffin seduced Mandeville\u2019s wife anyway? Perhaps it\u2019s just a nasty rumor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s a rumor, Mandeville certainly believes it,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said. \u201cDo you remember the first Lady Mandeville?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hero wrinkled her nose. \u201cVaguely. She died four years ago, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over three years ago. You wouldn\u2019t have moved in her circles anyway. She was quite fast for a young matron, but then she was a Trentlock,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said darkly. \u201cAlways a feckless lot, the Trentlock family, though quite comely, of course. That must\u2019ve been what turned Mandeville\u2019s head. Anne Trentlock was a beauty, no doubt about it, and the family is old and very nicely situated. Everyone thought the match a good one when it was announced.\u201d</p><p>Hero couldn\u2019t suppress a shiver. Everyone thought her match was a good one. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Griffin Reading is what happened.\u201d Cousin Bathilda shook her head. \u201cThe man is wild, has been ever since his father\u2019s death. The old marquess died when Reading was at Cambridge. Reading immediately left and began living the life of a young rou\u00e9 in London. He associated with the worst sort of lowlifes, seduced married ladies, and was nearly involved in two duels. And through all these scandals, Mandeville was a rock of loyalty. He wouldn\u2019t hear anything against his brother even when Reading began to be refused invitations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then Mandeville married Anne Trentlock. It was the match of the season, and naturally Reading was invited.\u201d Cousin Bathilda sighed. \u201cIt was a year before you came out, dear, but I was there. Anne couldn\u2019t take her eyes off Reading\u2014everyone remarked upon it. There was speculation that she would\u2019ve set her cap on winning Reading instead of Mandeville, had it not been for Mandeville\u2019s title.\u201d</p><p>Hero frowned. \u201cWhat did Reading do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe acted no differently than usual, but of course he must\u2019ve taken note of Anne\u2019s infatuation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mandeville?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat could he do?\u201d Cousin Bathilda shrugged. \u201cI suppose he tried to keep them apart, but Reading is his brother. It was inevitable that eventually Reading should find an opportunity to seduce his brother\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInevitable only if he was a complete cad,\u201d Hero muttered. This story was depressing her terribly. She\u2019d known Reading was a rake, but to do such a thing to his own brother was simply appalling.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but by then we all knew what he was.\u201d Mignon whined and batted a paw. Cousin Bathilda absently scratched her under her chin. \u201cWhen Anne died in childbirth, the brothers weren\u2019t even talking to each other. And there were rumors about the babe. A mercy it did not live, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a horrible thing to say,\u201d Hero whispered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps so\u2014your compassion does you credit.\u201d Cousin Bathilda pursed plump lips. \u201cBut we must be practical, I\u2019m afraid. Had the child lived with his father uncertain, it would have been a terrible burden, both for Mandeville and for the child himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Hero murmured. She wrinkled her nose. She hated this kind of practicality, though\u2014the kind that would bless the death of an innocent baby.</p> <p>Cousin Bathilda leaned forward in the swaying carriage and patted Hero\u2019s knee. \u201cThat\u2019s all history now. Just remember to keep well clear of Reading and the past will be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Hero nodded. She parted the carriage curtains to look out, but the night was black and all she saw was her reflection in the glass. Dying in childbirth was awful enough, but how much more terrible to die having betrayed one\u2019s husband? She let the curtain fall. That was a fate she had no intention of following.</p><p>The ride home took another twenty minutes, and by that time, Cousin Bathilda was nodding and little Mignon was snoring in her arms.</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Cousin Bathilda yawned as they descended the carriage steps. \u201cWhat a lovely ball, but I\u2019m for bed now, I fear. I\u2019m not like you young things that can stay up until all hours!\u201d</p><p>They mounted the white marble steps of the neat town house Maximus had bought for Hero, her younger sister, Phoebe; and Cousin Bathilda three years ago. Until then, they\u2019d all lived with him at Wakefield House in one of London\u2019s most fashionable squares, but Maximus had said that it wasn\u2019t right for three ladies to be rattling about a bachelor\u2019s mansion. Hero suspected that this was Maximus\u2019s way of ensuring his own privacy, but she didn\u2019t object. While their town house wasn\u2019t as palatial as Wakefield House, it was quite elegant and comfortable.</p><p>Panders, the butler, opened the front door, bowing over a round little belly. \u201cGood evening, my lady, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like good morning, Panders,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said as she handed him her wrap and gloves. \u201cHave one of the footmen take Mignon for her before-bed constitutional and then bring her to my rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Panders took the little spaniel in his arms, succeeding in remaining grave even as Mignon bathed his chin with her tongue.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Panders.\u201d Hero smiled at the butler and relinquished her wrap before following the older lady to the upper floor.</p><p>\u201cI am so very proud of you for making this match,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said outside her room. She yawned again, delicately patting her mouth with one hand. \u201cOh, dear, I\u2019m quite done in. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Hero whispered, and turned down the hall to her own room. It was well past midnight, but oddly she didn\u2019t feel at all sleepy.</p><p>She opened her door and wasn\u2019t too surprised when Phoebe\u2019s mobcapped head popped up from the covers of her bed. \u201cHist! Hero!\u201d</p><p>Phoebe was the youngest of the Batten children and looked nothing like either Hero or Maximus. Where both Hero and Maximus were tall, Phoebe was short\u2014barely an inch over five feet\u2014and rather on the plump side, much to Cousin Bathilda\u2019s consternation. A fine cloud of curly light brown hair, already falling from her night braid, framed her face, and her eyes were hazel behind small, round spectacles. In her white lawn night rail, she looked all of twelve, though she\u2019d been seventeen for half a year now.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing still up?\u201d Hero closed the door behind her, then kicked off her slippers. Four candelabras lit the room, making it bright and warm. \u201cAnd what have you done with Wesley?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe hopped from the bed. \u201cI sent her away. I\u2019ll play maid and you can tell me all about the ball.\u201d Phoebe wasn\u2019t yet out and hadn\u2019t been allowed to attend the engagement ball\u2014much to her vocal disgust.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s much to tell,\u201d Hero began.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t tease!\u201d Phoebe was already working at the hooks to Hero\u2019s bodice. \u201cWas Mrs. Tate there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you wouldn\u2019t believe her gown,\u201d Hero said, relenting.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScarlet. Almost the same shade as her hair. And her bodice was so low it was nearly indecent. I swear I saw Mr. Grimshaw stumble over thin air he was so busy craning his neck around to ogle her bosom.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe giggled. \u201cWho else was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, everyone.\u201d Hero helped take off her bodice, and then they both began on the tapes fastening her skirts. She kept her eyes on her fingers and made her voice casual. \u201cI met Mandeville\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he lived in the north of England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came down for the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he like the marquess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little. They\u2019re both tall and dark, but other than that, they\u2019re completely different. Lord Griffin Reading has such pale green eyes, startling really. His face is more lined than Mandeville\u2019s and thinner. He seems merrier, laughing and joking, but I think he\u2019s less happy than Mandeville. And the way he moves...\u201d</p><p>Hero looked up and realized that despite her carefully neutral tone, she must\u2019ve given something away. Phoebe was watching her quizzically. \u201cYes? How does he move?\u201d</p><p>Hero could feel heat stealing into her cheeks. She made a production of stepping from her skirts and shaking them out before draping them over a chair for Wesley to clean and put away tomorrow. \u201cIt\u2019s rather odd. He seems to be doing everything slowly, and yet when he wants, he\u2019s faster than other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a cat,\u201d Phoebe said.</p><p>Hero straightened and looked at her, eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that big marmalade tom that hung around the stables at Wakefield House?\u201d Phoebe began to work on Hero\u2019s stays. \u201cIt was always sleeping or lounging about, but when it saw a rat\u2014bang!\u2014it would be off like a lightning bolt and have that rat in its jaws in seconds. Is Lord Griffin like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Hero said, remembering how fast Reading had moved just before Lord Pimbroke had entered the sitting room. \u201cLike a great cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Her voice was overloud, and Phoebe looked startled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dearest. It\u2019s just that Cousin Bathilda spent the whole carriage ride home warning me about Reading\u2019s reputation. You must stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe pouted. \u201cI never get to meet the really interesting people.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Hero had a little too much sympathy with Phoebe\u2019s complaint. She might be out, but she was allowed to mix with only the very best of society\u2014no one with even a hint of scandal.</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of perfectly respectable people who are interesting as well,\u201d she said to Phoebe with more confidence than she actually felt.</p><p>Phoebe looked at her doubtfully.</p><p>Hero wrinkled her nose and capitulated. \u201cAt least one can look at the scandalous people while conversing with more respectable gentlefolk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound as interesting as meeting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I assure you watching Mrs. Tate\u2019s progress across a ballroom full of silly gentlemen is quite fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wish I could\u2019ve been there.\u201d Phoebe sighed.</p><p>\u201cNext season you\u2019ll be eighteen, and we\u2019ll have a grand coming-out ball for you,\u201d Hero said as she sat at her dressing table.</p><p>Phoebe picked the pins from her hair. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be already married by then and off doing married-lady things. I\u2019ll have only Cousin Bathilda to accompany me, and you know I love her, I truly do, but she\u2019s so very old and\u2014oh!\u201d Hero glanced in the mirror in time to see Phoebe\u2019s head ducking behind her. \u201cDash it, I\u2019ve dropped a pin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s one of your emerald ones.\u201d Phoebe\u2019s voice was muffled.</p><p>Hero turned on the stool and saw her sister on her hands and knees, patting the carpet. Hero\u2019s heart squeezed. The emerald pin was right in front of Phoebe, not more than a foot from her nose.</p><p>Hero cleared her throat, feeling a sudden constriction. \u201cHere it is.\u201d She bent and picked up the pin.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Phoebe stood and pushed her spectacles up her nose. A frown marred her sweet face. \u201cSilly me. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Hero gently placed the pin in the glass dish on her dresser. \u201cIt\u2019s dark in here with only the candlelight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Phoebe said, but her frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cShall I tell you how the ballroom was decorated?\u201d Hero asked.</p><p>\u201cDo!\u201d</p><p>So Hero went into great detail about the decorations at Mandeville House, the refreshments, and each dance she took part in as Phoebe brushed her hair. Gradually her sister\u2019s expression lightened, but Hero\u2019s heart remained heavy as she watched the reflected light of the four candelabras in her mirror.</p><p>They made the room as bright as day.</p><p>ST. GILES WAS a veritable hellhole, especially after the bucolic beauty of the Lancashire countryside, Griffin mused early\u2014very early\u2014that morning. He guided Rambler, his bay gelding, through the darkness and across the stinking channel running down the middle of the lane. He couldn\u2019t take the shortest route to his destination, because some of the alleys that way were too narrow to accommodate a man riding a horse. And he\u2019d be damned if he left Rambler anywhere here. The horse would be stolen before his master was out of sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Griffin ducked his head as he rode under a swinging sign advertising a chandler\u2019s shop. No lantern hung by the door of the shop as it would in the better parts of London. In fact, the only light he traveled by was the moon\u2019s pale face. Thank God it was a clear night at least.</p><p>Up ahead, a low door burst open and two toughs staggered out. Griffin laid his right hand on the loaded pistol stuck in his saddle, but the men paid him no mind. Pausing only for one of them to cast up his accounts into the channel, they wandered off away from him.</p><p>Griffin let out his breath and moved his hand from the pistol\u2019s grip to Rambler\u2019s neck, patting the horse. \u201cNot much farther now, boy.\u201d</p><p>He rode down the lane and then turned into a slightly larger street, lined with brick and plaster buildings, some with overhanging upper stories. A nondescript door stood in a tall brick wall, hiding a courtyard beyond. Griffin pulled Rambler to a halt by the door. Taking the pistol from the saddle holster, he used the butt to knock upon the wooden door.</p> <p>Almost immediately a gruff male voice called, \u201c \u2019Oo\u2019s without?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Ow\u2019m I sure \u2019tis you, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>Griffin raised his eyebrows at the door. \u201cBecause I\u2019m the only one who knows about that night at the Lame Black Cockerel when you drank a dozen pints of ale and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door flew open, revealing shifty black eyes in the ugliest face Griffin had ever known, in London or without. The nose was mashed nearly flat, causing the lipless mouth to always be parted so the man could breathe. Stubble perpetually dotted the lined cheeks and chin, like some spreading mildew, broken by old pox marks and scars far less benign. The man was of average height, but his arms and shoulders were disproportionately large, ending with hands that hung like great slabs of ham by his side. Most who saw him assumed he was either a professional boxer or a murderer for hire.</p> <p>They\u2019d be right on both counts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that glad to see you, m\u2019lord,\u201d Nick Barnes said. \u201cMe and the boys \u2019ave been staking out the place, but we could sure use your \u2019elp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave there been any more attacks?\u201d Griffin swung down from Rambler but kept the gun in his hand and his eyes sharp as he led the horse through the door. Inside, the small courtyard was paved with cobblestones. Buildings rose up on three sides. Griffin had purchased the buildings to either side just last year as a precaution. Now he was grateful for the forethought.</p><p>\u201cSome lads tried to come in night afore last, but we beat \u2019em back right smart,\u201d Nick said, heaving a solid oak bar across the courtyard door.</p><p>Griffin led Rambler to an ancient stone water trough to let him drink. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s given up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vicar won\u2019t give up until \u2019e\u2019s dead, and that\u2019s a fact, m\u2019lord,\u201d Nick said soberly.</p> <p>Griffin grunted. He\u2019d not held high hopes that Charlie Grady, otherwise known rather blasphemously as the Vicar of Whitechapel, would give up so easily. The Vicar had a dirty finger in most of the illegal trades east of Bishopsgate, but recently he\u2019d begun expanding his empire west into the Seven Dials area of St. Giles.</p><p>And that had impinged on Griffin\u2019s interests.</p><p>Griffin gave a last pat to the gelding and turned to Nick. \u201cYou\u2019d better show me, then.\u201d</p><p>The other man nodded and led the way into the building directly across from the courtyard wall.</p><p>He opened a stout wooden door reinforced with iron and shouted, \u201cOy, Willis! You and Tim come \u2019ere and guard the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>Two men lumbered out of the building, touching their hats as they passed Griffin. One held a cudgel, the other a long knife that looked suspiciously like a saber.</p><p>Nick watched as they took up positions by the courtyard door and then nodded at Griffin. \u201cThis way, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>The lower floor of the building was one large, cavernous room, broken here and there by massive brick pillars, holding up the upper floors. Four large hearths smoldered under great covered copper kettles nearly as large as a man. Various copper pipes sprouted from the kettles, leading to slightly smaller copper pots, which were in turn connected to oaken barrels. The smells of smoke, fermentation, juniper berries, and turpentine were heavy in the humid air. A dozen more men were in the warehouse, a few tending the fires or the contents of the kettles, but most stood about, hired merely for their muscle.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought in all the other operations,\u201d Nick said, gesturing to the copper kettles. \u201cAll but the one that the Vicar\u2019s boys blew up on Abbott Street.\u201d</p><p>Griffin nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well, Nick. One position is more easily guarded than many.\u201d</p><p>Nick spat at the stone floor. \u201cAye, that it is, but we\u2019ll \u2019ave another problem when the \u2019arvest grain comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Nick tilted his head in the direction of the courtyard. \u201cThe outer door. It\u2019s too small to bring in a wagon full of grain. We\u2019ll have to toss the bags over the wall, and while we do, the cart, the boys, and the blasted grain\u2019ll be sitting like pullets awaitin\u2019 pluckin\u2019 for Sunday supper.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grimaced, not bothering to reply to Nick\u2019s succinct analysis of their position. He watched the men stoking the fires beneath the huge copper kettles. Most of his\u2014their\u2014capital was sunk into this operation, and the bloody Vicar was set to destroy it all. For the Vicar had declared that he would smash all other gin distillers and make himself king of gin in London.</p><p>And as it happened, Griffin was the biggest gin distiller in St. Giles.</p><p>SILENCE HOLLINGBROOK WOKE to little baby fingers poking at her eyelids. She groaned and opened her eyes. Big brown eyes framed by an extravagance of lashes met her own. Mary Darling\u2014the owner of the eyes and the baby in question\u2014sat up and clapped pudgy hands, crowing her delight in having woken Silence.</p><p>\u201cMamoo!\u201d</p><p>Silence grinned back at her tiny bedmate\u2014it was quite impossible not to, really. \u201cHow many times have I told you not to poke at Mamoo\u2019s eyes, you little imp?\u201d</p><p>Mary Darling giggled. At little over a year old, she had but three words to her vocabulary: \u201cMamoo,\u201d an emphatic \u201cno!\u201d and \u201cSoo\u201d for Soot the cat\u2014who was not nearly as fond of Mary Darling as she was of him.</p><p>Silence glanced at the tiny window to their attic bedroom and sat up in horror. The sun was shining brightly. \u201cOh, no. You should\u2019ve poked me in the eye earlier. I\u2019ve overslept again.\u201d</p><p>Hurriedly she did her morning ablutions, feeling a vague sense that she was forgetting something important. She changed Mary Darling\u2019s diaper and dressed them both\u2014and only just in time. A firm knock came at the door. Silence pulled it open breathlessly and looked into the worn face of her elder brother, Winter.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sister,\u201d Winter said gravely. He rarely smiled, but there was a twinkle in his eyes as he looked at the baby in Silence\u2019s arms. \u201cAnd to you, too, Miss Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>The baby chortled and made a grab for Winter\u2019s plain black hat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Silence said breathlessly as she gently plucked Mary Darling\u2019s fingers from Winter\u2019s flat hat brim. \u201cI did mean to be down earlier, but, well, I overslept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Winter said, and somehow his very lack of condemnation only made Silence feel worse.</p><p>She\u2019d started working at the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children over six months ago, but she still felt like she was learning. Running a foundling home that housed nine and twenty children and infants was no small task, even with the aid of Winter and three servants.</p><p>Her self-doubts were not helped by the fact that her predecessor had been her elder sister, Temperance. Silence loved Temperance dearly, but sometimes she wondered darkly if Temperance had to be such a paragon. In all the years that Silence had visited the home when Temperance had been in charge, she\u2019d found her sister busy, flurried, and sometimes tired beyond bearing, but Temperance had always been in control.</p><p>Lately Silence had begun to wonder if she\u2019d ever feel in control\u2014of the home, of her life, or of anything else.</p><p>\u201cNell has taken the children down for breakfast,\u201d Winter said now.</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh, yes,\u201d Silence muttered, shifting Mary Darling to her other hip and trying to extricate a ribbon from the baby\u2019s mouth. \u201cNo, dearest, it really isn\u2019t for eating. I\u2019ll go help, shall I?\u201d she said to her brother.</p><p>\u201cThat might be a good idea,\u201d Winter murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at luncheon.\u201d</p><p>Silence bit her lip, remembering how poor Winter had had to dine on cold bread and cheese yesterday because she\u2019d forgotten to put the soup on in time. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure and have it ready today, really I will.\u201d</p><p>A corner of Winter\u2019s stern mouth kicked up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry so\u2014I wasn\u2019t chastising you. And besides, I like cheese.\u201d He brushed a finger across her cheek. \u201cNow I\u2019m away to work. If I\u2019m not at the school before the boys, Lord only knows what mischief they\u2019d get up to in my absence.\u201d</p><p>Winter turned and clattered down the stairs. She didn\u2019t know how he found such energy when he not only helped run the home, but also taught in a day school for boys.</p><p>Silence sighed and followed more slowly, careful of her footing on the rickety stairs. The Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children had once been housed in an aging but sturdy building, but that had been before it had burned at the beginning of the year. Now, thanks to the generosity of the home\u2019s patronesses, the elder Lady Caire and Lady Hero, a beautiful new home was being built. It would have plenty of rooms, a big kitchen, and a garden for the children to take fresh air in. Unfortunately, the new home wasn\u2019t yet built.</p><p>In the interim, Winter, Silence, the home\u2019s three servants, Soot the cat, and all the home\u2019s children\u2014save for two infants boarded out with wet nurses\u2014lived in one too-small, dilapidated building in St. Giles. Silence could have lived in the rooms she shared with her husband, William, but William was the captain of the merchant ship Finch and was away most of the time at sea. It had seemed silly to live by herself in the rooms in Wapping and then travel every day all the way to the home in St. Giles.</p><p>And there had been Mary Darling.</p><p>Silence kissed the little girl\u2019s soft cheek as she descended the stairs. Mary Darling had been left on her doorstep nearly seven months ago. It had been a hard time for Silence\u2014William had been at sea, and their parting had been chilly. Mary Darling had been like the first rays of a bright new day. She\u2019d warmed Silence\u2019s life, and Silence had hated to part with her, even for as short a time as a night at the home. Silence heard the voices of the children even before she and Mary Darling reached the main floor. A dark, crooked passage led back to the home\u2019s kitchen\u2014a big room with blackened beams in the ceiling. Two long trestle tables took up the middle of the room, one for the boys, one for the girls. Mary Darling began bouncing at the sight of the other children.</p><p>\u201cAll right, sweetheart.\u201d Silence picked up a bowl of porridge and a spoon and slid into a space at the girls\u2019 table with Mary Darling on her lap. \u201cGood morning, everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Hollingbrook!\u201d the girls\u2014and some of the boys\u2014chorused. Even Soot glanced up, chin dripping, from his morning saucer of milk by the fire.</p><p>Mary Evening, the girl sitting next to them, leaned close. \u201cGood morning, Mary Darling.\u201d</p><p>Mary Darling, mouth full of porridge, waved her spoon in greeting, nearly hitting Mary Evening\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Mary Evening,\u201d Nell Jones said as she draped a big cloth across Silence\u2019s lap and front.</p><p>Nell was a merry-faced blond woman, the most senior of the servants and a former actress in a traveling theater. She might be only a bit over thirty years of age, but she knew how to wield an iron hand, and Silence had come to rely on her good sense since taking over the home\u2019s management. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, Nell,\u201d Silence said. Eating breakfast with a baby in one\u2019s lap could be a very messy task\u2014as she\u2019d found out in the last months.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, ma\u2019am. And you\u201d\u2014Nell bent and mock-scowled into the baby\u2019s eyes\u2014\u201ccareful with that great big spoon.\u201d</p><p>Mary Darling laughed up into Nell\u2019s face, splattering porridge down the front of her chemise. Silence sighed and wiped at the spill, taking a spoonful of porridge herself. Breakfast was almost over, and if she didn\u2019t eat now, she\u2019d not have another chance until luncheon.</p><p>Hurriedly, she ate the thick porridge, taking sips of the hot tea that Nell thrust in front of her. In between her own bites, she fed spoonfuls to Mary Darling, keeping both the hot teacup and the tempting bowl of porridge out of the baby\u2019s reach. Mary Darling was old enough to feed herself with her spoon, but the result tended to be incredibly messy.</p> <p>Around them the children ate cheerfully, aided by Nell and the other maidservant, Alice. The home also employed a manservant, Tommy, who helped with the heavier tasks and ran errands.</p><p>Nell suddenly clapped her hands. \u201cTime to clean up, children. We have a busy day ahead of us, for we have a very important visitor coming today.\u201d</p><p>Silence nearly choked on her last spoonful of porridge. Oh, dear Lord! She\u2019d completely forgotten. Lady Hero was to tour the home today\u2014and not only was Lady Hero their patroness, but she was also the daughter of a duke. Silence pushed her bowl away, feeling slightly queasy. Would she ever be comfortable in her position as manageress of the home?</p><p>HERO STEPPED GINGERLY from her carriage that afternoon\u2014gingerly because she\u2019d learned very quickly to watch where she placed her feet in the St. Giles streets. To the side, a man lay in the gutter. Hero made a wide circle around him, her nose wrinkling as she caught the stink of gin. Here was yet another victim of that terrible drink, sadly not that uncommon a sight. What misery would be relieved in London if only gin could be eradicated!</p><p>Once past the drunkard, Hero made her way down a little lane to where the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children was housed temporarily in a rather ramshackle building. Hero sighed silently. As the patroness of the home, she felt guilty whenever she saw the wretched condition of the house the children lived in.</p> <p>Mrs. Hollingbrook, the home\u2019s manageress, bobbed a nervous curtsy as she neared. \u201cGood afternoon, Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>Hero nodded, smiling\u2014she hoped\u2014graciously. The fact was that she\u2019d originally become a patroness of the home when Temperance Dews, now the younger Lady Caire, was in charge. Hero had felt an instant friendship with the then Mrs. Dews and had rather enjoyed her interactions with the woman. She\u2019d not found the same rapport with Mrs. Hollingbrook\u2014at least not yet.</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook was younger and less poised than her elder sister. Her face reminded Hero of a medieval saint\u2014all pale oval solemnity\u2014and like one of those painted martyrs, she seemed to hold a resigned melancholy close to her heart.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come in and have a dish of tea?\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook asked formally as she always did.</p><p>She stood aside, letting Hero precede her into the home. Hero stepped over the threshold, trying not to wince at the cracked plaster on the entryway walls. A cramped room lay at the back of the house, and Hero entered it, familiar now with the rhythm of her visits to the foundling home. Inside, four chairs, a low table, and a desk had been crammed into the small space. Hero took one of the chairs, drawing off her hat as Mrs. Hollingbrook fluttered about, supervising the tea.</p><p>Finally the other woman settled to pour the tea. \u201cNo sugar, is that correct, my lady?\u201d</p> <p>Hero smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow where have I put the spoons?\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook held the full teacup in one hand, the hot liquid sloshing perilously near the rim as she searched the crowded tea tray. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t take sugar, perhaps you won\u2019t need a spoon anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Hero took the cup before Mrs. Hollingbrook burned herself. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook smiled uneasily and sipped at her own tea. Hero looked down at her teacup. People were often awkward or shy about her, she knew. Her rank awed them. It was a perpetual problem\u2014how to put others at ease.</p><p>She inhaled and looked up. \u201cI understand the home has new residents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh, yes.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook straightened and placed her teacup down carefully on the low table. She clasped her hands in her lap as if about to recite a memorized poem. \u201cSince we saw you last month, my lady, we\u2019ve taken on two infants\u2014a boy and a girl\u2014and a little boy of four years. The boy, Henry Putman, is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook stopped here because Hero had coughed. \u201cI beg your pardon, but I thought all the boys were named Joseph at the home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, they usually are, but since Henry Putman already had a name\u2014which, as it happens, he was quite adamant about\u2014we thought it best to let him keep it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Hero nodded. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ve never understood why Winter and Temperance chose to name all the boys Joseph and all the girls Mary. It\u2019s incredibly confusing at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think so,\u201d Hero replied gravely.</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook smiled quickly and suddenly, the expression lightening her pale face and making her rather beautiful. \u201cAhem. We also placed two of our girls in apprenticeships this last month. And, with the monies you and the senior Lady Caire gave us, we were able to outfit both girls with new clothes, shoes, stays, a prayer book, a comb, and a thick winter cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Hero nodded approvingly. Some of her help was working at least. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to show me the home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook jumped up. \u201cIf you\u2019ll step this way, the children have been practicing all week for you.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook led the way into the dark little hallway and up a rickety set of stairs. They passed a first floor, given over, as Hero knew from previous visits, to dormitory rooms for the orphans. On the second floor there was a room for the toddlers and infants and a little room used as a classroom. Mrs. Hollingbrook led her here and opened the door with a flourish. Within, a dozen of the older children stood in two rows, faces scrubbed, and hair still slick from water.</p><p>As she entered, they spoke in unison. \u201cGood afternoon, Lady Hero!\u201d</p><p>She permitted herself a small smile. \u201cGood afternoon, children.\u201d</p><p>Her reply elicited a smothered giggle from one of the boys. A sharp glance from Nell Jones silenced the giggle. Mrs. Hollingbrook gave a discreet nod, and the children burst into ragged song\u2014a hymn, no doubt, though Hero couldn\u2019t quite place either the tune or the words. She kept her smile firmly in place even as the most enthusiastic girl went flat on a low note and one of the boys elbowed another in the ribs, making the second squeak.</p><p>The song ended on a rather screeching high note, and Hero fought not to wince. She clapped enthusiastically, and the little boy who had assaulted his neighbor grinned at her, revealing two missing upper-front teeth.</p><p>\u201cSplendid, children,\u201d Hero said. \u201cThank you for your song. And thank you to your teachers as well.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook blushed prettily even as she escorted Hero back down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming, my lady,\u201d she said as they made the front door. \u201cThe children look forward so to your visits.\u201d</p><p>Hero knew that Mrs. Hollingbrook was bound to flatter her because she was the home\u2019s patroness, but as she took the other lady\u2019s hand, it seemed that the manageress truly meant her words.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy my visits as well,\u201d Hero said.</p><p>She wished she could say more. Could promise that the children would be out of this wretched temporary home soon. Could tell Mrs. Hollingbrook that the children would have new beds, a new schoolroom, and a huge garden to run in come spring. Instead she smiled one last time and made her good-byes.</p><p>She picked her way back up the street with a heavy heart. She had a feeling her next visit of the day wasn\u2019t going to be nearly as pleasant.</p><p>\u201cPlease take me to Maiden Lane,\u201d she instructed the coachman before climbing in the carriage.</p><p>She sat and glanced idly out the window as the coach rolled forward. The home depended on her. Now that\u2014</p><p>\u201cOy!\u201d a male voice\u2014a familiar male voice\u2014shouted very near.</p><p>The carriage shuddered to a halt.</p><p>Hero leaned forward. Surely it couldn\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>The carriage door opened and a tall masculine form climbed in the carriage and settled himself against the red squabs across from her as if he owned the vehicle.</p><p>The carriage started as Hero gaped at him.</p><p>\u201cWe meet again, Lady Perfect,\u201d Lord Griffin drawled.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Inevitably there came a time when Queen Ravenhair decided she should remarry. A queen must have a king and a kingdom an heir, after all. So the queen consulted with her advisors and ministers and men of letters to decide who would be the perfect highborn man to marry. But here she found a dilemma. Her advisors thought Prince Westmoon the perfect match for the queen, while the ministers scorned Westmoon and instead preferred Prince Eastsun. What was worse, the men of letters hated both Westmoon and Eastsun and considered only Prince Northwind the perfect consort for the queen....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>Griffin hadn\u2019t believed his eyes when he\u2019d seen Lady Hero step into a carriage in the worst part of St. Giles. He\u2019d hailed the carriage, told the coachman who he was, and hastily tied Rambler to the back before jumping in.</p><p>Now Griffin watched as Lady Hero narrowed her lovely gray eyes at him. \u201cLord Reading. What a delight to see you again.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head as he smiled at her. \u201cDo I detect a wee bit of sarcasm in your words, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped demurely. \u201cA lady never engages in sarcasm with a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d He leaned forward as the carriage tilted around a corner. \u201cEven when she\u2019s been sorely provoked by a gentleman who isn\u2019t very, er, gentlemanly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially then.\u201d She pursed her lips. \u201cA lady always maintains her composure, always chooses her words carefully, and always takes care to use them with circumspection. She\u2019d never mock a gentleman no matter how provoked.\u201d</p><p>She recited her rules as if by rote, her manner so grave that he nearly missed the gentle wryness in her tone. But it was there. Oh, yes, it was there. He had no doubt that she observed these rules with Thomas, but not with him. That was interesting.</p><p>And vaguely worrisome.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should try harder to provoke,\u201d he murmured without thought.</p><p>For a moment her eyelashes lifted, and her gaze met his directly, her eyes wide and intrigued, the very frankness of her look, whether consciously or unconsciously, a feminine lure to a man.</p><p>He caught his breath.</p><p>Then her gaze dropped to her lap again. \u201cWhat are you doing in St. Giles, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiding in your carriage.\u201d He stretched his legs in the narrow space between the seats. \u201cThis is your carriage, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI\u2019d hate to have to take Thomas to task because he\u2019d loaned you his carriage to gallivant about the sewers of St. Giles. Unless\u201d\u2014he widened his eyes in pretend sudden thought\u2014\u201cWakefield gave you permission to come here?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin haughtily. \u201cI\u2019m not a child, Lord Griffin. I hardly need permission from my brother to travel where and when I choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Wakefield won\u2019t be surprised when I inform him where I met you,\u201d he replied silkily.</p><p>Her gaze darted away, confirming his suspicions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice deepened to something approaching a growl. \u201cI thought not.\u201d</p><p>Anger rose in him, swift and hot. He was caught off guard by the intensity of the primitive emotion. What did it matter to him if Thomas\u2019s primly perfect fianc\u00e9e put herself in danger by haring about St. Giles? Common sense said it was hardly his business.</p><p>Unfortunately, common sense held no sway with his emotions. Lady Hero in this place was so terribly wrong that he had to restrain himself from grabbing her and bearing her bodily away, ranting all the while about headstrong chits, recklessly oblivious brothers, and the myriad of ghastly fates that could overtake a gently bred lady in London\u2019s slums.</p><p>Griffin took a deep breath and rubbed his eyes. God, he needed sleep. \u201cSt. Giles is not known for its hospitality, my lady,\u201d he said as gently as possible. \u201cWhatever brought you here cannot possibly be as\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t patronize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He felt his jaw tighten. Damnation, but he wasn\u2019t used to being dismissed so cavalierly by anyone, let alone a woman. \u201cTell me why you are here.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and looked away.</p><p>He smiled tightly. \u201cIt\u2019s me or Wakefield. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you insist.\u201d She smoothed her skirt with her palms. \u201cI\u2019m going to inspect the building site of a home for foundling children.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever he\u2019d been expecting, it wasn\u2019t that. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She made a quick impatient grimace, so fast he almost missed it. \u201cBecause I\u2019m one of the patronesses of the home.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows winged up. \u201cQuite commendable. Why keep it a secret from your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret.\u201d She caught his skeptical look and amended, \u201cThe part about me being a patroness isn\u2019t a secret anyway. Maximus is well aware that I\u2019ve pledged to help the home. The problem is its location. He doesn\u2019t want me visiting St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI applaud his intelligence,\u201d Griffin said drily. \u201cThen why sneak out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the patroness!\u201d Lady Hero frowned at him like an offended queen, the look only slightly dampened by the freckles scattered across her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to make sure the new home is built properly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another patroness\u2014Lady Caire. But she is out of the country at the moment.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI would go to Lord Caire, her son, or his bride, the younger Lady Caire\u2014she is the sister to the manageress of the home and used to run it herself\u2014but they have recently married and have retired to Lord Caire\u2019s country estate for the next several months.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her incredulously. \u201cSo you\u2019re overseeing the building of the home all by yourself at the moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her chin tilted proudly, but her pretty mouth trembled.</p><p>He raised his eyebrow at her and waited.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going very well,\u201d she said after a second\u2019s hesitation. Her voice was a breathless rush, her hands twisted in her lap. \u201cActually, it\u2019s going terribly. The architect we hired appears to be untrustworthy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to visit the site today\u2014to see what he\u2019s accomplished in the last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what he hasn\u2019t accomplished?\u201d How odd that her small show of trust should make his chest expand with warmth.</p><p>She inclined her head. \u201cThat, too.\u201d</p> <p>Griffin shook his head. \u201cYou must tell Wakefield about your problem. He or his agent can deal with this for you.\u201d</p><p>She lifted that damned proud chin again. \u201cI am the patroness, not Maximus. The duty is mine. Besides,\u201d she added a bit less autocratically, \u201cMaximus would probably forbid me from the position of patroness if I told him of my troubles. He was quite unreasonable when he learned of my decision to help the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he doesn\u2019t like his money being spent for him.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cIt\u2019s my money, I do assure you, Lord Griffin. An inheritance from my great-aunt quite apart from my dowry. I own it free from any interference from Maximus\u2014or anyone else for that matter. I may do with it as I like, and I like helping the children who live at this home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon for my misassumption.\u201d Griffin held up his hands in surrender. \u201cWhy does your brother hate the thought of you helping orphans so much?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cIt\u2019s not the orphans he hates\u2014it\u2019s where they live. Our parents were killed on the streets of St. Giles. His loathing for this place is quite deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Griffin laid his aching head back against the squabs.</p><p>\u201cI was eight when it happened,\u201d she said softly, though he hadn\u2019t inquired. \u201cThey\u2019d been to see a play and had taken Maximus\u2014he was just fourteen. Phoebe and I were much too small to go to such adult entertainments, so we stayed at home.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, interested despite himself. \u201cWhat were they doing in St. Giles? There\u2019s no theater here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She slowly shook her head. \u201cMaximus never told me\u2014if he even knows. I remember waking the next morning to the sound of weeping. Our nanny was quite fond of Mama. All of the servants were terribly distressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs were you, no doubt,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She shrugged one shoulder, the awkward movement unlike her usual graceful gestures. \u201cMaximus was in his rooms\u2014he wouldn\u2019t talk for days\u2014and there was no one to take charge. I remember that I ate cold porridge in the nursery that morning while the adults tramped about and talked on the floors below. No one paid me any mind at all. After a bit, the family lawyers arrived, but they were strange and cold. It wasn\u2019t until Cousin Bathilda came a fortnight later that I felt safe again. As if someone was there to take care of me. She wore a terribly strong, sweet perfume, and her black skirts were stiff and scratchy, but it was all I could do not to cling to her as Phoebe did.\u201d</p><p>She smiled almost apologetically.</p><p>The thought of her as a little girl, pale, solemn, and freckled, worrying that there was no one in the world to look after her\u2014to care about her\u2014was almost too much to bear.</p><p>He looked out the window and noticed absently that the neighborhood had gotten worse, if that was possible. \u201cWill you come here again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She said the word without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d he muttered, and scrubbed his hands across his face. The stubble on his jaw scraped his palms. He probably looked like a beast. Christ, just last week a woman had been attacked and left for dead in St. Giles. \u201cLook here, I can\u2019t in good conscience let you wander about the streets of St. Giles alone.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened across from him, her lips parting, no doubt in argument.</p><p>He leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, and met her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t and that\u2019s final\u2014no matter your reasons or your arguments.\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth and tilted her chin away from him, staring out the window.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help a small grin\u2014she was so regally offended by him. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to make you a bargain.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit suspiciously. \u201cWhat kind of a bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell either Wakefield or Thomas about your jaunts to St. Giles, if you allow me to accompany you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she simply stared at him. Then she shook her head firmly. \u201cI cannot accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Lord Griffin, I daren\u2019t be seen in your company,\u201d she said as ice formed along his spine. \u201cYou see, I know you seduced your brother\u2019s first wife.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>READING THREW his head back against the squabs and roared with laughter, his strong brown throat working. The sound was merry, but there was an almost imperceptible edge of danger to his laughter that made Hero instinctively tense. She was suddenly aware that they rode in a small, closed space and that she didn\u2019t know Reading all that well.</p><p>And what she did know of him wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>She watched him warily as his laughter died. He wiped at his eyes with a sleeve, inhaling deeply.</p><p>When he looked up again, the rage that lurked in his eyes made her tense further. \u201cListening to gossip, Lady Perfect?\u201d</p><p>She met his savage look with a steady gaze. \u201cDo you deny the accusation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d His mouth made an ugly twist. \u201cYou and all the other stupid, quacking, tittle-tattling gossipmongers have decided the truth. Protestations of wronged innocence would merely make me look foolish.\u201d</p><p>Hero bit her lip at his hurtful words, staring blindly down at her hands. They were laid one on top of the other, and she was vaguely pleased to see that they didn\u2019t mirror her inner turmoil. What did it matter to her if this man thought her \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cquacking\u201d?</p><p>The carriage bumped to a halt. They were at the entrance to Maiden Lane. She looked across the carriage to find Reading watching her broodingly, his pale green eyes hooded.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have the reputation as a rake and a seducer of innocents\u2014my brother\u2019s innocent.\u201d He waved one hand wearily, as if the matter was negligible. \u201cI still won\u2019t let you risk your pretty neck in St. Giles. Either you let me accompany you and protect you or I\u2019ll go to Wakefield and Thomas. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his tricorne over his eyes and folded his arms across his chest, as if settling in for a nap.</p><p>She watched him incredulously for a moment, but he didn\u2019t move. Obviously, he\u2019d said all he was going to say.</p><p>The carriage door opened, and George, one of the two brawny footmen she\u2019d chosen to accompany her, looked curiously in. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said distractedly. She turned back to Reading and cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to inspect the building site now.\u201d</p><p>Reading didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Well! If he was determined to be rude, she wasn\u2019t about to stay and try to get the man to respond. Hero got up and descended the carriage with George\u2019s help.</p><p>Lifting her skirts, she picked her way down Maiden Lane to the spot where the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children was being rebuilt. But as she neared, her worst fears were confirmed. The building site looked deserted.</p><p>Hero dropped her skirts and frowned.</p><p>George shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cShall I see if anyone\u2019s about, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, do,\u201d Hero said gratefully, and watched as George disappeared into the facade of the construction.</p><p>She sighed. It was going to be a wonderful building\u2014if it was ever finished. They\u2019d bought the houses around the burned wreckage of the previous home and had them pulled down. Now the foundation and facade of what would be a lovely brick building took up most of this side of the street. Hero pivoted and glanced at the other side of the narrow lane. The buildings there were built so close it looked as if they propped each other up. Wooden structures against crumbling brick, tilting upper floors precariously hanging over the lane. It was a wonder the whole mess didn\u2019t fall down.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>George hailed her as he came back, trailed by a disreputable-looking character.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019s the only one I could find about,\u201d George said, indicating the fellow. \u201cSays he\u2019s the guard.\u201d</p><p>Hero looked in astonishment at the man. He held a half-eaten heel of bread and wore a bedraggled blue coat several sizes too big for his frame.</p><p>At her glance, he swept a tattered flat hat from his head and bowed precariously low, his graying shoulder-length hair nearly touching the ground. \u201cM\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPratt.\u201d He clutched his hat and piece of bread to his chest, his expression angelic. \u201cIf\u2019n it please you, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Hero sighed. \u201cWhere are the workmen, Mr. Pratt?\u201d</p><p>The guard screwed up his eyes as if in deep thought and looked upward. \u201cDon\u2019t rightly know, m\u2019lady. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll return in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Thompson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Aven\u2019t seen \u2019im in a while.\u201d Pratt shrugged and took a bite of his bread.</p><p>Hero compressed her lips, glancing away from the man. Mr. Thompson was the architect of the new home and was in charge of building it. He\u2019d been perfect in the planning stages, producing a lovely drawing of a new home with exact specifications. Both she and Lady Caire had been quite pleased with him. But when the actual construction began, Mr. Thompson became less reliable. Materials that were supposedly already ordered had been absent, and then their delivery delayed, causing the crew of workers that had been hired to find other work.</p><p>Lady Caire had pushed back her tour of the continent until the foundation had been laid. At that point it had seemed that the worst of the construction problems were over. They had their material, a new crew was hired, and Mr. Thompson\u2019s apologies and assurances were profuse. But a mere month after Lady Caire\u2019s departure, things began to go wrong again. Construction was slow; the expense reports Mr. Thompson submitted didn\u2019t make sense to Hero; and when she made polite inquiries, he either gave vague answers or ignored her questions entirely.</p><p>And now in the middle of the day no one was at the building site!</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Pratt,\u201d Hero said, and turned to walk back to the carriage. \u201cIs he sufficient to guard such a large site?\u201d she asked George quietly.</p> <p>George looked a little startled at having his opinion asked. He scratched his chin. \u201cNo, my lady, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Hero nodded. George was only confirming her own fears. She\u2019d have to hire more guards immediately if nothing else.</p><p>She had half expected Reading to have deserted her, but as she entered her carriage, she saw that he slouched against the squabs in the same pose as when she\u2019d left him almost an hour before. She sat and watched him as the carriage lurched forward.</p><p>He wore a rather shabby brown coat with a bottle-green waistcoat and dark brown breeches and boots. His long legs took up most of the space between the seats, his scuffed boots nearly under her seat. His black hat was still tipped over his eyes, and she noticed for the first time that his jaw bore a heavy stubble. Had he been out all night since the ball? He hadn\u2019t moved when she entered or when the carriage started, and she could hear a faint snore coming from his parted lips. Her gaze dropped to those lips. The bottom was fuller in sleep, lax and sensuous, contrasting with the deeply masculine shadow of the stubble about his mouth.</p><p>Hero looked quickly away.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided?\u201d he asked, making her start.</p> <p>She inhaled. Had he been feigning sleep all this time?</p><p>He sat up and stretched lazily, then glanced out the window. \u201cHeaded home, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse than I thought.\u201d She pursed her lips. \u201cThe architect appears to have decamped.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, unsurprised. \u201cAnd my bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your blackmail.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cCall it what you like, but I\u2019m not changing my mind. You go with me or not at all.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at her hands in her lap. Her fingers had curled into fists. She had no doubt that he would indeed tell both her brother and her fianc\u00e9 if she did not take his \u201cbargain.\u201d Mandeville would disapprove, but it was Maximus who would put a halt to her seeing the home\u2014and possibly to her being the patroness. She listened and obeyed her brother in all other matters, but not this one. She saw again the sweet faces of the children as they struggled with the hymn they\u2019d practiced for her.</p><p>Hero glanced up. Reading was watching her as if he knew the thoughts going through her head. She lifted her chin. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy this sudden worry for my person? Why do you wish this bargain?\u201d</p><p>She expected more anger, but instead a corner of his mouth kicked up, and if possible, he slouched more in his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re a suspicious woman, Lady Perfect. Perhaps my soft heart compels me to come to the rescue of reckless maidens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite wise,\u201d he said, widening his eyes mockingly.</p><p>She looked out the window. What choice did she really have if she wanted to continue to visit the home?</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said, facing him again. \u201cYou may accompany me next time I visit St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He yawned and then stood to rap on the ceiling of the carriage. \u201cYou can send a note to my house whenever you wish to go. Thirty-four Golden Square.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she was diverted by this news. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying at Mandeville House?\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The carriage jolted to a stop and he was out the door, pausing to turn and say, \u201cI\u2019ll be by your house at nine tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t planned on going to the home again so soon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I think I can help you with your problems with the architect,\u201d he said slowly and patiently. \u201cNine sharp. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>His green eyes pinned her, and she could only nod her head mutely.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said again.</p><p>He leaped from the carriage and slammed the door shut. In a minute the carriage jerked forward.</p><p>Hero released a breath as she let her body relax, and for the first time she wondered, What had Reading been doing in St. Giles?</p><p>HERO NERVOUSLY DESCENDED her front stairs the next morning. Nine of the clock was very early for Cousin Bathilda\u2014or any other fashionable lady\u2014to be abroad, but it would be just her luck to be caught in the company of her notorious future brother-in-law. But when she looked up and down the street, she saw no one.</p><p>No one at all.</p><p>For a moment her shoulders slumped in something perilously close to disappointment. She\u2019d have to send back the carriage, already waiting in front. Well, he was a rake, after all. What did she expect? Morning jaunts with respectable ladies were probably not his thing at all. In fact\u2014</p><p>\u201cMiss me?\u201d</p><p>The masculine murmur came so close to her back that she jumped and gave a little shriek. Hero turned to glare at Reading, who looked thoroughly disreputable and rumpled.</p><p>\u201cHave you been out all night again?\u201d she asked without thinking, and then had time to realize her mistake as heat crept up her neck.</p><p>He laughed as he handed her into her waiting carriage. \u201cOf course. We rakes never sleep at night. We have far more, ah, interesting things to do in the dark hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She lowered herself onto the cushions.</p><p>The strange thing was, even though his words irritated her immensely, she felt a flutter of excitement that he had indeed showed up for their appointment.</p><p>\u201cYou, on the other hand,\u201d Reading continued as he sat across from her, \u201clook fresh and well rested. A lovely morning lily, in fact.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him suspiciously. What should\u2019ve been a compliment sounded oddly like an insult coming from his mouth.</p><p>He smiled innocently, the curve of his wide mouth cutting deep lines into his cheeks. His jaw was stubbled darkly in contrast to the white of his wig.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you could pose for a cautionary engraving entitled \u2018Dissolute,\u2019 \u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>He barked with surprised laughter. \u201cMy lily has thorns, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilies don\u2019t have thorns, and, anyway, I\u2019m not your lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, merely my dear future sister.\u201d</p><p>She debated telling him\u2014again\u2014not to call her his sister, realized any protest on her part would probably only urge him on to more irritating behavior, and sighed, giving up the matter. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He stretched his legs between them, his boots brushing the silk of her primrose morning gown. \u201cI have an old friend I\u2019d like to introduce to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an architect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hero looked at him curiously. \u201cWhere did you meet him?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sardonic look. \u201cI do spend some time among respectable people now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waved aside her flustered apology. \u201cI met Jonathan Templeton at Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you left after only a year,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou did call me feckless,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cBut not everyone I met at university was as irresponsible as I. Jonathan\u2019s father was a vicar with very little income. The only reason he was at Cambridge was because a friend of his family had kindly taken it upon himself to pay for Jonathan\u2019s tuition. He repaid his friend\u2019s kindness by studying day and night.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, watching him. \u201cAnd what did you study at Cambridge?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cBesides wenching and drink, you mean?\u201d</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t rise to the bait.</p><p>After a moment, he looked down at his hands, a half smile on his face. \u201cClassical history, if you can believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged restlessly. \u201cNot enough to stay, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read Herodotus in the Greek,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cDid you indeed? I wasn\u2019t aware Greek was on the curriculum for fashionable debutantes these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t, of course.\u201d Why had she told him that? \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>She stared at her hands in her lap, wishing she could better control her words around him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think of his description of Egypt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She peeked up at him to see if he was mocking her, but he seemed serious. She hesitated, then leaned forward. \u201cI thought their burial practices perfectly hideous.\u201d</p><p>His face relaxed and fine lines appeared at the corners of his eyes as he smiled. \u201cBut fascinating, yes? All that mucking about with myrrh and frankincense.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered delightfully. \u201cDo you think his report true? So many of the other things he writes about seem quite fanciful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as Arion the harper who rode about on a dolphin\u2019s back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the winged serpents that guard the frankincense trees in Arabia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the giant camel-chasing ants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamel-chasing ants?\u201d She wrinkled her brow. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to see how you could miss it.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cIn India?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course\u2014the ants that dig up gold!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cThose are the ones.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOld Herodotus certainly liked a good story, but you know there are some very odd things in the world. Who\u2019s to say that the Egyptians didn\u2019t really stuff myrrh into their dead grandfathers? Or that there aren\u2019t really giant furry ants in India terrifying the camels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must admit it seems a little unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit no such thing, my lady.\u201d The smile still played about his lips. \u201cHave you read Thucydides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d She looked down at her hands again. \u201cThe tutor who had taught me Greek had to leave due to his poor health. The ones who replaced him didn\u2019t altogether approve of my studying Greek. French is much more important for a lady. Besides, I soon was busy with dancing lessons, and singing lessons, and painting lessons. There\u2019s so much one must learn before one makes a debut into society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he murmured. \u201cDo you like painting?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She inhaled and looked up frankly. \u201cI loathe it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI have a copy of Thucydides somewhere about. Would you like to borrow it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d She paused and looked at him. She should decline his offer. Becoming any more involved with Reading than she already was was a sure way to disaster. And he\u2019d sensed her thoughts\u2014his face was already closing in preparation for her dismissal.</p><p>\u201cYes. Please,\u201d she said before she could think any more.</p> <p>A wide smile lit his face. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>The carriage halted and Reading glanced out the window. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>He helped her out, and Hero saw they were in front of a neat, but by no means wealthy, town house. Reading knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awfully early to be calling,\u201d Hero hissed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s expecting us.\u201d</p> <p>And indeed the door opened to reveal a young man in a somber brown wig and round spectacles.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d he cried with an infectious grin. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Jonathan.\u201d Lord Griffin squeezed the other man\u2019s hand. \u201cLady Hero, this is my friend Mr. Templeton. Jonathan, Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God!\u201d Mr. Templeton exclaimed, losing his smile. \u201cI had no idea Lord Griffin meant to bring a lady of your rank, my lady. I mean, that is, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Hero nodded to Mr. Templeton, conscious that her position in society had once again put a damper on things. She sighed silently.</p><p>Mr. Templeton glanced about dazedly and then gestured inside. \u201cWon\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled at him, trying to put him at ease. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They were shown into a small sitting room, sparsely furnished but meticulously clean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called for some tea,\u201d Mr. Templeton said. \u201cI hope that meets with your approval, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d She chose a straight-backed chair while Reading wandered over to a single bookcase to peruse the shelves.</p><p>Mr. Templeton glanced uneasily at his friend. \u201cLord Griffin said that you wished to consult with me about a project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hero folded her hands on her lap and explained about the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children, the plans to build a new orphanage, and the problems they were having. By the time she\u2019d finished her recitation, the tea had arrived and Reading had wandered back from the bookcase.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Jonathan?\u201d he asked as he accepted a cup of tea from Hero. \u201cThis architect they\u2019ve hired sounds like a bad \u2019un.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Templeton shoved his spectacles up his forehead and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cMuch as I hate to malign a fellow architect, the fact is I\u2019ve heard of this person.\u201d He looked apologetically at Hero. \u201cIt\u2019s rumored he\u2019s fled the country because of his debts.\u201d</p> <p>Hero drew in her breath. If their architect truly had absconded, then they\u2019d lost the monies that she and Lady Caire had already paid for the new home. She had more of her inheritance, but it came in the form of an annual income, of which she\u2019d already withdrawn this year\u2019s amount. Where was she to find more money?</p><p>\u201cCan you do anything for Lady Hero, Jonathan?\u201d Reading asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course I can.\u201d Mr. Templeton put down his teacup. \u201cI can look over the plans your architect had drawn up and see what work needs to be done on the building. I can, in fact, with your approval, take over the project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful, Mr. Templeton,\u201d Hero said. \u201cBut I must be frank. With my copatroness out of the country, my funds are limited. I can pay you an amount right now, but the rest of your wages will have to wait until I can find more funds.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Templeton nodded. \u201cThank you for your frankness, my lady. I do appreciate it. Shall we say that I\u2019ll begin the work and when I need further funds, I shall inform you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that sounds like a good plan.\u201d It would certainly give her some time in which to come up with the \u201cfurther funds.\u201d Hero stood. \u201cI shall have the plans we have sent around to your house here, along with the directions to the home. Thank you, Mr. Templeton.\u201d</p><p>He rose hastily to his feet, bowing. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure, my lady.\u201d</p><p>He showed them both to the door, where Lord Griffin bid farewell to Mr. Templeton before helping Hero into the carriage.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you find more money for your home?\u201d Reading asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you consider a small loan?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, startled. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t accept money from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell anyone. It would be a small transaction just between you and me. You could pay me back when you are able.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened silently. He would have her in his power if he made a loan to her... but that wasn\u2019t what made her curious. \u201cWhy are you making this offer to me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cDo you have an objection to my money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me well. I don\u2019t even think you like me.\u201d She opened her hands in her lap. \u201cFor what purpose are you making this offer? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head back, staring at her. \u201cI think it perfectly obvious. I have the money and you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you make such offers to every lady who needs money?\u201d She began to blush the moment the words left her mouth as she realized the possible double meaning, but she held his gaze defiantly. Would he take the easy way? Turn this into a joke?</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. He looked irritated now, but he answered her nonetheless. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>She simply looked at him.</p><p>He leaned forward suddenly, his elbows on his knees. \u201cMoney is the one thing I\u2019m good at. You can trust me completely in this matter. I don\u2019t cheat. I don\u2019t steal. When it comes to financial dealings, you can rely on me.\u201d</p><p>He said it almost like a confession, and she was strangely touched, as if he\u2019d shared something deeply personal with her.</p><p>Yet she\u2019d only known this man for less than forty-eight hours. Years of practicality held her back. \u201cI do appreciate your kind offer,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cbut I think I must decline it for now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if he\u2019d expected her answer and sat back. \u201cMy offer is still open should you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly felt lighter, even though she\u2019d refused his money. He was on her side. She wasn\u2019t working alone anymore. \u201cI haven\u2019t thanked you, have I?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, a smile playing about his mouth.</p><p>She inhaled, fighting down her own silly smile. \u201cWell, I do thank you. Mr. Templeton seems like a competent architect and, perhaps more importantly, an honest one. I would never have found him without your introduction.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be of service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is one question I have for you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in St. Giles yesterday morning?\u201d</p><p>If she expected confusion or denials of wrongdoing, that wasn\u2019t what she got. Reading grinned and knocked on the ceiling of the carriage to signal the driver to stop.</p><p>\u201cI was in St. Giles on business,\u201d he said as the carriage halted. He opened the door and looked back at her over his shoulder. \u201cWicked, wicked business.\u201d</p><p>He jumped down and tipped his hat to her. \u201cGood morning to you, my Lady Perfect.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the door and the carriage started forward.</p><p>Hero sat back against the squabs, whispering, \u201cAnd good day to you, my Lord Shameless.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Well, this was quite the problem as you can imagine! For Queen Ravenhair trusted\u2014and distrusted\u2014her advisors, ministers, and men of letters all equally. How to choose which of the three princes would make the perfect husband? After puzzling on the problem for several days, the queen mounted her mare and announced to a gathered throng of her subjects that she had come to a decision. She would invite all three gentlemen to her castle and there hold a series of trials to discover her perfect consort and the man she would wed. All the court cheered.</p><p>But the stable master, standing by the head of the mare, was silent....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>The first thing Griffin noticed as he entered Mandeville House that night was the multitude of candles. That and the two footmen and the butler who rushed to take his hat signaled that Mater had decided to turn a simple family dinner into an Event.</p><p>Griffin sighed.</p><p>Dinner with his family was wearisome enough without the extra frills.</p><p>\u201cMy lady has already sat down,\u201d the butler said, his tone managing to sound both obsequious and disapproving at the same time.</p><p>\u201cOf course she has,\u201d Griffin muttered. It wasn\u2019t enough that he\u2019d have to endure a formal dinner with Thomas and his perfect fianc\u00e9e\u2014he must be late as well.</p><p>He stifled a yawn as he followed the butler up the stairs to the dining room. The few hours of sleep he\u2019d been able to catch between leaving Lady Hero in her carriage and waking belatedly to dress for dinner didn\u2019t seem nearly enough.</p><p>\u201cLord Griffin Reading,\u201d the butler announced as if everyone in the room didn\u2019t know him already.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Caroline, the elder of his two sisters, said. Caro had always enjoyed stating the obvious. She was considered a beauty by most, but Griffin privately thought that ill humor overrode any amount of glossy dark locks and large brown eyes. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn bed,\u201d Griffin said succinctly as he made his way down the room to his mother. He stopped to touch the cheek of Margaret, his younger sister. \u201cBeen well, Megs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Griffin!\u201d she said. \u201cI have missed you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, her round cheeks rosy. Megs was the youngest of the family at two and twenty and Griffin\u2019s personal favorite.</p><p>He grinned and continued to the foot of the table. There were seven at the long table: Thomas at one end with Lady Hero to his right and Caro on his left; Mater was at the other end with Wakefield on one side and Lord Huff, Caro\u2019s husband, on the other. Megs was between Caro and Wakefield. Which left the last empty chair standing between Huff and Lady Hero. She was wearing a sort of misty green tonight that made her red hair blaze like flame in the candlelight.</p><p>Griffin bent and kissed his mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cGood evening, Mater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t boast of your debauchery,\u201d Caro sniffed.</p><p>Griffin raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s only boasting if I tell who was abed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease refrain for all our sakes,\u201d Caro said.</p><p>Griffin met Mater\u2019s gaze, which was part amused, part exasperated.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tease your sister,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so easy,\u201d he whispered back before straightening and moving to take his seat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve missed the fish,\u201d Huff said.</p><p>His brother-in-law was a short, burly man. Caro had inherited the Mandeville height and stood several inches taller than her husband\u2014a fact that mortified her to no end but that Huff didn\u2019t seem to notice at all. Actually, Huff didn\u2019t seem to notice much of what his wife did. Nevertheless, he was fond of Caro in an absentminded sort of way, and Caro was quite happy with her match since Huff was one of the richest men in England.</p><p>\u201cWas it any good?\u201d Griffin murmured back.</p><p>\u201cCod,\u201d Huff said somewhat obscurely.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Griffin took a sip of the red wine that had just been placed before him. The social niceties out of the way with his brother-in-law, he really had no choice but to turn to Lady Hero. \u201cI hope you are well, my lady?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d seen her only hours before, but the clarity of her gray eyes was something of a shock nevertheless. He remembered her stubborn insistence that she help her home for orphan children, even if her brother disapproved of her endeavor. Then there was that moment after they\u2019d visited Jonathan when they\u2019d seemed to find a strange accord. His offer of a loan had been on pure impulse; he\u2019d never done such a thing before in his life.</p><p>And it had felt right. He\u2019d wanted to help her, share her burden with her. He didn\u2019t care one whit about the foundling home, but her...</p><p>What was it about her? He found himself staring into those diamond-clear eyes, watching as the dark pupils at their center grew larger as she looked at him. He leaned closer as if to catch the exhalation of her breath in his own nostrils.</p><p>Oh, this was not good.</p> <p>Beyond her, Thomas cleared his throat.</p><p>Lady Hero blinked. \u201cI\u2019m quite well, thank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Griffin nodded and let his gaze slide past her. \u201cAnd you, Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Thomas clipped. \u201cI\u2019m quite fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Griffin smiled briefly and took another sip of the wine. Maybe if he drank enough, this dinner would be bearable.</p> <p>\u201cI heard a terrible story yesterday,\u201d Caro said as she took a prim little sip of wine. \u201cAn entire family found starved in one of those wretched hovels in the East End.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow horrible,\u201d Meg said softly, \u201cto starve for want of a bit of bread.\u201d</p><p>Caro snorted. \u201cBread would\u2019ve done them no good. It seems the entire family, including a suckling babe, supped upon gin and nothing else until they quite withered away.\u201d</p><p>Griffin noticed that Lady Hero had set down her fork.</p><p>The Duke of Wakefield stirred. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised\u2014I only wish I were. We hear these types of tragedies almost daily, and I fear we will continue to do so until gin is eradicated once and for all from London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here.\u201d Thomas raised his glass at the head of the table.</p> <p>Griffin\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cHow do you propose to do this, Your Grace, if I might be so bold as to ask? If the people want to drink gin, surely trying to make them stop is a bit like attempting to empty the ocean with a soup spoon.\u201d</p><p>Wakefield\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIf we can shut down the distillers of this foul beverage, we will have won half the war. Without a supply, the poor will soon find some other healthier thing to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Griffin murmured as he sipped from his wineglass. Had the duke ever worried about his family\u2019s money? He thought not.</p><p>A plate of boiled beef was set before Griffin just as Megs said from across the table, \u201cHuff was telling us earlier about a ghost that is said to haunt the coffeehouse he attends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Caro muttered.</p><p>Griffin raised his eyebrow at his normally staid brother-in-law. \u201cA ghost, Huff?\u201d</p><p>Huff shrugged his shoulders, sawing vigorously at the beef on the plate before him. \u201cGhost or spirit. Said to bang a drum incessantly at night. At Crackering\u2019s Coffeehouse. Have it on good authority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside the coffeehouse?\u201d Lady Hero murmured. \u201cBut is anyone there after dark?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMust be,\u201d Huff said. \u201cOtherwise who would have heard him?\u201d</p><p>Griffin caught Lady Hero\u2019s eye and could\u2019ve sworn the lady was suppressing a smile. He hastily looked to his own plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard there is a ghost or phantom in St. Giles,\u201d Caro said somewhat surprisingly.</p><p>\u201cDoes he bang drums?\u201d Griffin asked gravely.</p><p>Caro wrinkled her nose. \u201cNo, of course not, silly. He kills people.\u201d</p><p>Griffin widened his eyes at his sister.</p><p>\u201cWith a sword,\u201d Caro said, as if that settled things.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear this?\u201d Mater asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Caro stared into space for a moment, a faint frown marring the creamy skin of her brow, then shook her head impatiently. \u201cEveryone has heard of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Megs said.</p><p>\u201cNor have I,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI wonder if Caro is making it up?\u201d</p><p>Caro inhaled, her face turning a rather dangerous pink.</p><p>Before she could speak, Lady Hero cleared her throat. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve seen him.\u201d</p><p>All heads swung toward her.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Megs said with interest. \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wears a harlequin\u2019s motley\u2014all black and red triangles and diamonds\u2014and he has a great floppy hat on his head with a red plume. Oh, and there\u2019s a pantomime half-mask covering his face.\u201d Lady Hero looked around the table and nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s called the Ghost of St. Giles, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a ghost at all. He seemed corporal enough to me.\u201d</p><p>There was a small silence as everyone contemplated her words.</p><p>Then Mater asked, \u201cBut what were you doing in St. Giles, my dear?\u201d</p><p>Griffin set his wineglass down, trying to think of an excuse for Lady Hero to have been wandering about St. Giles.</p><p>But the lady did not share his anxiety. \u201cI went to view the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children along with many other members of society. You remember, Maximus, early last spring. The home burned to the ground\u2014that was when I saw the Ghost of St. Giles. We had to put up the children in your town house. You were away for the month.\u201d</p><p>Wakefield\u2019s mouth twisted wryly. \u201cAh, yes. I came home to find a game of shuttlecock going on in the ballroom.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero pinkened. \u201cYes, well, we moved them out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been quite frightened,\u201d Megs said softly. \u201cA fire and a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very exciting,\u201d Lady Hero said slowly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I had enough time to become frightened. People were rushing about, trying to put out the fire and rescue all the children from the flames. The ghost merely disappeared into the crowd. He didn\u2019t seem like a murderer\u2014he actually helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he only murders at night,\u201d Griffin said lightly.</p><p>\u201cOr when not in a crowd,\u201d Megs added.</p><p>\u201cMondays,\u201d Huff said.</p><p>Griffin looked at him. \u201cWhat about Mondays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he only murders on Mondays,\u201d Huff said in a burst of verbosity. \u201cTakes the rest of the week on holiday as it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuff, you are a genius.\u201d Griffin stared at his brother-in-law with admiration. \u201cA murderer who only kills on Mondays! Why, one would be completely safe from Tuesday to Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Huff shrugged modestly. \u201cExcept for the other murderers.\u201d</p><p>But this was too much for Caro. She snorted like an enraged cow. \u201cNonsense! What would a ghost be doing running about St. Giles in a harlequin\u2019s motley if he isn\u2019t killing people?\u201d</p><p>Griffin raised his wineglass solemnly. \u201cOnce again you\u2019ve debated us into the ground, Caro. I bow from the field of elocution, bloody and defeated.\u201d</p><p>Hero made a small squeaking sound beside him as if stifling a laugh.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d Mater warned.</p><p>\u201cIn any case, I hope the ghost confines himself to St. Giles,\u201d Megs remarked. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t like to run into him tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s tomorrow night?\u201d Griffin asked absently. A new dish had been placed before him that seemed to contain jelly with unidentified bits floating in it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re off to Harte\u2019s Folly,\u201d Megs said. \u201cCaro and Huff, Lady Hero and Thomas, Lord Bollinger and me, and Lady Phoebe and His Grace.\u201d</p><p>Wakefield stirred at the other end of the table. \u201cI do apologize, but I\u2019ve found I have a prior appointment tomorrow night. I shan\u2019t be able to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, truly, Maximus?\u201d Lady Hero\u2019s voice was softly disappointed. \u201cWho shall escort Phoebe, then? You know she\u2019s been looking forward to this outing.\u201d</p><p>The duke frowned, looking nonplussed. No doubt he was rarely chastised.</p><p>\u201cDoes she need an escort?\u201d Griffin asked. \u201cI mean, with all of you there?\u201d</p><p>A look passed between Lady Hero and Wakefield, so fast that Griffin almost thought he\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps she needn\u2019t come,\u201d Lady Hero murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, but Griffin can escort her,\u201d Megs piped up. \u201cCan\u2019t you, Griffin?\u201d</p><p>Griffin blinked. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally we wouldn\u2019t want to put you out.\u201d Lady Hero was staring fixedly at the plate before her. Her expression was serene, but somehow he knew there was distress in her gaze.</p><p>Thomas was watching him, his face remote.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d Mater said, and for the life of him he didn\u2019t know if she said his name in encouragement or in warning.</p><p>And in any case it hardly mattered. Once again he gave into temptation. \u201cI\u2019d be delighted to accompany you all to Harte\u2019s Folly.\u201d</p><p>HIS FACE ITCHED.</p><p>Charlie Grady propped one elbow on the plank table he sat at and scratched absently, feeling the bumps and ridges under his fingertips. Freddy, one of his best men, fidgeted in front of him. Freddy was a big bear of a man, all but bald, with a nasty scar running through his lower lip. He\u2019d killed four men in the last month alone, yet he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to look Charlie in the face. Instead, his gaze dropped to the floor, drifted to the ceiling, and just grazed Charlie\u2019s left ear. If Freddy had been a fly, Charlie would\u2019ve swatted him.</p><p>He might still.</p><p>\u201cTwo old women were taken last week by the Duke of Wakefield\u2019s informers,\u201d Freddy was saying. \u201cMakes the others fearful-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any given up their carts?\u201d Charlie asked gently.</p><p>Freddy shrugged, his eyes fixed over Charlie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNot yet. They\u2019ll sell gin as long as it makes \u2019em money, but with the informers about, they \u2019ave to watch their step, move more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s costing us money.\u201d</p><p>Freddy shrugged again.</p><p>Charlie picked up a pair of carved bone dice from the tabletop, idly rolling them between his fingers. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to see to the informers, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Freddy nodded, his gaze glancing away.</p><p>\u201cWhat about our plans for St. Giles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKay has left London.\u201d Freddy straightened a bit as if glad to be the bearer of good news. \u201cAnd I \u2019ad word this morning that Smith was inside \u2019is still when we blew it. \u2019E\u2019s alive, but the burns are bad. They say \u2019e won\u2019t live more \u2019n another day or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Charlie opened his hand to stare at the dice in his palm. \u201cAnd my lord Reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019E\u2019s put all \u2019is business into one building.\u201d Freddy scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s got an outer wall, and \u2019e \u2019as armed guards inside. It\u2019s going to be \u2019ard as \u2019ell to attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet attack it we will.\u201d Charlie let the dice fall from his fingers. An ace and a sice\u2014a six. Seven was always a lucky number. He grunted, pleased. \u201cTonight, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS LORD Griffin?\u201d Phoebe asked as Mandeville helped her from the carriage.</p><p>Hero turned a little to look out on the Thames as she waited for Phoebe. Where is Lord Griffin, indeed?</p><p>She, Mandeville, and Phoebe had traveled together to one of the stairs leading down to the Thames. Harte\u2019s Folly lay south of the river, and they\u2019d need to take boats to arrive there. Lady Margaret, Lord Bollinger, Lady Caroline, and Lord Huff, arriving in a separate carriage, had already descended the stairs and were no doubt entering a boat right now.</p><p>The carriage lanterns cast pools of light that were reflected on the wet cobblestones. It had rained earlier in the day, but the sky was clear now, a few stars already lighting the night. It was unseasonably warm for October\u2014perfect for visiting a pleasure garden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hero tilted her face to look up at the moon flirting with a wispy cloud. \u201cHe said he\u2019d meet us by the steps. I should think he\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother often has business of his own,\u201d Mandeville said neutrally. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be disappointed, Lady Phoebe, if he does not join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phoebe said, looking downcast despite Mandeville\u2019s admonition.</p><p>Hero felt a spurt of anger. How dare Reading disappoint Phoebe? No doubt he was in some woman\u2019s bed even as they stood here waiting for him.</p> <p>\u201cCome, darling,\u201d Hero said briskly. \u201cLet\u2019s walk down to the river. It\u2019ll take a few minutes to ready the boat, and Reading may yet arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sensible plan.\u201d Mandeville smiled in approval. \u201cThe stairs are slippery. Will you take my arm, Lady Hero?\u201d</p><p>He proffered his arm, but she backed up a step, frowning. \u201cPlease take Phoebe. I\u2019ll follow behind.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her quizzically. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>He offered his elbow to Phoebe, and she took it, shooting Hero a smile. Hero breathed a sigh of relief. Mandeville gestured to a footman with a lantern to precede them, and they started down.</p> <p>Hero lifted her skirts to peer at the steps underneath as she began her own descent. The stairs were medieval, narrow, and built against the river wall, completely open on the other side. The wind shifted, blowing the smell of the river at her: rotting fish and wet mud, and beneath that the scent of ancient water flowing endlessly to the sea.</p><p>Both she and Phoebe wore feathered half-masks and colorful gowns. Phoebe was in a delicious orchid and cream while Hero felt rather daring in bright red with ruby underskirts and decorative bows. Mandeville in contrast was in a black domino and half-mask.</p><p>Hoofs clattered on the cobblestones above them. Hero turned to peer over her shoulder, her hand braced against the slimy wall. She wobbled as her heel caught on the edge of the step, her foot twisting and her weight dipping as she lost her balance. Her heart swooped into her belly.</p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Large, masculine hands grasped her arms, pulling her back against a hard chest. \u201cThat\u2019s a long way down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Hero\u2019s pulse still fluttered in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Reading\u2019s voice was deep and somehow intimate in the still night air. He hadn\u2019t loosened his hold on her.</p> <p>Below them, Mandeville and Phoebe had halted on the small platform where the stairs turned.</p><p>Mandeville looked up. \u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>His face was shadowed in the dark, but Hero caught an edge to his voice.</p><p>She pulled and Reading let her arms slide from his grasp. \u201cYes, we\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>Mandeville nodded, turning and continuing down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Hero murmured as she carefully stepped down.</p><p>\u201cWhy must everyone tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you seem to be continually late?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m aware of the time and my tardiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said clearly and distinctly as if speaking to a slow child, \u201cbecause if you knew the time, you wouldn\u2019t be continually late.\u201d</p><p>Behind her Reading exhaled a laugh. \u201cTouch\u00e9, my Lady Perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His breath seemed to stir the small hairs at the nape of her neck. \u201cAre you not perfection itself?\u201d</p><p>She repressed a shiver. \u201cWhether I am or not, I\u2019m certainly not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>They were at the turning in the stairs and she stopped suddenly. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty.\u201d He raised innocent eyebrows at her. \u201cYou and your sister are very pretty tonight.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him and for the life of her didn\u2019t know what to think. His pale green eyes were shadowed behind a black half-mask and domino, and what she could see of his expression was relaxed\u2014but his hand was fisted by his side. Suddenly she was out of breath, the sensation of falling making her sway.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he whispered tenderly.</p><p>Her eyes dropped to his lips, wide and sensuous, framed by the black of the mask covering his upper face, and she wondered wildly what he tasted like.</p><p>\u201cDo hurry, Griffin!\u201d Lady Caro called from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>Hero turned jerkily, glad the dark hid her face from those below. She descended the remainder of the stairs, very conscious all the while of the large male shadowing her.</p><p>\u201cGlad you could join us, Griffin,\u201d Mandeville drawled when they reached the bottom.</p><p>The rest of the party was gathered by the stone dock where two low boats were drawn up. Lady Caroline wore a sapphire dress and half-mask that complemented Lord Huff\u2019s deep blue domino. Lady Margaret wore yellow with pink embroidery and bows. Her escort, Lord Bollinger, a slight young man, was in a black domino.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe, this is Lord Griffin Reading,\u201d Hero said rather breathlessly. \u201cLord Griffin, my sister, Lady Phoebe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to keep you waiting,\u201d Reading said as he bowed gallantly over Phoebe\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Phoebe darted a nervous glance at Hero. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive. You\u2019ve arrived just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let us proceed,\u201d Mandeville said. \u201cHuff, would you like to take my sisters and Lord Bollinger in that boat and we\u2019ll take this one?\u201d</p><p>Lord Huff nodded once. \u201cGood plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear?\u201d Mandeville held out his hand to Hero.</p><p>She took his hand and stepped gingerly into the barge. Lanterns were affixed to tall posts at either end of the boat, and the long benches were covered in soft cushions.</p><p>\u201cComfortable?\u201d Mandeville asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Hero smiled at him. He really was quite solicitous of her welfare.</p><p>\u201cWatch your step,\u201d Reading said as he helped Phoebe inside. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to have to swim the river.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe giggled as she sat next to Hero. \u201cOh, this is wonderful! The river is like a fairy kingdom at night.\u201d</p><p>Hero looked over the water. Lights lit it here and there, coming from boats like theirs, the lanterns reflected in the water. The oars squeaked and splashed as the two wherrymen labored at the stern, and the sound of distant laughter, high and light, floated over the water. Despite the strong river stink, it was rather magical.</p><p>\u201cWill there be fireworks, do you think?\u201d Phoebe asked.</p><p>\u201cGuaranteed,\u201d Reading said.</p><p>He and Mandeville sat across from them. Their black dominos made them nearly look alike in the dim light. But where Mandeville sat upright, his hands braced on his knees, Reading sprawled, legs spread wide apart, arms crossed on his chest.</p><p>Hero hastily looked away from him, though there was no way to ignore him in such a small space. She thought of that breathless moment on the stairs when her eyes had locked with his. Of the fact that only yesterday he\u2019d helped her with the home and discussed Herodotus with her, and the day before that she\u2019d agreed to let him accompany her every time she went into St. Giles. She felt a dangerous unsteadiness as if she were still on the stairs about to fall. A trembling giddiness made up equally of expectation and guilt.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I took tea this afternoon,\u201d she said to Mandeville. \u201cShe showed me the menu she has devised for our wedding breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d He smiled indulgently as Reading glanced away at the water. \u201cI hope it met with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d For some reason, she looked at Reading. As if he felt her gaze, he turned back to watch her. He widened his eyes mockingly at her. Hero inhaled, hoping the night hid her blush. \u201cYes. Yes, she\u2019s planned a lovely celebration of our nuptials.\u201d</p><p>Reading rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mandeville said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that you and Mother have become friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be hard not to.\u201d Hero smiled with genuine warmth. \u201cYour mother is lovely.\u201d</p><p>Reading\u2019s lips curled in amusement at that and he looked away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d Phoebe said. All this time she\u2019d been peering out over the water. \u201cThat\u2019s the dock, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Hero for confirmation.</p><p>Hero was aware that Reading\u2019s attention was caught. He was staring at them curiously.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear,\u201d she said, catching Phoebe\u2019s hand. \u201cThat looks like the dock.\u201d</p><p>But \u201cdock\u201d hardly did the landing area justice. A platform over the river was ablaze with lights, strung on poles. As they neared, Hero could see footmen in fantastic livery helping the rest of their party from their boat. Each footman wore a purple and yellow costume, but each was different: One man was in a striped coat with checkered stockings. Another wore a saffron-colored wig and a purple coat with yellow ribbons. And yet another had a bright yellow coat over a purple spotted waistcoat. They were all whimsical variations on a theme.</p><p>Their boat pulled into the dock, and a fellow in a lavender-powdered wig bent to help her from the boat. \u201cWelcome to Harte\u2019s Folly, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Hero said as the rest of her party disembarked.</p><p>Phoebe came to stand beside her. \u201cDid you see the primrose in his wig?\u201d</p><p>Hero turned and saw that indeed the footman wore a bright flower over his ear.</p><p>\u201cI do hope that\u2019s not a catching fashion,\u201d Reading murmured. He caught Phoebe\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019d look rather foolish with tulips about my ears.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe smothered a giggle with one hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d look a right ass,\u201d was Huff\u2019s pronouncement.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Huff, for your opinion,\u201d Reading said gravely.</p><p>Huff snorted.</p><p>Mandeville cleared his throat. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>He offered his arm to Hero, and she took it as they entered a wooded path. The trees about them were hung with fantastical fairy lights. Hero peered closer and saw that each was a blown glass globe, no bigger than her palm, encasing a light. Music drifted through the decoratively trimmed trees and hedges, growing louder as they advanced. The path suddenly opened, and they emerged from the trees into a wondrous theater.</p><p>A paved area spread out before them as if sprung from the forest floor. Behind that were artfully decaying ruins. If one looked closely, one could just see the orchestra playing between crumbling pillars. On either side, luxurious boxes rose, four levels high, some open, some curtained to give the occupants privacy.</p><p>A pretty maidservant, her hair intertwined with lavender and primrose ribbons, led them behind the boxes and up a carpeted stairs to a high box right on the stage.</p><p>\u201cI say, this is cracking,\u201d Lord Bollinger exclaimed. He was a quiet young man who seemed slightly overawed by Mandeville\u2019s rank.</p><p>Lady Margaret squeezed her escort\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s simply wonderful, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>Mandeville grinned, suddenly looking boyish. \u201cGlad you\u2019re pleased, Meg.\u201d</p><p>Hero smiled up at him as he held a chair for her. \u201cThank you for arranging this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d He bowed, but as he rose, his eyes went over Hero\u2019s shoulder and he seemed to stiffen.</p><p>The curtains parted at the back of their box, and a troop of servants entered with supper. Mandeville settled into the chair next to Hero as thinly sliced ham, wine, cheese, and prettily iced cakes were laid before them.</p><p>\u201cA toast,\u201d Huff mumbled, raising his glass. \u201cTo the beautiful ladies present tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Huff,\u201d Lady Caroline said, but she was blushing as she drank.</p><p>Hero smiled and sipped her own wine, but she couldn\u2019t help glancing over her shoulder as the others bantered. In the box opposite sat a lady with striking deep-wine-red hair. Three young and handsome gentlemen surrounded her, but the woman\u2019s eyes were fixed on their box. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hero followed her gaze. Mrs. Tate was watching Mandeville.</p><p>GRIFFIN\u2019S EYES NARROWED as he saw Lady Hero note the redheaded woman across the way. What the hell was Thomas up to? Had he arranged an assignation with a mistress with his fianc\u00e9e present?</p><p>Lady Hero casually turned back to the table, her gaze sliding by his. She made no sign, but somehow he could tell: She was upset.</p><p>Damn Thomas!</p> <p>Thankfully the entertainment began at that moment with a troop of brightly clad girls dancing onto the stage.</p><p>Griffin watched broodingly, fondling the diamond earring in his waistcoat pocket. What matter to him if Thomas wasn\u2019t quite as perfect as Lady Hero thought him? Their arrangement was surely no business of his. Why, then, did he feel an urgent need to drag his brother into a private corner and with a few choice words\u2014and perhaps a fist or two\u2014show him the error of his ways?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so graceful,\u201d Lady Phoebe said. She sat beside him, across the dinner table from Thomas and Lady Hero.</p><p>\u201cThey are indeed.\u201d Griffin smiled at her.</p><p>Lady Phoebe was so different from her sister she might have been a changeling. Where Lady Hero was tall for a woman and elegantly slender, Lady Phoebe was of only average height with a buxom figure, softly rounded shoulders, and plump arms. Lady Hero carefully guarded her expression and movements like a miser with a handful of gold coins. Lady Phoebe, in contrast, let every emotion play across her face, her expressive lips parting in wonder or curving wide in surprised amusement at the antics of a clown on the stage.</p> <p>\u201cBut where did he go?\u201d she murmured to herself. \u201cThe little monkey?\u201d</p><p>Griffin glanced at the stage. The clown had been playing with a monkey, but the animal sat now at his ankles, waiting with trained stillness.</p><p>He looked back to Lady Phoebe. She was leaning forward, squinting. Suddenly she laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>Griffin looked at the stage. The clown was making the monkey perform backflips through a hoop. Griffin lifted his wine to his lips, frowning thoughtfully.</p><p>The dancers and the clown were followed by a play, Love for Love, which was admirably acted, though Griffin hardly noticed. He was too busy watching Lady Hero from out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>As the actors were bowing, Thomas stood. \u201cShall we stroll the gardens?\u201d</p> <p>The suggestion was obvious, and Thomas never glanced at the box opposite. Still, Griffin was unsurprised when the red-haired lady stood as well. Grimly, he offered his arm to Lady Phoebe.</p><p>The pleasure gardens were cunningly laid out. Tall hedges trimmed into fantastic beasts lined the walkways, obscuring narrower paths leading off it, as well as nooks and grottos tailor-made for sophisticated amusements. As he guided Lady Phoebe, Griffin wondered cynically how many of the other ladies they passed were there professionally.</p><p>\u201cOh, look!\u201d Lady Phoebe tugged at his arm as one of the many set pieces came into sight. \u201cHow is it done?\u201d</p><p>Before them was a pretty outcropping of rock, decorated with a falls. But the falls in this case was of multicolored lights.</p><p>\u201cHow clever,\u201d Megs murmured. \u201cI can\u2019t tell how it\u2019s devised. Perhaps one of the gentlemen can educate us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t a clue,\u201d Bollinger admitted immediately with honest good humor.</p><p>Megs laughed. \u201cHuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be mechanical,\u201d Huff said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, of course it\u2019s mechanical,\u201d Caro said. \u201cBut how does it work?\u201d</p><p>Thomas frowned. \u201cA pulley system of some sort, I\u2019d wager.\u201d</p><p>For a moment they all gazed, transfixed, at the moving lights as they seemed to flow over the barren rock.</p><p>Griffin stirred. \u201cI think we\u2019re overlooking the most obvious explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is, my lord?\u201d Lady Hero raised her left eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cFairies,\u201d he replied gravely.</p><p>\u201cOh, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d grumped Caro, and immediately dragged her husband off, despite Huff\u2019s protests.</p><p>\u201cFairies,\u201d Lady Hero repeated. Her lips definitely twitched.</p><p>\u201cFairies.\u201d Griffin stuck his free hand between the buttons of his waistcoat and struck a learned pose, head tilted back, brow furrowed solemnly, foot thrust forward. \u201cIn my opinion\u2014which, by the way, is considered an authority on rainbow light falls\u2014each individual light in this falls is in actuality a fairy running quickly over the rocks.\u201d</p><p>Megs was grinning, Lady Phoebe was giggling, but Lady Hero nodded as if his nonsense was perfectly possible. \u201cBut if they are fairies as you say, why exactly should they run down instead of up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dearest lady,\u201d Griffin replied with sad pity. \u201cDo you not know that falls only run down and not up?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth had widened, her delicate, pale pink lips trembling with laughter, and his heart suddenly sang. Just like that. With no preliminaries or warning, without reason or goal, he was happy. And looking into her clear gray eyes, he had an idea she was happy as well. How odd that such a thing, such a moment, should compound and redouble until the very fact that she was glad made him the most joyful man in the world.</p><p>For just a moment in time.</p><p>Then Thomas, who if anything should\u2019ve been suspicious of their banter, said rather absentmindedly, \u201cShall we try this path, my dear?\u201d</p><p>And he pulled her away.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Lady Phoebe urged, and they and Megs and Bollinger chose another path.</p><p>Griffin strolled along, listening with only one ear to their banter and exclamations. He must\u2019ve interjected enough comments to maintain a normal front, for no one stared at him oddly or pulled him aside to ask just what the devil he thought he was doing flirting with his soon-to-be sister-in-law.</p><p>But he knew. Oh, yes, he knew\u2014he was in over his head and sinking fast. He might be irritated by Lady Hero\u2019s calm acceptance of her own perfection, of her condemnation of him without even a trial, even of her fondness for Thomas, but that didn\u2019t change his own body\u2019s inclinations. He was attracted to the lady\u2014and what was worse, the lady was attracted to him. This was exactly what he had vowed to never let happen. He couldn\u2019t let it go further. He must make a firm pledge to stay away from the lady.</p><p>Yet, here, tonight, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from peering down alleys and grottos, searching for a glimpse of scarlet and ruby skirts, a gingery head, the elegant turn of a neck. Where had Thomas taken her?</p><p>Damnation! Were they embracing even now?</p><p>They\u2019d almost made a complete circumference of the gardens when the first pop! exploded overhead.</p><p>\u201cThe fireworks!\u201d Lady Phoebe pointed.</p><p>A glowing red star shot into the night and burst above them, sending green and blue sparks showering down. Their group had stopped in a small clearing, and a crowd of the other guests began gathering about them. Caro and Huff soon joined them. Griffin glanced around but could see neither Lady Hero nor Thomas.</p><p>\u201cI say, is that a turtle?\u201d Huff asked beside him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d came Caro\u2019s exasperated tones. \u201cIt\u2019s a spider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like a turtle to me,\u201d Huff said, unperturbed by his mate\u2019s correction.</p><p>A flash of scarlet caught Griffin\u2019s eye. He turned and saw Lady Hero disappear down a path. Good God, was she alone? Surely she knew better than to wander a dark path at night by herself?</p><p>He excused himself from the small group, making sure Lady Phoebe was with Megs and Caro and their escorts, then strode rapidly to where he\u2019d seen Lady Hero. The popping and cracking continued overhead, and suddenly the path ahead of him was lit in bright orange. There at the far end stood Lady Hero looking around.</p><p>She turned as he advanced on her. \u201cThomas?\u201d</p><p>He took her arm, too ridiculously angry to correct her. Where the hell was his brother? He pulled, but she dug in her heels, just as blue and yellow lights burst overhead.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hurry, my lord?\u201d She tilted her face up to his, her eyes mocking behind the feathered half-mask she wore. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this romantic?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the explosions were in his head. Griffin stared into those innocently seductive eyes and realized very simply that he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.</p><p>He kissed her.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>What a spectacle there was when the three dignitaries arrived in the kingdom! Prince Westmoon came in a carriage made of gold and diamonds and drawn by twelve snow-white horses. Prince Eastsun rode in a palanquin encrusted with rubies and emeralds and hung draperies made of silk. And Prince Northwind arrived in a great gilded ship with sails of crimson and gold. All three men were haughty, commanding, and handsome beyond belief. But only the little brown bird and the stable master knew that the queen retired to her bed that night with a heavy heart....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>It was stupid and irrational, but Thomas found he couldn\u2019t stop himself from searching out Lavinia Tate. Not even the difficulty of finding her in the near dark in a maze of paths and side-paths deterred him. Three men? Had she become a sybarite? A woman controlled entirely by her physical desires? Thoughts such as these did not improve his mood, so when he did eventually run Lavinia\u2014and her three beaus\u2014to ground, his temper was perilously on edge.</p><p>\u201cDismiss them,\u201d he barked at her. He eyed the men. Two were barely old enough to shave, but the third was a big fellow with broad shoulders.</p><p>Thomas flexed his hands. In his current mood, he was of a mind to take on all three.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Lavinia drawled. She was wearing another flame-colored dress that should\u2019ve clashed horribly with her outlandishly red hair, but somehow didn\u2019t. In fact, the amount of creamy bosom the d\u00e9colletage displayed was enough to make a man drool.</p><p>Thomas scowled. \u201cTell them to leave, Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow at the use of her given name, and for a moment Thomas thought he really would have to choose between retreat and fisticuffs. Then she whispered something to the big fellow, and with a last nasty look, all three turned heel and left.</p><p>\u201cNow, then.\u201d She folded her arms across her chest as if bracing herself for an unpleasant confrontation with a bill collector. \u201cWhat is it, Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree, Lavinia?\u201d His hands clenched by his sides. \u201cAnd all merely boys.\u201d</p><p>She threw back her head and laughed. \u201cAs it happens, my lord, two of those boys are my nephews. And I doubt Samuel would like you calling him a boy.\u201d</p><p>So the big man was her lover. Thomas wanted to drive his fist into something. \u201cHe\u2019s younger than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs are you,\u201d she replied softly. \u201cYet it didn\u2019t keep you from my bed.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he merely stared at her hungrily, remembering her bed and what they\u2019d done there.</p><p>Then she looked away. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d He advanced toward her, confused by his own need to be near her. \u201cYou\u2019re the one following me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowing you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what reaction he\u2019d expected from his accusation\u2014perhaps protestations or even tears\u2014but it wasn\u2019t this. This looked perilously close to pity, her eyebrows drawing together, her lush mouth turning down.</p><p>\u201cThomas, I am not following you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain, then, how you happened to be here on the very night I attend with my fianc\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged\u2014actually shrugged!\u2014at his angry words. \u201cCoincidence, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your Samuel?\u201d He was close enough to touch her now, but he daren\u2019t. \u201cDeny, if you will, that you brought him here in a pathetic effort to make me jealous.\u201d</p><p>He sneered his words, but she looked at him wonderingly. \u201cAre you jealous, Thomas? I can\u2019t think why, since you\u2019re the one who broke it off when you decided to marry Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her too-perceptive face. \u201cI never said we had to quit, only that we wait a decent amount of time after the wedding. A year at most. I could\u2019ve bought you a bigger house if you wanted it. A carriage and team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe money never had anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cHowever provincial it might seem to you, I don\u2019t wish to carry on a liaison with a married man. It\u2019s rather sordid, don\u2019t you think? Besides, I\u2019ve seen your Lady Hero and she seems a nice girl. I shouldn\u2019t like to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>He grit his teeth, feeling the beginnings of a headache. \u201cAre you saying you care more for my fianc\u00e9e than me?\u201d</p> <p>She stared back, that wretched look of pity in her eyes again. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI cannot marry you\u2014you know that, Lavinia. Even if we were a suitable match, even if you weren\u2019t past the age of childbearing, I simply cannot marry one such as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow chivalrous of you to point out my advanced age to me\u2014yet again,\u201d she drawled. \u201cBut as it happens, there is no need for such drama. I know we cannot marry, and I refuse to conduct a liaison with you when you are otherwise promised. There really isn\u2019t anything more to say.\u201d</p><p>He felt something very close to desperation. \u201cI thought you cared for me.\u201d</p><p>Overhead the fireworks began exploding.</p> <p>\u201cI did. I do.\u201d She sighed and let her head fall back, watching the fiery trails. \u201cBut my feelings for you really have nothing to do with this discussion. Anne broke your trust long before I came along. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d trust any woman again, let alone one with a past like mine. You\u2019ve made that abundantly plain. Really, it\u2019s a wonder you were able to propose to even a virgin like Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>An awful, oily blackness invaded his chest at her words, because she was right, damn her. He\u2019d never bring himself to truly trust her.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019ve already stated, the thing is impossible.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019ll be waiting for me\u2014we\u2019d decided on ices while the fireworks played.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her mutely, unable to find the words that would make this right. The words that would make her stay.</p><p>She smiled rather wearily. \u201cGood-bye, Thomas. I hope you have a happy marriage.\u201d</p><p>And he could do nothing but watch her walk away from him.</p> <p>* *</p><p>HERO HAD WANTED to know how Reading tasted and now she knew: He was wine and man and need.</p><p>Pure, hot need, coursing through her blood like quicksilver, lighting her bones on fire, making her muscles quake until she literally trembled in his arms. He didn\u2019t kiss her like she was the daughter of a duke, reverent and slow. No, he kissed her like a woman. His lips were hard, demanding things from her, not waiting to see if she had the experience to keep up. His tongue pushed against her lips, insisting on entrance. She opened her mouth eagerly. He swarmed in without hesitation, taking as if she was his by right.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d she murmured, her hands clutching at his black domino, unsure of what to do. He pulled her close\u2014so close she felt the muscles of his legs through her skirts. His fingers were in her hair, skimming over her throat, brushing lightly at the tops of her breasts.</p><p>She should push him away. What she wanted instead was to take his hand and press those long fingers into her bodice. To guide him until he stroked the puckered tips of her naked breasts. She thought she might very well expire from sheer ecstasy if he touched her there.</p><p>A loud bang! made her start and break the kiss. The night sky lit for a moment, as bright as day, illuminating his masked face and his mouth, wet and tempting. He pulled back from her, still holding her shoulders and stared at her as if transfixed. Lord knew what her own expression looked like.</p><p>Behind them the cheers of the spectators rose.</p><p>Hero tried to speak and found she had to swallow before her mouth could form the words. \u201cWe need to get back.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t reply, merely caught her hand and turned, striding back up the path. She stumbled behind him, her limbs uncoordinated, her thoughts dazed. Another starburst exploded overhead, green, purple, and red flakes floating to earth. The path was widening; they were nearly to the clearing where the spectators stood.</p><p>Reading pulled her suddenly into a dark nook off the side of the path. He turned to face her and yanked her into his arms. Her entire being thrilled as he breathed a foul curse and then captured her mouth again. He devoured her as if she were a sweetmeat and he a man who had gone without bread for far too long. He licked across her lips, biting at the corner of her mouth, groaning somewhere deep in his chest. She opened her mouth eagerly this time, having learned what he\u2014what she\u2014wanted.</p><p>Another cheer went up.</p><p>He tore his head away from hers, muttering, \u201cYou taste like ambrosia, and I am a madman.\u201d</p><p>For a moment they simply stared at each other, and she had the strange feeling he was as confused as she.</p><p>He blinked, cursed, and, taking her hand again, led her into the clearing.</p><p>The gathered crowd all had their faces tilted upward, watching the display overhead. Hero followed Reading without thought, feeling quite shattered as they wound in and out of the bodies until they found their own party.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Phoebe exclaimed as Hero made her side. She clapped and squealed as spinning wheels appeared over their heads. She leaned closer to Hero and shouted, \u201cBut what has happened to Lord Mandeville?\u201d</p><p>Hero shook her head, her brain stuttering to life. She shouted back, \u201cHe went for refreshments and I lost him.\u201d</p><p>She heard Reading grunt. His lips were grim and she hastily looked away.</p><p>\u201cOh, look!\u201d Phoebe cried.</p><p>Bombs burst and turned, sparkling, into a green-and-gold-winged serpent. The fiery creature twisted and then melted into a glowing white shower of sparks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Lady Margaret breathed.</p><p>It was. It was the most fantastic fireworks display she\u2019d ever seen\u2014and yet she felt curiously unaffected. Hero was conscious only of Reading\u2019s bulk, on the far side of Phoebe. There seemed to be an invisible line between them now, an awareness drawn taut by sensuality and basic sin.</p><p>Dear Lord, what had she done?</p><p>She touched her mouth with shaking fingers. She\u2019d committed an act of horrible betrayal. She knew that. She was aware of the ramifications and of regret. The possibility of far greater sin and guilt. Of the fact that her very soul was in peril.</p><p>And she did not care.</p><p>She was in a fever, wanting only to taste his mouth again, to feel his hard body against hers. To find out if his bare skin was as hot without any clothes. To discover his naked chest. To lie with him entirely nude.</p><p>She gasped, winded, unable to catch her breath. She\u2019d never thought herself a creature of physical want. Had never experienced this longing before with any other man. It was as if she were the dormant black powder and he a flame that set her alight. Suddenly everything was vivid, clear, and burning. The very night sky rejoiced as if to celebrate her awakening.</p><p>Her facade had cracked. She realized with shock that she was as mortal as anyone else, as fallible as the most fallen woman.</p><p>And it did not matter. If he but crooked a finger, she would turn and follow him back into those dim paths. Would twine herself about him and lift her face for his kiss again.</p><p>Hero shivered and wrapped her arms about herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d His voice was deep and much too near.</p><p>She shook her head, a bit too violently, and backed a step away from him, putting prudent space between them. He frowned and opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAh, here you are,\u201d came Mandeville\u2019s voice from her other side.</p><p>She turned and smiled up at him, in near-panicked relief. Mandeville was normalcy. Mandeville was sanity.</p><p>Some of what she was feeling must have shone in her eyes.</p><p>Mandeville bent closer so she could hear over the cracks and pops. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have lost you. I hope it caused you no worry?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, still smiling like a fool, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Reading growled close, and at first she thought he accused her. Then she looked up and saw the murderous expression he shot at Mandeville. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for a lady alone here.\u201d</p><p>Mandeville\u2019s head reared back. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d</p><p>Reading made a grimace of disgust, turned on his heel, and strode to the edge of the clearing.</p><p>Mandeville looked uncertainly at Hero. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...\u201d</p><p>Dear God, she could not take an apology from him now. Hero laid a hand on his sleeve. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t worry yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I should,\u201d Mandeville said slowly. \u201cMy brother is right: I should never have lost you in the maze of paths. It was not well done of me. Please forgive me, Hero.\u201d</p><p>He hardly ever used her given name without her title. Hero felt sudden tears spring to her eyes. This man was so good, so right, and she was a fool to let bright, sparkling physical lust endanger her happiness with him.</p><p>She squeezed the arm under her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s done now and no true harm came of it. Please. Let\u2019s talk of it no more.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to search her face for a moment, even as purple and red lights showered above.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt seems I am to marry a very wise lady indeed.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled as she gazed up at him, knowing she did not deserve his praise. This was the man she\u2019d chosen to marry. The decision was made, the contracts drawn up and signed. This would be a good marriage, one of respect and common goals attained between the two of them.</p><p>And yet she could not help but turn her head slightly and glance at Reading. He stood apart, his face upturned to the sky as sparkling flames reflected in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGET UP, M\u2019LORD, she\u2019s doin\u2019 a runner.\u201d</p><p>Griffin groaned, rolling from his stomach to his back and flinging a shielding arm over his eyes. \u201cGo \u2019way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that, m\u2019lord,\u201d the cheerful voice of Deedle, his valet-cum-secretary-cum-jack-of-all-trades, replied. \u201cYou told me to wake you if she went out, an\u2019 keep at it no matter \u2019ow you might complain until you stood up by yerself, and \u2019ere I am awaking you.\u201d</p><p>Griffin sighed and cracked an eyelid. The sight that met his gaze was not a pretty one. Deedle was only a bit past five and twenty by his own reckoning, but he\u2019d lost both upper front teeth in that time. It didn\u2019t seem to bother him, though, judging by the wide smile that split his face. He wore a wig\u2014one that Griffin had cast off\u2014badly in need of curling and powdering. His muddy brown eyes were tiny and spaced too near, peering down a great angular nose that took up so much of his face that his small mouth and smaller chin seemed to have given up completely and retreated down his neck in defeat.</p><p>Deedle grinned at Griffin\u2019s open eye and stuck his tongue through the gap in his teeth\u2014a rather unfortunate habit of his. \u201cLike some coffee, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d Griffin squinted at the window. True the sun seemed to be high in the sky, but they\u2019d been out until well past midnight last night. He remembered that sweet kiss he\u2019d shared with Lady Hero\u2014and how she wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye afterward. He winced. \u201cAre you sure she\u2019s moving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lad I got on watch came running to tell me not ten minutes ago,\u201d Deedle replied. \u201cThe lady must like the mornings, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not keeping her promises.\u201d He sat up, the sheets falling away from his nude chest, and scratched his chin as he contemplated the fair Lady Hero. She was attempting to avoid him. Had his kiss frightened her that much? \u201cYou\u2019re certain she\u2019s headed to St. Giles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got that big footman and she\u2019s taking the carriage. Bit early for morning social calls.\u201d Deedle squinted and shrugged. \u201cStands to reason that\u2019s where she\u2019s headed, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Griffin sighed. Yes, it did stand to reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He climbed wearily from the bed and began splashing in the basin of water. \u201cHave we heard from Nick Barnes?\u201d</p><p>Deedle laid out the razor, strop, and towels. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Griffin frowned. Nick usually sent word first thing in the morning. Griffin would have to see if Nick was sleeping in\u2014or if something more ominous had happened. But first he must deal with the lovely Lady Hero\u2014and the consequences of last night\u2019s impulse.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Griffin ran down the steps of his rented town house. It wasn\u2019t in the most fashionable part of the West End of London, but he\u2019d long ago decided that lodgings separate from Thomas were essential for familial accord.</p> <p>Rambler was waiting at the bottom of the steps, his head held by a young groom. Griffin patted the gelding\u2019s glossy neck before swinging into the saddle and throwing the boy a shilling.</p><p>The day was sunny, and Rambler made good time, weaving through the London traffic. Griffin found Lady Hero\u2019s carriage not twenty minutes later, stalled behind a herd of pigs.</p><p>Lady Hero\u2019s coachman merely nodded as Griffin waved at him and entered the carriage.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said as he sat.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>He clapped a hand over his heart. \u201cSuch cruelty from such a fair lady.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t even look at him. She stared fixedly out the window, her profile remote and reserved. Only the faint spots of pink on her cheekbones gave lie to her serenity. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d He stretched his legs and crossed them at the ankle, grappling with a wholly foreign surge of guilt. Outside, a chorus of squealing rose alarmingly. \u201cI should be abed, still dreaming, but it\u2019s not my fault you decided to rise early and sneak off to St. Giles without me.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips irritably. \u201cThis isn\u2019t wise.\u201d</p><p>He noted that she didn\u2019t deny her destination. \u201cHave you told your brother or Thomas about your jaunts to St. Giles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as if pained. \u201cYou know we can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Had he hurt her so much? He cleared his throat, feeling uncharacteristically diffident. \u201cAbout last night...\u201d</p><p>She held up her palm, her face averted. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, but she was as still as a graven image. She seemed to have retreated somewhere deep inside herself.</p><p>Damnation! His mouth snapped shut. He turned to look out the window as the carriage began rolling forward. He\u2019d well and truly mucked this up. If he had it to do over, he\u2019d... what? He sure as hell wouldn\u2019t take back that kiss.</p><p>Griffin sighed and laid his head against the squabs. That kiss had been quite spectacular. He remembered her mouth soft and yielding, her breasts pressed against his chest, and the hard beat of his own heart. He\u2019d been aroused, naturally, but oddly the part that stuck in his mind wasn\u2019t the eroticism of their embrace, but the sweetness. It had felt... right\u2014as wrong as that was.</p><p>And as truly foolish as it was to have kissed his brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, he\u2019d do it all over again if Lady Hero gave even the slightest sign of acquiescence.</p> <p>Griffin cracked an eyelid and snorted under his breath. The lady was showing no such signs this morning. She sat ramrod straight in her seat\u2014surely an uncomfortable pose as the carriage swayed\u2014and her face was still averted. She gave every indication of loathing him.</p><p>Well, that was for the best, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Griffin sighed. \u201cWhy have you decided to go back to St. Giles so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Templeton has agreed to meet me at the site of the new home,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised his brows, waiting for more explanation, but it wasn\u2019t forthcoming. Fine, two could play at that game. He tilted his hat over his eyes and settled back to regain some of the sleep he\u2019d lost this morning.</p><p>The carriage shuddering to a stop woke Griffin some time later. He watched lazily as Lady Hero got up and left the carriage without a word to him. His lips twitched. That certainly put him in his place. He could stay in the carriage and await her return, but curiosity got the better of him. Griffin followed her out of the carriage, looking around.</p><p>They were in St. Giles, not far from his still, actually. The carriage was stopped at the end of a narrow lane, too wide to pass through. Griffin saw Lady Hero walking determinedly down the lane with her footman, George. Griffin jogged to catch up. By the time he made her side, she was already in conversation with Jonathan. The architect was all in black, a huge roll of papers under one arm. He turned to greet Griffin, but Lady Hero continued talking.</p><p>\u201c... as you can see. Now we\u2019re worried that the children will have to stay in their wretched temporary home for the winter. Can you give us any hope, Mr. Templeton?\u201d</p><p>She drew breath and Griffin took advantage of the pause by sticking his hand out to his friend. \u201cGood morning, Jonathan. How are you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite well, my lord, quite well indeed,\u201d the architect replied, beaming. He glanced at Lady Hero and blinked at her gimlet stare. \u201cEr... now, then, as to the progress of the foundling home, my lady. As you can see, the former architect barely laid the foundations. I\u2019ve had a chance to inspect the site, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve discovered several distressing points.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero frowned. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Jonathan nodded, pushing his spectacles up onto his forehead. \u201cMost of the foundation is sound, but in places it has already settled and will need to be dug up, shored, and rebuilt. Further, the papers you sent me indicated that special stone, wood, et cetera were bought and stored here. I\u2019m afraid I cannot find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStolen?\u201d Griffin asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord, or perhaps never truly bought in the first place.\u201d Jonathan looked troubled. \u201cIn any case, the materials will have to be purchased before further construction is done.\u201d</p><p>Griffin glanced at Lady Hero and saw that she was biting her lip. \u201cI... I will have to see about obtaining the monies necessary to purchase material. Last time it took weeks for the stone to be shipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Mr. Templeton rocked back on his heels. \u201cHere I think I have good news, then. I know of a supplier of fine granite who has some already sitting in his warehouse here in London. I have no doubt that he has enough to meet our needs. It isn\u2019t the Italian marble that the original plans called for, but the granite stone is pretty enough. Cheaper, too. I believe I can persuade him to extend you the credit on the stone.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero seemed to relax. \u201cWonderful, Mr. Templeton! I shall rely upon you to arrange for the granite to be bought and moved here. Now, perhaps you can show me the problems you spoke of.\u201d</p><p>Griffin sat on the stone foundation of Lady Hero\u2019s home and waited for her to complete her tour with Jonathan. He tilted his head back, feeling the sun on his face. He\u2019d have to take her home after this and then return again to St. Giles to consult with Nick about what to do with the Vicar. Griffin rubbed the back of his neck wearily. He couldn\u2019t remain indefinitely in London guarding the still. Perhaps the Vicar could be bought off somehow. Except that Griffin balked at giving the man money. The only other means of eliminating the crime lord was assassination.</p><p>Griffin chuckled in disgust. He hadn\u2019t sunk quite that low yet.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d</p><p>He glanced up to see a footman trotting toward him.</p><p>Griffin straightened. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lad at the carriage asking after you. Said to tell you that Nick sent him.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero had returned with Jonathan by this time. She looked at Griffin for the first time that day. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matter of business.\u201d He glanced at Jonathan. \u201cAre you done here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d He took her arm and walked rapidly toward the carriage. He hated to take her along, but he couldn\u2019t very well let her wander alone in St. Giles. \u201cDamnation.\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrow at him but kept pace with his stride. The youth waiting beside the carriage was one of Nick\u2019s crew. He doffed his hat at the sight of Lady Hero, his eyes widening. He\u2019d probably never seen an aristocratic lady in his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Griffin demanded.</p><p>The lad jumped, tearing his gaze from Lady Hero. \u201cNick wants to talk to you, m\u2019lord. Quick like, if\u2019n you can.\u201d</p><p>Griffin nodded. \u201cHop on the back of the carriage.\u201d</p><p>He gave the coachman directions and then helped Lady Hero in before pounding on the roof.</p><p>She watched him as he threw himself on the squabs. \u201cHow did your messenger find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent word where I\u2019d be,\u201d he said absently.</p><p>Thankfully she didn\u2019t ask any more questions. The carriage was already pulling up in front of the distillery\u2019s wall.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he ordered her before leaping from the carriage.</p><p>Griffin strode through the gate. Nick was in the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d Nick jerked his head toward the distillery, leading the way.</p><p>Inside, the fires illuminated the cavernous building like something out of Hades. A small knot of his men was gathered over something that lay on the warehouse floor. As Griffin drew nearer, he saw it was a man.</p><p>Or what was left of a man.</p><p>The body was tangled, the limbs at angles the joints weren\u2019t meant to bear naturally. Griffin took one look at the face and glanced away.</p><p>\u201cTommy Reese,\u201d Nick said, and spat into the straw. \u201cWent out for a tankard of beer yesterday afternoon and was thrown over the wall just \u2019alf an hour ago, lookin\u2019 like that.\u201d</p><p>Griffin fisted his hands. He remembered Tommy; he couldn\u2019t have been more than twenty. \u201cDid he say anything?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cAlready dead.\u201d He glanced sharply at the silent men and gestured Griffin to the side. \u201cTortured, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Griffin grimaced. \u201cWas Reese party to any particular secret of our business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, just started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the Vicar did this as a warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to scare the men.\u201d Nick lowered his voice. \u201cAlready two \u2019ave run off. Couldn\u2019t stop them, though I told the buggers right enough they\u2019d be safer in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Griffin rolled his head on his shoulders to stretch his neck, then swiveled to the men. \u201cWell, this is first shot. From now on, no one goes out at night, and during the day you go in pairs. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>The men nodded, though none would meet his eyes.</p><p>Griffin smiled widely, though he felt more like howling. \u201cAnd your pay has just doubled, right? Any man still here by tomorrow gets a fistful of coins. You go out tonight and you\u2019ll get that instead.\u201d He jerked his chin at the corpse.</p><p>One by one, he stared at each man until they all met his eyes and nodded.</p><p>Finally, Griffin jerked his chin. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>The men went back to work. No one smiled or looked particularly cheerful, but at least they weren\u2019t whispering mutiny among themselves anymore. Nick pulled two of the men aside and gave them instructions in low tones. A moment more and the two men had lifted Reese\u2019s poor body between them and taken it out to the courtyard. Griffin turned back to watch broodingly as the stills were stoked.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d came a feminine voice behind Griffin.</p><p>He turned and met Lady Hero\u2019s accusing eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re running a gin still!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Early the next morning, the queen greeted her suitors in her throne room. She wore a gown of silver and gold, her midnight-black hair was coiled and twisted beneath a golden crown, and every man in that room was amazed by her beauty and bearing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The queen looked at her suitors and asked them this question: \u201cWhat is the foundation of my kingdom? You have until midnight tonight to bring me your answer.\u201d</p><p>Well, Prince Eastsun looked at Prince Westmoon, and Prince Westmoon looked at Prince Northwind, and then all three princes hurried from the room.</p><p>But when the stable master heard the question, he merely smiled to himself....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p> <p>Hero couldn\u2019t believe it, but the evidence was right before her eyes\u2014and nose. The great warehouse held huge copper barrels set over smoldering fires, and the air smelled of alcohol and juniper berries. This was a gin distillery\u2014most probably an illegal one.</p><p>And Reading wasn\u2019t at all perturbed to be found out.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on? Was that a dead man I saw in the courtyard?\u201d She looked at him, waiting for an explanation, but he turned his back on her.</p><p>Actually, it was the large, burly man by his side who seemed the most embarrassed. \u201cM\u2019lord, the lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady can wait,\u201d Reading said quite clearly.</p> <p>Hero felt her face heat. Never had she been so cavalierly dismissed. And to think she\u2019d let this cad kiss her just last night!</p><p>She swiveled to leave the awful building, but suddenly he was there beside her, his hard hands holding her arms.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she hissed through gritted teeth.</p><p>His face held absolutely no compassion. \u201cI have business here. When I am done, I\u2019ll escort you home\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wrenched her arms free and turned.</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he said quietly, then louder to someone else, \u201cSee that her carriage doesn\u2019t leave without me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cM\u2019lord.\u201d Two men darted past her and out the door, no doubt to help keep her prisoner while Reading did his disreputable \u201cbusiness.\u201d She continued sedately to her carriage\u2014she\u2019d not let him see her in a hysterical flurry. Once outside the wall and at her carriage, she ignored Reading\u2019s guards and climbed in.</p><p>Her wait was short, but even so, she was not in the best of spirits when the carriage rocked and Reading climbed inside. He knocked on the roof and then sat down, gazing out the window. They rolled along for a few minutes until Hero couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me what that was about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to,\u201d he drawled\u2014expressly, she was sure, to enrage her.</p><p>\u201cThat was a distillery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor gin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes at him, feeling anger pounding in her breast. She was perilously close to losing her facade\u2014again. Hero fought to control her voice, but even so the words seemed to scrape against her throat. \u201cDo you have any idea the amount and depth of misery that gin brings to the people who live here in St. Giles?\u201d</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>She leaned forward and slapped him on the knee. \u201cDo you? Is this some kind of lark for you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and turned toward her finally, and she was shocked to see the exhaustion lining his face. \u201cNo, not a lark.\u201d</p><p>Tears bit at the corner of her eyes, and she found to her horror that her voice trembled. \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen the babies starving while their mothers drink gin? Haven\u2019t you stumbled over the bodies of broken men, mere skeletons from drink? My God, haven\u2019t you wept at the corruption that drink brings?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d She bit her lip, struggled to control her emotions, to control herself. Reading wasn\u2019t stupid. There must be some reason for his madness. \u201cExplain it to me. Why? Why would you dabble in such a filthy trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat \u2018filthy trade\u2019 saved the Mandeville fortunes, my Lady Perfect.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve never heard that the Mandeville fortune needed saving.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted wryly. \u201cThank you. That means I did my job well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my father died some ten years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She remembered the conversation she\u2019d had with Cousin Bathilda on her engagement night. \u201cYou immediately left Cambridge to go carouse about the town.\u201d</p><p>His smile was genuine this time. \u201cYes, well, that tale was more palatable than the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur pockets were to let. Yes\u201d\u2014he nodded at her incredulous expression\u2014\u201cmy father had managed to lose the family fortune with a series of investments that were ill advised at best. I had no idea of the family\u2019s finances. As I was the second son, Father and Thomas considered it none of my business. So when Mater told me at the funeral the straits we were in, you could\u2019ve knocked me down with a feather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you left school to manage the family\u2019s finances?\u201d Hero asked skeptically.</p><p>He spread his hands and inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cBut why you? Wasn\u2019t it Thomas\u2019s job to find a financial manager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u201d\u2014he ticked off his point on a long finger\u2014\u201cwe couldn\u2019t afford a financial manager, and two, Thomas\u2019s head for money is about the same as our dear, late father\u2019s. He spent the last of what we had in the week after Father died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd money is the one thing you\u2019re good at,\u201d Hero said slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s what you told me when you offered me a loan. When it comes to financial dealings, you can be relied on.\u201d Did he think that was the only thing he could be relied upon to do correctly?</p><p>Griffin nodded. \u201cThank God my mother caught wind of what Thomas was doing. She had a small inheritance of her own that she\u2019d kept hidden from Father. We lived for the first year or so on that bit of pin money until my distillery started bringing in money.\u201d</p><p>That reminder snapped her attention back to her original concern. \u201cBut... gin distilling? Why that of all things?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou have to understand. I came home from university to my mother near prostrate with grief and worry, half the family furnishings sold to pay my father\u2019s debts, bill collectors calling at all hours, and Thomas nattering on about how fine a new carriage with gilt trim would be. It was autumn and all I had was a rotten harvest of grain, mostly spoiled with damp. I could\u2019ve sold it to a broker who would\u2019ve then sold it again to a gin distiller, but I thought, wait a minute, why lose most of the profit? I bought a secondhand still and paid the old rascal I\u2019d bought it from extra to show me how to use it.\u201d</p><p>He sat back on the carriage seat and shrugged. \u201cTwo years later, we were able to afford Caro\u2019s season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mandeville?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cDoes he know what you do to support your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever fear,\u201d he said with deep and devastating cynicism. \u201cYour fianc\u00e9\u2019s hands are clean of all this. Thomas worries about far nobler things than where the money comes from to clothe him. His interests lie with parliament and such, not bill collectors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014her brows knit as she tried to figure it out\u2014\u201che must have some idea of where the money comes from. Hasn\u2019t he ever asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Reading shrugged. \u201cPerhaps he does wonder, but if so, he\u2019s never said a word about it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never tried to discuss it with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Troubled, she stared at her hands. What Reading did to make money was reprehensible, but what of a man who enjoyed wealth without once asking how it was made? Wasn\u2019t Mandeville in some ways just as much to be condemned as Reading? Perhaps more so\u2014he had all the benefits without suffering any of the soul-shredding consequences of dealing in gin. There was a name for such a man, she knew.</p><p>Coward, a tiny voice whispered deep in her heart.</p><p>She pushed the thought aside and looked at Reading. \u201cIf my brother finds out what you do, he\u2019ll not hesitate to have you brought before a magistrate. Maximus cannot be reasoned with when it comes to the subject of gin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven at the risk of embroiling his dear younger sister in scandal?\u201d He arched an eyebrow. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, turning to gaze out the window. They\u2019d left St. Giles behind and were rolling through a much nicer area. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him. He\u2019s obsessed with gin and the effects it has on the poor of London\u2014he has been ever since our parents\u2019 murders. He believes that gin is to blame for their deaths. I don\u2019t know that he would stay his hand, even if you\u2019re soon to be my brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s a chance I have to take.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cWhat were you discussing with that man at the distillery?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI have a competitor\u2014though that word is a bit refined for what he is\u2014who is bent on driving me out of business.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, alarmed. \u201cWhat kind of competitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind who likes to smash stills and throw the mangled body of one of my men over the courtyard wall,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I came to London\u2014well, that and your engagement to Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d She shook her head. How could he joke about becoming mixed up with such criminals? \u201cThen that man was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name was Reese, and his only sin appears to have been going out for a drink yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cThat poor man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, Thomas isn\u2019t involved.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him incredulously. Did he really think her so shallow?</p><p>\u201cI can understand that you were desperate to right your family\u2019s finances,\u201d Hero said slowly. \u201cBut they are no longer in peril, are they? My brother would have found out if there were financial concerns when he had my marriage contract drawn up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother is a shrewd man,\u201d Reading said. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt but that you are correct. The Mandeville fortune is safe now. He didn\u2019t find anything amiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is the case, then why continue to distill gin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re patronizing me again,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He looked at her, his pale green eyes suddenly hard. \u201cI have my family to consider, my Lady Perfect. Caro has made a fine match, but Megs is still unwed. If she is to find a suitable match, she needs to dress the part\u2014as I\u2019m sure you understand. I cannot give up the still until she is safely wed\u2014until I am financially stable. We need the money from the still to finance her season.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and spoke from her heart. \u201cWe have had our differences, my Lord Shameless. There have been times in the last several days when I have thought I disliked you quite intensely.\u201d He snorted, but she continued. She needed to make her point before she lost her courage. \u201cBut I think we have also learned something about each other. I would like to think that we are friends of a sort.\u201d</p><p>The silence was so complete that she thought for a moment that he was holding his breath. She opened her eyes to find him watching her, his elbows propped on his knees, his green eyes still but with an expression in their depths that made her catch her breath. She clasped her hands, bolstering her bravery.</p><p>\u201cYes, friends,\u201d she said quietly, as much to herself as to him. \u201cAnd as a friend, I beg of you: please quit this way of making money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegs\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head violently, cutting him off. \u201cYes, Lady Margaret needs gowns to catch a husband, but there must be other ways of making money. I\u2019ve seen how gin destroys lives in the poorer parts of London. You may not care right now, you may only see your family and the money you need, but someday you\u2019ll raise your head and look around. When that day comes, you\u2019ll realize the misery you and your gin have caused. And when that happens, gin will destroy you, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFriends.\u201d He sat back in his seat, ignoring her warning. \u201cIs that what I really am to you? A friend?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. She hadn\u2019t expected the question. \u201cYes, why not?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, eyeing her moodily. \u201cWhy not indeed. Friend is such a very... benign... word. Do you kiss all your friends the way you kissed me last night?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had narrowed\u2014she had been waiting for the shot. But still she couldn\u2019t quite control a small shudder. His mouth had been hot. \u201cI\u2019ve told you I do not wish to discuss last night. It\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d He stroked his chin. \u201cI find it rather hard to forget it myself. Your lips were so very soft, so very sweet when they parted beneath mine.\u201d</p><p>Her body heated at his words. She couldn\u2019t help it, and she felt that same spark of desire. He could light it within her so damned easily.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she said low. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p> <p>It was his turn to look away. \u201cI don\u2019t honestly know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m marrying Thomas,\u201d she said. \u201cIn only five weeks now. If we are to have any sort of brother-sister relationship, you must forget it.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted as if her words were obscene. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cI thought not,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s ducky. Just ducky.\u201d</p><p>He reached into the pocket of his coat and drew out a book. He tossed it wordlessly onto her lap and went back to staring moodily out the window.</p> <p>Hero looked down. It was a volume of Thucydides\u2019s History of the Peloponnesian War. She traced the embossing on the leather cover, her eyes suddenly welling with tears.</p><p>* *</p><p>\u201cOH, MRS. HOLLINGBROOK, you have a letter, ma\u2019am!\u201d Nell Jones came into the home\u2019s kitchen, waving a bit of paper in the air.</p><p>Silence looked up from the sad little lump of biscuit dough she was attempting to roll out. Really, it hadn\u2019t been one of her better culinary efforts.</p><p>Nell caught sight of the dough and wrinkled her nose. \u201cHere, let me finish that while you have a seat and read your letter.\u201d</p><p>Silence gladly relinquished the rolling pin. She brushed off her hands and washed them in a basin before drawing up a chair to the kitchen table. Mary Darling had been playing with a pot and a big spoon on the floor, but when she saw Silence sit down, she crawled over and demanded to be held.</p><p>Silence picked her up and kissed the top of her head. In the last seven months, Mary Darling\u2019s hair had grown in thick and inky black, a mass of corkscrew curls.</p><p>She set the baby on her lap and showed her the letter. \u201cNow who do you suppose it\u2019s from?\u201d she asked as she carefully lifted the seal.</p> <p>\u201cIs it Captain Hollingbrook?\u201d Nell asked. Overhead came a thump and then what sounded like a stampede of oxen across the floor. The children were supposed to be doing their afternoon reading under the supervision of the maids, but somehow the daily event often turned into a melee.</p><p>Silence sighed and turned her gaze to the letter. \u201cYes, it\u2019s from William.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad of that, I\u2019m sure, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Silence murmured absently.</p><p>She deftly kept the paper from Mary Darling\u2019s interested fingers as she read. William wrote about the Finch and its cargo, a storm they\u2019d weathered, and a fight among the ensigns.</p><p>\u201cHave a bit of patty-cake,\u201d Nell said to Mary Darling, and handed her some of the biscuit dough.</p><p>A seabird the men had shot and the sighting of a French ship... Silence skimmed down the page, following the neat handwriting of her husband, coming finally to his signature\u2014William H. Hollingbrook. She stared blankly at the page, before she began over again, reading more slowly, searching. But she knew already\u2014there were no jokes they shared between just the two of them, no endearments, no expressions of wanting to come home or missing her. In fact, the letter could\u2019ve been written to anyone.</p><p>\u201cIs he well?\u201d Nell asked.</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d Silence glanced up and noticed that Mary Darling was carefully breaking off bits of the biscuit dough and placing them in her mouth to chew with a thoughtful expression. \u201cNo, sweetheart. \u2019Tisn\u2019t good not cooked.\u201d</p><p>Nell smiled at the baby. \u201cShe thinks it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t it make her sick?\u201d Silence asked worriedly.</p><p>Nell shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly flour and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...\u201d</p><p>Silence began to unwrap the baby\u2019s fingers from the sticky dough. Mary Darling naturally didn\u2019t think this a good idea and voiced her protests loudly.</p><p>Someone knocked on the front door.</p><p>\u201cShall I see who it is?\u201d Nell asked over the baby\u2019s cries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Silence said. She scooped up the baby and swung her around. \u201cWho do you suppose it is? The king or queen? Or perhaps just the baker\u2019s boy?\u201d</p><p>Mary Darling giggled, distracted from the loss of her dough. Silence set the baby on her hip and went to the door. She pulled it open and looked out. On the step was a handkerchief knotted neatly. Silence glanced at it and then quickly searched the street. A woman was washing her step across the way, two men walked side by side trundling wheelbarrows, and several lads argued over a small terrier dog. No one seemed to be paying her any mind.</p><p>Silence bent and picked up the handkerchief. The knot was loose and came easily undone, even using only one hand. Inside the handkerchief was a handful of raspberries, perfectly ripe, perfectly unblemished.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d Mary Darling cried, and grabbed two, stuffing them into her mouth.</p><p>A small scrap of paper was revealed now, and Silence plucked it out from under the berries. One word was written on it.</p><p>Darling.</p><p>Silence glanced back at the street as Mary Darling snagged three more berries. It was the oddest thing\u2014no one looked in her direction, yet she felt as if watching eyes were upon her. She shivered and reached for the door, beginning to shut it.</p><p>A shout came from up the street, and four men trotted around the corner. Between them they held a ragged elderly woman who struggled in their grasp.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, yer buggers!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cI \u2019aven\u2019t done it, I tells ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Nell said quietly from behind Silence.</p><p>Silence looked at the maidservant and back to the street. People were peering out of windows and doors, coming to see what the commotion was about.</p><p>\u201cStand back!\u201d one of the men cried. He waved a thick cudgel over his head.</p><p>A stream of filthy wastewater poured from one of the houses, narrowly missing the group. The four men trotted faster.</p><p>\u201cInformers,\u201d Nell spat. \u201cPoor woman. They\u2019ll have her up before the magistrates for selling gin and collect a nice reward in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to her?\u201d Silence abhorred what drinking gin did to the people in St. Giles, but at the same time she knew that most who sold it were simply trying to make enough money to feed and house themselves.</p><p>\u201cPrison. Maybe worse. Depends if she can pay for witnesses or not.\u201d Nell shook her head. \u201cCome inside, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>With a last glance at the retreating informers, Silence closed the door and barred it.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you there?\u201d Nell asked.</p><p>\u201cRaspberries,\u201d Silence said, showing her the kerchief.</p><p>\u201cIn October? That\u2019s dear.\u201d Nell turned and started back toward the kitchen.</p><p>Dear indeed. Silence picked up a berry and popped it into Mary Darling\u2019s mouth. A month before, she\u2019d found a baby\u2019s girdle on the step, and the month before that there\u2019d been a packet of sugarplums. In fact, every month since Silence had found Mary on her doorstep, there had been a small anonymous gift left for the little girl.</p><p>And each had a note with but a single word written upon it: Darling.</p><p>The same note that had been left with Mary herself. The reason Silence had given the baby the name Mary Darling.</p><p>\u201cHave you an admirer?\u201d she whispered in the toddler\u2019s ear.</p><p>But Mary Darling merely smiled with red-stained lips.</p><p>\u201cDO YOU THINK a man can change?\u201d Hero asked that night at dinner.</p><p>She poked at the cold beef upon her plate. It was just her, Cousin Bathilda, and Phoebe, and Cousin Bathilda had pointed out that it was hardly thrifty to have Cook put on a grand meal for a quiet supper at home.</p><p>Still. Hero did dislike cold beef.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said promptly. Rarely did she ever not have a decided opinion.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of change do you mean?\u201d Phoebe asked.</p><p>The candlelight sparkled on her spectacles as she tilted her head in interest. She wore a bright yellow gown tonight, and it made her seem to shine in the little family dining room. The table was a nice, intimate size, and the fireplace, ornamented with white and blue tile, was just big enough to make the room warm and cozy.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Hero said vaguely, though of course she did know. \u201cSay, for instance, a gentleman has a decided fondness for gambling at cards. Do you think he could ever be persuaded to quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cousin Bathilda reiterated. She slipped her right hand beneath the table while staring fixedly straight ahead. There was a small scuffle under the table.</p><p>Neither Hero nor Phoebe made any sign that they had noticed the transaction.</p><p>\u201cI think it might depend upon the gentleman,\u201d Phoebe said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd perhaps on the nature of the persuasion.\u201d She picked up a tiny piece of her beef and slipped her hand beneath the table.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said. \u201cMark my words: No lady has ever been able to change a gentleman, by persuasion or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass the beetroot,\u201d Phoebe murmured to Hero. \u201cHow do you know, Cousin Bathilda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s common feminine wisdom,\u201d that lady said. \u201cTake Lady Pepperman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Hero asked. She helped herself to the beetroot, even though that was cold as well, before passing it to her sister.</p><p>\u201cBefore your time,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said. \u201cNow listen. Lord Pepperman was a well-known gambler and a very unlucky one at that. Once gambled away his clothes, if you can credit it, and had to walk home in nothing but his smallclothes and wig.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe snorted and hastily covered her mouth with her napkin.</p><p>But Cousin Bathilda was in full sail and didn\u2019t notice. \u201cLady Pepperman was at her wit\u2019s end, so she decided she would teach her husband not to gamble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Hero asked with interest. She chose a bit of beef and held it under the table. A small, warm, soft nose nuzzled her hand and then the beef was gone. \u201cHow did she manage that?\u201d</p><p>Panders, the butler, and both footmen were too well trained to show anything but boredom on their faces, but all three men were leaning closer to Cousin Bathilda.</p><p>\u201cShe told him he could gamble as much as he wanted, but only in his smallclothes!\u201d Cousin Bathilda said.</p><p>Everyone in the room\u2014including the servants\u2014gaped at Cousin Bathilda.</p><p>Then Phoebe closed her mouth and asked diffidently, \u201cDid that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Cousin Bathilda said. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening to a word I\u2019ve said? Lord Pepperman continued to gamble, except now he was clad only in his smallclothes. Went on for a year or more before he lost nearly everything and tried to blow his brains out.\u201d</p><p>Hero choked. \u201cTried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucceeded only in clipping off the top of his ear,\u201d Cousin Bathilda pronounced. \u201cMan was a horrible shot. Can\u2019t think why Lady Pepperman married him in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Hero murmured as she digested this cautionary tale. Truly she couldn\u2019t think how she could apply it to Lord Reading. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a small silence broken only by the discreet scrape of silverware on plates.</p><p>\u201cI saw Lady Beckinhall today,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said at last, \u201cat a quite dreadful tea given by Mrs. Headington. All that was provided for refreshments were some very dry little cakes. I am positive that they were stale\u2014at the very least two days\u2019 old!\u2014and Lady Beckinhall quite agreed with me.\u201d</p><p>Lady Beckinhall could hardly do otherwise, Hero thought wryly.</p><p>\u201cShe informed me that Lady Caire is thinking of extending her stay on the continent through the winter,\u201d Bathilda went on.</p> <p>Hero looked up. \u201cOh, no. Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it rather might be,\u201d Hero said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Phoebe asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the work on the new home.\u201d Hero sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve had to hire another architect, because the first one embezzled the funds we\u2019d given him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy dear!\u201d Cousin Bathilda looked horrified.</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll need more money\u2014quite a bit more money, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Hero said. \u201cAnd Lady Caire staying away even longer won\u2019t help matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her son?\u201d Phoebe asked. \u201cWon\u2019t Lord Caire and his new wife be returning to town soon?\u201d</p><p>Bathilda snorted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he stayed away until spring. He married a brewer\u2019s daughter, after all. He\u2019ll need his mother\u2019s help in getting invitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Temperance or Lord Caire are particularly interested in society events,\u201d Hero began.</p><p>Bathilda drew in her breath sharply.</p> <p>\u201cBut you are right,\u201d Hero added hastily. \u201cThey may stay away from town for even longer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat shall you do?\u201d Phoebe asked.</p><p>Hero shook her head and was silent a moment as the footmen cleared the supper plates and brought in a pudding for dessert.</p><p>She waited until they were each served, then said solemnly, \u201cI shall have to raise the funds myself somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have some of mine,\u201d Phoebe said promptly. \u201cMother and Father left me a fair amount, or so Maximus says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t touch it until you\u2019re of a majority,\u201d Hero said gently. \u201cThank you anyway, dear.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe scrunched her face for a moment. \u201cI\u2019d wager there are other ladies who would like to help the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Hero dabbed at her pudding without really tasting it.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Phoebe was beginning to look excited. \u201cYou could form a... a syndicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a gentlemen\u2019s business syndicate?\u201d Cousin Bathilda frowned.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cExcept it would be only ladies\u2014because if you let a gentleman in, he\u2019ll want to run things\u2014and it\u2019s to give money, not make it. You could call it the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea, darling,\u201d Hero said, smiling. Phoebe\u2019s enthusiasm was hard to resist. \u201cBut what ladies would I approach to give away their money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might try Lady Beckinhall for one,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said unexpectedly. \u201cI know for a fact that her late husband left her extremely well-off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but will she want to simply give away her wealth?\u201d Hero shook her head. She didn\u2019t know Lady Beckinhall all that well, but the lady had always struck her as more interested in fashion and the latest gossip than charity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you make a list,\u201d Phoebe said, \u201centitled \u2018Potentially Charitable Ladies of Means.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will certainly help.\u201d Hero laughed.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Phoebe ate some of her pudding with evident appreciation. \u201cI say, why did you ask earlier about changing gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Hero replied.</p><p>\u201cLord Mandeville seems perfect the way he is,\u201d her younger sister commented. \u201cDoes he gamble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d Hero said.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he did, I can\u2019t think he\u2019d allow you to confine him to his smallclothes like Lord Pepperman,\u201d Phoebe said.</p><p>The younger footman choked, earning himself a severe glance from Panders.</p><p>Suddenly an image of Lord Griffin in his smallclothes popped into Hero\u2019s head, making her go hot all over. She took a guilty sip of wine.</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said, apparently oblivious to the currents around her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to accept Lord Mandeville the way he is, my dear. Fortunately for you, he\u2019s quite perfect as he is.\u201d</p><p>Hero nodded, her mind on Lord Reading, which was why she nearly jumped at Cousin Bathilda\u2019s next words.</p><p>\u201cNow, Lord Griffin,\u201d the older lady said, \u201cis an entirely different kettle of fish. I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if he gambled excessively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Phoebe asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you suspect Lord Griffin of such awful things? He was quite lovely to me last night.\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda smiled and shook her head in a manner that Hero had found quite maddening at Phoebe\u2019s age. \u201cThose tales aren\u2019t for ears as innocent as yours, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, whatever his unspeakable deeds, I like him. He makes me laugh, and he doesn\u2019t treat me like a child.\u201d</p><p>Naturally this bit of rebellion set Cousin Bathilda off on a lecture about decorum and the dangers of judging gentlemen solely upon their ability to make one laugh.</p><p>Hero looked down at her cold pudding. She could sympathize with Phoebe\u2014she, too, liked Reading. He was at base, no matter what Cousin Bathilda said, a good man. And because he was a good man, she needed to show him why what he was doing was wrong. Not just for the people who were damaged by drinking gin, but for Reading himself. If he continued distilling gin, at some point he would cease to be a good man.</p><p>And that was something Hero was quite sure she couldn\u2019t bear.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>That night, the suitors assembled in the throne room and presented their answers to the queen. The first was Prince Westmoon. He bowed and set a single, flawless diamond before her. \u201cWealth is the foundation of your kingdom, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Next, Prince Eastsun strode forward. He nodded to the queen and laid a pretty little golden dagger at her feet, all encrusted with gems. \u201cArms are the foundation of your kingdom, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Prince Northwind presented a velvet bag with five and twenty perfect pearls and said, \u201cTrade, Your Majesty, is the foundation of your kingdom....\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>Griffin cursed the Vicar of Whitechapel as he rode home the next morning. After a sleepless night at the distillery, spent constantly tense, listening for the least sign of intruders, Griffin had nothing to show for it but an aching head. There\u2019d been no sign of the Vicar or his men. All Griffin wanted now was a bite to eat and the comfort of his own bed.</p><p>In fact, he was so focused on those two things that he almost didn\u2019t notice the carriage lurking discreetly on the cross street down from his town house. Only the glimpse out of the corner of his eye of a familiar coachman alerted him.</p><p>Griffin pulled Rambler to a halt with a muttered curse. What the hell was Lady Hero doing on his street at the unfashionable hour of ten of the clock? His house was only feet away, but Griffin sighed and walked Rambler over to the carriage. He rapped on the window.</p><p>Slim fingers promptly pulled the curtains back, and Lady Hero motioned him impatiently inside.</p><p>Wonderful. Griffin instructed one of the footmen to take Rambler to the mews. Then he climbed in the carriage. She wore a dark green coat over a lighter green skirt, and her red hair seemed to glow in the dimness of the carriage.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI\u2019ve an appointment in St. Giles, and since you insist on accompanying me, I thought I\u2019d save you the trouble of tracking down my carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow thoughtful.\u201d He slumped onto the carriage seat.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cHave you had any sleep at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nor breakfast either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She looked adorably disapproving. \u201cSleep, then.\u201d</p><p>And he was so weary that he didn\u2019t even ask what her mission was in St. Giles before laying his head on the squabs and losing consciousness so quickly he might as well have been knocked on the head.</p><p>He opened his eyes sometime later to see Lady Hero watching him. Her clear gray gaze was somehow intimate.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, enjoying simply looking back at her. \u201cMuch, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him curiously. \u201cFor a self-proclaimed rake, you work harder than any gentleman I know.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. Had anyone else said that, he\u2019d think it a complaint\u2014for an aristocrat to work was no compliment\u2014but Lady Hero\u2019s voice was musing. Did she actually approve of something about him?</p><p>He lifted a corner of his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t tell the guild of rakes, will you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, and then opened a cloth on her lap. \u201cI bought you a meat pie while you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an angel,\u201d Griffin said gratefully. He took the pie\u2014still warm\u2014and bit into it, savoring the gravy on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cMaking money isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019re good at,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He arched his eyebrows, still chewing.</p><p>A faint flush crept up her elegant neck. \u201cYou make people laugh.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cSo do fools.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, gently admonishing. \u201cYou jest, but the ability to laugh is a wonderful thing. Phoebe had a lovely time the other night, largely because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything extraordinary.\u201d He shook his head and took another bite.</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d She looked at him intently. \u201cPhoebe is... is special and very dear to my heart. I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am that you made her laugh that night. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he remembered how Phoebe had lost sight of the little monkey on stage. \u201cWhat did\u2014\u201d The carriage shuddered to a halt, distracting him before he could finish the thought. \u201cHave you decided to inspect the construction again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked down at her hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped at the temporary foundling home. I wanted to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d She wasn\u2019t meeting his eyes, so he probably wasn\u2019t going to like whatever she had in store for him. Still, he ate the last of the pastry and brushed off his hands. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps his smile had a bit too much teeth. She glanced at him rather nervously before descending the carriage. Outside, the day was gray and a chill wind blew.</p><p>Griffin offered his arm. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>She laid her hand on his sleeve, and he was aware of her touch, light though it was. It was pleasant to be able to guide her down the lane leading to the temporary home. To act the proper gentleman to her lady.</p><p>They stopped at the door to the home, and he stepped forward and knocked.</p><p>There was no sound from within.</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201cDo they expect you today?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, a fine pale pink blush climbing her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them I was coming.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to reply to this news before the door was pulled open. A young girl stood before them, an enormous apron pinned to her bodice.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mary Whitsun,\u201d Lady Hero said. \u201cIs Mrs. Hollingbrook about?\u201d</p><p>The girl curtsied. \u201cYes, my lady. Please come in.\u201d</p><p>Griffin stepped over the sill and noticed immediately the bare boards of the hallway\u2014they were warped. The girl led them into a small sitting room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch Mrs. Hollingbrook from the kitchen,\u201d Mary Whitsun said, and hurried away.</p><p>Lady Hero didn\u2019t sit and neither did Griffin. He circled the tiny room before halting in front of the fireplace. He tapped his fingers against the mantel and watched as crumbs of plaster fell to the hearth.</p><p>Footsteps sounded in the hall, and then the door was pushed open. The young woman who stood there was very pretty, but flustered. Pale brown hair with streaks of light red and blond was bundled untidily under a cap, tendrils stuck to her flushed cheeks. A smudge of flour dotted her chin.</p><p>\u201cLady Hero, we weren\u2019t expecting you,\u201d she said in a breathless rush as she curtsied.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter, Mrs. Hollingbrook.\u201d Hero smiled calmly, which seemed to set the other woman\u2019s nerves slightly at ease. \u201cI\u2019ve brought a friend, Lord Griffin Reading. He\u2019s heard me speak of the home and became quite interested. I was wondering if you could show him some of the children?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook\u2019s face brightened. \u201cHow do you do, my lord?\u201d She bobbed a wobbly curtsy, rising eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ll be very happy to introduce you to some of our charges.\u201d</p><p>Griffin smiled and bowed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He waited until the lady had turned her back to lead them from the room before shooting Lady Hero a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, Lady Perfect?\u201d he murmured in her ear as he placed a hand against the small of her back.</p> <p>She glanced at him nervously as he ushered her from the room. They followed Mrs. Hollingbrook back through the house.</p><p>The kitchen they entered was cavelike. Griffin had to duck his head so as not to knock himself out on the lintel. Six little girls were crowded around a long wooden table, in the process of rolling out pastry of some kind. As one, they looked up and saw him, then froze like young fawns surprised in a woodland glade.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said, \u201cwe have a special visitor. This is Lord Griffin Reading, a friend of Lady Hero. Please show his lordship your best manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest manners\u201d must\u2019ve been a code word. The girls each curtsied with varying degrees of grace.</p><p>Griffin nodded gravely and murmured, \u201cHow d\u2019you do?\u201d</p><p>A small, ginger-headed child smothered a giggle.</p> <p>Mrs. Hollingbrook chose to disregard this breach of decorum. She laid her hand on the eldest girl. \u201cThis is Mary Whitsun, who I believe you already met at the door.\u201d</p><p>Mary Whitsun bobbed a curtsy.</p><p>Lady Hero cleared her throat. \u201cHow long has Mary Whitsun lived at the home, Mrs. Hollingbrook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly ten years, my lady,\u201d Mary Whitsun answered for herself.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you come to the home?\u201d</p><p>Mary looked quickly at Mrs. Hollingbrook. There was a slight line between that lady\u2019s eyes. \u201cMary was brought to us by a\u201d\u2014she darted a look at the girls\u2014\u201cer, person of ill repute. She was just three at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her mother?\u201d Lady Hero asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about her parents,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said slowly, \u201cbut judging by the person who brought her here, it was thought that her mother was a poor unfortunate who walked the streets.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother had been a prostitute. Griffin looked at the girl, wondering how she felt to have such intimate matters of her history discussed in front of her.</p><p>The girl met his gaze, her expression stony.</p><p>Griffin nodded at her and said gently, \u201cThank you, Mary Whitsun.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook moved to the next small girl in line. \u201cThis is Mary Little. She has been with us since she was an infant left on our doorstep.\u201d</p><p>Mary Little bobbed a curtsy. \u201cAre you the one that\u2019s to marry Lady Hero?\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero gasped softly beside him. Griffin didn\u2019t dare glance at her. \u201cNo, it\u2019s my brother who is to wed Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said the child.</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook cleared her throat. \u201cAnd this\u201d\u2014she laid a hand on the third girl in line\u2014\u201cis Mary Compassion. She came to us at the age of two along with her brother, Joseph Compassion. Their parents died within a sennight of each other from cold and ill nutrition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd drink,\u201d Lady Hero murmured.</p><p>Griffin stared at her impassively. She lifted her chin, stubbornly staring back.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook looked between him and Lady Hero, a puzzled frown on her face. \u201cMost of the deaths in St. Giles\u2014the ones that are not from old age, that is\u2014are helped along in one way or another by drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many die from old age in St. Giles?\u201d Lady Hero asked.</p><p>\u201cFew,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook replied softly. \u201cVery, very few.\u201d</p><p>Griffin fisted his hands, trying to keep his voice level. \u201cAnd these other young ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook glanced distractedly at her charges. \u201cThis is Mary Evening. She has been with us since infancy. She was found on a nearby church step. Next to her is Mary Redribbon, who was brought to us by a local tavern owner.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook glanced quickly at Lady Hero. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mary Redribbon was left at the tavern by her mother, who did not return.\u201d</p><p>Griffin forced a smile to his lips as the little girls dipped in curtsy. Damn it. He wanted to shout that it wasn\u2019t his fault if people chose to drink gin. He\u2019d made no woman prostitute herself or abandon her babe in a tavern. If he didn\u2019t distill the gin they drank, someone else would.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally, this is Mary Sweet.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook stroked the curls of the smallest child, who couldn\u2019t have been more than three. \u201cHer mother has five other children and attempted to sell Mary when she was but an infant. We persuaded the mother to give her to us instead.\u201d</p><p>Griffin inhaled. \u201cHow very fortunate for Mary Sweet.\u201d He glanced at the toddler, who promptly hid her face in Mrs. Hollingbrook\u2019s skirts.</p><p>\u201cWe are fortunate as well,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said affectionately. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll come with me, I can introduce you to some of our boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, as to that.\u201d Griffin made a grimace of apology. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Lady Hero overestimated the time available to us. We shall have to save the rest of your tour for another day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said. \u201cYou\u2019re most welcome at any time, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and took Lady Hero\u2019s arm in a firm grip, propelling her to the door even as she breathlessly said her good-byes. He kept his smile pasted to his face until they were outside.</p><p>She tried to take her arm from his grasp. \u201cMy lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d he murmured, trotting her up the lane. He gave instructions to the coachman, helped her into the waiting carriage, and sat.</p><p>Then he looked across at her and growled, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>READING\u2019S PALE GREEN eyes were hard, his lips pressed together, forming white brackets on either side, and his nostrils flared.</p><p>He looked so intimidating, in fact, that Hero had to swallow before she could reply. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get you to understand what your gin distilling is doing to St. Giles and the poor people who live here. As a friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed sharply, drowning out her words. \u201cYes? As a friend, what did you think would happen when you took me there? I\u2019d gaze at those tiny girls and have a sudden revelation? Perhaps give all my worldly goods to the poor and become a monk?\u201d</p><p>He sat forward. \u201cListen, and listen well, my lady\u2014I like who I am and what I do. I\u2019m an unrepentant rake who makes illegal gin. Don\u2019t think you or anyone else can change me\u2014even if I wanted to be changed.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips and cocked her head, staring at him silently. Anger was rising in her as well.</p><p>He returned her stare until the silence seemed to irritate him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my lord, are not nearly as reckless\u2014or as bad\u2014as you would have me believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you babbling about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour reputation.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cYour rakishness. You\u2019ve let all of London think that you left Cambridge on some feckless whim when in fact you left to help your family. You lead others to believe that you live the life of a libertine, without care or worry, when in fact you work for your family\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>He laughed incredulously. \u201cIn case it has escaped your memory, I was in the act of bedding a married woman when we met.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, that vision making her even angrier somehow. \u201cI never said you were perfect. Just not as damnable as you let others believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin and stared him in the eye. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He smirked nastily. \u201cWhat about my dear brother\u2019s late wife?\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to beat faster. The carriage was so confining, and his temper was a nearly visible haze of red between them. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole world knows I seduced her under my poor brother\u2019s nose, and had she not died in childbirth, along with the babe, no doubt I would\u2019ve fathered his future heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cDid I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do all those things the world and your own brother think you did?\u201d</p><p>For a moment he stared at her, wild and grief-stricken, and she held her breath, waiting for his answer.</p><p>Then he slowly shook his head. \u201cNo. God, no.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. \u201cThen why let everyone believe such an atrocious lie? Why pretend to be worse than you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d he began, but she wasn\u2019t done questioning him yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded fiercely. \u201cWhy continue in this dreadful gin business? You are better than this, Reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat god gave you the right to sit in judgment over me?\u201d he asked low and awful. \u201cOh, but I forget: You consider yourself more virtuous than the rest of us mere mortals. You are Lady Perfect, arbitrator of other people\u2019s sins, an incorruptible maiden colder than graveyard granite in January.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, unable to speak for a moment. Did he really see her thus? As a chilly, self-righteous virgin?</p><p>\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she whispered, and couldn\u2019t help the tears that flooded her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>Her vision was blurred, so she didn\u2019t see his movement, but she was suddenly across the carriage, half sprawled on his lap.</p><p>\u201cI dare,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbecause I\u2019m selfish and black-hearted and vain. I dare because you are what you are and I am what I am. I dare because I cannot otherwise. I\u2019ve lived too long without bread or wine, crawling desperate in a lonely, barren desert, and you, my darling Lady Perfect, are manna sent directly from heaven above.\u201d</p><p>His lips were on hers, urgent and hot. Oh, Lord, she had not known how much she missed his kisses! His mouth tasted of need too long suppressed, but where he might\u2019ve been rough with her, he was instead gentle.</p><p>Very gentle.</p><p>His lips pressed against hers, his tongue licking at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he pleaded even as she opened her lips.</p><p>He canted his face, pulling her closer, his tongue sliding into her mouth. His beard scratched against the soft skin of her chin, but she didn\u2019t care. She suckled his tongue, drawing on it as if it were the sweetest thing she\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he murmured again, and she felt his broad hand on the bare skin just below her neck.</p><p>He stroked her as if gentling a kitten, softly, expertly, his hand drifting lower. All her awareness was centered on that hand, on his fingers drawing nearer to the tip of her breast. Her breasts felt tight and heavy in anticipation, and she waited with bated breath for him to touch her. He bit suddenly at her lower lip, distracting her, and then\u2014oh, heavens!\u2014his fingers slid beneath her bodice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gasped, feeling his hot skin as he stroked over her hardened nipple. He spread his hand, trapping the tip between his first and second fingers. When he squeezed, she felt the sudden jolt between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he murmured, quieting the moan she\u2019d made. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>She looked and saw that he\u2019d pulled her bodice down, exposing one nipple above her stays. He muttered something, working at the laces of her bodice, and then both breasts were exposed.</p><p>For a moment he merely stared down at her, her soft skin framed by his big, tanned hands, his long fingers playing with her nipples possessively.</p> <p>\u201cSweet, so sweet,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLet me taste them.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, and his gaze was feverish, his green eyes gleaming like a demon. That was why she agreed\u2014it must be why\u2014because she could only nod at him.</p><p>And then his mouth was where no man had ever touched her. His tongue stroked across one naked nipple, wet and faintly rough at the same time. She had no idea she was so sensitive there. He took her flesh into his mouth\u2014tenderly, reverently\u2014and she jumped. He pulled strongly, the sensation so exquisitely sweet it verged on painful.</p><p>She looked down dazedly, watching his white wig against her breast. This was too intimate an act to be done in a carriage fully clothed. She wanted a private part of him, too, if only a little bit. She pushed aside his wig, pulling it off his head and throwing it to the seat. He never stopped his ministrations, only moved to the other nipple.</p><p>Under the wig, his hair was dark and thick, shorn short, almost like fur. She ran her hands over his scalp, flexing her fingers, feeling his hair, warm and surprisingly soft. She closed her eyes in bliss. He was pinching her first nipple between his thumb and finger as he suckled on her other breast. A fire was building at her center, hot and uncontrollable.</p> <p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he whispered against her breast.</p><p>\u201cI... I am,\u201d she answered.</p><p>She opened her eyes and saw him rub his cheek against her cherry-red nipple. She swallowed at the erotic sight, at the sweetly rough sensation of his unshaven cheek on her sensitive flesh. His eyes were bright and green, watching her, demanding something.</p><p>\u201cNot there,\u201d he said, and caught her hand, drawing it down between them. Her skirts concealed his lap, and he pulled her fingers underneath, fumbling with his other hand, until suddenly\u2014startlingly\u2014she touched naked flesh.</p><p>Her gaze flew to his.</p><p>His smile was rueful, yet strained. He looked upon her bare breasts, but what she held, naked, in her hand was hundreds of times more intimate.</p> <p>\u201cDo you feel me?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She licked her lips, staring into his face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStroke me.\u201d His eyes half closed. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She flexed her fingers, exploring this foreign, hot flesh. It was so hard it didn\u2019t seem humanly possible. Yet the skin was tenderly soft. She wrapped her hand about him, and his palm closed over hers, strong and unbearably familiar. He showed her how to slowly stroke up until she touched the wide, slick head. She caressed it, feeling the spongy flesh, the tiny indent at the very tip. He made a sound, almost of pain, and then he seized her hand and brought it down the thick stalk again. It was so much longer\u2014so much bigger\u2014than she\u2019d ever dreamed.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he moaned. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and licked across her nipple before gently closing his teeth over the tip. She gasped, her head falling back against his shoulder. He worried her nipple, then let it go to kiss it softly.</p><p>\u201cStroke me,\u201d he gasped, and let her hand go.</p><p>She did, pulling up over that hard flesh, hidden beneath her skirts. That part of him that made him a man.</p> <p>\u201cLike this?\u201d she whispered, low and intimate in the rocking carriage. Outside, London passed by. Inside she held a man\u2019s penis in her palm.</p><p>\u201cYesss,\u201d he hissed before tonguing her other nipple. \u201cExactly like that.\u201d</p><p>She looked down and saw herself, displayed before him, a wanton feast, her nipples red and swollen, so sensitive his every touch made her moan. Her hand moved beneath her skirts, and she wondered at her own daring. Perhaps this was a dream, a wicked fantasy come to life in the middle of the day in her own carriage. She stroked a man\u2019s bare cock\u2014Reading\u2019s bare cock\u2014to bring him carnal pleasure. She watched his face, shining with sweat, the intent look he bent upon her nipples, and the breaths that made his great chest expand and contract. It occurred to her that she might never share a moment as intimate as this again with another human being.</p><p>His big hands were on her breasts, and he pinched both her nipples at once. She bit her lip at the pleasure-pain, a tear slipping down one cheek. This was real. This was something outside of everyday bland interactions and rote conversation. His mouth was on hers, open and wild, and his hips were thrusting, moving his cock in her hand in an animal rhythm. He squeezed her poor engorged nipples again, pulling at them at the same time. And she felt.</p><p>She felt alive.</p><p>She arched, pushing her breasts into his hands, sucking on his tongue, and feeling an unstoppable rush of pure, white pleasure through her body. And at the same time, as if in sympathy, the male flesh in her palm jerked and gushed hot liquid between her fingers. She pulsed as he pulsed, shuddered as he shuddered, and she didn\u2019t want it to end.</p><p>When she finally opened her eyes, she was appalled and amazed at the same time.</p><p>Green eyes watched her face, lazy and satisfied, and very, very male. For a moment all was peaceful with the world.</p><p>And then she remembered. \u201cDear God. Thomas is to meet me at my house for luncheon.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>GRIFFIN\u2019S BODY WAS filled with a warm lethargy, but Lady Hero\u2019s words were a douse of icy water. He straightened and glanced out the window. Her house was in sight. He turned to her and for a moment was stunned anew. She lay across his lap, her breasts bared just past the tips of her delicious nipples, her pale cheeks flushed, her diamond eyes dazed by what they had just shared.</p><p>Dear God, indeed.</p><p>Hastily, he searched his coat pockets and found a handkerchief. He took her hand from beneath her skirts and began wiping his spill off of her fingers.</p><p>She snatched her hand away. \u201cI... I can do that.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows but let her take the handkerchief. He put himself to rights and watched as she finished scrubbing her fingers and then wrinkled her nose at the handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and fumbled with her bodice. \u201cPlease turn away.\u201d</p><p>A sardonic reply was on his lips, but he thought better of it. He turned to view the closed curtains over the window. She\u2019d moved off his lap, but he felt the small movements beside him as she adjusted herself. She was ashamed, he could see that clearly, and for the life of him he didn\u2019t know how to make this right.</p><p>He felt her rise and take her seat on the opposite side of the carriage. He looked up.</p><p>She was patting at her hair, refusing to meet his gaze. \u201cI... I hope you will not speak of this to anyone?\u201d</p><p>He cursed, low and foully.</p><p>Her head jerked up and she stared at him with eyes that made him want to weep and bellow at the same time.</p><p>Griffin passed a hand across his forehead. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll not talk.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, then nodded jerkily. \u201cYou need to put on your wig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d He looked about the carriage seat, finally finding it smashed into a corner. The carriage rolled to a stop as he tugged the wig on. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They sat there in silence as they waited for the footman to set the step and open the door. Griffin tried to think of something to say. He\u2019d stolen her innocence\u2014in intent if not in fact. There was no going back from that.</p><p>Finally, after eons of waiting, the door was opened and she stepped down, her face averted from his. No doubt she loathed the very sight of him now, he thought grimly as he followed her.</p><p>\u201cHero, darling, there you are!\u201d Lady Phoebe called from the top of the town house steps. \u201cCousin Bathilda is pacing holes in the sitting room carpet, and Cook has burned the soup.\u201d Her bright eyes swiveled to him, and she squinted a bit behind her glasses. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve brought Lord Griffin for luncheon as well. How clever of you.\u201d</p><p>Griffin felt Lady Hero go stiff beside him. \u201cI do not wish to intrude on your luncheon, Lady Phoebe. Your sister kindly offered me a ride in her carriage, no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you must stay,\u201d Lady Phoebe protested. \u201cCook will fix the soup, she always does, and it\u2019s so much nicer with two gentlemen instead of a lonely one, badgered by females all about. Hero, do make him stay.\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero turned to him and smiled with trembling lips, her eyes tragic. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He ought to go, he knew that. Knew, too, that she didn\u2019t really want him here. But her very fragility at that moment made it impossible for him to turn away.</p><p>Griffin bowed and held out his arm for her. \u201cAs you wish, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She laid her hand on his sleeve, and he remembered with something of a jolt that those same fingers had wrapped around his cock not five minutes ago. Dear God, his brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. What a mess he\u2019d made.</p><p>They mounted the steps and went inside, her sister all the while chattering and thankfully oblivious to their silence. Lady Hero was so wooden beside him she might have been a walking statue. He had an urge to cover the fingers on his sleeve, to see if they were warm with life.</p><p>Did she hate him now? Wish that they\u2019d never done what they\u2019d done in the carriage? He knew he should be regretting those moments, but he simply couldn\u2019t. Her delicate breasts had been too sweet, the sound she had made when he\u2019d taken her ripe nipple between his lips too beautiful. Her gray eyes had narrowed in bliss as he\u2019d made love to her. And by God, he\u2019d take that memory to his grave and be thankful of it, no matter the cost.</p><p>A footman took her wrap, and Lady Hero glanced at Griffin, then away again swiftly. \u201cI... I just need to freshen up. Phoebe will show you to the luncheon room.\u201d</p><p>Griffin bowed, watching moodily as she retreated up the stairs.</p><p>He turned to Lady Phoebe, offering his elbow. \u201cI\u2019m at your mercy.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, taking his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s just us for luncheon\u2014myself, Hero, your brother, and Cousin Bathilda. Have you met my cousin Bathilda yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had the honor.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t let Mignon bother you. She growls at everyone.\u201d</p><p>And with those cryptic words, she led him up the stairs and into a light, feminine room, all yellows and whites with dauntingly fragile furniture. Thomas was standing at the far end with a rather stout matron. He looked up at their entrance, seeming less than pleased to see his brother.</p><p>\u201cLook who Hero brought home,\u201d Lady Phoebe said as they neared.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d Thomas murmured in greeting.</p><p>\u201cThomas.\u201d Griffin turned to the older lady and eyed the small black, white, and brown spaniel she held in her arms. It was growling at him, low and continually, rather like a bumblebee.</p><p>\u201cThis is Lord Griffin Reading, Cousin Bathilda,\u201d Lady Phoebe murmured. \u201cMy lord, this is my cousin, Miss Bathilda Picklewood.\u201d</p><p>Miss Picklewood dipped into a creaking curtsy as he bowed. \u201cWe shall have to tell Panders that there is one more for luncheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to eat too much,\u201d Griffin said lightly. \u201cWhat a pretty little spaniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Miss Picklewood had actually pinkened. She stroked the spaniel\u2019s head, and it interrupted its rumbling to lick her fingers. \u201cWould you like to pet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Griffin examined the dog warily. It hadn\u2019t started growling again, but then its protuberant brown eyes didn\u2019t look particularly friendly either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beside him, Lady Phoebe\u2019s eyes were positively dancing behind her spectacles. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened. If she bites, we\u2019ll send for a doctor, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloodthirsty baggage,\u201d Griffin muttered under his breath before extending a hand toward the dog\u2019s nose. If he were going to be bitten, he might as well get it over with. \u201cMademoiselle Mignon.\u201d</p><p>The spaniel sniffed daintily and then opened her mouth in a doggy grin as he gingerly fondled her ears.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Miss Picklewood said. \u201cShe usually hates gentlemen.\u201d</p> <p>Griffin\u2019s outraged gaze flew to Lady Phoebe\u2019s own, and she covered her mouth to stifle a giggle.</p><p>The girl shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s never actually bitten a gentleman before. Just threatened to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came close with me,\u201d Thomas remarked drily. \u201cYou must\u2019ve rubbed your fingers in bacon, Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she just has very good taste,\u201d Griffin said as he scratched Mignon\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cIn any case, she certainly seems fond of you,\u201d Miss Picklewood muttered. She nodded as the butler made some sort of signal. \u201cI think we\u2019re ready to go in. Perhaps you can see what\u2019s taking your sister so long, Phoebe?\u201d</p> <p>Lady Phoebe slipped from the room, and Thomas made a social remark, but Griffin wasn\u2019t paying attention. He absently stroked the little spaniel and wondered if he was the reason Hero was reluctant to come to luncheon.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. He\u2019d made the worst mistake of his life.</p><p>\u201cHere she is.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the sound of Lady Phoebe\u2019s voice. Hero was standing beside her, composed, though color still flew high in her cheeks.</p><p>She walked straight to Thomas and held out her hand. \u201cMy lord, it is good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Thomas bent over her hand in a polite, everyday gesture that in no way could be construed as passionate, and pain arched through Griffin\u2019s body in a searing flame. In that moment, he wanted to shove aside his brother, lift up Lady Hero, and bear her away. Take her someplace where he could wipe that look of bored serenity from her face and replace it with lust. Lust for him.</p> <p>Instead he took a breath and offered his arm to Lady Phoebe. \u201cWill you accompany me into luncheon, my lady?\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, her round, rosy cheeks merry. \u201cI\u2019d be delighted, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The luncheon, like the room, proved to be a feminine affair. A clear soup hardly more than a broth, delicate little pastries more pretty than filling, and a variety of breads and cheeses. The wine was good, though, and in ordinary circumstances, Griffin might\u2019ve enjoyed himself.</p><p>\u201cI understand you manage the family estates,\u201d Miss Picklewood said with a queer look fixed on her face. She sat at the head of the table. One of her hands drifted beneath the table.</p><p>\u201cManage is surely too strong a word,\u201d Thomas drawled from the foot of the table. \u201cMy brother is preoccupied with his amusements, and we do have several land stewards.\u201d</p><p>Griffin picked up his knife. \u201cWhat my brother is trying to say is that, yes, I do oversee the Mandeville estates as well as my private ones.\u201d</p><p>Thomas gave him a blank, unfriendly stare as he sipped his wine.</p><p>To Thomas\u2019s right, Lady Hero straightened as her hand disappeared beneath the table. \u201cAre your lands in Lancashire as well, Lord Griffin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Griffin toyed with his knife. \u201cA result of prudent marriages by my ancestors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s so far from London,\u201d Lady Phoebe exclaimed. \u201cSurely you must get lonely in the country.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and stared straight ahead as her hand, too, suddenly darted underneath the table.</p><p>Thomas, seemingly oblivious to all this, snorted. \u201cMy brother can find excitement no matter where he is. And he has his trips to London should he find a need to debauch himself.\u201d</p><p>Griffin narrowed his eyes, staring at Thomas, feeling the blackness boil at the back of his eyeballs. He smiled and dropped the knife. It clattered onto his plate.</p><p>The ladies started.</p><p>Thomas merely raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Griffin shifted his gaze to Lady Phoebe, who sat between him and Thomas. \u201cI enjoy riding and hunting, my lady, and overseeing the planting and harvest takes up much of my time, so no, I\u2019m not lonely, though I do thank you for your concern.\u201d</p><p>She was frowning, her eyes darting between him and his brother, but at his words she smiled tentatively. \u201cWell, we shall have to be sure to see that you are properly entertained when you are in London, won\u2019t we, Hero?\u201d</p><p>Lady Hero pressed her lips together. \u201cPhoebe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lady Phoebe looked confused.</p><p>Lady Hero\u2019s expression was wooden. Even Miss Picklewood\u2019s face looked more welcoming.</p><p>At that moment, Griffin felt tiny paws on his knee. They tapped quite imperiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted to go anywhere you have a mind, Lady Phoebe.\u201d He smiled and broke off a piece of pastry, feeding it to Mignon beneath the table.</p><p>\u201cOur time is largely taken up by wedding arrangements,\u201d Hero said repressively.</p><p>\u201cBut you must shop.\u201d He picked up the knife again, idly twirling it between his fingers. \u201cAnd eat and go to fairs and the like.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe giggled nervously.</p><p>Hero\u2019s eyes dropped to her plate. Her cheeks had gone pale, her mouth crimped in a straight line.</p><p>He shrugged easily, though his heart had shriveled. \u201cOr perhaps not.\u201d</p><p>Thomas stirred in his seat. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d be inclined to go to any more fairs.\u201d</p><p>Lady Phoebe perked up. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>Griffin arched an eyebrow at his brother, a sudden memory lightening his mood.</p><p>\u201cBecause Griffin nearly got himself killed by a pack of traveling tinkers at the last fair he attended,\u201d Thomas drawled.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Phoebe leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. He was in the act of stealing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely examining,\u201d Griffin interjected.</p><p>\u201cStealing,\u201d Thomas rolled over him with his parliamentary voice, \u201ca trinket of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA penknife,\u201d Griffin murmured to Phoebe. \u201cIt had a ruby on the hilt.\u201d</p><p>Thomas snorted. \u201cPaste, most likely. In any event, one of the tinkers, a man of at least six feet tall, caught him by the scruff of the neck, and had I not intervened, I would be one brother shorter today.\u201d</p><p>Griffin smiled wryly, putting down the knife and taking a sip of wine. \u201cEven then Thomas was rather renown for his oratory.\u201d</p><p>Thomas grinned and Griffin remembered that long-ago day. The sudden fear, the complete relief and gratitude when his bigger, older brother had come to his rescue. He looked down at his plate, nudging the knife with his fingertip. That time seemed centuries ago now.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d Hero asked softly.</p><p>He inhaled and looked up, meeting her far-too perceptive eyes. \u201cNearly twelve.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and the conversation moved on to a piece of gossip Miss Picklewood had heard.</p><p>But Griffin was silent, contemplating that past when he and Thomas had been so close.</p><p>And the present when they were so very far apart.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Queen Ravenhair looked at the offerings of her three suitors and nodded regally. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and led them into the dining room where she turned the conversation to other matters.</p><p>But that night as Queen Ravenhair stood upon her balcony, the little brown bird flew to the railing. She took the bird into her cupped palms and saw that he had a string about his neck, and at the end of the string was a small iron nail.</p><p>And then she smiled. For her people used nails to build their houses, and that\u2014her people and their homes\u2014was the foundation of her kingdom....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>Hero stared at herself in her dressing room mirror the next afternoon and wondered what sort of woman let her fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother make love to her. The woman in the mirror looked the same as she remembered\u2014widely set gray eyes, neatly coiffed red hair, steady, serene gaze\u2014everything in place, in fact. But somehow she was different than the person she\u2019d thought herself just a week before. That woman\u2014that Hero\u2014would never have sinned, would\u2019ve scoffed at the mere suggestion that she might.</p><p>And yet she had.</p><p>Hero lightly touched a curl at her temple.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite lovely, my dear.\u201d Lady Mandeville\u2019s voice broke into her thoughts.</p><p>Hero glanced down at herself. Yards of shimmering pale silk apricot swathed her form, pulled back in front to reveal a cream underskirt embroidered with green, blue, and pink posies. The embroidery continued along the seams of the dress and framed the deep, round neckline. It was indeed a lovely dress.</p><p>Why, then, did she feel like weeping?</p><p>\u201cYou do like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lady Mandeville inquired. \u201cWe can have it remade or have an entirely new one made if you don\u2019t. There\u2019s still time before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Hero said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely dress. The seamstresses have done a wonderful job.\u201d</p><p>The little woman kneeling at her feet flashed her a grateful smile before bending again to the hem.</p><p>She\u2019d always known who she was, Hero reflected. A lady of principles. A woman with compassion and a few ideals, but one who had a level head on her shoulders. She\u2019d always prided herself on her common sense. Yesterday had been a very sad blow to both common sense and the image she\u2019d had of herself. She was four and twenty\u2014a mature number of years. One would think by now that she\u2019d have a firm grasp of who she was.</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d the head seamstress said, sitting up. She eyed the hem critically. \u201cWe\u2019ll take that up and then add some lace to the sleeves and bodice. It\u2019ll be very fine when we finish, my lady, never you fear.\u201d</p><p>Hero dutifully pivoted to eye the dress from the side. Such a perfect dress. If only the woman inside was as perfect. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll require three more fittings, I think. May we call upon you next Tuesday morning, my lady?\u201d The seamstress and her helpers were already extracting her from the dress.</p><p>\u201cThat will be fine,\u201d Hero murmured.</p><p>\u201cI shall come to that fitting as well,\u201d Lady Mandeville announced. \u201cWe can discuss the family jewelry and what pieces you might want to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Hero met her own eyes in the mirror as the seamstresses worked around her. Calm and gray. She\u2019d committed a sin. She wasn\u2019t sure she could ever resurrect her perfect facade again. She should be wracked with guilt and despair and yet... and yet, doing what she had done with Lord Reading yesterday had felt fundamentally right.</p><p>Soul-deep right.</p><p>That feeling was perhaps the most disturbing thing of all.</p><p>It took another half hour to dress again. Lady Mandeville chatted lightly as Hero made her toilet, and if the older lady saw anything odd about her future daughter-in-law, she made no sign. The seamstresses left after carefully packing away Hero\u2019s wedding dress, and then Lady Mandeville rose as well. She drew on her gloves, watching as Wesley crossed the room to fetch a jacket for Hero from the wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you like the dress, my dear?\u201d Lady Mandeville said softly.</p><p>Hero looked at her kind face and had to blink suddenly. She didn\u2019t deserve this wonderful woman as a mother-in-law. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u201d\u2014Lady Mandeville touched Hero\u2019s shoulder lightly with one finger\u2014\u201cyou seem rather melancholy this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Hero smiled, pulling the crumbling shards of her facade about her. \u201cBridal nerves, I expect.\u201d</p><p>Lady Mandeville looked uncertain, but in the end she nodded. \u201cOf course. But if you would like to talk to me about anything\u2014anything at all\u2014well, I do hope we\u2019ll have that sort of a relationship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hope so too,\u201d Hero said in a rush. How she longed to confess all her doubts and worries! But Lady Mandeville would no longer look at her quite so kindly if she knew how Hero had deceived her son. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Lady Mandeville gave one last tug to her gloves. \u201cGood, my dear. I\u2019m glad. Now, don\u2019t keep Thomas waiting too long. I know he expects to take you driving this afternoon.\u201d So saying, the lady bid her farewell and left.</p><p>Hero donned a pretty green jacket with Wesley\u2019s help.</p><p>Wesley stood back to admire her work and nodded, satisfied. \u201cMy Lord Mandeville will be quite taken with you today, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>Hero smiled slightly. \u201cThank you, Wesley.\u201d</p><p>She descended the stairs and found Mandeville already waiting for her in the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d he said as she entered. \u201cYour beauty puts the sun to shame.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are the wedding plans progressing?\u201d he asked as he guided her from the sitting room and down the front steps. \u201cI hear the dress is nearly finished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, only a few more fittings.\u201d Hero glanced at Mandeville curiously. This might be the most personal interest he\u2019d ever shown in her. \u201cYour mother told you before she left?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and he helped her into his open carriage. \u201cMy mother loves a wedding. You should\u2019ve seen the flurry she was in when Caroline was married. I think her only disappointment now is that a son does not require a trousseau.\u201d</p><p>Hero glanced at her hands folded in her lap and hid a smile at the thought of Mandeville being outfitted in new stockings and chemises. \u201cI quite like your mother. She\u2019s been a great help with the wedding plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy to hear it.\u201d He concentrated on the ribbons for a moment, guiding his lovely matched bays into the crowded London street.</p><p>Hero tilted her face up surreptitiously. The sun was out today, a welcome last stand of autumn. The London traffic ebbed and flowed around the carriage in a giant stream. A heavy miller\u2019s cart trudged along ahead of them, and sedan chairmen deftly wove in and out of slower pedestrians, their passengers jogging along in upright boxes. A few soldiers on horses clattered by, ignoring the shouted insults of a pair of butcher\u2019s boys who\u2019d been splattered by the horses\u2019 hooves. A single tattered woman bawled a song by the side of the road, her two children at her feet with hands outstretched.</p><p>\u201cShe likes you, you know,\u201d Mandeville said.</p> <p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He slapped the reins as the carriage cleared the miller\u2019s cart, and the horses stepped into a trot. \u201cShe has a dowager house, naturally, but I find it\u2019s easier if the two of you get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hero murmured. She straightened the edge of her glove. \u201cDid she like your first wife?\u201d</p><p>Mandeville glanced at her warily. \u201cYou mean Anne?\u201d</p><p>Was it such an odd question? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, returning his gaze to the horses. \u201cMother manages to get along with nearly everyone, it seems. She never showed any outward dislike or disapproval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she show any approval, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She watched him for a moment as he handled the reins with expert ease. He was a private man, she knew, but in only weeks they would be man and wife. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>He flinched as if she\u2019d said something obscene. \u201cMy dear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s none of my business,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut you never speak of her to me. I just would like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He was silent a moment, a slight frown between his eyebrows. \u201cThen I shall endeavor to assuage your curiosity. I was... fond of Anne and quite sad when she died, but I hold no disappointed love for her. You need have no worries there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd Reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve heard the rumors,\u201d Hero said carefully. She remembered Reading\u2019s own reply on the matter when she pressed him about whether he\u2019d seduced his brother\u2019s wife. No, God, no. \u201cDo you truly believe your brother could\u2019ve betrayed you so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to believe,\u201d he said very drily. \u201cAnne herself told me.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>THOMAS WATCHED HIS fianc\u00e9e\u2019s delicately curved eyebrows arch in surprise and felt irritation crawl under his skin. What had she thought? That he\u2019d harbored some insane suspicion without any evidence?</p><p>And why the hell was she quizzing him anyway?</p><p>He faced forward again, guiding the bays around a shepherd with a herd of sheep milling in the middle of the road. They were nearing Hyde Park, and he longed for the open air. Wished he could give the bays their heads and let them run wildly down the lane.</p><p>Hardly a fitting activity for a marquess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lady Hero murmured beside him, quietly contrite.</p><p>Well, even the most perfect of women became emotional once in a while. They could hardly help it, made the way they were. Anne had been a mercurial creature. Lavinia was passionate, but more controlled. In comparison to them, Hero was a model of restraint, really.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt was a long time ago in any case. I cannot ever forgive Griffin, but I can certainly try and lay the matter aside and go on. As I\u2019ve said, you needn\u2019t worry about what happened in my marriage to Anne. It\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he tried to remember what Anne had looked like that terrible night. She\u2019d been hysterical, weeping as she tried to push her poor, dead babe from her body. At one time he\u2019d thought the sights and sounds of that night would be engraved in his nightmares for the rest of his life. But now all he could remember was the still, gray body of the baby, its features curiously flattened, and the thought that all of the blood and hysteria hadn\u2019t mattered anyway. The child had been a girl.</p><p>A tiny, dead girl.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Lady Hero said beside him.</p><p>Thank God the gates of the park were within sight. He hated thoughts like these, useless and dispiriting. Ones that challenged his authority and his place in the universe: A marquess should not have to hear the dying confession of infidelity from his wife. Should not have to see the dead body of his baby girl.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t discuss this again,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve had your questions answered.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but then she didn\u2019t have to. Naturally she would acquiesce to his wishes. It occurred to him that Lavinia would\u2019ve kept arguing the point. Odd thought\u2014and hardly helpful. He endeavored to put it from his mind.</p><p>The park was crowded today, the fine weather drawing out all walks of society. He guided the bays into the slowly moving line of carriages and horses revolving about one end of Hyde Park.</p><p>\u201cI saw Wakefield yesterday,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Her voice seemed a little cool, but then she was probably distracted by the passing parade.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. He tells me that there is a possibility that he soon will have a titled gin distiller in his grasp.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened beside him. Many women found political talk dreary, but he\u2019d thought her more tolerant than most. After all, she was sister to one of the foremost parliamentarians of the day. And of course she knew of his own political ambitions.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who?\u201d she asked, calming his sudden worry.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said. Most likely keeping the matter under his hat until he\u2019s certain. Your brother is a dark horse. Ah, there\u2019s Fergus.\u201d Thomas nodded to Lord Fergus sitting with his rather plain-faced wife. Behind them sat their two daughters, also, alas, plain-faced. \u201cHe\u2019s in the naval department,\u201d he murmured sotto voce as he pulled the bays alongside the Fergus carriage.</p><p>And then he was proud, for Lady Hero graciously nodded at the introduction of the ladies and then complimented Lady Fergus on her bonnet, prompting the lady\u2019s sallow complexion to turn pink. The two girls leaned slightly forward, and all four were soon in animated discussion.</p><p>\u201cA good match, Mandeville,\u201d Fergus rumbled after they\u2019d discussed the latest Lords scandal. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, indeed,\u201d Thomas murmured.</p><p>His recent ridiculous doubts fled. Lady Hero was above all a calm and demure creature, not given to the type of awful drama Anne often acted out.</p><p>Fergus nattered on for another ten minutes\u2014the man was prone to be didactic\u2014and then they made their farewells.</p><p>Thomas took up the reins again. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t find talking to Lady Fergus and her daughters too boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Lady Hero replied. \u201cThey were quite nice. Besides, I know how important these kinds of little meetings are for you and your career, Mandeville. I want to do everything I can to aid you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI keep forgetting that your perception rivals your beauty, my lady. I am indeed a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t all ladies wish to be flattered?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer and he glanced her way. Lady Hero\u2019s face was in profile as she looked fixedly to the side. He followed her gaze and felt as if he\u2019d been struck in the belly.</p><p>Lavinia Tate was two carriages over, laughing up into the face of that Samuel fellow who\u2019d escorted her to Harte\u2019s Folly. She wore a quilted jacket the color of spring poppies, and the sunlight glinted off her damnably bright red hair. If any man in Hyde Park hadn\u2019t noticed her yet, it was because he was dead.</p><p>Or a fool.</p><p>\u201cWho is she to you?\u201d Lady Hero asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Thomas said through stiff lips.</p><p>\u201cYet you stare at her as if she\u2019s someone very important indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He tore his eyes from the sight of Lavinia and looked at his fianc\u00e9e, her face too pale, her hair merely a tasteful, natural shade of light copper. She was a watercolor next to Lavinia\u2019s vivid oil. \u201cShe\u2019s... someone I once knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou no longer know her?\u201d Lady Hero tilted her head in gentle inquiry.</p><p>Lavinia\u2019s laugh floated on the autumn breeze.</p><p>Thomas wanted suddenly to shout at Lady Hero, to make that gentle expression fall from her face, to shake her until she quit her questions and her perceptive looks, and then he wanted to jump from the carriage and plant a facer in that stupid young buck with Lavinia.</p><p>But he did none of that, of course. Gentlemen of his rank never acted in such a way. Instead, he merely urged the horses on, waiting interminably to pass Lavinia\u2019s carriage.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in my past,\u201d he said through cold lips. \u201cI met her when I was rather down, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>He remembered when he was the man who she laughed up at, the way it had made his chest swell. And he remembered the sight of her in the morning light, so carnal, so wise. He\u2019d been able to see every single line in her face, the slight sag to her breasts, and strangely it hadn\u2019t made a whit of difference. She\u2019d been the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Would ever see.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s in the past now. We\u2019ll not talk of it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed beside him, the sound sad and somehow lonely. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right. It\u2019s best to put aside what might have come before. Our future together should be what we focus on.\u201d</p><p>She laid a gloved hand on his elbow, slim and comfortable. \u201cWe\u2019ll make an admirable pair, you and I, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>He was able to summon a smile to give her. \u201cYes. Yes, we will.\u201d</p><p>And then they were finally past Lavinia Tate.</p><p>WESLEY WAS PUTTING the finishing touches on Hero\u2019s toilet the next morning when Phoebe burst in the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hero started to open her mouth to ask what she\u2019d never guess, but Phoebe continued in a rush. \u201cLord Griffin and Lady Margaret have called and asked to take us shopping!\u201d</p><p>For a split second, Hero\u2019s heart leaped at the thought of him. But then her practical side asserted itself.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear.\u201d Hero winced at the excited look on Phoebe\u2019s face. Her entire countenance seemed to glow. \u201cYou know that Bathilda doesn\u2019t want me to be seen with Reading. And after bringing him back to luncheon the other day...\u201d</p><p>The light went out in Phoebe\u2019s face. \u201cBut I cannot go alone with them.\u201d</p> <p>No, she certainly couldn\u2019t, and Reading was well aware of the fact, Hero thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Hero?\u201d</p><p>Hero closed her eyes.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t shut out Phoebe\u2019s voice. \u201cPleeease?\u201d</p><p>Hero\u2019s eyes snapped open. \u201cFine. But only for an hour or so, no more.\u201d</p> <p>She needn\u2019t have bothered with caveats\u2014Phoebe was already hopping up and down with excitement.</p><p>Hero sighed, knowing already that this was a very bad idea. Still, she had to struggle to contain a smile as she descended the stairs after Phoebe.</p><p>Reading waited below, looking quite respectable in a dark blue coat and breeches. He smiled as Phoebe bounced up to him, but his eyes were on Hero.</p><p>She fought not to blush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you could join us, Lady Hero,\u201d he said as he escorted them out the door.</p><p>She shot him a sharp glance, watching for irony, but he seemed perfectly serious. \u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened mockingly at her. \u201cIn the carriage.\u201d</p><p>And indeed when they entered the carriage, there was Lady Margaret already waiting.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad you could come on such short notice!\u201d she exclaimed as they settled on the cushions. \u201cI feel we ought to get to know one another since you\u2019re marrying my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hero murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon be sisters, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Reading\u2019s face went blank as he turned to the window.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Lady Margaret said. \u201cI almost feel as if I know your brother, the duke, better. Thomas talks about him so much, and then they spent all that time last summer drawing up their gin bill. Wakefield\u2019s quite passionate on the subject, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe believes that St. Giles is crime-riddled because of gin,\u201d Phoebe said soberly. \u201cSo by extension he blames our parents\u2019 death on gin.\u201d</p><p>Hero glanced at her sister, a little surprised that she\u2019d gleaned this information from the censored things that Maximus said in front of her.</p> <p>Lady Margaret nodded. \u201cThen I suppose you both are also passionate on the subject.\u201d</p><p>Reading turned to look at Hero, and she tilted her chin up as she answered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ladies can\u2019t make bills in parliament,\u201d Phoebe said, \u201cbut Hero has recently become the patroness of a home for foundling children in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lady Margaret asked. \u201cHow I admire you, Lady Hero. I\u2019ve never done anything so selfless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could.\u201d Phoebe leaned forward in her eagerness. \u201cHero has decided to let other ladies help with the home by donating their money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Reading drawled. \u201cAnd are gentlemen allowed to help, too? Perhaps I shall make a donation.\u201d</p><p>Hero couldn\u2019t quite meet his gaze. He was jesting, of course, but he\u2019d already offered to help her once....</p><p>But before she could say anything, Phoebe leaped in. \u201cIt\u2019s for ladies only, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch discrimination,\u201d Reading murmured.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen always want to run things,\u201d Hero shot back.</p><p>Reading\u2019s mouth quirked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very true,\u201d Lady Margaret said. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite smart of you to limit your, er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSyndicate,\u201d Phoebe supplied. \u201cIt\u2019s to be called the Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d Lady Margaret enthused. \u201cI think that a ladies-only syndicate is quite a wonderful idea. May I join?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Hero replied as Reading rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cExcept...\u201d Lady Margaret looked suddenly abashed. \u201cI\u2019ve only a bit of pin money to donate. Perhaps it won\u2019t be enough to join?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no lower limit,\u201d Hero said firmly, even as she realized that her syndicate might have to be larger than she\u2019d first envisioned. \u201cAny lady of means who is sincere in her wish to help the orphan children of St. Giles is welcome to join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lovely.\u201d</p><p>Reading smiled and shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re at Bond Street, ladies. Will you come and shop now?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe and Lady Margaret eagerly descended the carriage, and somehow Hero found herself with Reading.</p><p>He bent over her as their sisters walked ahead. \u201cSo you have found a solution to your dilemma over the funds for the home all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe came up with the idea, but yes, I think it a good solution,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d he said unexpectedly. \u201cBrava.\u201d</p><p>His approval sent a warm feeling through her, as if she\u2019d just drunk hot tea on a cold day. Why she should care one way or the other about his feelings on the matter, she did not know, but there it was\u2014she did care.</p><p>\u201cHave you told Thomas yet about your involvement with the home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glanced down guiltily. \u201cI will soon, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI just hope Thomas is as liberal as your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an awful thing to say.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBut true nonetheless. Your activities will reflect upon Thomas, and he has a damnably narrow view of what it means to be the Marquess of Mandeville.\u201d</p><p>She felt a twinge of irritation, though she knew that Reading was but speaking the truth. Mandeville did need to worry about his name\u2014he was a prominent member of parliament. And as his wife, she would be under scrutiny. Still...\u201cI can\u2019t think being the patroness of a home for foundling children can be considered so very risqu\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but gallivanting about St. Giles is.\u201d He escorted her around a group of ladies gathered about a window display. \u201cHe\u2019ll want you to stop once you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she insisted stubbornly. \u201cBesides, I can\u2019t think what business it is of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d He turned and suddenly his green eyes met hers. The street, the crowds, seemed to fall away, and she could hear the echo of her heartbeat in her ears.</p><p>Hero inhaled, tearing her gaze from his. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. Besides, it\u2019s natural for Mandeville to want to protect his wife. You must understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust I?\u201d He shook his head, his mouth twisting. \u201cI only understand that I prefer birdsong from the meadow instead of a cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? Have you ever thought of the bird?\u201d she asked too quietly, too intensely. Suddenly they were no longer speaking of birds. \u201cPerhaps she feels safer knowing that someone is looking after her in her cage. Perhaps she fears the wide-open space with no one to guard her.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he was silent; then Reading said low, \u201cHow does the bird know she hates the freedom of the meadow if she\u2019s never felt it?\u201d</p><p>His green eyes were locked with hers, and she couldn\u2019t look away. Her breath was caught in her chest, and she longed to simply do as he suggested, to fly free, but she couldn\u2019t... she simply couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d Lady Margaret called ahead of them, gesturing to a pretty little shop.</p><p>The shop turned out to be a milliner\u2019s where Phoebe found a lovely length of Belgian lace. Afterward, Reading bought them all buns and tea and then insisted they visit a bookstore. Phoebe and Lady Margaret made for a display of beautifully illustrated books on botany while Reading drew Hero aside toward a small shelf of books in Greek and Latin.</p><p>\u201cThey have some interesting books here,\u201d he said, taking down a tome of plays. \u201cHave you read Aristophanes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she murmured, even as she took the book from his hands. She fingered the leather spine.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cIt\u2019s merely a book of plays, a bit scandalous in parts, granted, but nothing to tempt you into sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a book of plays,\u201d she said, still holding the book. \u201cNot history like Thucydides and Herodotus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d His eyebrows rose up his forehead.</p><p>\u201cSo it isn\u2019t serious.\u201d She placed the book carefully back on the shelf. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to occupy my mind with more important matters than comedic plays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuty to whom?\u201d he began rather heatedly, but suddenly there was a cry and a thump from behind him.</p><p>Hero looked and saw Phoebe crumpled in a heap at the bottom of a short series of steps. \u201cOh, dear God!\u201d</p><p>She hurried over with Reading.</p><p>Phoebe\u2019s face was chalk-white, and Lady Margaret, though standing by her, did not look much better.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Reading barked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lady Margaret said. \u201cShe must\u2019ve tripped on the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see them,\u201d Phoebe said through pale lips. \u201cI was walking to another bookshelf, and the stairs just came up in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Reading glanced at her sharply before bending and asking, \u201cCan you stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading, her forehead,\u201d Hero said. There was a line of blood dripping down the side of Phoebe\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve bumped it.\u201d Reading touched Phoebe\u2019s hair gently.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d Phoebe began to raise her right arm and then inhaled sharply, her face turning a ghastly green. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Hero asked.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s broken her arm,\u201d Reading said. \u201cNo, don\u2019t touch it. Let me.\u201d With one athletic movement, he gathered Phoebe into his arms and rose. \u201cI\u2019ll carry her back to the carriage, and once we\u2019ve got her home, we\u2019ll send for a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Hero began, but Reading was already striding out the shop door.</p><p>She and Lady Margaret trotted to keep up, and they were soon at the carriage. The ride home was an awful journey, each bump causing Phoebe pain. Reading sat beside her, trying to brace her against the worst jostling, his mouth white-rimmed. As soon as they were at the house, Bathilda came out and began efficiently ordering maids and footmen about. Phoebe was carried into the house, and Hero was about to follow her when a restraining hand was laid upon her arm.</p><p>She turned and looked up into Reading\u2019s angry face. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she have better spectacles? It\u2019s obvious she can\u2019t see with the ones she has\u2014she didn\u2019t see the steps! You need to consult an expert.\u201d</p><p>Hero closed her eyes, waiting for self-righteous anger to meet his, but all she felt was a deep, despairing sorrow.</p><p>\u201cHero?\u201d he asked, squeezing her arm.</p><p>\u201cWe have consulted the experts,\u201d Hero said wearily. \u201cSome from as far away as Prussia. Ever since a year ago when we realized her eyesight was poor, she\u2019s been prodded and poked and any number of \u2018cures\u2019 tried upon her.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>She blinked back tears, trying to smile and failing miserably. \u201cAnd none of them has worked. Phoebe is going blind.\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>IT WAS PAST midnight by the time Griffin entered St. Giles that night, and those who were easy prey were already scurrying to ground. He\u2019d not seen hide nor hair of the Vicar\u2019s men in the nights since Reese\u2019s body had been thrown over the wall. Maybe the man had lost interest in this part of London. Maybe the talk that the Vicar was going to attack again was simply rumors. Maybe the man was dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe, but Griffin wasn\u2019t counting on it. He rode with his eyes alert, one hand on the loaded gun in his saddle. The Vicar had been known to demonstrate patience when he was after something he wanted. And it appeared he wanted Griffin\u2019s still very much.</p><p>A shadow moved to his right, slipping from a doorway, and Griffin pulled one of the pistols from the saddle. He turned, raising the pistol, and then he blinked at what he saw. A man in some sort of close-fitting costume, wearing a short cape and an extravagantly plumed hat. The apparition bowed slightly, flourishing his hat, and then leaped and swarmed straight up a house wall, disappearing onto the roof.</p><p>Good God. Griffin looked up but caught no sight of the Ghost of St. Giles\u2014for it must be he. The apparition had been wearing black and red motley. Was the ghost a footpad? But if so, the man had made no move to try and rob him. What exactly was the purpose of the ghost\u2019s wanderings? Griffin shook his head and kneed Rambler into motion again. Too bad he couldn\u2019t tell Megs of his sighting\u2014she\u2019d be all agog.</p><p>It was full dark by the time Griffin arrived at the distillery. He pounded on the gate and waited for what seemed like an overlong time for an answer, his back crawling all the time at the knowledge of how exposed he was. When Nick Barnes finally opened the door, Griffin felt his nerves tighten. Nick\u2019s face was grim.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Griffin asked as he dismounted inside the courtyard wall. He took the two loaded pistols from the saddle and shoved them in a wide leather belt he had strapped over his coat.</p><p>\u201cAnother man gone just this morn,\u201d Nick growled. \u201cDon\u2019t know if \u2019e was taken by th\u2019 Vicar or if \u2019e plain ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Griffin pulled off his coat and picked up a shovel to stoke the fires beneath one of the big copper caldrons. This day just kept getting worse and worse. He still saw little Phoebe in his mind\u2019s eye, her face drawn tight by pain, the knowledge that she was losing her sight making him feel helpless. Damn it, a young girl like her shouldn\u2019t have to go blind. God shouldn\u2019t let it happen.</p><p>When Griffin looked up again, he saw Nick was staring at him thoughtfully. \u201cBad business.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grunted and pushed a shovelful of coal into the fire.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll not last long like this,\u201d Nick said quietly.</p><p>Griffin looked around, but none of the men were close enough to overhear. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that fact. All the Vicar needs to do is pick us off a bit at a time and sit back and wait until I can no longer pay enough to keep the men here.\u201d</p><p>Nick scratched his chin. \u201cIs it worth it, is what I\u2019m a-wondering? You\u2019s got a bit put by, I knows. Per\u2019aps it\u2019s time to quit. Give up the stills and find some other way to make a shillin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Griffin turned and glared at him.</p><p>Nick shrugged imperturbably. \u201cThen maybe we should do something a bit more activelike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Griffin bent and shoveled more coal.</p> <p>He knew what Nick was getting at: an attack of their own. This had started as a simple business\u2014never respectable, of course, but a business nevertheless. When had it descended into warfare? Maybe it was time to give up this illicit means of making money, but what else did he have? Land that his farmers labored to get a stingy crop from. How else could he turn his grain to money?</p><p>Nick watched him shovel coal silently for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI seen that lady what came with you th\u2019 other day,\u201d Nick said chattily after a bit.</p><p>Griffin straightened and propped an elbow on his shovel, raising an eyebrow. Nick didn\u2019t chat.</p><p>Nick pursed his lips\u2014not a pleasant sight. \u201cSeemed a mite put out, she did. Something you said, maybe, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t approve of gin distilling,\u201d Griffin said flatly.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Nick rocked back on his heels. \u201cNot a proper occupation for toffs, I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Griffin winced and rubbed the nape of his neck. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not entirely correct. She champions a foundling home in St. Giles. She thinks gin is the reason there\u2019s so many orphans. It\u2019s the root of every evil in London as far as she\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe \u2019Ome for Unfortunate Infants and Foundlin\u2019 Childr\u2019n.\u201d</p><p>Griffin glanced at him, surprised. \u201cYou know of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Ard not to, livin\u2019 in these parts.\u201d Nick tipped back his head to stare at the shadowed ceiling of the warehouse. \u201cA good place, is what I \u2019ear. Not like those what sell the mites into bad apprenticeships. Pity the \u2019ouse burned last winter.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grunted. \u201cShe\u2019s having it rebuilt. Bigger and grander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a right angel of good will, she does.\u201d</p><p>Griffin stared at him, suspicious of mockery.</p><p>Nick looked innocent. \u201cMakes one wonder what she was doin\u2019 wi\u2019 you, don\u2019t it, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s affianced to my brother.\u201d Griffin shoveled in more coal, though the fire was well enough stoked now.</p><p>\u201cOh, then she \u2019as but a sisterly interest in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d Griffin growled in warning.</p><p>But Nick was never the type to be cowed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the saintly ones, I find, that needs watchin\u2019,\u201d he mused. \u201cNow, whores, they be simple\u2014fuck \u2019em an\u2019 pay \u2019em. No problems, everything nice an\u2019 tidy an\u2019 never a thought afterward. But with a respectable woman, why there\u2019s talk an\u2019 feelings an\u2019 suchlike. Trouble, the lot of them. Not, mind you, that it\u2019s not worth it in the end, just that there\u2019s a bit of worry up front. A man best be warned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d Griffin said slowly, \u201care you giving me romantic advice?\u201d</p><p>Nick pushed his hat to the back of his head so he could scratch his scalp. \u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grunted. \u201cShe\u2019s soon to be my sister-in-law anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019 course, o\u2019 course,\u201d Nick murmured.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at all convinced by the reminder.</p><p>Griffin wasn\u2019t sure he was convinced himself. He sighed and threw aside the shovel. \u201cDo you remember when we first started this all those years ago?\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cThat little still on Tipping Lane? You were a right green \u2019un then, m\u2019lord. Suspicious, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I could trust you.\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned. \u201cNor I you. You was this toff down from that fancy school, all lace and fripperies. Weren\u2019t sure as you\u2019d last a week.\u201d</p><p>Griffin snorted. He\u2019d met Nick in a seedy Seven Dials tavern\u2014not the place one usually found business partners. But something about the glaring former boxer had struck him as essentially honest. Nick had been the one to introduce him to the man he\u2019d bought his first still from. The thing had been rickety in the extreme.</p><p>\u201cRemember when we thought the still would blow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Nick spat into the straw. \u201cWhich time? I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 of more \u2019n one.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grinned and looked around the warehouse. It was a far cry from that small single still on Tipping Lane. It had taken years to build his business to this point, to be where he didn\u2019t have to lie awake at night worrying over money flow and harvests. To where he could tell his mother to plan for Megs\u2019s next season and be fairly sure they\u2019d actually be able to afford it. He only needed a little more time to get entirely financially stable.</p><p>\u201cWe worked hard to get here, didn\u2019t we?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I\u2019ll let the Vicar take it from me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that.\u201d Nick dug a short clay pipe from his waistcoat. He took a moment to light it with a straw stuck in the still fire. Then he said, \u201c \u2019Ave you ever thought of doin\u2019 somethin\u2019 else?\u201d</p><p>Griffin looked at him in surprise. \u201cNo. I suppose I\u2019ve never had time to think of finding other business. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nick scratched the back of his head. \u201cWell, not rightly. Me father was a weaver, but I never learned the craft. Seemed a tedious task when I were young, an\u2019 now I\u2019m too old a dog for learnin\u2019 new tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeaving.\u201d Griffin thought of the Mandeville lands in Lancashire. They\u2019d always been too rocky for growing grain. Many of their neighbors had put in sheep for wool and meat.</p><p>\u201cMam and me sisters spun the thread for Pa,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI did, too, when I were a lad.\u201d</p><p>Griffin smiled at the thought of Nick spinning thread with his great hamlike hands.</p><p>A shout came from behind them. Griffin whirled, snatching a pistol from his belt. Smoke was pouring out from one of the big chimneys that climbed the outer walls. The men were milling, coughing from the rolling black smoke.</p><p>Nick swore foully. \u201cThey\u2019ve stopped th\u2019 chimney from without!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut out the fire!\u201d Griffin shouted. \u201cI\u2019ll guard the walls.\u201d</p><p>He gestured to the men, slapping his hands on the backs of those turned away, and ran to the warehouse entrance. Griffin slammed himself against the wall next to the door and shoved it open a crack with one foot. The guards outside were wrestling with attackers next to the walls. Already three men were past them and into the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming in,\u201d he told his men. \u201cMake damn sure they don\u2019t get to the warehouse.\u201d</p><p>And with that he kicked the door wide and drew his other pistol, firing both straight-armed. One attacker went down, crashing to the cobblestones. More shots exploded from his men\u2019s guns, and the second man went down. But one man still rushed the door while others were overwhelming the courtyard guards. In a corner of the courtyard, Rambler squealed and reared in terror.</p><p>\u201cGet them!\u201d Griffin shouted, his words sounding muffled to his own ears.</p><p>His men flew past him toward the walls. He threw down one pistol and drew his sword to meet an attacker. The man was short but burly, and he held a huge cutlass in his hand. The attacker swung and Griffin dodged. He was afraid his thinner sword would break under the cutlass. He slid closer while the man was still turned aside from the force of his own blow and stabbed him under the arm through the armpit. The man didn\u2019t even flinch. He struck at Griffin with his other hand, a blow Griffin was just able to duck, taking it on his shoulder instead of his face, his hand still on the sword stuck in the man\u2019s body. The man raised his cutlass again, but then staggered. He crumpled all at once, like a marionette whose strings had been cut.</p><p>Griffin stuck his foot on the man\u2019s chest and pulled his sword from the attacker\u2019s body. He turned toward the wall, sword ready, but there was no need. Four bodies lay on the cobblestones and a man\u2014one of his own\u2014was sitting with his back against the wall, moaning. All the other attackers had retreated.</p><p>The skirmish was over\u2014at least for now.</p><p>\u201cGet him inside.\u201d Griffin gestured at the moaning man. \u201cYou others stay and guard the courtyard from further attack.\u201d</p><p>He left eight men guarding the walls and turned back to the warehouse. Rambler still snorted and shook where he was tethered in a corner.</p><p>Griffin went to him and placed a hand on the gelding\u2019s sweaty neck. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, lad. All right now.\u201d</p><p>The horse rolled his eyes at him.</p><p>Griffin spoke quietly to him for a few more minutes and then filled a nosebag from the saddle with a handful of oats. He left Rambler contentedly munching and strode to the warehouse. Smoke still slipped from the doorway, drifting into the night, but it was thinner now. He picked up the pistol he\u2019d thrown down and ducked inside.</p><p>It was dim, the smoke swirling about the ceiling. Griffin squinted against stinging ash.</p><p>Nick loomed out of the dark like Satan himself, his face blackened. \u201cWe got it out, sure enough, but we can\u2019t work the still on that \u2019earth now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Griffin nodded. \u201cWe need guards on the roof.\u201d</p><p>Nick cocked an eyebrow, looking positively evil. \u201cAnd \u2019ow will we get men for that duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay them triple,\u201d Griffin said grimly.</p><p>\u201cAt some point you\u2019ll be paying more than you\u2019re makin\u2019,\u201d Nick warned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that fact.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and turned to look back at the wreckage of the blocked chimney. \u201cCould\u2019ve been worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tried to block another of the chimneys, but the wad fell through. Merely made a smokin\u2019 mess on the fire.\u201d He looked back at Griffin. \u201cWe got it out well enough.\u201d</p><p>Griffin sat on a barrel wearily and began reloading his pistols from a sack of powder and balls. \u201cThis time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d Nick grunted, and turned to the chimneys, his words drifting back over his shoulder. \u201cJust pray our luck \u2019olds out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The next day, the queen called for her horse and assembled the princes so they might go hunting with falcons. And as they sat mounted in the stable yard, she turned to her suitors and asked, \u201cWhat is the strongest thing in my kingdom?\u201d Then she rode out of the stable yard without a backward glance.</p><p>Well, the princes wore looks of consternation as they followed the queen to the hunt, but the stable master only nodded his head thoughtfully....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>It was midmorning by the time Griffin arrived home from St. Giles. He wearily dismounted Rambler outside his town house and gave the reins to a stable lad.</p> <p>\u201cSee he\u2019s rubbed down well and given some oats,\u201d he instructed the boy.</p><p>With a last pat for Rambler, he climbed the front steps of his town house and let himself in. He kept only a small staff at his London residence since he did no entertaining here. A cook, a few maids, a bootblack boy, and Deedle were quite sufficient for his needs. The price for such laxity, however, was that there was often no one to meet him at his own door.</p><p>Griffin threw his hat at a hall table and didn\u2019t bother to pick it up when it fell to the floor. He began climbing the stairs. God, he ached like an old man. Another night awake was added to the fight and the ride to and from St. Giles. Now all he wanted was a hot bath and bed. Not necessarily in that order.</p><p>But Deedle knew well his master\u2019s ways.</p><p>The manservant poked his head out of Griffin\u2019s room as soon as he heard his steps in the upper hall. \u201cI\u2019ve got the water boiling, m\u2019lord. We\u2019ll \u2019ave a bath ready in two ticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless you, man,\u201d Griffin said. He sat upon his bed and began drawing off his boots as the maids hurried in with steaming kettles.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Griffin winced and then sighed as he lowered himself into a tub of hot water.</p><p>Deedle fussed about for a moment, putting clothes away. Then he picked up Griffin\u2019s muddy boots. \u201cI\u2019ll take these down to the boy, shall I?\u201d</p> <p>Griffin, eyes closed, waved a hand.</p><p>The door shut behind the valet.</p><p>He\u2019d already soaped the smoke from his head and body, but the rising steam was wonderful. Griffin lay there, soaking, and let his mind drift. He\u2019d left orders for Nick to find more men\u2014if there were some to be had at any price. The Vicar wasn\u2019t just targeting Griffin\u2019s stills. Overnight there\u2019d been news of two different fires destroying other gin makers. At least one man was dead in the flames. Could he keep his business going?</p><p>Griffin snorted softly. Lady Hero would certainly be happy if he went under. One less gin maker among hundreds\u2014if not thousands\u2014in St. Giles. But then maybe she was right to disapprove of his business.</p><p>The thought of her disapproval brought other thoughts of her as well. He remembered the little line that knit itself between her delicately arced brows when she lectured him. The way her pale rose lips softened when she listened to his response. And how her lashes had drifted closed when he\u2019d kissed her neck.</p><p>Griffin groaned and his hand drifted along his thigh to his cock, already half erect. He brought up images of those sweet little breasts, the red nipples large in contrast and somehow unbearably erotic. They\u2019d been drawn hard and tight for him, and he imagined biting gently down on them. He could almost hear the moan she\u2019d make at his touch.</p><p>He grasped his cock in his hand, pulling up, feeling his own hardness, the exquisite sensitivity at the tip.</p><p>He\u2019d draw the laces from her stays, bare her fully for his own enjoyment. And under her skirts, there lay that sweet, warm, wet\u2014</p><p>Downstairs, someone began pounding on his front door.</p><p>Griffin groaned. Surely there was someone to answer it. He didn\u2019t have many servants, but he did have enough to answer a bloody door. Or perhaps the caller would give up.</p><p>But the knocking continued.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he spat, letting go of his now-rigid cock. The visitor might be Nick Barnes with more news.</p><p>Griffin climbed from the tub, splashing water on the rug, then swiped a towel across his body and pulled on breeches and a shirt. He ran down the stairs barefoot and stomped across the hall floor to fling open the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He found himself glaring into Lady Hero\u2019s startled gray eyes. She glanced down the length of him, making him very aware of the damp shirt clinging to his chest and the breeches covering his half-aroused state.</p><p>Her gaze snapped back up to his. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d she said low. \u201cI\u2019d heard reports this morning of a gin still burning in St. Giles. They said a man was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said, not very graciously.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cMight I come in?\u201d</p><p>He looked up and down the street. No one appeared to be paying attention to them. He reached out, wrapped his fingers around her upper arm, and yanked her inside his house.</p><p>Lady Hero stumbled in with a squeak. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to salvage your reputation,\u201d Griffin muttered. He turned and stomped into the library without bothering to see if she\u2019d follow. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing visiting a bachelor\u2019s residence\u2014unaccompanied\u2014in the middle of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure you were all right,\u201d she said from behind him. \u201cAnd I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grunted. The damned woman no doubt wanted to continue her harangue about the still. He picked up a decanter of brandy and splashed some into a glass. He turned with the glass in his hand and found her frowning at the scatter of papers on his desk. Probably disapproved of the mess.</p><p>He tossed back some of the brandy. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She turned, still frowning. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>He gestured with the glass, spilling some of the brandy onto the floor. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips in a fussy little moue that only served to draw attention to her mouth. He had a sudden image of her mouth pursed and filled. His cock, ever at the ready, came to full, raging arousal.</p><p>Griffin slammed back the rest of the brandy.</p><p>She opened that luscious mouth. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you wanted to chat about the weather?\u201d Griffin said silkily. He refilled his glass. \u201cThat would be an appropriate topic of discussion for an early morning call.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a finger to stop her and took another gulp of brandy. It burned going down, but his shoulder, which had been aching from this morning\u2019s fight, began to loosen.</p><p>\u201cShould you be drinking so much before noon?\u201d she asked disapprovingly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He glared and took another sip to prove his point. \u201cI always drink when I\u2019m half dressed and entertaining ladies.\u201d</p><p>She flushed a becoming pink. \u201cPerhaps I should come back another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d He set down the glass with a crack and stalked toward her. \u201cYou\u2019ve interrupted my bath, interrupted my quite pleasurable pursuits there, in fact. You might as well tell me what you want to say.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, mute.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you wanted to take me to task for my gin-making ways yet again, hmm?\u201d He leaned over her, not caring if he intimidated or even frightened her. \u201cOr chide me for fucking too much.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the word but stood her ground bravely.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes viciously. How dare she stand there like a martyr when he ached\u2014literally ached\u2014for her? He snapped his fingers as if remembering something. \u201cBut you can\u2019t chide me for seduction when you\u2019ve fallen victim to my lewd advances yourself, can you? Not so saintly now, are you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and he thought he saw a shimmer that might\u2019ve been tears. He wouldn\u2019t give ground now. Not when he might finally drive her out of his house, out of his life, and out from under his skin.</p><p>Griffin bent and murmured in her ear, \u201cBut perhaps that\u2019s what you really came here to discuss\u2014seduction. Perhaps all that stuff about gin making was merely an excuse you seized upon to come see me. Perhaps you want me to kiss more than your sweet breasts this time.\u201d</p><p>HE\u2019D TAUNTED HER, baited her, argued with her, and made her feel far more than she should. And now he loomed over her, clearly trying to scare her away.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t frightened.</p><p>Lord Reading\u2019s warm breath washed over her bare neck, scented with brandy, and his wicked words sparked something deep within her. It might be\u2014definitely should be\u2014shame, but she very much feared it was something else entirely.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he purred. \u201cMy hand on your belly? Stroking down until my fingers tangle in your maidenhair? I\u2019d wager it\u2019s as soft as a kitten\u2019s fur, your hair down there.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a shuddering breath, pressing one hand to her stomach. He shouldn\u2019t say these things. She should make him stop. She should leave. Except... except she wanted with all her heart to stay. To meet him on equal ground\u2014just this once.</p><p>To be a woman to his man.</p><p>He didn\u2019t touch her, simply stood over her too close and whispering those shameful, shocking, seductive words. \u201cBut what\u2019s below is even softer, isn\u2019t it? Your sweet petals, all wet and silky, blooming open for me. I\u2019d find your secret bud hidden in among them, and I\u2019d circle it just so. Never hard enough to hurt you\u2014oh, no, I\u2019d not hurt you\u2014but not so soft that you couldn\u2019t feel it. For I want you to feel it, Hero. I want you to feel me.\u201d</p><p>She moaned, and she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014didn\u2019t want to help it anymore. She turned her head toward him. His face was inches from hers. His eyes were a pale, implacable green, arrogant and sinful. If that was all she saw in his gaze, she would\u2019ve walked from the room.</p><p>It was the hint of vulnerability that made her stay.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his lips. They were curled in a sneer, but the lower one was still wet from the brandy. The sight sent a rush of warmth low in her belly. \u201cGriffin.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and muttered something vile under his breath. Then she was caught in his arms, not gently at all, and his mouth was on hers, wild and needy.</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he muttered as his lips feasted on hers. \u201cHero.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seemed to have let slip some essential control. His movements were jerky and ungraceful, starkly primitive in their intent. He knocked her hat to the floor. His mouth bit along her jaw and down her neck as he grappled with her wrap, tearing it from her arms. He swore and lifted his head, staring down as he got her bodice off and began rapidly unlacing her stays.</p><p>She should be horrified. Frightened and appalled, but instead his savagery seemed to feed some need within herself. Her hands were helping his; she was stripping the clothing from her limbs as fast as he. The room was hot, her breath was coming in gasps, and the scent of brandy and need filled her nostrils, making her feel faint. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her skirts suddenly dropped, and then she stood in only her chemise, stockings, and shoes.</p><p>He blinked, his eyelids dropping to half-mast as his movements suddenly stilled. For an awful moment, she feared he might come to his senses and stop.</p><p>Instead he slowly moved his hand to the chemise\u2019s edge at her shoulder. He fingered the fine material gently, his gaze locking with hers. Then, his green eyes holding hers, he twisted his fingers in the fabric and pulled sharply downward. A seam ripped, something gave way, and he tore the fragile fabric from her body.</p><p>She gasped, shocked, standing there nude before him. She\u2019d never revealed herself to a man. She was aware of her nipples, pointed and red in the chill air of the room, and the knobbiness of her knees. Except\u2014dear Lord!\u2014he wasn\u2019t looking at her knees. Her chest heaved and his eyes rose to her breasts. His mouth twisted in a smile. Before she\u2019d even completed the thought, his hands flashed out to shackle her wrists.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head slowly, his gaze never leaving her body. \u201cLet me look. Let me feast.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. Her whole body was hot, prickling with sensation, as if his eyes physically touched her. This was almost torture, standing nude before him, letting him look at her without even her hands to cover herself with.</p><p>He chuckled, low and dark, and then, still holding her wrists, he swooped down and covered her right breast with his mouth.</p><p>She jumped and her head fell back helplessly. His mouth was hot, sucking hard on her flesh. She wanted to feel more, she needed more, and her hips of their own accord jerked toward him.</p><p>\u201cOh, not yet,\u201d he whispered over her wet, sensitive nipple. \u201cNot nearly yet. I\u2019ve been thinking of this for a long time.\u201d</p><p>What? she wondered wildly. What could he possibly have been thinking about?</p><p>He sank to his knees before her, and she lifted her heavy head, blinking down curiously at him. What was he...?</p><p>He let go of her wrists to place his hands on her thighs and force her legs farther apart. Her dazed mind stuttered to life. He was too close to her center. He could see and, more importantly, smell everything.</p><p>He lifted one of her legs\u2014her foot still shod in an elegant heeled slipper\u2014and draped it over his shoulder, which placed him squarely underneath her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said frantically. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, and his pale green eyes seemed to glow. \u201cYes. Hold on to the back of the settee, and whatever you do, don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>And then, before she could move or think, he dipped his head forward and licked across her folds.</p><p>She gasped and grabbed wildly for the settee behind her. She\u2019d heard whispers of this, but in no way was she prepared for it. He was kissing\u2014no, worse, licking\u2014her intimate flesh. It was the most extraordinary thing she\u2019d ever experienced in all her life. His tongue was hot and faintly raspy, stroking firmly over and over, burrowing deeper until he did indeed find what he\u2019d called her bud.</p><p>She puffed out air and bit her lip. Her eyes squeezed tight. She mustn\u2019t scream, mustn\u2019t make a sound, but, dear Lord, it was hard not to. He was licking delicately, exquisitely, over and over again. She felt him pull apart her folds with his thumbs, and then he set his mouth directly over her center.</p><p>And sucked.</p><p>She gasped, the sound loud in the room. It was almost painful it was so sweet. She felt tremors rock her legs, and for the life of her she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She peeked.</p><p>His dark, shorn head was between her thighs, his thick lashes shuttered over his eyes as he ministered to her. One brown hand was splayed on her pale hip, the difference in their skin tones in shocking contrast. He was so big, so masculine, and he was servicing her. This must be wrong, must surely be a sin, for it felt too, too good.</p><p>His eyes suddenly flashed open, and he was looking up at her, green eyes intent as he kissed her between her thighs, in that place no one but she had ever touched.</p> <p>The sight was too much. An implosion started at her center, sending out sparkling waves. She bit her lip and shut her eyes, unable to hold his gaze while suffering this final, intimate pleasure. It was shameful. It was wonderful. She shuddered and quaked beneath the shattering release, and she did it all in front of him. She thought he would draw away, but he continued with tiny, intimate kisses, making the aftershocks go on and on until her legs trembled and she feared she would fall.</p><p>Then he was surging up her, catching her about her waist and setting her on the settee. He threw her clothes on top of her, and before she could wonder what he was about, he lifted her high against his chest.</p><p>She clutched at his shoulders as he strode to the library door, and she realized what he meant to do. \u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d he replied.</p><p>She feared servants, but no one was about as he ran across the short hallway and up the stairs. He strode down an upper hall and shouldered open a door at the far end. She just had time to see a full bath, a few crumpled towels, and a huge bed with atrocious flaming orange drapes, and then she was bouncing on the bed.</p><p>Griffin flung her clothes rather cavalierly to the floor, stripped off her slippers, and then stood looking down at her.</p><p>She held her breath, wondering what he expected of her. She\u2019d never done this, hadn\u2019t planned it, and was in no way prepared. She started to prop herself on one elbow, but he slowly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cStay there.\u201d He raised his hands over his shoulders, grasping the back of his shirt. \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>He drew his shirt off over his head and doffed his breeches.</p><p>She\u2019d seen naked males before. Statues, pale and entirely denuded of hair. A few living boys or even young men, their shirts removed for labor.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen this man nude, though. He was brown all over. What she\u2019d taken for skin tanned by the sun was instead naturally olive toned. His shoulders were wide and square, and in contrast to those unliving statues, there was hair upon his body. Sprinkles of it, dark and curling, from one brown nipple to the other, a bare patch between chest and belly and then a gradually widening line of dark hair from his navel to the bush about his genitals. The hair there was thick and black, and his penis rose ruddy and dark from it, a strange, foreign, male thing.</p><p>She looked and looked and felt herself clench internally at the sight, the wonder, of being free to inspect his nude body. She\u2019d held that part of him in her hands, but she\u2019d never seen it. It rose almost vertical to his belly but stood away from his body. Thick veins twined about its length, leading to a fleshy cap, swollen past his foreskin. It gleamed faintly in the candlelight, reddish purple and ready. It was the most magnificent thing she\u2019d ever seen in her life\u2014and the most frightening.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked, grasping himself.</p><p>She watched, mesmerized, as he pulled the skin down the shaft and then up again, cupping the head in his palm. Her eyes rose to his, and she could only speak the truth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A corner of his mouth kicked up, though he looked far from amused. \u201cGood. I\u2019ve heard of virgins running screaming from the sight.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip at the word virgin.</p><p>\u201cYou are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said in a voice that in any other man she might think gentle. \u201cA virgin?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. A virgin. She was about to lose her virginity. This was wrong. This was a sin. This was\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think,\u201d he ordered. He stepped forward to place a knee on the bed, making it dip beneath his weight. \u201cDon\u2019t think, don\u2019t wonder, don\u2019t worry. Only feel.\u201d He lowered himself, his hands on either side of her head, his body suddenly heating hers. \u201cFeel me.\u201d</p><p>And she did. He pressed his legs between hers, widening her thighs until there was a place for his hips, and settled himself on her. She could feel the rough hair of his legs sliding along hers, the hard slab of his belly, and above all, the hot iron rod lying across her mound.</p><p>She looked up at him as he lowered his head toward hers, murmuring, \u201cFeel me.\u201d</p><p>His lips were gentle but not soft. He inserted his tongue into her mouth, and she knew now how to suckle upon it, how to tilt her head so that their mouths fitted together perfectly. His hands were in her hair, pulling pins out, burrowing beneath the tresses to palm her scalp, and she realized suddenly that she could explore as well.</p><p>She lifted her hands along his sides, stroking, touching his warm skin. His back was smooth, a little damp now from his bath or perhaps the heat they made between them. She skated up and felt the muscles of his shoulders move beneath her palms. This was so intimate, so quietly special: to touch a man\u2019s naked back, to feel him as he made love to her.</p><p>He muttered something and lifted away from her, breaking their kiss. He rocked to the side a bit and reached between them. She felt his fingers sliding through her maidenhair. Then he was pushing his penis against her folds, swirling the head in her wetness, pressing against her apex. She watched his face, seeing the grim set of his mouth, the slight furrow between his brows. Sweat shined on his forehead, and it occurred to her that though he\u2019d no doubt done this innumerable times before, he was taking this time very seriously.</p><p>That gave her comfort.</p><p>Then he shifted and looked up, and at the same time she felt the tip of his cock at her entrance.</p><p>She gripped his shoulders in sudden doubt.</p><p>He ducked his head, catching her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t think. Just feel.\u201d</p><p>And he flexed his hips.</p><p>She expected pain, but there was only a strange sort of pinch. She panted, waiting for more\u2014pain or pleasure, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>He slid a little way out and then farther in.</p><p>Her lips parted as she realized that he was not fully sheathed in her.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered against the corner of her mouth.</p><p>He withdrew and shoved again, this time only a little more inside. The pinch had lessened, but the stretching, the pressure was still there, not a painful sensation, but not entirely pleasant either. He shifted then and brought her legs up, wrapping them about his waist. Suddenly there seemed to be more room. He slid partly out, his penis rubbing against her, and then shoved forcefully, his hip bones meeting hers.</p><p>She looked up at him, so full of his flesh. Was this all there was?</p><p>He seemed to understand the question in her eyes. He lay against her, his upper half braced away from her on straight arms. He smiled again, this time rather grimly, and grunted, \u201cFeel.\u201d</p><p>Then he slid against her, his penis slowly pistoning out and into her. She gasped. He did it again, his eyes watching hers, and swiveled his hips, grinding down on her.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d With her hips tilted up, his body was hitting that spot exactly, each pull of his cock adding somehow to the exquisite sensation.</p><p>\u201cFeel, my heart,\u201d he whispered, and she saw that his eyes were glistening. Before she could speak he dipped his head to tongue her nipple.</p><p>She arched helplessly underneath him. His strong body guided and pleasured hers, his hips moving relentlessly, grinding down on that one special spot. It began again, a glistening heat between her legs, growing and spreading outward until she quaked and clutched at his shoulders. There was something else here as well. It was a terrible sorrow, a welling joy, as if all the emotion she\u2019d ever held in check or pushed away was suddenly rising to the surface. She couldn\u2019t control her face, couldn\u2019t control her body. She was coming apart, and she\u2019d never be able to pin herself back together again.</p><p>Griffin was making love to her, and she knew in that moment that this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Here and only here would she ever be truly free. She held him close, terrified he would somehow stop and leave her behind.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. He gently bit down on her nipple and rocked against her faster and faster, sweat gleaming on his neck and on his chest, until she shattered under him. She opened her mouth in a silent scream, and he filled it with his tongue and lips, shuddering into her, continuing his ride, until he suddenly left her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt the splash of warm liquid on her belly and opened her eyes. He was above her, his cock in his hand, his face relaxing from the sexual tension of before.</p><p>It was over. She was no longer a virgin.</p><p>CHARLIE WATCHED AS the dice fell from his fingers. A deuce and a trey. Five could be lucky or not; it just depended on the play.</p><p>\u201cThe attack failed, then.\u201d He knew without looking up that Freddy shifted his weight from one foot to the other.</p> <p>\u201cAye. Three men killed outright and another two injured and lyin\u2019 in bed.\u201d</p><p>Charlie grunted, scooping up the dice. He rolled them between his fingers, the familiar clink of the bones soothing to his ears. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still dealing with the duke\u2019s damned informers.\u201d</p><p>Freddy didn\u2019t answer that, probably because there was no need.</p><p>\u201cBut you say Reading was seen with the duke\u2019s sister?\u201d Charlie asked thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cTwice in St. Giles,\u201d Freddy replied.</p> <p>Charlie nodded, feeling the skin on his cheeks pull as he smiled. \u201cThe duke, the duke. It always comes back to the duke, doesn\u2019t it? The duke and Reading, our dear friend.\u201d</p><p>Freddy licked his lips nervously.</p><p>A thump and a feverish murmur came from overhead.</p><p>Charlie glanced up as if he could see the woman lying above. \u201cHow is she today?\u201d</p><p>Freddy shrugged. \u201cThe nurse says she took some broth this morn.\u201d</p><p>Charlie looked down without comment and threw the dice. They tumbled to the edge of the table, a trey again and a cater\u2014four. Lucky seven. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time we use the duke\u2019s informers to our own end. Perhaps it\u2019s time His Grace learns what Reading really does in St. Giles.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>That night, Queen Ravenhair again called her suitors to her throne room and asked them what their answers were.</p><p>Prince Westmoon snapped his fingers. Instantly a groom led a prancing black stallion into the throne room. Westmoon bowed low. \u201cThis horse is the strongest thing in your kingdom, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Prince Eastsun waved a hand, and a huge warrior marched into the throne room, his chest armored in silver, his sword sheathed in a golden scabbard. \u201cThis man is the strongest thing in your kingdom, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Prince Northwind presented a snowy bullock with gilded horns. \u201cThis bullock is the strongest thing in your kingdom, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>Griffin slumped to the bedsheets, his body slaked. He lay there on his back, an arm over his eyes, his mind entirely blank, and all his muscles in a state of total relaxation. He might as well have been poleaxed.</p><p>Which apparently could not be said of Hero.</p> <p>When the bed shook, he realized that his lover might not be in a similar state of enervated shock.</p><p>Griffin cracked one eyelid and watched, bemused, as Lady Hero jumped from the bed and ducked below the side. She straightened a minute later, trying to struggle into the remains of her chemise.</p><p>He yawned. \u201cI know you\u2019re new to this, sweeting, but the usual thing is to lie about for a bit, perhaps do the thing over again, God and my cock willing. No need to go haring off.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words left his lips, his brain finally\u2014belatedly\u2014roused itself, and he knew, absolutely and fatally, that it was the exact wrong thing to say.</p><p>She gave up on the chemise and bent to pick up her stays. Her face was half averted, but he could see even in profile when her lips thinned. \u201cI must go.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think very well\u2014something more than the ordinary had happened here\u2014but he knew he didn\u2019t want her to go. Griffin scrubbed his hand over his head, trying to find some measure of wakefulness. \u201cHero\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ducked down again.</p><p>He propped himself up and peered over the side of the bed. She knelt, rummaging through her pile of clothes. Her head, even down-bent, did not look welcoming.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cStay a little while and I\u2019ll call for some tea.\u201d</p><p>She stood again, pulling on her petticoats. \u201cI can\u2019t be seen here.\u201d</p><p>He was tempted to ask why she\u2019d bothered to come in the first place, then, but prudence\u2014not usually a virtue of his\u2014stilled his lips. He knew he should talk to her, but he couldn\u2019t think of the words that would persuade her to stay. His head felt thick, filled with dirty lint and smoke left over from the night awake in the warehouse.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared for this, damn it.</p><p>She had on her stays now and was clumsily lacing them. No doubt she usually had the aid of a maid. He felt a strange kind of tender pang at the sight.</p><p>He rolled to sit on the edge of the bed, his legs spread, and pulled a corner of the sheets over his lap. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled back\u2014and half turned away. \u201cI... I can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you weeping?\u201d he asked in horror.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>But she was. Dear God. She was crying.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do, how to make this right. \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>She stilled and turned, her eyelashes spiked with tears. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Had he just said that? But he looked her in the eye and repeated the words. \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>It was as if something clicked into place\u2014a missing piece he hadn\u2019t even known he lacked\u2014and he knew, suddenly and completely, that marrying Hero was the right thing to do. He didn\u2019t want anyone to ever hurt her. He wanted to be a shield for her. For the first time since he\u2019d come back to London, he felt as if he knew what his purpose was. He felt right.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t seem to feel the same way.</p><p>She shook her head, stifling a sob, and bent to pick up her dress.</p><p>His pride was pricked. He stood, the sheet falling away. \u201cWhat say you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she muttered as she fought her way into the dress.</p><p>His head reared back as if she\u2019d struck him. \u201cYou find an offer of marriage from me silly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She had the dress over her head and started lacing up the front. \u201cYou only ask because you\u2019ve bedded me.\u201d</p><p>He set his hands on his hips as anger rose in his chest. His head throbbed\u2014he hadn\u2019t enough sleep in days\u2014and he tried to keep his voice even. \u201cI\u2019ve taken your virginity, my lady. Pardon me if I think that a good reason to take you to wife as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear Lord.\u201d She turned to face him. Her eyes skipped over his nude body, and then she held her gaze firmly above his waist. \u201cHave you not listened to a word I\u2019ve said these last days? Marriage is a contract, a bargain between families. A pact for the future, solemnly thought out and sincerely entered into. It isn\u2019t something one just jumps into on a whim.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you ask me before you bedded me?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, tempted to answer that he\u2019d been thinking with the smaller of his two heads before he\u2019d bedded her, thank you very much.</p><p>But she was already continuing, her voice horribly gentle. \u201cYou and I have no similar goals or intentions. You told me less than a fortnight ago that you never intended to marry. You\u2019re offering out of guilt or misplaced gallantry, neither of which is a solid foundation for a marriage. I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake\u201d\u2014her voice wobbled, making his heart constrict\u2014\u201cbut calling off my marriage to Mandeville would simply compound it.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her. When had she thought all of this out?</p><p>He could refute all of her points, given a night\u2019s sound sleep, but one stuck out in particular. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to marry Thomas.\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrows. \u201cIs that why you bedded me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he roared.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, perfectly reasonable, perfectly perfect. \u201cMy arrangement with Thomas is between him and me. It has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d he said, the words sounding stupidly pompous even to his own ears, standing there naked, arguing with the woman he\u2019d ignobly deflowered. \u201cI\u2019m Thomas\u2019s brother and the man you just fucked.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cI hate that word. Please don\u2019t use it around me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Hero!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to leave now,\u201d she said politely, and did just that.</p><p>For a moment he stared, incredulous and stunned, at the closed door. What had happened? What had he done?</p><p>His eyes dropped to the white sheets on the bed, and he saw a small smear of blood there. The sight tore at his heart. Griffin swore and slammed his fist into the bedpost, splitting his knuckles.</p><p>Deedle came in the room, looking around brightly. \u201cI passed a lady in the hallway, m\u2019lord, in quite the hurry. Right pretty, though. Didn\u2019t think you was up for it, if\u2019n you know what I mean, after last night.\u201d</p><p>Griffin groaned and dropped back to the bed, his aching head in his hands. \u201cShut up, Deedle.\u201d</p><p>THE DAY WAS bright and sunny, even in St. Giles, and Silence Hollingbrook smiled as she made her way through the morning market.</p><p>\u201cMamoo!\u201d Mary Darling cried from her perch on Silence\u2019s hip, and stretched out plump baby hands toward a pile of shiny red apples.</p><p>Silence laughed and stopped. \u201cHow much?\u201d she asked the bonneted apple seller. William had once praised her apple pie\u2014long ago when they\u2019d first been married.</p><p>The woman winked, the wrinkles in her tanned face deepening. \u201cFor you and such a bonny lass, only threepence a half dozen.\u201d</p><p>Normally, Silence would bargain the seller down, but the apples did look good and the price was fair. \u201cI\u2019ll take a dozen.\u201d</p><p>She handed over the coins and called Mary Evening over with the marketing basket she held. She watched as the seller carefully picked out and filled the basket for her. The apples would make a nice pie or two for the children.</p><p>She continued on her way through the stalls. Besides Mary Evening, she had Mary Compassion and Mary Redribbon to carry her purchases, and the girls trailed her like obedient ducklings. They\u2019d already purchased onions, turnips, and a nice lump of fresh butter, and Silence was making for a stall with a pretty display of beetroots when a shout made her glance to the right.</p><p>A small gang of boys was there\u2014a common sight in St. Giles and indeed all of London. These boys were intent on some type of dicing game on the ground, and one boy had obviously won or lost. He jumped up and down and was immediately cuffed by another lad. In a moment, both boys were rolling in the dust, no one paying much attention to them other than to walk around the scuffle. Then as she was idly watching, she saw something\u2014someone\u2014beyond the boys. A graceful male figure, inky black curls brushing broad shoulders, the hint of wide, cynical lips.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>She dodged to the side, trying to get a better look. He\u2019d turned away, and there were other people, other stalls, between them. She couldn\u2019t be sure, but if she could just get a good glimpse...</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, ma\u2019am?\u201d Mary Evening panted.</p><p>Silence looked around and realized that the girls were running to keep up with her swift steps. She turned back, searching the place where she\u2019d last seen that too-familiar face.</p><p>But he was gone.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d imagined him; perhaps she\u2019d mistaken another man with long hair worn undressed about his shoulders. Mary Darling fretted and reached for an apple in Mary Evening\u2019s basket. Silence picked one out with fingers that trembled and gave it to the baby. She\u2019d not seen him since that one awful night; surely she must be mistaken.</p><p>But she knew she wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d caught a glimpse of Charming Mickey O\u2019Connor, the most notorious river pirate in London.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we were home,\u201d she told the children.</p><p>She turned, hurrying away from the market. Perhaps it was merely a coincidence that Charming Mickey should be in the market at the same time as she. He did live in St. Giles, as she had good reason to know. Except she really couldn\u2019t see Mr. O\u2019Connor doing his own marketing. Her steps quickened until she was nearly trotting. Her heart was beating in triple time, so fast and light she thought she might faint. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mustn\u2019t show fear before the wolf.</p><p>She half laughed, but the sound was more a sob. Mickey wasn\u2019t anything like a wild, savage wolf\u2014at least on the surface. The one time she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d been dressed in velvet and lace, every finger of his hands adorned with jeweled rings. He\u2019d been elegant and suave. But underneath, dear God, underneath he\u2019d been exactly like a ravenous wolf.</p><p>Silence was panting by the time they made the home. Her fingers were clumsy with the key, and she nearly dropped it twice before getting it in the door. With a last nervous look over her shoulder, she pushed the girls inside the home and slammed the door shut behind her. Quickly she flung down the bar.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d Mary Evening asked anxiously.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Silence placed a hand over her breast, trying to calm her breathing. Mary Darling munched messily on her apple, unconcerned. At least she hadn\u2019t alarmed the baby. She smiled. \u201cYes, quite, but I\u2019m dying for a cup of tea, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d was the general consensus.</p><p>So she marched back to the kitchen with her charges, feeling marginally better.</p><p>That feeling stopped, though, when she saw Winter standing in the kitchen, his face grave. Winter never came home before his luncheon at one of the clock.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing home at this hour?\u201d</p> <p>Winter looked at the eldest girl. \u201cMary Evening, please set the marketing on the table and take the other girls with you upstairs. I believe Nell has just made some tea for the children there.\u201d</p><p>The girls obediently trailed from the kitchen.</p><p>Silence looked at Winter, her chest squeezing, \u201cWinter?\u201d</p><p>He glanced distractedly at Mary Darling, still in her arms. \u201cPerhaps we should send the baby upstairs as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Silence swallowed, laying a cheek against Mary Darling\u2019s soft, black curls. \u201cLet her stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Winter nodded. \u201cWill you sit?\u201d</p> <p>She lowered herself to one of the kitchen benches. \u201cWhat is it? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve received word from the owners of William\u2019s ship,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>Her head started to spin, Winter\u2019s words becoming indistinct.</p><p>Still, when he continued, she heard him. \u201cWilliam\u2019s ship has been lost at sea. There were no survivors. I\u2019m afraid William is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU SEEM TIRED, my dear,\u201d Cousin Bathilda observed that night as she and Hero rocked in the carriage. \u201cPerhaps you shouldn\u2019t have sat with Phoebe all afternoon.\u201d</p><p>They were on their way to a ball. Hero frowned for a moment, thinking. Oh, yes, the Widdecombe\u2019s ball. She might find a lady tonight interested in helping the home if only she put her mind to it. Funny how she\u2019d had trouble concentrating all day.</p><p>\u201cMy dear?\u201d Cousin Bathilda prompted.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe didn\u2019t tire me.\u201d Hero smoothed her brow. \u201cI have a slight headache.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall I tell the driver to turn around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hero said too sharply, then inhaled. \u201cNo, it\u2019s quite all right, cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t think it\u2019s all right when you use that tone,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said, her feathers all ruffled.</p><p>Hero stifled a sigh and made herself smile calmly. \u201cTruly, I\u2019m sorry to have snapped at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d the other lady replied. \u201cIt\u2019s rather late to turn about now anyway; we\u2019re nearly there. Although I do feel bad about leaving poor Phoebe abed at home. Has Maximus talked to you about her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must make a decision soon, I think.\u201d Cousin Bathilda had lines of worry about her eyes. \u201cThank the Lord the physician said her arm will heal. It would be terrible if she were crippled as well as...\u201d Bathilda\u2019s voice died away as if she couldn\u2019t quite make herself say the word.</p><p>Hero sighed and turned to gaze out the window, though there was nothing to see in the dark. How strange she felt! As if she\u2019d become disconnected from her body and the events around her. She should be thinking deeply at this moment, coming to decisions and making things right somehow. Instead, she found it hard to concentrate on anything at all. Anything but thoughts of Griffin and how it had felt to accept him into her body this morning. She could almost smell his skin, hot and salty, feel the hair on his chest rasping against her bare nipples, see his eyes watching her always....</p><p>\u201cI do hope Lord Griffin isn\u2019t at the ball tonight,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said, making her start.</p><p>Fortunately, her cousin didn\u2019t seem to notice Hero\u2019s wild glance.</p><p>\u201cBad enough that Phoebe seems entirely charmed by him,\u201d Cousin Bathilda huffed. \u201cI cannot believe you invited that man to luncheon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe doesn\u2019t know the particulars of his reputation,\u201d Hero replied, attempting to move the conversation away from herself.</p><p>\u201cNaturally not!\u201d Bathilda was shocked at the mere notion. \u201cA precious, innocent girl like her having knowledge of the extent of Lord Griffin\u2019s scandalous ways\u2014the very thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his good points as well,\u201d Hero said before she could stop herself. \u201cHe\u2019s funny, and an interesting conversationalist, and he can be very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny and kind do not excuse a man\u2019s rakishness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will soon be part of the family,\u201d Hero replied, and felt like weeping.</p><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d was all Cousin Bathilda had to say to that.</p><p>Her obvious indignation made Hero smile faintly. \u201cMignon likes him, remember.\u201d</p><p>The little dog raised her head at her name. She was curled up beside Bathilda on the carriage seat.</p><p>Cousin Bathilda stared severely at her pet. \u201cShe usually has better taste, I must say.\u201d</p><p>Mignon decided their conversation was uninteresting, since the topic didn\u2019t involve doggy tidbits. She yawned and laid her head back down again.</p><p>\u201cAh, here we are,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said as the carriage rolled to a stop. She gathered Mignon in her arms and preceded Hero down the steps.</p><p>Outside, the Widdecombe town house was ablaze with torches. Liveried footmen bowed and ushered them up the steps and inside.</p><p>\u201cI see Helena has made an extra effort this year,\u201d Cousin Bathilda whispered loudly in Hero\u2019s ear. \u201cAnd well she should after last season\u2019s debacle.\u201d</p><p>Hero was still trying to remember the debacle in question when they came upon the receiving line.</p><p>\u201cBathilda.\u201d A very thin lady with silvery gray hair leaned forward and almost touched her cheek to Cousin Bathilda\u2019s. \u201cHow wonderful to see you again. And you brought your darling dog,\u201d she observed with pursed lips as Mignon rumbled at her.</p><p>\u201cHelena.\u201d Cousin Bathilda put a soothing hand on Mignon\u2019s head. \u201cYou remember my dear relative, Lady Hero Batten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Hero dipped into a curtsy.</p><p>\u201cEngaged to the Marquess of Mandeville, yes?\u201d Lady Widdecombe peered at her with faint approval. \u201cA very good match, my dear. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lady,\u201d Hero murmured. She felt a suffocating weight, as if a large boulder sat upon her chest. How scandalized everyone here would be if they knew what she truly was beneath her facade. She\u2019d lost her perfection. She\u2019d lost her place. For a wild moment she had the urge to simply turn and flee from the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Mandeville now,\u201d Cousin Bathilda exclaimed.</p><p>Hero glanced up and saw her fianc\u00e9, looking the same as ever. He was quite elegant tonight in deep brown velvet overembroidered in gold and red.</p><p>He made a leg at the sight of her. \u201cMiss Picklewood, Lady Hero. You are the fairest damsel here tonight, I vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d She wondered what he would say if she asked him what feature he found so especially beautiful about her? Was it her eyes? Her neck? Her breasts? But then he\u2019d never seen her bare breasts. Only one man had and it wasn\u2019t her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>She looked away, biting her lip as guilt battered against her.</p><p>\u201cI hope your dear sister is better?\u201d Mandeville asked gravely.</p><p>\u201cAs well as can be expected, my lord,\u201d Cousin Bathilda answered. \u201cThe doctor has prescribed bed rest, but he thinks the arm will knit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see my good friend Mrs. Hughes over there,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said. \u201cIf you young people will excuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Mandeville murmured. He held out his arm to Hero without really looking at her. \u201cShall we stroll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she answered sedately, calming the hysterical voices in her head.</p><p>She laid her hand on his sleeve as he led her into the crowd. The room was too hot, it seemed. Lady Helena had chosen to decorate the ballroom with hundreds of roses, and the scent of the wilting flowers was almost overwhelming. She nodded her head and murmured inanities to passing people until she thought she might scream. Her world had tumbled off balance, and she didn\u2019t know how to right it again.</p><p>And then, suddenly, Griffin stood in front of them, dressed elegantly in blue and gold, his wig snowy white. His arm was crooked, as he idly fondled something in his hand. His green eyes flicked from her face to her hand, laid on Mandeville\u2019s sleeve, then rose slowly to his brother\u2019s face.</p><p>Hero tried to swallow, but her throat was dry. Surely he wouldn\u2019t say anything, do anything, here?</p><p>Griffin bowed stiffly. \u201cGood evening, Thomas, Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d she heard Mandeville say beside her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were invited tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing the places where I\u2019m welcome.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyes at his cynical tone. His green eyes clashed with hers, his expression grim.</p><p>She caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d Mandeville asked.</p><p>Griffin raised his eyebrows and opened his hand. Hero inhaled silently. Her diamond earbob lay on his palm\u2014the one she\u2019d thrown at him in the sitting room at her engagement ball.</p><p>He smiled thinly. \u201cA trinket I found upon the floor. Do you think it becomes me?\u201d</p><p>He held the earring to his ear as Hero widened her eyes in warning. Surely Mandeville would recognize it as hers!</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s better suited to a lady,\u201d Griffin drawled. He reached out, and Hero felt the heat of his fingers as he dangled the earring near her ear.</p><p>Mandeville frowned, looking confused. \u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Griffin\u2019s smile had disappeared as he looked at her. \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019ll make it a keepsake.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the earring into his waistcoat pocket.</p><p>Hero stared at him, her chest aching as if she\u2019d been weeping. She\u2019d lost him, she suddenly realized. They could never again be friends now.</p><p>Griffin looked at Mandeville. \u201cWith your permission, I\u2019d like to offer your fianc\u00e9e a dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Mandeville replied.</p><p>And just like that, she was handed from one man to the other, rather like a prize pony at a country fair.</p><p>Hero waited until they\u2019d strolled some distance from Mandeville. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Griffin replied low. \u201cYou seem to only want to do, er, other things with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d she hissed desperately.</p><p>In any other man, the look he gave her might be mistaken for hurt. \u201cI\u2019m not going to disgrace you here in front of everyone, never fear.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to reply to that, and while she was contemplating it, he led her swiftly through a pair of French doors and outside.</p><p>She looked around the lovely paved balcony with wide steps that led into a shadowed garden and turned to him accusingly. \u201cYou told Mandeville we were to dance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged, unconcerned. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell him you felt overwarm. You certainly appear overwarm.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a hand to her flushed cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s not a very gentlemanly thing to say.\u201d</p><p>He laughed shortly and without humor. \u201cNothing I say ever pleases you, my Lady Perfect. Have you noticed? Only the things I do please you.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, but he placed a thumb under her jaw and turned her head back so that she had no choice but to look him in the face. \u201cYou were pleased this morning, were you not?\u201d</p> <p>Hero wanted to lie, but in the end she could not, so she simply stayed mute.</p><p>He grimaced and let his hand drop with a gesture of disgust. \u201cYou won\u2019t admit it, but I know you were. I felt you as you came apart in my arms, as your sweet cunny clenched about my cock.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, remembering the feel of him, too. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her hard and then drew her down the steps and into the shadows of the garden. Pulling her along until they were out of earshot of the ballroom doors.</p><p>He turned and placed his hands on her upper arms. \u201cWe must discuss it, even if you want to forget it forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d she whispered, emboldened by the dark. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he said low, and her name sounded like a prayer on his lips.</p><p>He bent over her, there in the dark garden, and she felt the brush of his lips over hers. They were whisper-soft, like the kiss of a knight for a maiden he held in high esteem. Did he think of her that way, even now that she\u2019d proven herself unvirtuous? She drew back and tried to search his face, but it was in shadow. He might as well have been a stranger.</p><p>She made to step back, but he caught her hand, holding her against himself. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tilting her face to look at the stars, still and empty and so very far away. \u201cHow can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not?\u201d he retorted, his voice deep. \u201cI\u2019ve pierced your maidenhead.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHero.\u201d His hands rose to grip her shoulders hard. \u201cYou must marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His head jerked back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me, Lord Griffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... have feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart tear a little. \u201cFeelings are not the same as love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love Thomas.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t our pact together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen for God\u2019s sake, why demand it of me?\u201d he growled low and urgent. \u201cIf I\u2019m good enough to bed, surely I\u2019m good enough to wed.\u201d</p><p>She merely shook her head again. Panic was rising in her chest, a suffocating sense that she could never undo her wrong, that she\u2019d never recover the place that she\u2019d always had in society and her family.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The denial burst from her lips without thought or preparation. The mere notion of falling in love with this man made fear surge in her breast.</p><p>\u201cThen why come to me? Why let me make love to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She inhaled to steady her voice. \u201cI... I came this morning to see if you were all right, to talk to you about the home, about your gin making. I had no notion of doing what we did.\u201d</p><p>But was that the truth? a small voice asked deep inside her. Her heart had been beating hard when she\u2019d knocked on his door. She\u2019d been excited, her hands trembling in anticipation. Maybe without knowing it herself, she had gone there to submit to him. To find out, once and for all, if she was more than the facade of a duke\u2019s daughter.</p><p>He shook his head, clearly confused. \u201cAt least answer my question: Why not marry me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head frantically. \u201cI... I can\u2019t think. You don\u2019t understand the magnitude of this decision. If I marry you, my life will never be the same again. Maximus will hate me. He may repudiate me, keep me from the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake.\u201d For a moment she could tell he was struggling to keep his voice low. Then he said urgently, \u201cI may be a rake, but my reputation isn\u2019t that sordid. I doubt your brother will be happy with our match, but to cast you out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hates gin making,\u201d she whispered back fiercely. \u201cYou are a gin distiller. How long before he finds that out? You have no idea of the depths of his hatred for gin and gin makers. What he will do to you\u2014and me\u2014when he does find out.\u201d</p><p>He shoved her away suddenly, as if he didn\u2019t trust his hands on her. \u201cHave you even thought of the alternative? If you go through with this marriage with Thomas, we\u2019ll be knotted together for the rest of our lives with this between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she cried. \u201cDear God, don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve known that from the moment I rose from your bed this morning?\u201d</p><p>He backed from her vehemence as if stunned, and in that moment she did what she\u2019d never done in her entire life.</p><p>She turned and ran.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Queen Ravenhair eyed the stallion, the warrior, and the bullock for some time, but in the end she merely nodded and thanked her suitors for their answers. She dined in state with the princes, but though they had much to talk\u2014and argue\u2014about, the queen was nearly silent throughout the meal. She was relieved when at last she retired to her rooms. Once there, Queen Ravenhair hurried to the balcony.</p><p>There, already waiting, was the little brown bird. And about his neck was an acorn on a string....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>Griffin stalked back into the ballroom, trying to look civilized, as if he wasn\u2019t actually hunting Hero down. Which was a lie, of course, because he was most definitely hunting her.</p><p>He paused just inside the French doors, glancing casually about, and caught a glimpse of red curls to his right. He smiled at a passing matron, who looked alarmed, and began strolling in that direction.</p><p>He\u2019d always loved women. Ever since that first sweet tavern owner\u2019s daughter\u2014Belle or Betty or perhaps Bessie. She\u2019d had wide blue eyes and tits with freckles on them, and she\u2019d shown him infinite pleasure at the age of nearly sixteen. He\u2019d never had any particular problem attracting women, both low and quite high. They seemed to be drawn by his smile and his ease. One of his lovers had called him charming, and maybe he was. All he knew was that he took care of them for the short period they were with him, and when they inevitably left, either with a laugh or a quiet tear, he smiled and kissed them and sent them on their way. He didn\u2019t moon over them, he didn\u2019t lie awake thinking about them, and he never, ever, ever went chasing after them like some pie-faced simpleton.</p><p>And yet here he was stalking through a crowded ballroom, his brother and her cousin in attendance. Well. That only made the hunt more interesting, didn\u2019t it?</p><p>She was skittering around the edge of the crowd. She looked over her shoulder, and he stopped, half turned away from her, to greet an elderly gentleman he\u2019d never met. The old man arched his eyebrows, confused but pleased, and Griffin leaned a little closer to hear his reply.</p><p>She fell for the ruse, silly, silly chit, and darted down a hallway. He straightened and turned from the old man, moving with purpose now. One glance showed that Thomas was clear across the room with a gentleman Griffin vaguely recognized as a member of the House of Lords. Griffin made sure no one was paying him any particular attention and ducked into the hallway.</p><p>The hall was lit, but the candelabra were few and far between. This wasn\u2019t one of the main thoroughfares where the ladies went to mend their appearance. He tutted. She couldn\u2019t have chosen a better place for his purposes had she acted under his own instructions.</p><p>Statuary lined the hall, eerily lifelike in the candlelight. The first room was on his left, the door ajar. He glanced inside and saw two shapes moving in the darkened room. His mouth curved in a cynical smile. She hadn\u2019t gone to ground there. The next sitting room was empty. He carefully searched it while keeping an eye on the door so she wouldn\u2019t double back past him.</p><p>The moment he entered the third room, however, he knew. It might have been the faint scent of a woman, or perhaps he heard a low gasp. Or perhaps he simply knew on a level below his senses and skin, a level as deep as his soul: She was here. He closed the door behind him, enclosing them both in near darkness. A single candle flickered, abandoned, on a side table.</p><p>Griffin glanced about the room. It seemed to be a small library or retiring room. A trio of chairs was by the fireplace on the far side, facing away from the door. Two settees were nearer to him, at right angles around a low table in the center of the room. One of the settees had its back to him, but the trio of chairs was the more obvious choice.</p><p>He smiled slightly, feeling his pulse spike, and walked slowly toward the fireplace.</p><p>She waited until he was bent over the nearest chair. There was a scuffling and a sudden flurry, but he was watching.</p><p>Griffin whirled and made it to the door before she did.</p><p>Hero halted, panting, inches from his chest.</p><p>He cocked his head, smiling not at all nicely. \u201cGoing somewhere, my Lady Perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me out,\u201d she demanded. Any other woman would\u2019ve pleaded.</p><p>He took a step toward her, forcing her to step back or let him run into her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She flung back her head, regal and palely beautiful. The diamonds in her red hair glittered. \u201cI\u2019ve told you I won\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have,\u201d he agreed pleasantly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not looking for marriage at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, and he saw the delicate skin on her throat flutter under her heartbeat. He\u2019d bedded her only this morning. She\u2019d been an innocent; she\u2019d still be sore. They were in a public gathering, for Christ\u2019s sake.</p><p>None of it mattered.</p><p>He was ragingly hard for her.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cGriffin.\u201d</p><p>He half closed his eyes at her murmur. \u201cYou say my name like a lover, so soft, so sweet. I want to lick the word from your lips, sip the exhaled breath from your mouth. I want to possess you utterly. Right now. Right here.\u201d</p><p>She darted then, a hart flushed from cover, and tried to leap around him. He caught her by her waist and flung her up against the closed door.</p><p>Then he bent his head and looked her in her brilliant diamond-gray eyes. \u201cWhat will it be, madam?\u201d</p><p>HERO LOOKED INTO those demonic green eyes and knew stark despair mixed with freedom: She couldn\u2019t resist him. Why, she wasn\u2019t sure. Any other man she would\u2019ve walked away from. But not Griffin.</p><p>Never Griffin.</p><p>She let her own worst impulses fly free. She raised her hands, framed his lean cheeks, and pulled his head down to hers.</p><p>Oh, yes, she needed this. She needed him.</p><p>His mouth was warm and luscious, and she feasted on it like a starved child. She hadn\u2019t even known that she\u2019d missed the taste of his lips. The taste of liberty.</p><p>He groaned and fumbled with her skirts, pulling, yanking them up. She felt a draft of cool air on her bare thighs, and then his big, hot palms were on her bottom. He squeezed and fondled her, all the while kissing her passionately, his tongue in her mouth. His fingers dipped into the crevice of her buttocks and stroked down until they met her wetness from behind.</p><p>He tore his mouth from hers, panting. \u201cPut your arms around my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>She complied, with no idea what he might have in mind. Then he was lifting her bodily, supporting her whole weight in just his arms. She hung gracelessly for a moment until she instinctively wrapped her legs about his waist.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>His hand was between them, fumbling awkwardly, and she bit her lip against a wholly inappropriate fit of the giggles. They were both completely dressed. He even still wore his white wig. How could he possibly think\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then she felt the naked heat of his cock.</p><p>She gasped, staring into his eyes, only inches from her own.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he hissed quietly. \u201cYou must make no noise.\u201d</p><p>He made a movement and that broad head slid through her slick folds.</p> <p>She bit her lip.</p><p>He braced one hand on the door and lowered his head to whisper against her lips. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>And his cock breached her.</p><p>There was a tiny pinch, a stretching. She watched him swallow, his strong throat working. His mouth pulled in a slight grimace; there were white lines at the corners of his lips. He pushed again. She opened her mouth in a silent gasp as he invaded her another couple of inches.</p><p>The door thumped against her back.</p> <p>Hero squeaked in alarm. Griffin slipped his palm over her mouth and leaned hard into the door. She looked at him, her eyes wide. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI say, the door won\u2019t open,\u201d came a slurred male voice from outside.</p><p>A feminine giggle was the reply.</p><p>The door thumped again, which had the effect of driving Hero\u2019s hips hard against Griffin. His cock slid exquisitely against her, seating him fully, his pelvis brushing hers.</p><p>\u201cShall I try again?\u201d the male voice asked.</p><p>Griffin leaned his full weight on her and the door, his legs braced, his head beside hers, his forehead against the wood of the door. She was spread wide, helplessly open and impaled upon his strong flesh, waiting to see if they\u2019d be discovered.</p> <p>The door gave another shudder, actually opening a crack. Griffin lunged into her hard and slammed the door back shut. Hero closed her eyes, close, so close, to ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cDamn me, we\u2019ll find another room, shall we?\u201d the man without said.</p><p>Footsteps tromped away.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, holding her up, still impaled, still arched against him. They breathed together, their chests moving as one. Slowly, so very slowly, his hand drifted down from the door. He brushed over the tops of her breasts, lightly, almost casually.</p><p>She waited, her hand on his neck, feeling the animal heat of him. He burrowed beneath her skirts and traced leisurely up her thigh, toward her center, toward that point where he was joined with her. She turned her head and took his earlobe between her teeth. He circled, delicately, almost too lightly, his fingers trailing through her folds stretched wide. He reached the apex of her sex and spread his hand, pressing down quite explicitly on her clitoris.</p><p>And she jerked, hard and hot, falling from a great height, the wind whistling past her ears, glorious in her descent.</p><p>He arched away from her and pulled his cock partway out, then slammed it back into her, rough and fast and relentless. He thrust in and out in short, jerky, controlled movements, never so hard as to rattle the door, never so soft as to let her down from her fall from on high.</p><p>She wanted to scream, wanted to shout aloud with joy. This rapid energy was too much, was not enough. She wanted him to continue forever. She bit, gently, precisely, on his earlobe and his mechanical rhythm stuttered. He jerked, arched, jerked again and then thrust one last time, holding himself deep within her.</p> <p>She felt heat flood her insides.</p><p>His breath was loud and harsh in her ear, and she amused herself by licking his earlobe. Then, moving slowly, he unwrapped her legs from his waist and set them on the floor.</p><p>She leaned against the door, catching her breath, watching with half-closed eyes as he took out a handkerchief and cleaned himself. How had she become so wanton in the span of less than a day?</p><p>He glanced up and saw her watching him. Deliberately, he held out the handkerchief. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>She should have felt shame or even degradation, but instead it seemed a curiously intimate gesture. She took his handkerchief and, reaching under her skirts, wiped his semen from her thighs. She let her skirts fall and stood holding the soiled cloth, unsure of what to do with it.</p><p>He finished buttoning his breeches and took the cloth from her fingers, folding it and slipping it into his coat pocket. He twitched at her skirts, straightening them carefully as she stood there, as complacent as a child. Griffin caught her eye, reaching gravely to push a lock of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he whispered almost sadly. \u201cYour toilet is done, my Lady Perfect. No one will ever know how I\u2019ve despoiled you. You are as lovely as ever.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and leaned her head back against the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve never called me lovely before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t I?\u201d he asked lightly. He turned away, glancing about the room, presumably to make sure there was no evidence left behind. He looked back at her, his wide mouth curled at the corner. \u201cPerhaps I never found the need with Thomas constantly praising your beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does it by rote,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured, and touched her hair lightly. \u201cNothing I do with you is ever rote.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave a pang then. What was he telling her? She inhaled to say something\u2014what she wasn\u2019t sure\u2014but his hand fell, and he stepped back, executing a graceful bow.</p><p>His face wore a polite mask when he said, \u201cThe usual thing in these instances is for the lady to leave first. I\u2019ll wait an appropriate amount of time before following you so that we are not seen together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, feeling suddenly naive, \u201cof course.\u201d</p><p>Hero smoothed her skirts one last time and peeked out the door. The dim hallway was deserted. She looked over her shoulder at Griffin, feeling as if she should say something, wanting to say something.</p><p>He cocked an amused eyebrow at her.</p><p>Well, she could play the sophisticate, too. She inhaled and sailed forth, moving without hurry. She was new to this type of subterfuge, but it seemed sensible to appear unruffled. She walked to the end of the hall, took another breath, and slipped into the ballroom.</p><p>She was just congratulating herself on having succeeded in avoiding detection when her brother\u2019s voice spoke beside her. \u201cThere you are, Hero.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t quite jump, but she may have squeaked before she turned to face Maximus.</p><p>His dark, heavy brows drew together. \u201cSomething the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She made herself unclench her fingers as she inhaled and smiled brightly. \u201cNo, of course not. I didn\u2019t realize you were attending tonight.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed together in an expression that wasn\u2019t quite a grimace as he scanned the room. \u201cI need to discuss an urgent matter with Mandeville. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI talked to him earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Phoebe?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and glanced at her brother. His razor-sharp eyes were suddenly focused on her. \u201cBetter. Will you come to see her again? She asks after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tomorrow afternoon, I think. I will have to tell her when I see her.\u201d</p><p>Hero inhaled, closing her eyes. \u201cThen you\u2019ve come to a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. She cannot have a season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been dreaming of one\u2014you know that.\u201d Her heart was aching.</p><p>\u201cWould you have her make a fall at a dance?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cCan you imagine her humiliation? I will not let her endanger either her pride or her person. We\u2019ll keep her safe with us, with her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will she make a match?\u201d Hero bit her lip. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean for her to remain a spinster all her life?\u201d</p><p>Maximus shrugged one shoulder impatiently. \u201cShe is only seventeen. When the time is right, I can introduce a select number of gentlemen to her. Never fear. I will take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Hero nodded. Of course he would. Maximus always took care of those around him. And perhaps he was right\u2014a season might prove too stressful for Phoebe with her failing eyesight.</p><p>Still, it would be a terrible blow to Phoebe. She had been so excited at the prospect of her season.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made the correct decision,\u201d Hero murmured, glancing down at her hands.</p><p>Maximus brought his eagle-eyed gaze back to her. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d She smiled at him rather wistfully.</p><p>It would be so nice if she could talk to him about her troubles. About Griffin and the strange, tangled relationship they had, her doubts about the coming marriage to Mandeville, and whether it would even take place. There was so much she\u2019d like to share with him, her elder brother. She\u2019d lost Papa and Mama too young to really miss them overmuch, but at times like these, she longed for them. To have someone who truly cared about her.</p><p>But she\u2019d never had that kind of rapport with Maximus. Perhaps it was because of her own reserved personality or because he was so much older than she and shouldered so many duties as the Duke of Wakefield. Or maybe it was simply never meant to be. Whatever the case, she realized now that she didn\u2019t really know her brother. Not, at least, in the deeper sense. She didn\u2019t know what he feared\u2014if indeed he feared anything. If he\u2019d ever loved or ever cried or if, late at night, he ever suffered any self-doubt.</p><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t really know her either, did he?</p><p>Maximus surprised her by taking her hand. \u201cI care for you and your welfare\u2014you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded silently, feeling guilt mixed with pain at his words.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever need me, Hero, you have merely to ask,\u201d he said.</p><p>He squeezed her fingers and then tucked them into the crook of his elbow. \u201cCome. I see Mandeville in the far corner. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be much pleased to see his fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>She agreed because she could hardly do otherwise, but she searched the ballroom as they crossed to Mandeville. She couldn\u2019t see Griffin. Perhaps he\u2019d already gone in to dinner.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the urgent matter you wish to discuss with Mandeville?\u201d she asked idly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his brother.\u201d</p><p>Hero stopped, causing Maximus to halt as well. \u201cWhat about Reading?\u201d</p><p>Maximus frowned down at her. \u201cHe\u2019s distilling gin in St. Giles. I will have to arrest him.\u201d</p><p>The blow was so sudden, so sharp, that for a moment she didn\u2019t feel the pain. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my dear,\u201d Maximus began. \u201cI know he\u2019s Mandeville\u2019s brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>She clutched his arm with shaking fingers. \u201cYou cannot arrest Griffin. You simply cannot.\u201d</p><p>Maximus\u2019s eyes narrowed sharply. \u201cGriffin?\u201d</p><p>This was it. She\u2019d betrayed herself. She was going to lose Maximus, lose her family and friends.</p><p>Carefully, Hero took her hands from her brother\u2019s sleeve and clasped them primly in front of herself. She must remember that they stood in a crowded ballroom.</p><p>\u201cFor me, Maximus,\u201d she whispered, her lips barely moving. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t touch him.\u201d</p><p>Around them the crowd talked and laughed and even shouted, but Maximus was as still as a graven image and just as silent.</p><p>Hero closed her eyes and prayed.</p><p>Finally he spoke. \u201cWhatever Reading is to you, it must stop immediately.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. His face was pale and set, his lips bloodless. She opened her mouth to speak.</p><p>His hand rose, sharp and commanding, between them. \u201cWait. I will not move against him for your sake, but in return you will promise me that you will quit him. Hero, he distills gin.\u201d The word was spat from his lips.</p><p>She bowed her head, her heart beating fast in relief.</p><p>\u201cYour word, sister.\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely.</p><p>Maximus took a deep breath, and she realized suddenly that his entire body was tense and trembling, like a racehorse held back from the starting gate.</p><p>\u201cWe will not speak of this again,\u201d he murmured, and then he took her arm.</p><p>They walked sedately to Mandeville\u2019s side as Hero fought to catch her breath.</p><p>Mandeville\u2019s first words didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cWakefield, my dear.\u201d The marquess bowed to them both, then frowned. \u201cI shall have to take my brother to task, my lady. He seems to have abandoned you to your own devices.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s of no matter,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m sure there was someone he wanted to talk to.\u201d</p><p>The gentlemen made noises of vague assent, and then Maximus drew Mandeville into a discussion of a bill he wanted passed in parliament.</p><p>Hero listened long enough to make sure the bill had nothing to do with gin, and then she fixed a pleasant, interested expression on her face and let her mind wander. She opened her fan and behind its painted scene scanned the ballroom. Griffin wore blue and gold tonight, and for a moment she thought she saw his broad shoulders leading a lady in the minuet. Then the man turned and she saw it wasn\u2019t him. She had to warn him somehow, but she must not be seen in his company. Perhaps she could send word to his house tomorrow.</p><p>Maximus bowed and made some parting comment, but Hero was hardly aware, so caught up was she in searching for Griffin.</p> <p>\u201cI must beg your pardon for both my brother and I,\u201d Mandeville said.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She glanced up to find him regarding her seriously.</p><p>\u201cI am just as much at fault for neglecting you as my brother,\u201d Mandeville said. \u201cI fear I have not played the attentive fianc\u00e9 very well these last several days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my lord,\u201d she said with a pang. \u201cI am perfectly happy with your attention.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re kind as you always are, my lady, but I\u2019ve been remiss.\u201d He hesitated a moment, then said, \u201cI admire the duke very much. He is, I think, one of the great leaders of our nation. It may seem that I forget at times that it is you I have pledged to wed, not he.\u201d</p> <p>She felt her lips tremble on a smile at the thought of Mandeville and her brother at an altar wedding each other, but she suppressed it. She knew it would hurt Mandeville\u2019s feelings if she found his words amusing. He meant them from his heart.</p><p>She laid her palm on his sleeve. \u201cHe admires you as well, my lord, and I assure you, I am not jealous of the time you spend with my brother. I know you both have grave matters of the nation to decide. Indeed, I am glad that our government is in such capable hands.\u201d</p><p>Mandeville gave her one of his rare, unpracticed smiles, his face becoming boyishly handsome, and she was reminded why she\u2019d consented to become this man\u2019s wife in the first place.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cCome, my dear. Let us discover what awaits us in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>And she accompanied him, her heart more confused than ever.</p><p>GRIFFIN HAD HAD perhaps more than his fair share of intimate encounters at balls and other social events. Ladies who were excited by the hazards and the possibility of being discovered. For others it was simply easier to meet at a ball than to risk the danger of him climbing in her window at night.</p> <p>Such sophisticated seductions were urgent at the time but easily forgotten afterward. The various fumblings in anonymous dark rooms became, after a parade of similar encounters, merely ordinary. Once Griffin stepped out of whatever dark room he\u2019d chosen for the evening, he rarely thought about the lady involved.</p><p>But as she\u2019d proven already on numerous occasions, Hero was different.</p><p>The moment he stepped back in the ballroom, his entire attention was on her. Was she having second thoughts? Perhaps realizing this moment how very sordid a rendezvous in the midst of a crowded social event was? Damn it, he should never have followed her down that hall. Hero wasn\u2019t like the cynical matrons he usually seduced. She was idealistic, proud, sure of her own infallibility. And he had been the one to prove how very human she was.</p><p>The thought did not shine a flattering light on him. Worse, this maidenish nervousness was enough to make a rake think hard about reform. He snorted, startling a plump matron nearby. Perhaps it was time to settle down and spend his evenings with a warm cup of milk by the fire.</p><p>His musings were still dark when he caught sight of Megs, lovely in a yellow frock with black and red embroidery, but looking a bit like a wilted buttercup.</p><p>\u201cOh, Griffin,\u201d she sighed when she saw him.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cOh, Megs.\u201d</p><p>She plucked limply at her skirts. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m the sort of lady a gentleman would like to kiss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot if I\u2019m about, I hope,\u201d Griffin growled.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI cannot remain a virgin forever, Griffin. I\u2019d hope to someday have children without it being a divine miracle. That is\u201d\u2014her brief show of spirit suddenly flew away again\u2014\u201cif any man ever shows enough passion to take me to wife.\u201d</p><p>Griffin straightened, his eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat has that ass Bollinger done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather more what he hasn\u2019t done,\u201d Megs moaned. \u201cHe\u2019s refused to take me into the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a good thing, too,\u201d Griffin said with vast disapproval. Good God, anything could happen in a garden at a ball\u2014and he should know.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, Griffin,\u201d Megs said soberly. \u201cI know you have all those big-brother feelings to overcome, but try for a moment. How can I contemplate marriage to a man who looks appalled at the mere notion of kissing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he was even thinking of kissing you?\u201d Griffin pointed out. \u201cPerhaps he was worried about the cold, or good God, Megs, your reputation. He may\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I asked him,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cTo...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cAnd he looked like I\u2019d asked him to lick an octopus. A live octopus.\u201d</p><p>Griffin wondered if he could punch a man for not kissing his sister.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, which was an entirely inadequate response.</p><p>But oddly Megs seemed content with it. \u201cYes. You see the problem? If he\u2019s not even tempted, if he\u2019s even disgusted by the thought, well, what hope can there be for a satisfactory union?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Griffin shook his head, trying for something better. \u201cYou know people of our rank don\u2019t marry for love, Meggie. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>The thought depressed him unaccountably.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m expected to make a good marriage in which, if I\u2019m lucky, my husband won\u2019t have half a dozen mistresses and give me the pox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegs,\u201d Griffin protested, truly shocked. When had his little sister become so jaded?</p><p>She waved away his male outrage. \u201cBut I can at least find some kind of... of friendship, don\u2019t you think? A common understanding, a desire to do more in the bedchamber than produce an heir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he soothed. He knew he should be remonstrating her over her shocking language, but he just hadn\u2019t the stamina for such hypocrisy at the moment. \u201cWe\u2019ll find you a good husband, Megs.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt is possible, isn\u2019t it? Caro jogs along comfortably enough with Huff. And Thomas seems content with Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>Griffin stiffened at Hero\u2019s name, but Megs didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>She wrinkled their nose. \u201cHe isn\u2019t exactly demonstrative with her, but she\u2019s a pleasant sort. I quite like her, really, and she understands that he must be pompous sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Griffin unwillingly snorted a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d Megs tilted her head back, staring at the shimmering chandeliers overhead for a moment. \u201cWell, if Lady Hero suddenly died\u2014tragically, you know, like in a terrible horse-riding accident or from a lightning strike\u2014I think Thomas would be sad, but he wouldn\u2019t be prostrate.\u201d She looked at him a little wistfully. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want to die himself. I just think it would be nice to be married to a man who would truly mourn my loss if I died. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said as he caught sight of Hero across the room, ethereal and lovely and entirely out of his reach. If she died, he suddenly knew that he wouldn\u2019t much care if he lived or died. \u201cYes, it makes all the sense in the world.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The queen smiled in delight when she saw the acorn about the little brown bird\u2019s neck. An acorn grows into an oak, the strongest tree in the forest, and the forests of her kingdom were filled with mighty oaks. Truly, then, the acorn was the strongest thing in her kingdom.</p><p>Queen Ravenhair carefully plucked the acorn from the little bird\u2019s neck. She cupped the bird in her palms and whispered her secrets to him before letting him fly. Then she leaned over her balcony, searching the castle grounds, but all was silent and dark. Only a single light flickered in the stables....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>\u201cWe lost another \u2019un,\u201d Nick said as Griffin entered the warehouse early that morning.</p><p>Griffin sighed and unpacked the pistols he\u2019d brought with him onto a wooden barrel. The men were working, but there wasn\u2019t the usual laughter and loud talk. The still was eerily quiet.</p><p>\u201cRun away or caught by the Vicar\u2019s men?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know. \u2019E just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Griffin nodded and sat to begin loading the pistols. He\u2019d bought them used, but he\u2019d made sure they all worked well enough.</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 word is, the informers picked up three more gin sellers today,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Griffin looked up. \u201cYou\u2019re just a font of good news.\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned nastily. \u201cBetween th\u2019 Vicar and the informers, I\u2019m feelin\u2019 a bit like a doxy wi\u2019 two sailors\u2014one takin\u2019 \u2019er from in front and the other goin\u2019 at it from behind.\u201d</p><p>Griffin winced at the graphic image. \u201cThank you for that thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the way I sees it, m\u2019lord,\u201d Nick said cheerfully. \u201cNow if we could just get the informers and th\u2019 Vicar to pay us for the favor, why, we\u2019d be rollin\u2019 in gold.\u201d</p><p>Griffin laughed reluctantly. \u201cThat\u2019s not likely to happen any time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Nick scratched his chin contemplatively for a moment. \u201c \u2019Ow\u2019s that lady what you brought \u2019ere the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, felicitations, m\u2019lord!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she turned me down.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cThe ladies need time to think some matters over like.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grimaced and set down the pistol he\u2019d just loaded. \u201cIt\u2019s more than giving her time to think. She doesn\u2019t see me as fit husband material. And then there\u2019s the small matter of her still being engaged to my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny woman \u2019oo\u2019d pick your brother over you is soft in th\u2019 \u2019ead, if you don\u2019t mind me sayin\u2019 so, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Griffin smiled wryly.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Ave you given any more thought as to what you might do if we lose the still?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Griffin shrugged, staring at the pistols.</p><p>\u201cMe granddad was a shepherd,\u201d Nick said, gazing into the blackened rafters of the warehouse. \u201cGrew up around sheep. Dumbest creatures in the world, mind you, so me da said, but easy and the livin\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>Griffin contemplated that odd information for a moment and why it might\u2019ve been offered. \u201cYou want to tend sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw.\u201d Nick sounded offended. \u201cBut wool, there\u2019s money to be made in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYer get some sheep up north, see? You\u2019ve said before that the land\u2019s bad for crops. What\u2019s no good for grain is often fine enough for animals to graze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true enough,\u201d Griffin said slowly. He was surprised that Nick seemed to have put some thought into the matter.</p><p>Nick\u2019s raspy voice was eager. \u201cYou send the wool t\u2019 London, an\u2019 it\u2019s spun and woven. I still know some weavers, used to be friends of me da. Might start a shop. I could oversee th\u2019 operation here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to become a weaver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an \u2019onest trade,\u201d Nick said with dignity and a hint of hurt. \u201cOne that\u2019d make us both money, too.\u201d</p><p>Griffin frowned. \u201cWho would spin the wool?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s big shoulders moved in a shrug. \u201cChildren or women can spin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh.\u201d There was a growing demand for woolen cloth in London, both for export and to clothe its population. And as for children to spin the wool, there might be a ready source nearby.</p><p>Nick slapped his knee. \u201cForgot to tell you\u2014the chandler shop on the corner makes a fine dish of jellied eels. \u2019Ad some just yesterday. Right tasty they are. Half a tick and I\u2019ll have you a bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nick whirled and was off out of the warehouse before Griffin could finish demurring to the offer. Griffin sighed. Nick had a particular fondness for jellied eels, which he didn\u2019t share.</p><p>But then between the Vicar and Hero, the prospect of having to consume a full bowl of jellied eels was the least of his worries.</p> <p>Griffin strolled out of the warehouse to wait for his disgusting breakfast. The sky above the courtyard wall was turning a pearly gray as the sun began to rise. Nick was already thinking ahead to what they might do instead of distill gin, and if there was one thing that Griffin had always trusted, it was Nick\u2019s head for business. If Nick thought they could make money off of sheep, well then\u2014</p><p>The shot was loud in the still morning air.</p><p>Griffin ran to the gate, and only as he flung it open did he realize that he was unarmed. If this was a trap to draw him out... But, no, the narrow alley outside the warehouse was deserted.</p><p>Griffin frowned. \u201cNick! Where are you, Nick?\u201d</p><p>He nearly turned back, but then he heard the groan.</p><p>He found Nick slumped inside a doorway only feet from the warehouse entrance.</p> <p>Griffin swore and bent over his friend. Blood and jellied eels were splashed upon the cobblestones. Nick was trying to stand, but something was wrong with the big man\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cSpilled me eels,\u201d Nick wheezed. \u201cBuggers spilled me jellied eels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about your damned eels,\u201d Griffin growled. \u201cWhere are you hit?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked up and the sun suddenly rose, lighting every ugly cranny in his face. His eyes were sliding to the side, his mouth lax. Griffin inhaled and then found he couldn\u2019t breathe properly.</p><p>\u201cBest eels in St. Giles,\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn you, Nick Barnes,\u201d Griffin hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t you die.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Nick\u2019s arm and bent, hauling the other man\u2019s weight over his shoulder, staggering as he stood. Nick was solid muscle and heavy as a horse. Griffin made it back through the gate to the warehouse and locked it before setting Nick down on the cold, damp cobblestones of the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cGet some cloths!\u201d he roared to the guards. The blood was everywhere, soaking into Nick\u2019s breeches, splattering Griffin\u2019s jacket. Griffin turned back to Nick, holding his head in his hands. \u201cNick!\u201d</p> <p>Nick opened his eyes and smiled sweetly up at him. \u201cThey were awaitin\u2019 for me. Vicar\u2019s men. Fuckin\u2019 jellied eels.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes closed and no matter how Griffin swore at him, they did not open again.</p><p>HERO KNOCKED FOR the second time at the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children that afternoon. She stood back and glanced at the upper-story windows, puzzled. Every one was shuttered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps no one\u2019s here, my lady,\u201d George, the footman, offered.</p><p>Hero frowned. \u201cSomeone is always about\u2014it\u2019s a home for children, after all.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and glanced up the street nervously. She still half expected Griffin to discover that she\u2019d journeyed into St. Giles without his escort. He\u2019d seemed to have an uncanny ability to know when she was planning to go into St. Giles. Yet today there\u2019d been no sign of him.</p><p>The door opened and Hero turned in relief, but her smile soon faltered when she saw the grave little figure in the doorway. \u201cWhy, Mary Evening, whatever is the matter?\u201d</p><p>The child ducked her head, opening the door wider to let her in. Hero instructed George to wait by the door. She crossed the threshold and was immediately struck by how silent the house was. Instead of letting her into the sitting room, Mary Evening led her back to the kitchen. The child darted out of the room, leaving her alone.</p><p>Hero looked around. A kettle was simmering on the fireplace, and clean dishes were stacked to dry on a sideboard, the obvious debris from luncheon. She wandered to a cabinet and opened a door curiously, finding tea, flour, sugar, and salt.</p><p>Footsteps sounded in the hall. Silence Hollingbrook entered. For a moment Hero couldn\u2019t figure out the difference in the woman\u2019s appearance. Then she realized that instead of her usual brown or gray costume, Mrs. Hollingbrook was clad entirely in flat black.</p><p>There could be only one reason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to keep you waiting,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said distractedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Mary Evening put you in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in mourning,\u201d Hero said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook smoothed a hand down her black skirts. \u201cMr. Hollingbrook... my husband, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled on a broken gasp.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d Hero hurried over, pulling out one of the kitchen benches.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, I just... I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Hero repeated, pushing gently on Mrs. Hollingbrook\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook sank onto the bench, her expression dazed.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d Hero went back to the cabinet and took down the tin of tea leaves. A brown pottery teapot was drying with the other dishes. She righted it and began spooning in tea leaves.</p><p>\u201cYesterday. I... Yes, it was only yesterday,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook murmured wonderingly. \u201cIt seems so long ago.\u201d</p><p>Hero went to the hearth and, catching up a cloth, picked up the kettle and poured boiling water into the teapot. Fragrant steam rolled up from the teapot before she replaced the lid. She\u2019d come to inform Mrs. Hollingbrook about the new architect and the further delays in building the new home, but that information would obviously have to wait. This was more important.</p><p>She brought the full teapot to the table. \u201cHe was lost at sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook fingered her skirt. \u201cHis ship went down. One and fifty men aboard, and all lost at sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Hero fetched two cups from the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cIt is sad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the other woman said. \u201cAt sea. I keep remembering those lines from The Tempest: \u2018Full fathom five your father lies/ Of his bones are coral made/ Those were pearls that were his eyes...\u2019 \u201d Her voice trailed away as she stared fixedly at the table.</p><p>Hero poured some tea and put a heaping spoonful of sugar into the cup before placing it in front of Mrs. Hollingbrook.</p><p>\u201cHow long does it take, do you think?\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hero asked.</p><p>The other woman glanced up, her eyes looking bruised. \u201cFor a corpse to turn into something else in the sea? I\u2019ve always found it somewhat comforting that we all turn to dirt in the end\u2014when we\u2019re buried in the ground at least. Dirt can be a very good thing, after all. It nourishes the flowers, makes the grass grow that sheep and cattle feed upon. A cemetery can be a very peaceful place, I think. But the sea... It\u2019s so very cold and lonely. So lonely.\u201d</p><p>Hero swallowed, looking at her tea. \u201cDid Captain Hollingbrook like sailing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook seemed surprised. \u201cHe talked about it even when he was home on land. He\u2019d always wanted to be a sailor ever since he was a little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps he never saw the sea quite like you and I would,\u201d Hero said tentatively. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t presume to know what his mind was like, but wouldn\u2019t it make sense that he might have a different opinion of the sea? That he might even like it?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook blinked. \u201cMaybe. Maybe so.\u201d</p><p>She reached forward and took the hot tea in both hands, raising it to take a tentative sip.</p><p>Hero drank from her own cup. Although the tea wasn\u2019t as fine as the type she was used to, it was strong and hot and at the moment seemed just the thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said vaguely. \u201cI should... What did you come for today?\u201d</p><p>Hero thought of the news she\u2019d wanted to share about the new architect for the home. \u201cNothing important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook knit her brows, seemingly deep in thought. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hero asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell you these things,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook murmured distractedly. \u201cIt\u2019s not your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Hero said, \u201cthat I would like it to be my concern. If that would be all right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said. \u201cThat would be all right with me.\u201d She took a breath and said in a rush, \u201cIt\u2019s just that when he left\u2014when William sailed last\u2014we were not in the concord of mind that we usually were.\u201d</p><p>Hero looked down at her tea, remembering the rumors that had swirled last winter about this woman. There were those who had been quite eager to tell her then that it was well known that Mrs. Hollingbrook had sold her virtue to a man called Mickey O\u2019Connor. At the time, she\u2019d decided to disregard the rumors. She trusted both Temperance and Winter Makepeace, and if they had confidence that their sister was fit to run a foundling home, then she was content with their opinion.</p><p>Hero had dealt directly with Mrs. Hollingbrook all summer and fall, and in that time she had found no reason to doubt her. She didn\u2019t know the truth of the rumors, whether they were groundless or if Mrs. Hollingbrook had somehow compromised herself. But she no longer had quite the moral authority to judge other women on their failings, did she? And even if she had, Hero would still feel at a soul-deep level that Mrs. Hollingbrook was a good woman. A woman deserving of the epithet \u201cvirtuous.\u201d</p><p>But whether the rumors were true didn\u2019t really matter at this moment. Trust could be broken over falsehoods as easily as lies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, because she didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook didn\u2019t seem to need an eloquent speech. \u201cI wish I could have but one more chance to speak to him. To tell him...\u201d Her voice faded away, and she shook her head before drawing in a shaky breath. \u201cI just wish we had not parted on such unfriendly terms.\u201d</p><p>Hero hesitantly reached out a hand toward the other woman. She didn\u2019t know her well\u2014they were of different classes\u2014but grief was universal.</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook clutched her hand convulsively. \u201cIt\u2019s selfish, I know, but I keep thinking \u2018it\u2019s over now.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Hero asked gently.</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook shook her head again, and tears suddenly ran down her cheeks. \u201cMy life, everything I... I thought I\u2019d have. This was my love; this was my marriage. William and I were happy once. I\u2019m explaining it badly.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cLove\u2014happiness\u2014isn\u2019t so very common, really. Some people never find it in all their lives. I had it. And now it\u2019s gone.\u201d She opened her eyes, staring without hope. \u201cI don\u2019t think love like that comes twice in a lifetime. It\u2019s over. I have to go on without it now.\u201d</p><p>Hero looked down, tears misting her own eyes. Love isn\u2019t so very common. She\u2019d known that in an intellectual sort of way, but here was someone who\u2019d had it and then lost it. She had a sudden, near-panicked urge to see Griffin. She had to warn him that Maximus knew of his distillery. She had to touch his hand, to assure herself that he was whole and alive. She had to hear him breathe. Was this love, this longing? Or was it a sly facsimile? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPardon me,\u201d Mrs. Hollingbrook said, wiping at her tears. \u201cI\u2019m not usually so maudlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Hero said firmly. \u201cYou have suffered a great shock. It would be strange if you were not melancholy.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hollingbrook nodded wearily.</p><p>Hero stayed a few minutes longer, drinking the tea in companionable silence. But her urge to see Griffin\u2014to feel for herself that he was alive and well\u2014was still strong. She soon excused herself and walked rapidly to the door.</p> <p>On the tedious carriage ride back to the better parts of the West End, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from dwelling on the most grotesque thoughts: Griffin dragged before a magistrate, condemned and humiliated, and the most horrifying of all\u2014his limp body swinging from a hangman\u2019s knot.</p><p>By the time she mounted the step to his town house, she was near hysterical with her own morbid imaginings.</p><p>The door was pulled open by Griffin himself. He didn\u2019t seem to employ very many servants. He scowled down at her, the stubble thick on his jaw, his shirt open at the throat, and his bare head tousled. Deep shadows circled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her relief at seeing him well, albeit surly, brought contrary irritation to her chest. \u201cWill you let me in?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged and stepped back, his grudging movement ungracious.</p><p>She entered anyway, following when he turned his back and led the way into his library. She took a moment to look about. Last time she\u2019d come here, their argument had flared so fast and intense she hadn\u2019t had time to notice his house.</p><p>Now she saw that his library was expensively if carelessly appointed. An exquisite painted globe of the world was draped with a waistcoat. Several small paintings of saints, delicate and fine and looking very old, hung on the wall, but two were crooked and all were dusty. The bookshelves were filled to overflowing, the books crammed against each other in whatever way they\u2019d fit. In just a glance, she saw a large book of maps, a history of Rome, a naturalist\u2019s study, Greek poetry, and a recent edition of Gulliver\u2019s Travels.</p><p>\u201cHave you come to critique my reading taste, my lady?\u201d Griffin poured himself a brandy.</p><p>\u201cYou know I have not.\u201d She turned and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019ve begun the Thucydides, though I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m very slow. My Greek is rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said simply, because it was true. The work necessary to understand the Greek script made her feel all the more accomplished when she did finish a paragraph.</p><p>She waited for a reply from him.</p><p>But he shrugged and tossed back the brandy. \u201cWhy have you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo warn you about my brother.\u201d She removed a stack of books from one end of a settee and sat since he made no move to offer. \u201cHe knows that you\u2019re distilling gin in St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her irritation increasing. Didn\u2019t he care about his own safety?</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough? You must give up your still at once, before Maximus sends soldiers to arrest you.\u201d</p><p>He studied the amber liquid in his glass. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She felt wild frustration rising within her breast. Maximus may have given his word that he wouldn\u2019t act against Griffin, but as long as Griffin had his still, he was in danger. \u201cWhyever not? You\u2019re more than a man who is good at making money, Griffin. So much more. You\u2019re caring and funny and noble. Can\u2019t you see that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, and she caught her breath, cutting off her words. His green eyes shone as if with tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNick is dead,\u201d he said. \u201cNick Barnes. He started the still with me. You may not remember him\u2014he was with me when you saw the still. The big man with the scarred face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d She remembered that they had seemed to be friends despite the difference in their station. She looked at him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick went out this morning to get jellied eels.\u201d Griffin made an odd face, half grimace, half smile. \u201cHe loved jellied eels. The Vicar\u2019s men shot him and I found him....\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed away as he shook his head.</p><p>She rose and crossed to him, unable to stay so far away when he was in pain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She took his face between her palms. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave it now,\u201d he rasped, his pale green eyes intense. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? They murdered Nick. I can\u2019t let them get away with it.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cBut your life is in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it to you?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He let his glass fall to the carpet, where it rolled under the settee. His hands grasped her shoulders. \u201cWhat do you care if my life is endangered? Am I a friend you share a bed with? A brother-in-law you\u2019ll invite to your wedding? What, Hero? What am I to you?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, trying to find the words. She cared for him, that much was true, but beyond that she couldn\u2019t tell him. She hadn\u2019t the words to describe her feelings.</p><p>She simply didn\u2019t know.</p><p>He seemed to understand her dilemma. Frustration warred with despair in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he hissed, and kissed her.</p><p>HER LIPS WERE soft and yielding, but that didn\u2019t assuage Griffin\u2019s anger. He wanted to imprint himself upon her. To make her acknowledge that he was more than simply a friend or a potential brother-in-law. To ensure she never forgot him.</p><p>He wanted to engrave himself upon her very bones.</p><p>His grief and anger over Nick\u2019s death seemed to twist and transform until all he felt was a raw ache for Hero. Right here. Right now.</p><p>He arched her over his arm, cruelly putting her off balance as he ravished her mouth. He could feel the clutch of her fingers in his back, but she wasn\u2019t struggling. She made no effort to escape him or his savage plundering of her mouth.</p><p>That placated the beast within him a little. He pulled back and looked into her diamond eyes. They were dazed, blurred with sensuous need. He picked her up, ignoring her squeak, and bore her from the library like a rapacious Viking marauder.</p><p>Deedle had just entered the hallway. The valet\u2019s mouth dropped open as his master passed.</p><p>Griffin shot him a glare, ensuring there would be no unasked-for comments. Then he was mounting the stairs with Hero in his arms.</p><p>She buried her face against his chest. \u201cOh, Lord! He saw us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he won\u2019t say a damned thing if he wants to keep his position,\u201d Griffin growled.</p><p>He strode down the upper corridor and carried her into his bedroom, kicking the door closed behind him. He flung her down on the bed and immediately began prowling up her supine form.</p><p>She looked at him with sleepily erotic eyes and whispered, \u201cBut he\u2019ll know what we\u2019re doing in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He straddled her, caging her with his body. \u201cWere it up to me, all of London would know what we do here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at his words and he expected protestations. Instead she reached up and ran her palms over his head.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d she said, low and a little sadly. \u201cOh, Griffin.\u201d</p><p>The sadness made his chest hurt, but he wouldn\u2019t have been deterred even if she had argued. Not now. Not this time. A great urgency was building inside of him, a need to complete this with her before it was too late. He tore at the laces to her bodice like a ravening beast.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to stop him but simply lay beneath him and smoothed her hands over his short hair as if to soothe him. He got her bodice open and threw it aside, impatient. Her stays seemed to resist him willfully. He who had never had trouble removing the clothing of any woman.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d she murmured, and gently set aside his shaking hands.</p><p>She unlaced her stays, and he filled his hands with her warm flesh. He made himself calm, touching her as delicately as he was able to in this state.</p><p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d he ordered. \u201cTake off all of it.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows but complied, slowly working herself out of the miles of expensive fabric while he went quietly insane. When at last she\u2019d kicked off her shoes and reached for her ribbon garters, he reared up.</p><p>\u201cLeave them.\u201d</p><p>He examined her, like a connoisseur with a particularly fine piece of artwork. Her body was slight, her breasts high and delicate, her hips slim, and her moonlight skin seemed to glow in his dim bedroom. The tuft of hair at the apex of her thighs was a gleaming red beacon.</p><p>His cock was hard and throbbing, but it wasn\u2019t lust he felt looking at her, naked and vulnerable beneath him. It was a strange kind of possessiveness, a need to keep her close, to defend and honor her. She could be hurt in so many ways, this proud woman, and the thought of each was like the cut of a knife, so that in the end his very soul seemed to be awash in blood.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t she see his blood? Couldn\u2019t she keep him from hurt in return?</p><p>He looked at her, wanting, hating, needing. She had a trio of faint freckles on her left shoulder, and he bent to lick them.</p><p>Her hands clutched at his head. \u201cGriffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he murmured mockingly. He bit gently at the juncture of her shoulder and her neck. \u201cDo you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... yes,\u201d she whispered, and he was filled suddenly with a kind of melancholy yearning.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you like?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>He drew back and looked at her. She lay quietly, watching him with those serious diamond eyes. He was used to being the one who led the seduction. He did things to his lovers; they rarely reciprocated. Possibly it was a need to be in control or simply the dominant male animal asserting itself. In any case, he was unused to handing over the reins of lovemaking.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said.</p><p>Reluctantly he moved aside, ready to catch her should she jump up and try to escape. But she rose and knelt beside him, looking at him curiously. He still wore his breeches and shirt.</p><p>She touched his throat with a single finger, trailing it down to where his shirt parted on his chest. \u201cTake this off, please.\u201d</p><p>He shifted enough to tear the shirt off over his head.</p><p>\u201cNow your breeches.\u201d</p><p>He kicked them and his smallclothes off and lay back down, naked.</p><p>She sat on her knees for a moment, her head tilted curiously as she simply looked at his body. He itched to move. To grab her and roll her under him. But he took a breath and let her have her moment of silent examination.</p><p>Then she placed both hands on his chest, her fingers tightening a little, kneading the muscle above his nipples. Her eyes half closed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know men had such hair upon their bodies,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s never there on statues\u2014unless in neat small whorls over the groin. But you have more than that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her hands stroked up, his chest hair curling over her fingers before springing back. It tickled a little, pulled a bit more. He moved his legs restlessly. He\u2019d never thought much about his own body, save as it could please either him or a lover.</p><p>\u201cDoes it disgust you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said consideringly. \u201cIt\u2019s just so very... foreign.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were tracing over his belly now, circling his navel. She glanced at him. \u201cDoes it itch?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose in sudden humor. \u201cNo. Sometimes it catches in my clothing, which is quite painful, but that doesn\u2019t often happen.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, seemingly content with that answer. Her fingers were stroking through his pubic hair now, close to but not quite touching his cock.</p><p>\u201cYou have it, too,\u201d he whispered. He lifted a hand to thread his fingers through her pretty red curls. Her legs were closed tightly, so he could do no more than pet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked down, watching his hand in her maidenhair as if fascinated by the sight. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it? We wear so many clothes, laced, buckled, and tied up tight, and yet underneath we are like\u201d\u2014she spread her fingers, catching the base of his cock in the crook of her thumb and forefinger\u2014\u201cthis.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, meeting his gaze, her own solemn. \u201cDo all lovers think like this? That they have a secret just between the two of them? Is this what it was like with your other women?\u201d</p><p>Something about the way she classed herself in with the faceless other women he\u2019d bedded disturbed him deeply. They were transitory. Mere phantoms that came and went in his life.</p><p>She was more to him than that.</p> <p>He wrapped his hands about her slim waist and lifted her up and over him so that her legs straddled his thighs. \u201cWhat other women? I can\u2019t remember any woman before you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled at her, intending to bring her closer so he could kiss her, but she forestalled him with a hand against his chest. \u201cYour words are pretty, my lord, but the fact remains. There were other women in the past, and there will be other women in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His denial was hard, immediate, and given without any prior thought. By talking of a future in which he had other lovers\u2014a future in which they were apart\u2014she implied that someday she would have another lover. Neither possibility was admissible.</p><p>He jerked her close and rolled her beneath him, lying on her heavy and hard. He might be crushing her, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She had to understand.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no others, either for you or for me,\u201d he said, his nose nearly pressed against hers. \u201cNo other people live outside this room. There is only you and I and this.\u201d</p><p>He shoved into her. She was tight and not quite ready, but he pressed relentlessly. He would not be forestalled; he would not retreat.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d she gasped. She arched beneath him, her legs widening.</p><p>That gave him a little more room. He took advantage of that fact, pressing forward into her lush heat.</p><p>\u201cYou and I,\u201d he panted, \u201care special. This isn\u2019t like what everyone else does. It isn\u2019t like anything I\u2019ve ever had before. We are unique together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be,\u201d she said stubbornly, even as her slim fingers gripped his buttocks.</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said against her mouth. Why wouldn\u2019t she believe him? Why this denial of something nearly mystical? \u201cListen to me. I will never have another lover like you. You will never have another lover like me. What we have should be cared for and cherished.\u201d</p><p>And he pushed one last time and seated himself finally. She was wet now, grasping at his penis in erotic little twists that made his balls draw up tight, made his brain go fuzzy.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d she began, maddening, maddening creature.</p><p>And since he could no longer form a coherent argument, he did the next best thing. He covered her mouth with his, thrusting his tongue into her honeyed warmth, his hips moving of their own accord. God! This was heaven, though he\u2019d surely be damned by that blasphemous thought. She was soft and giving beneath him, making small animal sounds against his mouth, her hips cradling his, and all that time her sweet cunny gave and gave and gave.</p><p>He\u2019d lost the ability to move with any finesse. Years of sophisticated practice in lovemaking fell by the wayside because he\u2019d not been lying: This was unlike anything he\u2019d ever experienced before. Where before he\u2019d been performing a physical act, now he did something that involved both body and soul.</p><p>With Hero, this ancient movement was making love.</p><p>He threw back his head, glorying in the sensations, physical and mental. She made him believe he could fly. He looked down and watched her face, glowing with exertion. Her eyes were closed, a slight frown between her brows, her mouth a little parted. She bit her bottom lip as he watched, and he knew she was close.</p><p>Close and he could make her fall over the edge.</p> <p>He hitched himself up, pressing against the apex of her thighs with each thrust, rubbing against her little bud. She swallowed, her delicate throat working.</p><p>He grit his teeth and held out. He was close as well, but he\u2019d not go until she\u2019d found her bliss. He lowered his head and whispered in her ear, \u201cCome for me, sweeting.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured against her neck. He could taste salt and woman, and his cock jumped within her.</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>\u201cLet me feel your honey.\u201d He licked down over her breast. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>She arched, her legs moving restlessly.</p><p>\u201cCome, my love,\u201d he murmured against her nipple, and then sucked that tender bit of flesh into his mouth. He drew it between his teeth and bit carefully, gently.</p><p>And she came apart in his arms, her cunny squeezing so exquisitely about his cock he let go of her nipple and arched back. He shouted his agony, holding himself deep within her as he jerked and jerked again in almost painful bliss.</p><p>She was his, he was hers, and at this moment in time their world was complete.</p><p>HERO STARED AT the canopy over Griffin\u2019s bed and traced circles on his broad back. He\u2019d collapsed on top of her after their lovemaking and showed no signs of moving. Her legs were splayed wide beneath him, his penis still lodged within her. It was not a graceful pose, but at the moment she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She held him tenderly in her arms, this big, strong man. This man who shouted at her and carried her off\u2014twice now!\u2014to his bedroom to have his wicked way with her. He was stubborn and rude and made his living making gin. He was everything she disapproved of, in fact, and yet, if he stirred right now and indicated he wanted to make love again, she\u2019d do it.</p><p>And what\u2019s more, she had no doubt that she\u2019d enjoy it.</p><p>Was this love? Silly question. She was too mature to mistake physical lust for love, but still... the question whispered in her brain. If she felt nothing for him, surely she wouldn\u2019t have this near-constant longing to be with him? Surely she wouldn\u2019t be already mourning their coming separation?</p><p>He sighed and lifted off of her, his penis sliding from inside her. She felt bereft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, his words slurring a bit. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to crush you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d she replied, as polite as if he\u2019d apologized for stepping on her foot while dancing.</p><p>He grunted and threw an arm around her shoulders, scooping her close to his side. She lay against him, watching the rise and fall of his chest, the flutter of his eyelashes as he drifted into sleep.</p><p>She inhaled and smelled his scent\u2014male and sexual. She thought about how she felt when she was with him, about the way he looked at her sometimes, as if she were a strange and very precious bird whose song he couldn\u2019t quite figure out. She thought about Mandeville and his perfection and about Maximus and his pride and his hate. She thought about herself and what she\u2019d learned since that fateful carriage ride when she\u2019d placed her hand on a bare male cock. Griffin\u2019s bare cock.</p><p>And as the shadows began to lengthen along the wall, she came to a decision.</p><p>She knew what she must do.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The next morning, the three princes\u2014looking somewhat grim\u2014assembled in the stable yard, for the queen wished to go riding. When everyone was mounted, Queen Ravenhair faced her suitors and asked, \u201cWhat is the heart of my kingdom?\u201d</p><p>She glanced once at the stable master, so swiftly that no one might have noticed. But the stable master touched his finger to his cap, and his lips curved just a tiny bit at the corners.</p><p>Then the queen rode out of the stable yard with the princes....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>\u201cI do not see why Mrs. Vaughan must hold a musicale every season,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said the next morning at breakfast. She waved an invitation furiously in the air, causing Mignon, sitting on her lap, to snap at it.</p><p>Hero surreptitiously moved Cousin Bathilda\u2019s imperiled teacup away from the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cShe never spends the money necessary to employ musicians of any talent,\u201d Cousin Bathilda continued, \u201cand thus we are all forced to listen to off-key violinists and tipsy sopranos while partaking of squashy cakes and watered wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf her events are so awful, why go?\u201d Phoebe asked reasonably. It was the first morning she\u2019d felt well enough to come down to breakfast. Her right arm was bound tight to her chest, and she used her left a little awkwardly to eat.</p><p>\u201cMy dear gel,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said severely, \u201cMrs. Vaughan is sister to the Duchess of Chadsworth, who is mother to the future Duke of Chadsworth, a very fine catch indeed. It would not do to insult her.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe wrinkled her nose. \u201cWell, Hero is already engaged and I think the future Duke of Chadsworth is mentally deficient. And he has no chin.\u201d She popped a bite of roll into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHero, explain to your sister the importance of remaining in the good graces of duchesses, irrespective of whether their sons have chins or not,\u201d Cousin Bathilda commanded.</p><p>Hero opened her mouth to say something vague. Her mind wasn\u2019t really on the conversation. All she could think about was the appointment she intended to make immediately following breakfast.</p><p>Fortunately, Cousin Bathilda hadn\u2019t really wanted someone else speaking for her. \u201cNo matter one\u2019s own rank, one should never irritate the sister of a duchess. It\u2019s simply bad form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s bad form for her to hold boring musicales,\u201d Phoebe said pertly.</p><p>\u201cYou are but a child,\u201d Cousin Bathilda pronounced. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand better when you come of age, won\u2019t she, Hero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Hero looked at the older woman blankly for a moment as her mind caught up with the breakfast-table conversation. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda was feeding Mignon a bit of bacon and wasn\u2019t paying much attention to her, but Phoebe looked at her curiously, squinting a bit through her spectacles. \u201cAre you feeling quite the thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Hero took a sip of her tea and found it had gone cold. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe shrugged. \u201cYou seem distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding nerves,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it before. A gel gets all fuzzy-minded the closer the date comes. Soon she\u2019ll not make a lick of sense at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make getting married sound like a debilitating disease,\u201d Phoebe laughed.</p><p>\u201cFor some it is,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said darkly. \u201cNow finish up your breakfast. Maximus said he\u2019ll be calling on you this morning.\u201d</p><p>Bathilda gave Hero a significant glance, and Hero realized that Maximus must be coming to tell Phoebe the bad news about her season\u2014or lack thereof.</p><p>On that ominous note, Hero excused herself and called for a carriage to be brought round. She couldn\u2019t bear to sit at the table any longer, listening to Cousin Bathilda talk about her marriage, and she was worried about Phoebe. Poor Cousin Bathilda was going to be so upset when she heard what Hero was about to do.</p><p>The thought wasn\u2019t pleasant, and it brought with it the realization of all the other people she was about to disappoint. Dear Lord, her family might never forgive her. But her plan was the right thing to do, even if it was not the easiest, so she held her head high as she stepped down from the carriage outside Mandeville House.</p><p>The hour was unfashionably\u2014indeed scandalously\u2014early, and she hadn\u2019t brought a chaperone. The butler lifted his eyebrow faintly when she requested to see Mandeville, but he showed her into the sitting room readily enough. Hero paced to the mantel and stared sightlessly at some Mandeville ancestor\u2019s portrait. What she planned to do would infuriate Maximus, nullify their bargain, and put Griffin in danger. After talking to Thomas, she would have to go to Maximus and throw herself on his mercy. Perhaps if she promised to\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thomas opened the door.</p><p>He crossed to her immediately, his handsome features worried. \u201cWhat is it, my dear? Has something happened?\u201d</p><p>Now that he was before her, tall and imposing, Hero found she had trouble putting together the words. \u201cI...\u201d She cleared her throat and looked about the room. A group of chairs sat together in one corner. \u201cI need to talk to you. Will you be seated?\u201d</p><p>He blinked and she fought down nervous laughter. No doubt he was rarely if ever told to take a seat in his own home\u2014or anywhere else for that matter. He was a marquess. What she was about to do suddenly made her quail. Before she could change her mind, she hurried to the chairs and sat down. Mandeville followed more slowly, frowning now.</p> <p>Hero waited until he sat across from her and then just said it. \u201cI cannot marry you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his expression clearing. \u201cMy dear, such bridal nerves are common, even for a woman as level-headed as you. Don\u2019t worry that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, causing him to abruptly close his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not suffering from nerves or... or any kind of womanly hysteria. I simply cannot marry you.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip as he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d she offered belatedly, conscious that she was making a hash of this.</p> <p>He stiffened at her apology, possibly realizing for the first time that she was serious. \u201cPerhaps if you explain to me the problem, I can help.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord, if only he weren\u2019t so reasonable!</p><p>She looked down at her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve simply come to the understanding that... that we won\u2019t do together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it something I\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She looked up quickly, leaning forward earnestly. \u201cYou\u2019re everything a lady could hope for in a husband. This has nothing to do with you. It\u2019s me, I\u2019m afraid. I just can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe marriage contracts have been drawn up and our engagement announced. It\u2019s too late to change your mind, my dear. You protest otherwise, but I believe this is simply a case of bridal anxiety. Perhaps if you go home and rest, spend the day abed with some tea. I do feel\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a virgin any longer, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>His head reared back as if she\u2019d struck him. \u201cMy dear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t with good conscience marry you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt would not be fair to you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he simply stared at her, and she thought he\u2019d realized that this was final.</p><p>Then he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI cannot pretend joy at this news,\u201d he began ponderously. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t as earth-shattering as all that. I will, of course, want to wait long enough to make sure any offspring is mine, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dear God, but she wanted to scream! \u201cI lay with your brother, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his face slowly going red.</p> <p>She stood. \u201cI\u2019ve compromised myself and sacrificed both my virtue and perhaps more importantly my self-worth. I\u2019m sorry, Thomas. You do not deserve this. If I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>One moment she was babbling and he was staring at her stony-faced. In the next he was towering over her, his expression red and awful and completely terrifying. She had only a second of fear.</p><p>And then he struck her full in the face.</p><p>GRIFFIN MOUNTED THE steps of Mandeville House, his mind in a weary fog. Was this what grief was\u2014a mind-numbing fatigue? It seemed so to him. He\u2019d spent the night burying Nick. He\u2019d paid for a coffin and burial clothes, a plot and headstone, and he watched all alone as Nick had been lowered into that cold grave. Then Griffin had returned to his still and begun making arrangements to destroy the Vicar. Just a few days more and everything would be in place to bring down the Vicar and avenge Nick. Just a few more days and then he could rest.</p><p>But in the meantime, he had other duties to attend to. This morning he was to escort Mater to the shops to pick out a settee or sideboard or some other frippery. Why she had to do her shopping so blasted early in the morning he wasn\u2019t sure, but she\u2019d been quite adamant about the time.</p><p>He nodded to the butler as he entered. \u201cWhere\u2019s my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marquess is in the crimson sitting room,\u201d the butler intoned.</p><p>Griffin began striding in that direction. \u201cI\u2019ll just show myself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a guest, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Griffin turned, still backing toward the sitting room. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>Griffin paused. Hero had been very quiet yesterday as she\u2019d left him. He\u2019d hoped that her silence meant she was rethinking marriage to him, but surely she wouldn\u2019t say anything to Thomas without\u2014</p><p>A shout came from the sitting room.</p><p>Griffin pivoted and ran toward the sound. A crash came and then another shout.</p><p>He flung open the door as the shout coalesced into a single screamed word. \u201cWhore!\u201d</p><p>Thomas was standing, shoulders hunched, face bloodred, over something on the floor. The place where he glared was concealed by the settee. Griffin felt his blood turn to sharp, stabbing ice in the second it took him to cross the room and look over the settee.</p><p>She was alive. That much he saw and comprehended. She lay in a pool of emerald green skirts but she was alive.</p><p>Then his attention was drawn to the red mark on the side of her beautiful face.</p><p>It was in the shape of a man\u2019s hand.</p><p>Roaring filled his head, white and complete, drowning out sound, sight, and reason. He took Thomas low, his shoulder slamming into his brother\u2019s belly. Thomas staggered back, hitting a chair, and they both went over, chair and all. Thomas swung a fist, and Griffin took it on the shoulder, not even feeling the blow.</p><p>Not feeling anything but murderous rage.</p><p>He lowered his head and beat, fists balled, teeth clenched, the roaring in his ears loud and total. He saw only Thomas\u2019s bloody face, his brother\u2019s mouth moving, saying something, perhaps pleading, and Griffin\u2019s heart swelled with gleeful rage.</p><p>He\u2019d touched her. He\u2019d hurt her. And for that he deserved to walk upon crippled legs.</p><p>Someone pounded on his back, but he didn\u2019t pay attention. Not until Hero shouted in his ear. \u201cGriffin, stop!\u201d</p><p>He became aware, slowly it seemed, of people in the room. Of an ache in his shoulder and, strangely, his jaw. He glanced up and saw Mater\u2019s face.</p><p>She was crying.</p><p>His arms fell to his side, and he stared at her, his chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cOh, Griffin,\u201d she said, and he wanted to weep as well. To howl his shame and sorrow.</p><p>He looked down and saw Thomas lying between his knees, trying to staunch the blood flowing from his nose with one hand. Over his hand, his brother\u2019s blue eyes glittered with rage and an answering shame.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d Hero said, her hand on his shoulder as light as a bird\u2019s, and finally he turned to look at her.</p><p>Tears sparkled in her eyes, and one side of her face was reddened and beginning to swell. The sight enraged him all over again, but this time he didn\u2019t glance at his brother. Instead he reached for her face, his hands bloody and trembling.</p><p>He cradled her with his bruised hands. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He rose and tried to take her into his arms, to somehow try and make right this bloody, awful mess.</p><p>But she shook her head, backing away. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he pleaded, and his vision blurred. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her hand rose, delicate and pale, to halt him. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t... just don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And she turned and fled the room.</p><p>Griffin looked around. The butler, a footman, and several maids were standing about gawking while his mother\u2019s frail shoulders shook.</p><p>\u201cGet out, the lot of you,\u201d he barked to the servants.</p><p>They fled silently.</p><p>He took Mater into his arms, feeling the fragile bones of her shoulder blades. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m a beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffin seduced my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Thomas said indistinctly through swelling lips. He still lay on the floor. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her any more than he could keep his hands off poor Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffin?\u201d Mater looked at him, her eyes bewildered, and it nearly broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Thomas,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Griffin turned his head slowly and glared at his brother silently, his upper lip lifting in a threat so primal, even Thomas understood. \u201cYou\u2019ll not talk of this. You\u2019ll not insinuate. You\u2019ll not even speak her name\u2014do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Thomas shut his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot a word, or I\u2019ll finish what I began.\u201d</p><p>Mater laid a protesting hand on his shoulder, but this was too important, even if it distressed her further. Griffin held Thomas\u2019s gaze until his elder brother nodded and looked away.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cCome, Mater. Let\u2019s have some tea and I\u2019ll try to explain.\u201d</p><p>And he led her from the room, leaving Thomas on his arse on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI CANNOT PRETEND joy over your actions,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said to Hero an hour later. \u201cBut I think you have been quite punished enough for whatever transgressions you may have committed.\u201d</p><p>She gently replaced the wet cloth on Hero\u2019s swollen cheek. Hero closed her eyes, not wanting to see the anxious worry in Cousin Bathilda\u2019s eyes. She lay in her own bed now, hiding from the turmoil outside her room. The entire side of her face throbbed where Thomas had struck her. Mignon was beside her, the little dog\u2019s nose against her good cheek as if to give comfort.</p><p>Sudden tears flooded Hero\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve your care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said with some of her former vigor. \u201cThe marquess had no right to strike you. The very idea of hitting a lady! It\u2019s very lucky he didn\u2019t break your cheekbone. Really, it\u2019s for the best that you shan\u2019t marry the man after all if he has such violent impulses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was provoked,\u201d Hero said drily.</p><p>The memory of Thomas\u2019s enraged face as he stood over her made her shiver. And then when Griffin had entered with such force. The sight of the brothers locked in mortal combat seemed like a terrible dream. She\u2019d actually worried that Griffin would not be stopped until he killed his brother. How had things come to this?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make it a small wedding, of course,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said now.</p><p>Hero blinked. \u201cBut I\u2019m not marrying Mandeville.\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda patted her shoulder. \u201cNo, dear, Reading. And as soon as possible, before any gossip gets out.\u201d</p><p>Hero closed her eyes in weariness. Did she want to marry Griffin? Would Maximus even let her? But thoughts of her brother brought a realization.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear Lord, I forgot Maximus!\u201d Hero sat upright, the wet cloth sliding from her face. She looked at Cousin Bathilda in panic. \u201cDoes he know yet?\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda blinked, looking taken aback. \u201cI certainly haven\u2019t told him, but you know how he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Hero said, climbing from the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have found out by now\u2014you know he will,\u201d Hero muttered as she searched for her slippers. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s by informants or gossip or plain alchemy, but he finds out everything sooner or later, and considering the scandalous nature of this news...\u201d She trailed off as she bent to look under the bed. There her slippers were!</p><p>\u201cMy dear, far be it for me to stop you seeking solace from your brother, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to wait a while until he has had time to properly, er, digest the news?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what do you think he\u2019ll do then?\u201d Hero demanded as she shoved her feet into the slippers. Her hair must be a mess! She rushed to the mirror to look.</p><p>\u201cDo? You mean...?\u201d Cousin Bathilda gasped.</p><p>Hero turned and saw from the blanched expression on the other woman\u2019s face that at last she\u2019d realized the peril. Without her marriage to Thomas to stop him, Maximus would attack Griffin\u2014or worse.</p><p>She nodded and gave her hair a distracted pat. It would simply have to do\u2014she didn\u2019t have the time to wait for it to be dressed again. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to do something, perhaps even something violent. And frankly I\u2019ve had enough male violence for today.\u201d</p> <p>She dashed out of the room and down the stairs, then had to pause in the front hall while a carriage was called.</p><p>\u201cWait for me, dear,\u201d Cousin Bathilda panted behind her. She held Mignon in her arms like a shield.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bound to be in a terrible mood,\u201d Hero said. \u201cYou needn\u2019t accompany me.\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of all of you since your parents\u2019 death. I\u2019ll not let you face him without me. Besides,\u201d she added a bit more prosaically, \u201cit may take two females to calm him.\u201d</p><p>The thought did not make Hero more cheerful, but she entered the carriage with determination.</p> <p>Half an hour later, they were knocking on the door of Wakefield House, the imposing residence her father had built. He\u2019d expected to raise his family here, but only Maximus inhabited the grand town house now.</p><p>A flustered butler opened the door, his back straightening at the sight of her. \u201cMy lady, I don\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>Hero pushed past him and turned. \u201cWhere is my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Grace is in his private rooms, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hero nodded briskly and mounted the stairs. Normally she would never invade Maximus\u2019s bedroom, but the circumstances were extraordinary.</p><p>As it turned out, his door was open, a secretary scurrying out like a chastised dog.</p> <p>Hero took a deep breath and entered the room.</p><p>Maximus was in his shirtsleeves, bent over a desk, writing something. Three other men stood in the room, including Craven, Maximus\u2019s long-time valet. Craven was tall and thin and looked more like a coffin-maker than a valet, dressed as he was all in black.</p><p>He saw her and Cousin Bathilda and turned to Maximus. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>Maximus looked up and met Hero\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d he said to the servants.</p><p>Craven ushered the other men from the room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Maximus stood and crossed to her. He stared down into her face, his own curiously blank.</p><p>Then he touched a finger to her aching cheek. \u201cHe\u2019ll die for this.\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t sure which \u201che\u201d Maximus referred to, but it hardly mattered. \u201cNo, he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and half turned toward his desk again. \u201cI\u2019ve already sent my seconds to Reading. The matter is settled.\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda drew in her breath and moaned softly.</p><p>Hero caught his arm. \u201cThen call them back.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. Maximus was a duke, after all. No one talked to him thusly, not even she.</p><p>But this was life or death.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a duel,\u201d she told him, holding his eyes firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want any more violence, and I certainly don\u2019t want a death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt most certainly does!\u201d she said. \u201cI am the one responsible for Mandeville\u2019s rage. I am the one who chose to give away my virtue and cause this problem.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHero\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen,\u201d she said low. \u201cI am ashamed of what I\u2019ve done, but I will not let shame make me hide from the consequences. Call back your seconds, Maximus. Don\u2019t fight a duel that will ruin you on my behalf. I don\u2019t think I could bear to live with that.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her silently for a moment, then crossed to the door and cracked it open. Craven must still have been waiting outside, because Maximus held a murmured conversation before closing the door again and coming back to her.</p><p>\u201cI do this for you,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly for you, and I do not promise that I will not pursue a duel at a later date if I feel this matter is not adequately settled.\u201d</p><p>Hero swallowed. It was a great concession, even if it was only a partial one. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Cousin Bathilda pronounced, and plopped into a chair.</p><p>Maximus nodded and crossed to the desk. \u201cNow, we must settle how soon you can marry Mandeville. I\u2019ve no doubt the servants will have started gossiping over this morning\u2019s affair already.\u201d</p><p>Alarm climbed Hero\u2019s spine. \u201cMaximus\u2014\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at the papers on his desk. \u201cNo doubt he\u2019s upset about your liaison with his brother, but I think he will come around when he has a chance to think. The marriage settlement was very much to his liking, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaximus!\u201d she repeated a little desperately.</p><p>Her brother looked up, frowning.</p><p>Hero lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m not marrying Mandeville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to arrest Lord Reading?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a moment and then glanced down again at his papers as if her feelings hardly mattered. \u201cThen you\u2019ll marry the Marquess of Mandeville.\u201d</p><p>His flat tone sent a chill down her spine. She knew that voice: It was the voice of the Duke of Wakefield.</p><p>And the Duke of Wakefield did not change his course once set.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>That night the queen summoned her suitors to her throne room to hear what their answers might be.</p><p>Prince Westmoon came forward and unfurled a magnificent flag at her feet. On it was the emblem of her kingdom along with an embroidered castle. \u201cThis castle,\u201d he said, \u201cis the heart of your kingdom, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Next, Prince Northwind unveiled a silver compass, cleverly inlaid with mother-of-pearl and coral. \u201cThe harbor, Your Majesty. That is the heart of your kingdom.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Prince Eastsun laid before her a sparkling crystal globe that held a miniature town at its center. \u201cThe city is the heart of your kingdom, Your Majesty....\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>The Duke of Wakefield was not an easy man with whom to procure an audience.</p><p>Griffin had spent half the afternoon cooling his heels in first one sitting room and then another at Wakefield House. Presumably he was moving closer to the great man, but at the rate he was going, it would be well past Christmas before he got there.</p><p>Which was why he was striding down a long and formidably elegant hallway in search of His Grace\u2019s study. He had no doubt that the man didn\u2019t want to see the seducer of his sister\u2014and a gin distiller to boot\u2014but that was just too bad. His and Hero\u2019s future depended on this meeting.</p><p>He passed a small library and yet another sitting room\u2014how many did one man need?\u2014before coming to a closed door on the right.</p><p>Griffin opened it without knocking.</p><p>Considering that he had a huge mansion with an overabundance of rooms, the Duke of Wakefield had chosen a relatively small space for his study. The room must be nearly at the back of the house, an odd situation for the master. The study\u2019s walls and ceiling were covered in dark wood, intricately carved as if from some medieval monastery. Beneath his feet was a carpet richly embroidered in amber, ruby, and emerald. At one end, taking up nearly the entire width of the room, was a huge, rather ugly desk, also carved from dark wood. Behind the desk was the duke, scowling at him.</p><p>Griffin made a leg. \u201cYour Grace, I hope I am not disturbing you.\u201d</p><p>One ducal eyebrow slowly rose at this bit of blatant lying. \u201cWhat do you want, Reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister.\u201d</p><p>Wakefield\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cAccording to her, you\u2019ve already had her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d No use trying to pretend innocence. \u201cAnd that is why I desire her hand in marriage now.\u201d</p><p>Wakefield leaned back in his chair. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m letting my sister be seduced into a trumped-up marriage with a fortune hunter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fortune hunter.\u201d Griffin flexed his fist, still sore from his brother\u2019s jaw. Losing his temper now would not serve his cause well. \u201cI have enough money of my own.\u201d</p><p>The duke\u2019s upper lip curled ever so slightly. \u201cThink you that I haven\u2019t made inquires about you and your business?\u201d</p><p>Griffin stiffened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a profligate rake,\u201d Wakefield said. \u201cYou enjoy the affections of numerous ladies\u2014the majority married. You have only a small inheritance yourself, but your brother for some reason sees fit to let you manage both it and the Mandeville lands. Add to that the fact that you are distilling gin illegally in St. Giles, and it\u2019s not a very nice picture, is it?\u201d</p><p>Griffin looked the other man in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t gamble or drink to excess. I have increased what you term a small inheritance fourfold since I got it and confidently intend to continue to build it. I may be known for my affairs of the heart, but I fully plan to be faithful to your sister when she marries me.\u201d</p><p>Wakefield smiled cynically. \u201cFew men of our class refrain from keeping a mistress once married, and yet you expect me to take you on your word alone that you will not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of your still? Will you give it up for my sister?\u201d</p><p>Griffin thought of Nick covered in jellied eels and his own life\u2019s blood. \u201cNo, not yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>The duke watched him silently for what seemed like a full minute. Griffin could feel a bead of sweat trickle down the small of his back. The urge to say something was nearly overwhelming, but he knew he\u2019d laid his case before the man as strongly as possible. Speaking now in the face of the intimidating stare would only show weakness.</p><p>Finally, Wakefield spoke. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway. This entire discussion is moot. I\u2019ve already informed Hero that she will be marrying your brother on Sunday. And if you haven\u2019t given up your still by then, no doubt I will be visiting you with my soldiers very soon thereafter.\u201d</p><p>He picked up a piece of paper from his desk. The interview was obviously over.</p><p>Today was Wednesday. Sunday was only four days away. Griffin took one step toward the big desk and swiped his arm across the entire top. Pens, papers, books, a small marble bust, and a gold inkwell all crashed to the floor.</p><p>Griffin leaned across the desk, his arms braced on the now-clear top, and stared into Wakefield\u2019s outraged eyes. \u201cWe seem to be under a confusion of communication. I did not come here to ask for your sister\u2019s hand. I came to tell you I will marry Hero, with or without your permission, Your Grace. She has lain with me more than once. She may well be carrying my child. And if you think that I\u2019ll give up either her or our babe, you have not done nearly enough research into my character or history.\u201d</p><p>Griffin pushed himself off the desk before the other man could utter a word and strode out the door.</p><p>IT WAS VERY, very late at night, and Thomas squinted as he propped himself up with one hand on the doorjamb while he used the other to pound on the door. It was the second time he\u2019d knocked, and he stepped back to squint up at the town house. This was the correct house all right, he wasn\u2019t likely to ever forget it. Which meant the jade was either not answering him or, worse, was visiting one of her many young paramours. If she was, he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>The door opened abruptly to reveal a large, menacing manservant he\u2019d not met before.</p><p>Thomas scowled. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>The manservant began to close the door.</p><p>Thomas set his shoulder against the door, shoving hard. But his footing wasn\u2019t as firm as he thought it. Suddenly he found himself on his arse\u2014the second time today\u2014and red washed over his vision. He was the Marquess of Mandeville, damn it! His life wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a flurry of movement at the door, and then Lavinia was bending over him in a purple wrap, her outrageously red hair about her shoulders. In dishabille, without the artful application of her paint pots, she looked every year of her age. And yet when he stared up at her, he thought her the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened to you?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk. Hutchinson, help me get him inside.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas began to protest the help of the manservant, but as his legs did appear to be a bit wobbly, it really seemed a moot point. A few minutes more and he was ensconced in her sitting room on the yellow settee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked this settee,\u201d he said, patting the cushion beside him. He gave her a seductive look. \u201cSome of my best memories took place here.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, which was not how he remembered her responding to his seductive looks in the past. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s house, Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my fianc\u00e9e anymore,\u201d he said, sounding petulant even to his own ears.</p><p>Her delicate eyebrows rose. \u201cI thought you\u2019d signed the marriage papers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe fucked Griffin.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia merely looked at him, her arms folded beneath her magnificent bosom.</p><p>He shook his head irritably, glancing about the room. \u201cFucked him under my own nose. Jus\u2019 like Anne. Whores, all of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>She moved slightly at the second use of the crude verb. \u201cYou know I dislike such language, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He laid his head in his hands, for it had begun to spin slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d she asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cGriffin.\u201d He laughed, feeling his nose. It was large and lumpy and no doubt broken, but at the moment he hardly felt it. \u201cHe attacked me, if you\u2019ll credit it. After seducing my fianc\u00e9e, he hit me. Should call him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you deserve it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged guiltily. \u201cI hit her. Lady Hero. I\u2019ve never before struck a woman in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it does sound like you deserved it,\u201d Lavinia said briskly. She bent to examine him. \u201cEven so, your nose looks quite painful.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her slyly. \u201cYou always cared for me, Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. She could at least pretend a sentimental affection. \u201cLavinia...\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou need cold water for that nose.\u201d</p> <p>She moved to the sitting room door, and he watched her longingly as she called for the hulking butler and asked for cold water and a cloth. Her wrap was a deep amethyst that hugged her luscious bottom. He noticed that her slippers were worn, though, the embroidery tattered. She should have new slippers, ones with jeweled heels. He\u2019d give her jeweled slippers and much, much more if only she came back to him. He closed his eyes a moment.</p><p>When next he opened them, Lavinia was beside him with a basin of water. She draped a cold cloth over his nose.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Thomas winced.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d she said.</p><p>He watched her as she leaned over him, her brows knit.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but really,\u201d he said somewhat indistinctly. He needed the question answered right this moment. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said as she lifted away the cloth and rewetted it. \u201cYou decided it was time to marry. You asked Lady Hero to be your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why leave me?\u201d he asked stubbornly. \u201cYou know I could\u2019ve kept you in luxury for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of my life?\u201d Her brown eyes met his, and he couldn\u2019t read the emotion that lay within them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, suddenly sober. \u201cFor forever. I would not take any other mistress. I would\u2019ve been true to only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to your wife, you mean.\u201d The strange spell that had been between them broke. She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d not take well to being a kept woman, I\u2019m afraid, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry you, damn you,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>He knew he wasn\u2019t charming anymore. Wasn\u2019t anything but ugly, but he couldn\u2019t prevaricate. The emotion welled up in him too strongly.</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t marry me,\u201d she said, sounding almost bored. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t marry some other gentleman.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back, the blow more painful than his brother\u2019s fist. \u201cYou will not!\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhyever not? You have no claim on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he hissed. He threw aside the silly cloth and grabbed her close. \u201cDamn you!\u201d</p><p>And he kissed her with all the desperation of a man with a torn and bloodied heart.</p><p>She tore her mouth away even as he delved beneath the amethyst silk wrapper. \u201cThis won\u2019t solve anything, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight not,\u201d he grunted as he licked her neck. \u201cBut it sure as hell will make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Thomas,\u201d she sighed, and since that didn\u2019t sound like a rejection of any sort, he went ahead and did what he\u2019d been wanting to do for months now.</p><p>Make love to Lavinia.</p><p>GRIFFIN WAS DOZING in one of his brother\u2019s chairs when the front door of Mandeville House opened and closed. He jerked awake, rubbing at his face groggily.</p><p>He\u2019d tried Thomas\u2019s house the night before\u2014after seeing the Duke of Wakefield\u2014but Thomas had been out. When it was clear that his brother wasn\u2019t returning home any time soon, Griffin had decamped to St. Giles.</p><p>This morning he\u2019d come directly to Thomas\u2019s house to catch his brother before he left for the day. Except Thomas, that most staid of bachelors, appeared to have spent the night out.</p><p>Curious.</p><p>Griffin peered into the hall.</p><p>There was Thomas, looking damnably grumpy, and with a nose the size of a turnip, speaking sharply to his butler. \u201cI don\u2019t care who has come to call. I\u2019m not at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even for blood relations?\u201d Griffin drawled.</p><p>Thomas swung violently in his direction and then winced and lifted a hand to his head as if it ached. \u201cEspecially not to bloody blood relations!\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the stairs in dismissal.</p><p>Griffin was beside him in a couple of strides. \u201cThat\u2019s just too damn bad, brother mine. You and I are overdue for a heart-to-heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d Thomas started.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Griffin leaned into his brother\u2019s face. \u201cNot unless you want me hanging out your dirty laundry here and now and within earshot of the servants.\u201d</p><p>Thomas eyed him sourly for a moment, then jerked his head toward the stairs and began climbing without a word.</p><p>Since this was a better reception than Griffin had hoped for, he followed.</p><p>They ended up in a study on one of the upper floors. Griffin prowled around the room while Thomas crossed to a crystal decanter and splashed amber liquid into a glass.</p><p>Griffin raised his eyebrows. \u201cBit early in the day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d Thomas replied moodily.</p><p>Griffin grunted as he studied a medieval etching on the wall. \u201cThis was father\u2019s study, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Thomas looked up as if surprised. \u201cYes. Don\u2019t you recognize it?\u201d</p><p>Griffin shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t come in here much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather used to call me in every Sunday evening,\u201d Thomas mused. \u201cBefore I went away to school. Then when I was home, we\u2019d retire here after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Griffin asked.</p><p>\u201cTalk.\u201d Thomas shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019d ask me about my studies. Have me recite my Latin lesson when I was younger. Discuss politics when I was older.\u201d</p><p>Griffin nodded. \u201cHe was preparing you to be the marquess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he was.\u201d Thomas looked at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t he do the same with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t invited,\u201d Griffin said without heat.</p><p>Thomas stared at him a moment as if baffled, then looked down at his glass. \u201cWhat do you want with me, Griffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to decline to marry Hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already declined me.\u201d</p><p>Griffin looked at him. Apparently he hadn\u2019t heard yet from Wakefield. \u201cHer brother wants her to marry you this Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Thomas narrowed his eyes. \u201cDoes he indeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Griffin grit his teeth. \u201cI want you to refuse to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Thomas snorted angrily. \u201cOf course you do. I suppose you want her for yourself, just as you wanted my first wife for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with Anne,\u201d Griffin said as calmly as he could.</p><p>\u201cOh, no?\u201d Thomas sneered. \u201cPoor, poor Anne! What would she do if she knew her lover had forgotten her so easily? But then you do go through women fast enough. I suppose there\u2019s little point in learning their names, much less remembering them when dead. Have you told Hero about Anne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The reply pulled Thomas up short. He blinked before recovering. \u201cWhat? That you make a habit of seducing your brother\u2019s women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told her that I\u2019d never touched Anne.\u201d Griffin met his brother\u2019s somewhat bloodshot eyes grimly.</p><p>Thomas barked a laugh. \u201cYou lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not.\u201d Griffin couldn\u2019t stop the heat entering his tone. God! He\u2019d lived with this slander for years. \u201cI never made love to Anne, never seduced her, never had any intention of seducing her. If she told you otherwise, she lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne told me on her deathbed you were her lover.\u201d Thomas banged his glass down on the side table. \u201cShe told me the baby was yours. She said you\u2019d been lovers for months, that you\u2019d started seducing her before we\u2019d even wed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you at her funeral that she lied!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really expect me to believe a known rake over my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you to believe your brother!\u201d Griffin\u2019s shout echoed about the room. He bent forward, grasping the back of a chair, trying to regain his composure. \u201cJesus, Thomas. How could you? How could you believe I would seduce your wife? I\u2019m your brother. You never even thought to give my words credence. You just believed a hysterical woman dying in childbirth over me. It was as if you\u2019d been expecting it all along, and her words merely confirmed your suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had been expecting it.\u201d Thomas picked up his glass and drained it. \u201cYou flirted with Anne, admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Fine! I flirted with her. I flirted with her like every other gentleman does with every other lady in a ballroom.\u201d Griffin threw up his hands. \u201cBut that was all it ever was. It never went beyond silly words in public. I never meant it to go beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved you.\u201d</p><p>Griffin inhaled. \u201cIf she loved me, it wasn\u2019t because I encouraged her. You know that, Thomas. Once you were married, once I realized that she might be taking our social flirtation at all seriously, I went north.\u201d</p><p>But Thomas was shaking his head. \u201cYou knew she had a tendre for you and you exploited it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I do such a thing?\u201d Griffin asked in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cJealousy.\u201d Thomas gestured with his glass. \u201cYou said it yourself: Father never invited you to his study. You weren\u2019t the heir.\u201d</p><p>Griffin laughed incredulously. \u201cDo you think me such a pathetic man that I\u2019d seduce my brother\u2019s wife out of jealousy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Thomas downed the rest of his glass with one gulp.</p><p>Griffin closed his eyes. If Thomas had been any other man, Griffin would have called him out. The insult to his honor, to his integrity, to his very character was unbearable. But this was Thomas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His brother.</p><p>And he still needed something from him.</p><p>Griffin inhaled slowly. \u201cI think you know, somewhere under that stuffy, stubborn hide, that I\u2019m innocent of this heinous charge.\u201d</p><p>Thomas started to talk, but Griffin held out his hand. \u201cLet me continue.\u201d</p> <p>After a moment, Thomas nodded stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Griffin looked at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t love Hero. She has admitted being my lover. I don\u2019t think you want to marry her. Let me have her, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Despair clawed at his chest, but Griffin didn\u2019t let the weakness show. \u201cYou don\u2019t want her. I do. Don\u2019t be a dog in the manger.\u201d</p><p>Thomas laughed. \u201cThe tables have turned, haven\u2019t they? Not so cocky now, are we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t, Thomas.\u201d Griffin closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf Wakefield has decided we\u2019ll marry this Sunday, I fully intend to comply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>Griffin opened his eyes on the stark words. They were true, he realized. The understanding should\u2019ve been a shock. Instead, it felt strangely right.</p><p>He stared at his brother without hope, but without fear either.</p><p>Thomas looked startled a second; then he glanced away uneasily. \u201cMore fool you.\u201d And he left the room.</p> <p>HERO WAS LYING in bed that night, sleepless, her mind running in tight, erratic circles, when she heard the sound at her window. It was a tiny thing, something like a scratch, and if she hadn\u2019t been wide awake and worrying, she wouldn\u2019t have heard it at all. Could a cat have climbed up to her balcony? She propped herself up and stared toward the long windows. Her room was black, but muted moonlight lit the window dimly. She squinted. Surely\u2014</p><p>A large shape suddenly loomed, silhouetted black against the window.</p><p>Hero gasped and choked, struggling to scream.</p><p>The shadow moved, the window opened, and Griffin calmly stepped into her bedroom.</p><p>Hero found her voice, even as her heart leaped in gladness at the sight of him. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d he said, sounding like a disapproving schoolmaster instead of a midnight marauder. \u201cDo you want to wake the entire house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m most definitely contemplating it,\u201d she replied, though he no doubt knew as well as she that she lied. Hero sat up in her bed and tucked the sheets primly under her arms. She wore a chemise, but she didn\u2019t want him to get any ideas that she was wanton.</p><p>Well, even more wanton than she\u2019d already shown herself to be.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t make a reply but prowled closer. The room was dark, and as he moved, she lost his shape behind the bed curtains. She felt an awful moment of panic as he disappeared from her sight, as if she\u2019d never see him again. She reached out to brush aside the curtains and saw him by her dresser. He seemed to be studying the things on the top. Could he see in the dark?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to your brother.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tells me you\u2019re going to marry Thomas on Sunday,\u201d he said. \u201cOur... conversation did not end well, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>\u201cWell? Are you going to marry Thomas?\u201d</p><p>She squinted but still couldn\u2019t make out his expression. \u201cThat\u2019s what Maximus wants me to do.\u201d</p><p>His head swiveled toward her. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>She wanted Griffin, but it wasn\u2019t that simple. If she refused to marry Thomas, there would be nothing to stop Maximus from going after Griffin. Nothing to stop him from arresting Griffin and hanging him by his neck until dead. And even if that were not the case, could she marry Griffin knowing that she would have to give up her family? Perhaps never see Phoebe or Cousin Bathilda or Maximus again? A stifling panic rose in her throat at the mere notion.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided to give up the still?\u201d she asked softly, desperately.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His voice was hard. \u201cNick died defending it. I can\u2019t just walk away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to marry Thomas,\u201d she said, feeling helpless. She let the curtain fall, deliberately cutting herself off from him. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d His voice was low and gritty and sounded nearer.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d she asked wearily. Her heart had ached for days now, for so long that she didn\u2019t notice it anymore. It was simply there: a constant pulse of sorrow. \u201cI can\u2019t marry you. We\u2019re nothing alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he whispered, and it sounded like he was close beside her, the breath of his words separated from her only by the gauze of her bed curtains. \u201cWe are nothing alike, you and I. You\u2019re more similar to Thomas\u2014staid, cautious in your decisions, careful of your actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me sound a terrible bore.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, an intimate brush of sound in the dark. \u201cI said you are similar to Thomas\u2014not alike. I\u2019d never find you boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind.\u201d She touched the curtain with a fingertip, pressing gently until she felt the plane of his cheek through the gauzy fabric.</p><p>\u201cI think that it\u2019s our very differences that make us a perfect match,\u201d he said, and his jaw moved under her fingertips. \u201cYou\u2019d die of boredom with Thomas within a year. If I found a lady with a temper similar to mine, we\u2019d tear each other apart within months. You and I, though, we\u2019re like bread and butter.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said, his voice quivering with laughter but also with an undertone of gravity. She cradled his jaw as he said, \u201cBread and butter. The bread provides stability for the butter; the butter gives taste to the bread. Together they\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows drew together. \u201cI\u2019m the bread, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d His voice was a thread of rumbled sound, low and ominous. She could feel his words as they drifted over her palm. \u201cAnd sometimes I\u2019m the bread and you\u2019re the butter. But we go together\u2014you understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She wanted to say yes. She wanted to agree to marry him and turn a deaf ear to all the dissenting voices in her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he whispered, and she traced the movement of his lips through the curtain as he spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way about any other woman. I don\u2019t think I ever will again. Don\u2019t you see? This is a once-in-a-lifetime event. If you let it slip through your fingers, we\u2019ll both be lost. Forever.\u201d</p><p>His words made her shudder. Lost forever. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of him lost. Impulsively she leaned forward and set her lips against his through the curtain, feeling his heat, feeling his presence.</p><p>But he drew his head back. \u201cDo you understand how much you mean to me? What we are together?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you see how much you\u2019re asking of me? To leap into an abyss on just your words. I can\u2019t see how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me show you.\u201d</p><p>The bed curtains were shoved aside, and he was in bed with her. He pulled the curtains closed, and suddenly her bed was small, intimate, and dark. They were enclosed in their own tiny world, just the two of them, outside of time and space.</p><p>He drew the covers from her grasp, and she let him without even token protest. The fabric made a shushing sound as it slid down her legs, and she swallowed, her body beginning to throb with want for him. She knew him now\u2014knew what he could do to her. What he could make her feel.</p><p>His hands touched her ankles, encircling them, warm and firm. \u201cHero.\u201d His voice was gritty, deep and threaded with intense emotion.</p><p>She felt his hands smooth up her calves, his touch almost too tender here in the dark. He was only a shadow, so she closed her eyes and concentrated on his fingertips, trailing over her thighs, trying to forget that this would surely be their last time together. He traced swirls on her skin, and when her breath hitched, it sounded loud in her ears. He reached the tops of her thighs, and she moved her legs restlessly, but his touch left her as he drew her chemise off over her head. She lay nude, her skin prickling with the chill of the night air.</p><p>Then his fingertips descended again, lightly skimming circles on her sides, almost tickling. Her skin seemed to tune itself to him, coming alive with tingling sensation.</p><p>She reached for him impatiently. \u201cGriffin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust let me show you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers trailed from her sides to her belly, meeting over her navel. She sucked in a breath, unable to keep completely still under his touch. He breathed a laugh and scraped his nails lightly up to just under her breasts. Her nipples were tightly drawn already, pricking with anticipated pleasure. He traced the tender curve of the underside of her breast, tickling, faintly scratching, and she had to squeeze her thighs together to contain her own excitement.</p><p>When his mouth descended on one trembling nipple, hot and wide open, she jumped. She clutched at his hair as he traced around her nipple with his wet tongue, then sucked strongly. He was pinching at her other nipple, nearly painfully, his entire mouth over her breast, devouring her flesh in erotic hunger.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>He nipped at her in punishment. She gasped and raised her legs, shocked to feel his breeches against her inner thighs. He was still dressed, but at this moment she no longer cared. She raised her hips and ground desperately against him. She found him, hard and big inside the fabric of his breeches, and she widened her thighs still farther to press her aching flesh against him.</p><p>But he dropped his weight on her, pinning her open and vulnerable beneath him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he murmured, and moved his mouth to her other nipple.</p><p>She tried to shift her hips, to rub against him somehow, but he lay, large and male and implacable, upon her. He held his upper body off her with his arms as he leisurely ravished her breasts, but his hips pinned her completely.</p><p>She grasped at his hair, trying to tug his head up. But his locks were shorn too short, and he merely chuckled against her nipple.</p><p>He was pulling strongly on her oversensitive nipples, and she was close\u2014so close! If he\u2019d just let her\u2014</p><p>\u201cGriffin!\u201d she hissed in frustrated exasperation.</p><p>She felt herself heating from within, the entire surface of her body alert and ready for him. She could feel him, hard and long, against her clitoris, but he would not move.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He raised his head and licked lazily at a nipple, his breath caressing her wet skin as he whispered merely another torment. \u201cEasy, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He spoke as if she were a mare in need of gentling, and at any other time, she would\u2019ve made him aware of his insult. But at this moment she was entirely at his mercy.</p><p>\u201cGriffin, please,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She tossed her head restlessly. She\u2019d explode if he didn\u2019t give her release soon.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me?\u201d He kissed her nipple too gently.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>And somehow, despite her extremis, she saw the gaping hole of the trap. She peered up at him blindly in the dark. She couldn\u2019t see his face, his expression.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d she sighed hopelessly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say it, can you?\u201d he whispered. \u201cCan\u2019t admit it either.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face against her breasts, and she thought his cheek might be wet.</p><p>\u201cGriffin, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised his head and tilted his body to the side. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she thought he meant to leave her, and her heart dropped in panic. She grabbed his arms desperately.</p><p>But she could feel his muscles moving beneath her fingers as he worked his hands between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s all right,\u201d he murmured as he settled between her thighs again.

He entered her, one slow inch at a time, and it was torture. She made to arch up, to embed him all at once, but he shifted one hand, holding her hips firmly down.</p> <p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he growled. \u201cLet me give you this at least.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew a bit, and she mewled in protest; then he was crowding into her again, his length endless and rock hard. He shoved and shoved again, and she felt his pubis meet her mound.</p><p>He paused, and she could hear his breath coming in quick pants, but when he spoke, his voice was even and smooth. \u201cThere. That\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you want\u2014good, hard cock.\u201d</p><p>On the last word, he reared and withdrew his length to the very tip before slamming his hot flesh back into hers. And he was right: It was what she wanted. It was perfect, in fact. Him moving on her like a stallion, all muscle and sweat, intent on their mutual pleasure.</p><p>He grabbed her knees and raised them higher, spreading her wide for his pleasure as he hitched himself up her. He pounded into her in a strong, insistent rhythm. With every thrust, he shoved her up the bed until her head was buried into her pillow, the pillow hard against the spindles of her bed. She gasped helplessly, glorying in his savagery. She loved this, wanted it to continue forever, wanted him to thrust into her until she forgot who he was. Who she was.</p> <p>Until time itself stopped.</p><p>But neither of them could continue indefinitely. His thrusts were becoming jerky and hard, and she felt herself at the edge of her own release. She arched beneath him, her hands scrabbling at his shoulders. He slammed his mouth over hers just as she opened it to scream. Hot flashes of lights were going off behind her eyes. His cock was rubbing, rubbing, rubbing over that one delicious spot, and she was going to die from the endless pleasure.</p><p>He thrust his tongue into her mouth, and she sucked it helplessly. He ground his hips into her and shuddered. She felt the tremors wrack his big shoulders. He tore his mouth from hers and groaned, long and low, his body shaking as it poured life into hers.</p><p>He dropped like a stone onto her and lay unmoving for a moment while she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>Finally he turned his head toward her face and brushed a kiss over her cheek. \u201cI love you and I believe with all my heart that you love me as well. Why can\u2019t you say it, Hero?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>Queen Ravenhair looked at the answers to her question and nodded in acknowledgment. \u201cI shall see you on the morrow, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>But as she rose to leave the throne room, Prince Eastsun spoke. \u201cWhat is your decision, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><p>She looked and saw that all three princes were staring at her rather sternly.</p><p>\u201cYes, which of us have you chosen?\u201d Prince Northwind demanded. \u201cWe have answered each of your questions, yet you have said nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must decide,\u201d Prince Westmoon said. \u201cYou must decide and tell us on the morrow which of us you will marry....\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>Griffin got up and lit a candle from the banked embers in her fireplace. He walked back to the bed, arrogantly nude, the candlelight shining on his smooth stomach. He set the single candle on her bedside and climbed in beside her again, large and male and demanding.</p><p>\u201cWell? Why can\u2019t you say it?\u201d</p> <p>Hero looked at Griffin and felt her heart begin to crumble. \u201cDoes it matter so much, three little words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it does.\u201d</p><p>But she shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t. You want me to give up my family, all that I know, and you won\u2019t even give up your awful still. Can\u2019t you see that what you\u2019re asking is impossible?\u201d</p><p>She expected anger and harsh words. Instead, he merely closed his eyes as if too weary to keep them open. \u201cI need but a little time with the still. After I take down the Vicar. After\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long, Griffin?\u201d Her voice rasped in her throat. \u201cDays? Weeks? Years? I cannot wait that long. Maximus and your brother will not let me.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes, and his gaze was hard now. \u201cSo it comes down to this: You will choose marriage to my brother over marriage to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you do this to me? To us?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, trying to find the words. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life obeying the rules set before me by society and my brother. Maximus has decided that Thomas is the better man for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou accuse me of not giving up my still for you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut I think you are the greater coward. You will not give up your brother\u2019s approval for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right,\u201d she answered. \u201cI cannot go against Maximus now. I cannot. He has the power to ban me from my family. Besides, he\u2019s made the right choice. Thomas is reliable. He\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word dropped between them like a leaden weight. Hero felt tears fill her eyes, though she wasn\u2019t sure for what she mourned.</p><p>The bed shook and suddenly Griffin was atop her, his weight pressing her into the mattress, his breath hot and angry against her cheek. \u201cHe might be safe, but do you love him, Hero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cDoes he make you blush with anger and then with want?\u201d He kicked apart her legs, settling hot and heavy between them. \u201cDoes he know how sensitive your nipples are? That you can come just by me sucking them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he watch you like I do? Does he know that your eyes turn to diamonds when you\u2019re aroused?\u201d He nipped along her neck, his kisses insistent and hard. \u201cDoes he know that you like to read in Greek but loathe drawing? Does he wait with bated breath for you to arch your left eyebrow so prissily\u2014and then grow hard when you do?\u201d He thumbed both her nipples at once, bringing a surge of heat between her thighs. \u201cTell me, Hero, goddamn it to bloody hell, tell me: Does he make you feel like I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Her answer was a despairing wail.</p><p>His thumbs were between them, spreading her folds as if he had every right, as if she was his, now and forever, until the end of time, amen. And then he was in her. Hard and hot, moving so exquisitely she began to cry.</p><p>She wrapped her legs tightly around his narrow hips, her arms about his shoulders, holding on to him with her entire body as he rode her.</p><p>His big penis slid in and out of her slick folds. She was already sensitive from their previous lovemaking. She was gasping, hardly able to keep up, his pace rough and fast. It was too much; she couldn\u2019t hold herself together anymore. She wanted to push him away. To flee this room and him and his too-strong lovemaking. He wasn\u2019t giving her time to yield to him, to hide or assimilate his angry urgency. He was simply pushing her to experience what they shared\u2014what they made\u2014here and now.</p><p>He bent and caught her mouth, kissing her possessively even as his cock worked in and out of her. She moaned, opening her mouth, accepting the invasion of his tongue, tasting her own tears on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHero. Hero. Hero.\u201d</p><p>He punctuated each utterance of her name with a hard thrust of his hips as if to brand her as his. Sweat was dripping from his body, his breath was coming in hard gasps, and the bed was quaking.</p><p>She shook her head against the pillow\u2014in denial of him or their lovemaking or of her own urges, she was no longer sure. But he pursued her, catching her head between his hands, holding her and making her look at him as he thrust himself into her body.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me, Hero?\u201d His pale green eyes were full of torment. \u201cDo you love me like I love you?\u201d</p><p>And she cracked apart on his words, a stream of liquid heat pouring forth from her center. She trembled beneath him, trying to tear her gaze from his as her passion exploded within her. As rivers of sweet pleasure spread through her thighs and belly. As her heart fractured and re-formed.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t let her look away. He held her gaze as his own eyes half closed and the muscles of his face, neck, and chest tightened. She watched helplessly as he convulsed above her, his big, strong shoulders gleaming with sweat.</p><p>He thrust into her once, twice, three times more and held himself there, tight against her, their bodies locked, as he orgasmed. His eyes pled silently with hers, defiant and proud.</p><p>Her vision blurred.</p><p>He slumped onto her, his chest heaving.</p><p>Hero closed her eyes, running her hands over his slick shoulders. She wanted to imprint this memory on her mind: the musk of their lovemaking, the weight of him on her, the sound of his harsh breaths in her ear. Someday, perhaps soon, she would want to draw upon this memory, to cherish and hold it in her heart.</p><p>He suddenly rolled off her, and her hands clutched after him, but he wasn\u2019t leaving her bed. Not yet at least.</p><p>He gathered her close, nestling her bottom into his groin, surrounding her back with his wide shoulders. He brushed the hair from her nape and kissed her there.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>And so she did.</p><p>THE DAY WAS gray, but then every day seemed gray now, Silence thought as she gazed out the grubby kitchen window.</p><p>\u201cMamoo!\u201d Mary Darling cried, clutching fretfully at the front of Silence\u2019s dress with grubby hands. \u201cMamoo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mary Darling,\u201d Silence sighed.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten to don an apron before sitting down to a late breakfast with the toddler. Now there were two smears of grease across her black bodice. She stared down at herself, feeling helpless and blank. She ought to rise and wash herself off\u2014or at least find an apron\u2014but she didn\u2019t seem to have the energy.</p><p>\u201cGive the child to me, sister.\u201d Winter hung his round black hat by the door as he entered the kitchen, then placed a plain wooden box on the table. He plucked Mary Darling from her arms and flung the child in the air, catching her easily as she squealed and giggled.</p><p>Why must men fling babies about? Even Winter, the most staid of her brothers, was prone to the disease. \u201cI\u2019m always afraid you\u2019ll drop her when you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never do,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing home in the middle of the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf the boys were absent, sick from some type of fever, and the other half could not concentrate.\u201d Winter shrugged. \u201cI sent the remaining boys home. Where is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children have already eaten. Nell has taken them for a morning walk.\u201d</p><p>Winter glanced over the baby\u2019s shoulder, eyebrows raised. \u201cAll of the children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones big enough to walk anyway,\u201d Silence said, feeling guilty. \u201cI should have gone with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Winter said hastily. He tucked the baby against his side and took down a plate from the cupboard. \u201cWe all must take a respite from work now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t lost a dear one recently,\u201d he replied softly.</p><p>She pressed her lips together for a moment, then rose and took the plate from her brother. Silence crossed to the hearth and filled the plate with porridge from a pot hanging there. She brought the plate back to the table and set it in front of him.</p><p>\u201cLet me take Mary. She\u2019ll have the porridge all over your coat in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Winter said. He spooned up a mouthful of the thick porridge and murmured in contentment as he ate it. \u201cThat\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNell made it,\u201d Silence said drily. Her own cooking left much to be desired. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Winter swallowed and gestured to the wooden box. \u201cI found that on the front step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Silence felt a spark of curiosity and looked at the box with more animation than she\u2019d had in days. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s Mary Darling\u2019s admirer?\u201d</p><p>Winter smiled gently. \u201cI could venture a guess, but it seems more logical to simply open it and find out.\u201d</p><p>Silence stuck out her tongue at her brother. She turned the box over in her fingers. It was no bigger than the size of her palm. As she examined the box, she realized that although it was very plain, without marking or paint, the box was finely worked. It shone with beeswax. She frowned uneasily. The box was much dearer than Mary\u2019s other gifts.</p> <p>Mary Darling grabbed for the box, held so temptingly in front of her.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, sweetie,\u201d Silence said. \u201cWe need to see what\u2019s inside first.\u201d</p><p>She laid the box on the table, opened the lid, and gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Winter half rose to look.</p><p>Silence turned the box so that he could see the strand of pearls coiled inside.</p> <p>He was quiet a moment; then he lifted the necklace with his long, elegant fingers. He held the pearls up, watching as they gleamed in the light. \u201cThis is a very expensive present for a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for Mary Darling,\u201d Silence whispered. She held up the scrap of paper that had lain under the pearls. Two words were written upon it.</p><p>Silence Hollingbrook.</p><p>WHEN HERO WOKE, she knew even before she opened her eyes that Griffin was no longer with her. She lay, unmoving, eyes shut, as if to put off the inevitable realization that he was gone. The bed was cold. He\u2019d been gone a long time.</p><p>She curled her fingers into fists and was startled to feel something in her right hand. She opened her eyes to see and brought her hand closer to her face. It was late morning, the light shining from her window bright and strong.</p><p>The thing in her hand was her diamond earring. Hero traced the bobble with one fingertip. The diamond earring Griffin had picked up after she\u2019d thrown it at him so long ago now. She looked at it, and tears filled her eyes as she understood the message.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t coming back.</p><p>IT WAS LATE morning by the time Griffin climbed the steps to his town house. His legs felt leaden, his chest heavy and clogged.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head at the familiar voice. Mater stood on his step, wrapped in a velvet cape.</p><p>He stopped and said stupidly, \u201cWhat are doing here? Has something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas something happened?\u201d she repeated incredulously. \u201cYes, something happened\u2014you beat Thomas, say you\u2019ve seduced his fianc\u00e9e, and then you both virtually disappear! I want to know what is going on and how you\u2019ll resolve this horrible difference between you two. It\u2019s worse now than before you came back to London. What has happened to our family?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, this strong little woman, and saw her shoulders sag. She\u2019d withstood Pater\u2019s death, withstood debt and scandal, and now she was near defeat because of him. His mouth tasted of ashes.</p><p>Add his mother\u2019s disillusionment to his sins.</p> <p>He glanced around and realized they were in a public place. One of his neighbors was peering at them avidly from behind her curtains.</p><p>Griffin took Mater\u2019s arm. \u201cCome inside, dearest.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him uncertainly, and in the morning sunshine, the lines about her eyes were clear. \u201cGriffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>He led her into his library and realized his mistake immediately when he glanced to the spot beside the settee where he\u2019d made love to Hero. He swore under his breath, but where else was he to put her? Half the rooms were in sheets because he didn\u2019t bother using them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, touching his arm worriedly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said, and strode to the door to bellow for a servant. A full minute elapsed before a blowsy maid scurried into view. \u201cBring some hot tea and cakes.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied. \u201c \u2019Aven\u2019t any cakes, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>Griffin grimaced. \u201cBread, then, or whatever else Cook can find.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door and turned back to the room, running his hands over his head. He wasn\u2019t wearing a wig, hadn\u2019t shaved in days, and his house and staff were wretched. Well, the last hardly mattered anymore. Once he\u2019d dealt with the Vicar, he\u2019d let the lease lapse and remove himself and Deedle to the north. Deedle hated it there, but Griffin would be damned if he\u2019d stay in the same city as Thomas and Hero.</p><p>\u201cGriffin?\u201d Mater said softly.</p><p>Damn it. Mater had never cared to rusticate. He\u2019d be leaving her behind as well. Unless she decided to take up residence in a city nearer the Mandeville estate. But that still wasn\u2019t London.</p><p>Nothing was the same as London.</p><p>\u201cGriffin!\u201d His mother crossed the room and took his hands. \u201cYou must tell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>He smiled wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s not so very dramatic as all that, Mater. I\u2019m making plans to leave London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t live here with Thomas and her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Hero, you mean.\u201d She half laughed, and he opened his eyes to see her staring at him in exasperation. \u201cAre we not to speak her name now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be rather hard for Thomas,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cHe\u2019s not...\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey will be married Sunday.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her hands and crossed to pour himself a healthy glassful of brandy.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d marry her?\u201d he asked, his back still turned to her. \u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDoes it matter? Anyway, Thomas will have his revenge for my seduction of Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d She made a dismissive sound. \u201cI never believed you\u2019d seduced Anne.\u201d</p><p>He turned, vaguely surprised\u2014and rather grateful. \u201cNo? Everyone else did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your mother, Griffin.\u201d She placed her hands on her hips and looked at him with exasperation. \u201cDo give me some credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mater, I love you so.\u201d He smiled wryly and drank some brandy, wincing slightly as it burned his gullet.</p><p>\u201cNo one believes that old gossip anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas does.\u201d</p><p>She stared. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and drank some more brandy. The second sip was smoother. Perhaps he\u2019d become a sot.</p><p>\u201cBut that can\u2019t be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid so himself,\u201d he assured her. \u201cGot it from Anne\u2019s own lips as she lay dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl always was a ninny, God rest her soul,\u201d Mater muttered. \u201cDid you tell him point-blank that you didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he point-blank did not believe me, perhaps because of my recent actions with Lady Hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an entirely different matter,\u201d Mater said.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo Thomas I doubt it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne was his wife. Lady Hero is only affianced to him. Besides...\u201d She trailed off, biting her lip.</p><p>Griffin narrowed his eyes at her suspiciously. \u201cBesides what?\u201d</p><p>She waved an irritable hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not my secret to divulge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t growl at me.\u201d She locked gazes with him for a moment, then looked away. \u201cHe can be so foolish sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business, Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it involves Hero, it is. I love her.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened immediately. \u201cOh, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, unfortunately,\u201d he said. \u201cNow tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Thomas took up with a rather risqu\u00e9 lady last season, a Mrs. Tate. He tried to hide it from me, of course, but I saw nonetheless. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her when he\u2019d see her at a ball or some other such place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas has a mistress? Damn it, I knew it! He was following her at Harte\u2019s Folly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather more than a mistress I think, although perhaps he doesn\u2019t know it himself,\u201d she said somewhat obscurely.</p><p>Griffin\u2019s anger was building. How dare Thomas marry Hero already encumbered by a mistress? \u201cHas he broken it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Mater replied. \u201cI thought he had when he proposed to Lady Hero, but now I think he\u2019s seeing Mrs. Tate again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo punish Hero,\u201d Griffin growled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I think he\u2019s formed a tendre for the woman.\u201d Mater shook her head sadly. \u201cI love Thomas dearly\u2014he is my firstborn son\u2014but he can be so very boneheaded. He should let Lady Hero go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Griffin tossed back the rest of the brandy. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that doesn\u2019t matter to me in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d He tried to smile and failed. \u201cShe won\u2019t marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Mater frowned ferociously. \u201cShe might say she doesn\u2019t want to marry you, but I don\u2019t for a moment believe she doesn\u2019t love you. A woman like Lady Hero does not let a man into her bed out of the bonds of wedlock unless she\u2019s fallen head over heels for him.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his glass, unable to meet her gaze. He suddenly found it hard to speak. \u201cShe\u2019s hiding it well if she does love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only we had more time,\u201d his mother burst out. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d come to her senses if Thomas would just wait to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wakefield who is pushing the marriage.\u201d Griffin shook his head. \u201cAnd in any case, I truly don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be changing her mind. I have business to finish here, and then I\u2019ll be leaving for Lancashire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t leave!\u201d Mater cried. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? If you just give her time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay and watch her marry Thomas!\u201d he hissed, the pain surfacing despite his efforts to keep it submerged. He glanced at her and then away again at the pity in her eyes. \u201cI simply can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGriffin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He cut the air with the blade of his hand. \u201cJust listen. I\u2019ll finish my business, and then I\u2019m moving north permanently. I\u2019ll either transfer my business north somehow or have my agents act for me in London. I\u2019m not coming back.\u201d</p><p>She watched him silently, but tears swam in her eyes. He could see them clearly.</p><p>It was more than he could bear.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love me. I have to accept that fact and go on.\u201d He picked up the decanter and a glass and strode to the door. He paused there, his back to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then he fled to his rooms. If he was lucky, he\u2019d be insensibly drunk in an hour.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>The queen returned to her rooms that night with a heavy heart. Her suitors were right: She must make a decision and choose the perfect man to wed, but the thought filled her with sorrow. She went to her balcony and saw that the little brown bird was already perched there.</p><p>Queen Ravenhair picked up the bird and found about his neck a string with a tiny mirror tied to the end.

She had retired to the sitting room with a pot of tea, now cooling on the low table in front of her. The room smelled of roses, because a giant vase of the flowers sat on the corner table.

She\u2019d gone off to try and reason with Maximus, but Hero had very little hope that even Cousin Bathilda would persuade Maximus to put off the wedding. Once Maximus set his mind to something, he was like a granite boulder: hard and immovable.</p><p>Not that it mattered, really.</p><p>If she were to marry Thomas, this Sunday or a Sunday months from now it made no difference. She didn\u2019t even care about the inevitable scandal. She knew she should. A small part of her mind was wailing that she should be panicked, should be pacing or throwing hysterics herself. And yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care.</p><p>She was making a mistake.</p> <p>Hero sighed and dropped the earring next to her tea-cup. She couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was making a terrible, irredeemable mistake.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Phoebe called from the doorway as she entered. \u201cWherever has Cousin Bathilda gone? I can\u2019t seem to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, love,\u201d Hero said, feeling guilty. \u201cShe\u2019s gone off in a frenzy to speak to Maximus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phoebe said, sitting down on a chair at right angles to Hero\u2019s settee.</p><p>Phoebe\u2019s little shoulders drooped. Hero bit her lip. \u201cDid Maximus talk to you?\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe nodded, looking down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Phoebe straightened a bit. \u201cAll those balls and such. It would have been wearying, I expect, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is rather tiring,\u201d Hero said gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d Phoebe wrinkled her nose. \u201cI would\u2019ve liked to have danced with a gentleman not related to me once. Just once.\u201d</p><p>Hero felt tears prick her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best. I do understand that.\u201d Phoebe inhaled and looked up. \u201cDid Cousin Bathilda go to talk to Maximus about your marriage?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was diffident and Hero felt worse. They\u2019d not told Phoebe anything, but she must\u2019ve been aware of the household turmoil the last couple of days.</p><p>\u201cYou know Maximus said I had to marry this Sunday?\u201d Hero asked.</p><p>\u201cOne of the servants overheard something and told me.\u201d Phoebe\u2019s eyes dropped. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like him anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he hit you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Phoebe looked at her worriedly. \u201cThat\u2019s where you got that bruise on your cheek, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hero winced as she touched her cheek. It was turning a rather vivid purple. \u201cBut he has sent his apologies.\u201d She gestured to the vase of roses.</p><p>Phoebe examined them. \u201cSo that\u2019s who they\u2019re from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re quite extravagant. He must be feeling guilty. But then he should feel guilty. I don\u2019t think you ought to marry him,\u201d Phoebe said earnestly. \u201cNot if he\u2019s hurt you. What is Maximus thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not quite that simple.\u201d Hero sighed and picked up the diamond earring, twisting it between her fingers. \u201cMaximus is doing what he thinks is best for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandeville acted out of anger\u2014I did something to anger him terribly. He\u2019s a very trustworthy man usually. Maximus knows this and knows he will make a responsible, solid husband for me.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe wrinkled her nose. \u201cResponsible. Solid.\u201d</p><p>When repeated flatly like that, Thomas\u2019s attributes sounded less sterling. Nevertheless, Hero nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems rather boring reasons for marrying someone.\u201d</p><p>Hero bit her lip. \u201cMarriage is supposed to be boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Phoebe asked. \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be exciting and... and an adventure? I\u2019m sure if you looked a bit more, you could find a man who made your heart thrill when you saw him.\u201d</p><p>Made her heart thrill. That was what she felt like when she saw Griffin. But he was wholly inappropriate, wasn\u2019t he? Phoebe was simply too young to understand.</p><p>Hero shook her head, staring at the earring in her hand.</p><p>Phoebe leaned forward to peer at her hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the earbob you lost at your engagement ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hero folded her fingers protectively around the little piece.</p><p>\u201cBut how wonderful that you\u2019ve found it again,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like having an entirely new set when one finds a lost earring, I always think.\u201d</p><p>Hero raised her eyebrows in faint amusement. \u201cHow often do you lose earrings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite often, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cThey just seem to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother is as stubborn as a mule!\u201d Cousin Bathilda cried as she entered the sitting room. Mignon barked as if to emphasize the pronouncement.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t move the date?\u201d Hero asked.</p><p>\u201cNot only would he not move the date, but he also wouldn\u2019t even discuss the matter.\u201d Cousin Bathilda plopped onto the settee beside Hero, earning a growly grumble from Mignon. \u201cThen he had the temerity to tell me that he had business to conduct and that our interview was over! Can you imagine? Where that man became so rude, I haven\u2019t the faintest. Your mother was the height of civility, my dears, a true lady, even without the title, and I certainly never led him to believe that such conduct to his elders was a matter of course.\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda was busy twitching her skirts in her agitation, and the constant movement was apparently too much for Mignon. The little spaniel got up from her lap and delicately stepped onto Hero\u2019s lap, where she settled with a long-suffering sigh.</p><p>Hero stroked Mignon\u2019s silky ears. \u201cWould you like some tea, Cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea would be quite the thing,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said. \u201cBut this pot has gone cold no doubt. Phoebe, will you be a dear and call for another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Cousin Bathilda.\u201d Phoebe obediently rose.</p><p>Bathilda cast a glance at the girl as she crossed to the door. \u201cHow much does she know of the matter, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably everything,\u201d Hero said wearily. \u201cThe servants can\u2019t help but overhear and they gossip, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWretched gossip!\u201d Cousin Bathilda humphed. Phoebe returned and Bathilda smoothed her face. \u201cThank you, my dear. I\u2019m glad to know that I instilled some manners in you girls at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could make Maximus do something he didn\u2019t want to do, manners or not,\u201d Phoebe said cheerfully. \u201cHe\u2019s the duke, after all. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to imagine him as anything else, but he must\u2019ve been a baby with pap on his face once upon a time.\u201d She frowned uncertainly. \u201cHe was, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Bathilda said. \u201cHe was an adorable baby, although very grave even when in leading strings. Your mother used to laugh at his solemn face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d Phoebe leaned forward. She was always interested in discussions of their parents. Since she\u2019d only been an infant when they died, she had no memories of them.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said, \u201cthough your father chided her for it. He said such solemnity in a boy would make a good duke in a man. And he was right\u2014Maximus is a magnificent duke, even if he is stubborn as a mule.\u201d</p><p>The maids entered with new tea things, and there was silence a moment as they cleared the old tea away and set out the new. Hero thanked them and they curtsied and quietly left the room.</p><p>\u201cThis looks nice and hot,\u201d Cousin Bathilda said as she sat forward to pour. \u201cPhoebe, would you like a dish? Hero?\u201d</p><p>Hero shook her head, and Cousin Bathilda assembled a dish of tea for Phoebe and one for herself.</p><p>Cousin Bathilda sat back with her dish, inhaling the steam. \u201cAh, this is restorative. I can\u2019t think why your brother must torment me so, my dears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps his business was very important,\u201d Phoebe offered as she sipped her own tea.</p><p>Cousin Bathilda snorted delicately. \u201cHe said so and perhaps thought so, but I don\u2019t see how arresting some illicit gin maker in the worst part of St. Giles can be all that important no matter what he says or thinks.\u201d</p><p>Mignon squeaked as Hero clutched involuntarily at her ear. Maximus was after a gin maker in St. Giles\u2014today! Griffin had said just last night that he\u2019d argued with Maximus. If Maximus saw Griffin as a threat to her marriage to Thomas, he might consider it a deed well done to get Griffin out of the way.</p><p>Hero shivered as fear raced up her spine. Her brother could be very ruthless, but surely\u2014surely!\u2014he wouldn\u2019t move against Griffin when she was about to marry Thomas. Hadn\u2019t he promised her? But, no, he hadn\u2019t actually put the promise into words\u2014he\u2019d simply asked if she wanted Griffin arrested. The implication had been that he would have Griffin arrested if she didn\u2019t marry Thomas. But after that, Griffin had argued with Maximus. Had Maximus decided to eliminate the threat that Griffin posed to her marriage to Thomas?</p><p>Cousin Bathilda glanced at her. \u201cSomething the matter, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I was just wondering when Maximus plans to arrest this gin distiller.\u201d Hero dug her fingers into Mignon\u2019s soft fur, and Mignon licked her hand.</p><p>\u201cAt this very moment,\u201d Cousin Bathilda replied, causing Hero\u2019s heart to nearly stop. \u201cWell, soon in any case. He was muttering something about taking soldiers and finding his informant as he escorted me to his door.\u201d</p><p>Hero leaned forward urgently. \u201cThen he hasn\u2019t done it yet? There\u2019s still time?\u201d</p><p>Cousin Bathilda looked startled and slowly lowered her teacup. \u201cWhy, yes, I suppose so, dear. Whyever do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ve remembered an appointment,\u201d Hero said, standing and unceremoniously dumping Mignon to the floor. The little dog squawked and retreated under the settee. \u201cIs the carriage still in front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cousin Bathilda called behind Hero as she rushed to the door. \u201cHero, what is this about?\u201d</p><p>But Hero was already in the outer hallway making for the stairs. She hadn\u2019t time to explain to either Bathilda or Phoebe. She hadn\u2019t time to find help. She had to go to St. Giles and warn Griffin before her brother threw him in gaol...</p><p>On a hanging charge.</p><p>THOMAS WAS SURPRISED to see a coach outside Lavinia\u2019s house when he climbed down from his carriage late that afternoon. He frowned, a vague worry beginning to niggle at the back of his mind as he knocked at her door.</p><p>The imposing butler answered and scowled down at him. Thomas didn\u2019t bother with any niceties. He brushed past the man, noticing crates and baskets piled against the walls of the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Tate is in her rooms,\u201d the man said sourly\u2014and he dropped the \u201cmy lord,\u201d Thomas noted.</p><p>Thomas ran up the stairs without another word. Damn the man anyway; he was but a mere servant. Thomas was determined to have a word with Lavinia about her staff, but when he reached her rooms, he stopped dead instead. Every drawer was opened in her bureau, and her wardrobe was flung wide. Dresses, petticoats, stockings, shoes, chemises, and other female odds and ends were strewn on every available surface. And in the midst of all this chaos, Lavinia was directing two maids as they packed the clothes into boxes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>She looked up at his voice, and her face went completely blank.</p><p>Something in the vicinity of his heart constricted. \u201cLavinia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartha, Maisie, please help the footmen in the downstairs sitting rooms,\u201d Lavinia said.</p><p>The maids bobbed curtsies and left the room, shooting him curious looks.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care what was going through their pea brains. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m packing to leave of course.\u201d</p><p>She wore a simple gray dress today\u2014not at all her usual style\u2014and against her bright wine-red hair, it gave her a severe look.</p><p>He had a savage urge to tear it from her body.</p><p>\u201cI thought...\u201d He had to stop and swallow past a sudden swelling in his throat. He had a wrenching, horrifying notion that he might weep. \u201cI thought you would stay with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I let you bed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, damn you!\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBut I told you already that I will not be your mistress while you are married to another woman, Thomas. I never changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the bed, but he grabbed her arm roughly. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She raised her eyebrows and looked at him, sadly it seemed. \u201cBut you know love has very little to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he whispered, and because he was in despair, he took her mouth.</p><p>She let him. She stood silent and complacent, made no move to struggle, as he ground her lips beneath his. She tasted of mint and tea, and he groaned, growing erect. She\u2019d always done this to him, since the very first time he\u2019d seen her, laughing at some other man in a ballroom. She brought out the animal side of him, made him forget he was a peer, a respected member of parliament, and a gentleman who owned vast amounts of land.</p><p>She made him into a man, only a man, and in the past he\u2019d hated her for it: reminding him that beneath the ermine robes he was merely blood and bone like any other wretch who scrabbled for a living in London. But here, now, he no longer cared. He was going to lose her, once and for all. She would simply walk away, wine-red hair, maddening laugh, and those plain brown eyes that saw all of his most shameful secrets and loved him anyway.</p><p>And in the end, when he finally took his mouth from hers, she simply looked at him and turned away. She picked up a stocking and began carefully rolling it. \u201cGood-bye, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>He sank to his knees, there in her room on the carpet that was worn in spots, and said the first thing that popped into his mind. \u201cPlease marry me, Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU LOOK LIKE you\u2019ve died, been buried for three days, and then been dug up,\u201d Deedle greeted Griffin cordially that evening in St. Giles. Deedle tilted his head and took a closer look. \u201cAnd been to \u2019ell in the meantime, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, I have,\u201d Griffin growled as he filled a nosebag for Rambler.</p><p>He\u2019d not sufficiently trusted any of the men at the still to put them in charge, so he\u2019d been forced to press Deedle into service. His valet stood, armed like a buccaneer, two pistols in his belt and a sword as well. Griffin looked up at the sky. The day was fleeing fast as night cast long shadows in St. Giles.</p><p>Deedle pushed his tongue through the hole in the front of his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2019appened to you, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>Griffin shook his head, then stopped as it throbbed in warning. \u201cNothing to worry yourself over.\u201d</p><p>Deedle snorted. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it or leave it, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d Griffin strode into the dim interior of the still warehouse. He hadn\u2019t the patience to argue semantics with Deedle this evening.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave it,\u201d Deedle said, skipping to keep up with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened since I was here last?\u201d Griffin asked.</p> <p>Deedle sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost two more men overnight. That brings us to five, not including we two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou doubled their pay again?\u201d</p><p>Deedle nodded. \u201cJust like you said to. Didn\u2019t keep those two fellows from doin\u2019 a runner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose it matters much anymore anyway,\u201d Griffin said. He watched dispassionately as his remaining men filled oaken barrels with gin. \u201cThe whole thing\u2019ll be over after tonight.\u201d</p><p>Deedle came around to face him. \u201cThen it\u2019s tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Griffin gazed at the big copper kettles, the barrels of waiting gin, the fires, and the huge warehouse itself. Everything he and Nick had worked so hard to build. \u201cYes, tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Deedle breathed. \u201cAre you sure? We\u2019ve less than a dozen men and not all the supplies you wanted. M\u2019lord, it\u2019ll be near suicide.\u201d</p><p>Griffin stared back at Deedle, his gaze level, his head pounding, his mouth tasting of blood and bile. He\u2019d lost Hero, would lose his mother to London, never had a chance of reconciling with Thomas in the first place, and Nick, his dear friend, was dead and buried. The bloody still was the last thing he had left in London.</p><p>\u201cTonight or never. I\u2019m not waiting any longer. I want this over with.\u201d He turned and picked up one of the wicked-looking swords his men used and then glared back at Deedle. \u201cAre you with me or not?\u201d</p><p>Deedle swallowed and gripped his pistol. \u201cAye, m\u2019lord, I am.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Tears filled Queen Ravenhair\u2019s eyes at the simplicity and beauty of the tiny mirror\u2019s message.</p><p>She held the bird in the hollow of her palms. \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d she whispered into the downy feathers. \u201cWho shall I take as husband?\u201d</p><p>She let the bird go and he flew away. But instead of disappearing for the night as usual, it was back again within minutes. It alighted and opened its beak to sing.</p><p>Let the heart of the heart decide....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>\u201c \u2019E\u2019s cornered,\u201d Freddy said with satisfaction that evening. \u201cReading won\u2019t be getting out of this one alive, I\u2019m thinking. \u2019E\u2019s lost Nick Barnes and most of \u2019is men have deserted \u2019im.\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded, listening with one ear to the click of the dice in his fingers and with the other for any sound overhead. \u201cOur informant has told Wakefield where Reading\u2019s still is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold \u2019im and is leading \u2019im to Reading\u2019s still as we speak,\u201d Freddy said. So great was his glee that he almost looked Charlie full in the face.</p><p>Almost, but not quite.</p><p>Charlie spilled the dice to the table. Two aces. Deuce. For a moment he stared, mesmerized by the ill omen. Deuce could foretell death, but whose\u2014his enemy\u2019s or his own... or perhaps the woman who lay above?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll draw him out,\u201d Charlie whispered, still mesmerized by the unlucky dice throw. \u201cDraw him out, kill him, and fire the still.\u201d</p><p>THE SKY WAS turning gray as Hero climbed from her carriage at the edge of St. Giles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this, my lady,\u201d George the footman said. He hoisted a lantern and fingered one of the pistols she\u2019d given him.</p><p>A shout rose from the group of men arguing over an overturned cart in the road. Her carriage was stuck behind the accident in a street too narrow to turn around.</p><p>\u201cI understand your objections,\u201d Hero murmured. \u201cBut I cannot wait for them to clear the road. It could take hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeggin\u2019 your pardon, my lady, but couldn\u2019t we send word back home for another footman or two to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you. I haven\u2019t the time.\u201d Hero picked up her skirts and began to walk briskly away from her carriage and the accident.</p><p>\u201cBut after dark,\u201d George fretted. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re attacked, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the pistols,\u201d Hero said soothingly.</p><p>George looked unconvinced by this assurance, but he made no more protestations. Instead he fixed a suspicious eye on their surroundings.</p><p>Hero bit her lip as she wrapped her cloak about herself. She couldn\u2019t blame George. This expedition was dangerous\u2014very dangerous. Normally she\u2019d never even contemplate going into St. Giles after dark, let alone on foot and with but a single bodyguard. She was quite aware of the dangers St. Giles posed.</p><p>But what other choice did she have? She needed to get to Griffin\u2019s still as soon as possible. She hadn\u2019t wanted to risk arousing Cousin Bathilda\u2019s suspicions by taking more than one footman.</p><p>Hero glanced about them. The street they were in was darkening and becoming deserted as she watched. Everyone seemed to want to get inside before full dark. She shivered. Dear Lord, what if she was too late and Maximus had already made his raid on the still? The thought of Griffin in chains, of him being thrown into some wretched prison, was almost more than she could bear. He was so proud! Worse, what if he resisted being taken? What if he were shot?</p><p>She nearly sobbed at the thought. This was insane. Just last night she\u2019d rejected him as thoroughly as if she\u2019d written it all down on paper. Now she was racing through the St. Giles alleys in fear for his life.</p><p>Had she gone insane? Or had she simply made a terrible mistake?</p><p>Why had she sent him away in the first place? All the considered arguments she\u2019d given him, all the well-reasoned points, none of them made sense anymore. All she knew was what her innermost heart felt: she wanted Griffin. Despite his wild ways, despite his shady past, despite the fact that her brother was about to arrest him for distilling gin.</p><p>She wanted Griffin. She\u2019d die if anything happened to him, and she very much feared that her life would be a long, gray, boring test of endurance without him in it. She wanted him, she needed him, and yes, she loved him\u2014she\u2019d admit it now that it might be too late. She loved him.</p><p>And that was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cTHIS\u2019S BARMY,\u201d DEEDLE hissed under his breath.</p><p>Griffin glanced back at him over his shoulder. Night had fallen, and the alley behind the warehouse still was swallowed by shadows. The blackness was a boon for the predators of the night, hiding any lurking assassin or creeping attacker.</p><p>Of course, the shadows also hid those who preyed upon the predators. Tonight that included Griffin and Deedle.</p><p>Griffin checked with his fingers that his gun was cocked. \u201cIt might be barmy, but it\u2019s our only chance.\u201d</p><p>Deedle grunted. \u201cThe Vicar and \u2019is gang won\u2019t be expecting us\u2014that\u2019s for certain. Not sitting out \u2019ere in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Something scraped and Griffin turned his head toward the sound, alert and silent. A low shape darted across the alley.</p><p>\u201cCat,\u201d Deedle whispered. \u201cThink the Vicar will attack tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been waiting since they killed Nick,\u201d Griffin murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s hoping most of my men have fled\u2014which they have, damn him\u2014and he wants me desperate and afraid. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a good chance that tonight\u2019s the night.\u201d</p><p>Deedle gripped Griffin\u2019s shoulder just as Griffin saw the shadow move. Three men were creeping up the alley. One leaped and clawed at the wall of the warehouse. They were going to stop the chimneys again in preparation for the rest of the attack, if Griffin wasn\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>Griffin charged low and fast and without sound. He caught the first man by the hair and clubbed him with the butt of his gun. The man went down like a felled tree. The second man shouted, but Deedle shot him. Griffin turned and aimed at the man scaling the wall. He squeezed the trigger and felt his chest expand in savage triumph when the man fell.</p><p>Then someone hit him from the side. His pistol flew from his hand as he was thrown violently against the wall. His attacker was a giant with a giant\u2019s fists, pounding at his face, his belly. Griffin gasped, winded, the world spinning. He drew his pistol and shot point-blank into the other man\u2019s face.</p><p>He felt the sting of gunpowder against the side of his face, the spray of something wet and sticky. He pushed aside the body and glanced up, his ears strangely muffled. Men were pouring in at the far end of the alley, running toward him and Deedle, at least twenty of them, maybe more.</p><p>It was a trap, he thought, oddly composed. The Vicar had been waiting for them to emerge from the walls of the still warehouse. And they had. They had.</p><p>Griffin walked to the middle of the alley and turned, drawing his sword to face the oncoming slaughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cM\u2019lord,\u201d Deedle wheezed beside him. \u201cWho the \u2019ell is that?\u201d</p><p>And Griffin looked over his shoulder and realized that a second group of men blocked the other end of the alley, marching in line, coming toward them. Behind them were men on horseback.</p><p>\u201cSoldiers.\u201d He spat blood into the dust at his feet. \u201cThe Duke of Wakefield is coming to arrest me if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God in heaven,\u201d Deedle muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re dead, m\u2019lord. Dead!\u201d</p> <p>And Griffin threw back his head and laughed. The sound echoed off the filthy brick walls that enclosed the alley he was about to die in.</p><p>SILENCE HURRIED HOME, through the darkened streets of St. Giles.</p><p>She\u2019d meant to take only a quick trip to visit one of the home\u2019s wet nurses and her tiny charge. But the moment she\u2019d entered the woman\u2019s apartment, she\u2019d immediately caught the astringent scent of gin. That had led to recriminations, protests, and a rather awful scene before she\u2019d finally walked out with the orphaned infant. No matter how sorry she might feel for the wet nurse\u2014a widow with a child of her own\u2014Silence couldn\u2019t risk the well-being of such a tiny baby. The nursling was only a month or so old\u2014a fragile age for a baby.</p><p>She\u2019d known of another possible wet nurse for the baby, but the second woman lived nearly a mile away from the first, and in the opposite direction of the home. She\u2019d hurried there as fast as she could walk with the babe in her arms. And in the end, Silence had been very satisfied with the placement. The new wet nurse, Polly, had been employed in the past by the home and had always given satisfactory service. Although her own children were now weaned, Polly assured Silence that she had enough milk for the orphaned infant.</p><p>A good day\u2019s work, but an exhausting one, and the reason she was now caught out after dark.</p> <p>Silence pulled her light woolen cloak more securely about her shoulders and eyed a dark doorway as she passed it. She was trying very hard not to think of some of the awful tales she heard from Nell\u2014an inveterate teller of horror stories. The woman who\u2019d been strangled by a lover. The woman who\u2019d been dragged into an alley and savagely attacked by three drunken men. The woman who had gone out to buy a meat pie for her four children and simply disappeared, her shoe found the next day in an alley.</p><p>Silence shivered. All of Nell\u2019s stories had two common elements: They were all about women out alone.</p><p>And they all took place after dark.</p><p>A cry came from up ahead, and Silence\u2019s steps faltered. She was in a wide street, but there were no cross streets nearby. Only a single flickering lantern hung over a tiny cobbler\u2019s shop. Voices could be heard and lights, growing stronger, coming nearer.</p><p>Silence looked about desperately. A man shouted an angry curse. Then a crowd came tearing around the corner of the street up ahead. There were men holding torches, but also women. They milled and shouted, and in the middle was some kind of wretched thing that they were dragging by a collar.</p><p>Someone smashed a window and Silence flinched. She was already backing away, turning to hurry up the street she\u2019d just walked down. But that direction was away from the home. She looked over her shoulder as two men dragged the wretch they\u2019d caught to the middle of the street and began beating him with cudgels.</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Ave mercy!\u201d she heard their victim cry.</p><p>There were more curses and amid them a single hoarse shout she could make out: \u201cInformer!\u201d</p><p>Dear Lord, they were lynching a gin informer.</p><p>Doors opened up ahead, but when she looked there hopefully, more people came out and ran toward the horrible scene behind her. The street was suddenly filled with shouting madmen. Someone jostled her and Silence tripped. She fell against a house wall, pressing herself back.</p><p>A drunken man loomed in front of her, hands twitching, ugly mouth leering. Without a word, he snatched the hood from her head, pulling her hair painfully as he did so. Behind him, flames shot up to the sky, framing his black face with orange. What in God\u2019s name were they doing to the poor informer?</p><p>But she had worse to think about right in front of her. The ugly man leaned over her menacingly.</p><p>Silence darted to the right and for a split second felt a rush of welcome relief because she thought she was free.</p><p>Then a heavy hand caught her by the hair, and she knew the night was about to become a nightmare.</p> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>The queen tossed and turned that night on her royal bed, but in the morning she had come to a decision. She dressed with care, wearing her best cloth of gold gown and a diamond and ruby crown. Then she strode into the throne room to meet her suitors. The princes had dressed in their best as well. Prince Eastsun shone in robes of gold and silver, Prince Westmoon wore a doublet sewn with emeralds, and Prince Northwind was fairly encrusted with pearls. All three men stood tall and handsome, perfectly perfect in their splendor.</p><p>\u201cHave you made your decision?\u201d Prince Eastsun asked.</p><p>Queen Ravenhair tilted her chin. \u201cYes....\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>The first wave of attackers hit like a battering ram. They didn\u2019t seem to have pistols, but they were armed with cudgels, and a few bore swords. Griffin fired his last shot from his remaining pistol, taking down the man leading the charge.</p><p>Griffin drew his sword. \u201cFor Nick Barnes!\u201d</p><p>A shot came from behind him, and then the Vicar\u2019s men from one end and the soldiers from the other converged, and he and Deedle were in the middle of a melee. Griffin swung his sword with one hand, nearly severing a man\u2019s arm. The man howled and fell and was trampled by a horse.</p><p>For a moment, through the mass of heaving men, Griffin saw a face\u2014or what might be a face in a nightmare. The man\u2019s flesh looked as if it had turned to wax and melted down the side of his skull before hardening in a grotesque parody of facial features. Griffin blinked and the vision was gone.</p><p>Griffin punched another man and was shoved hard in return. Someone swung a cudgel at him, and he took the blow on his left shoulder, his entire arm going numb. He shook his head, trying to clear a trickle of blood from his eyes. He didn\u2019t even remember the wound from which it came. He expected at any moment to be shot or impaled from behind but didn\u2019t bother looking.</p><p>Death would find him soon enough.</p><p>Beside him Deedle cursed. Griffin turned to see Deedle stagger back from three men. His arm was painted red.</p><p>Griffin shouted and charged Deedle\u2019s attackers. He felt his face stretch into a grin as he threw the first man aside. The other two turned tail and ran. Then, suddenly, there was a break and he was face-to-face with a gleaming black boot ornamented with a gold spur. He looked up and saw Wakefield glowering down at him from atop a huge black horse.</p><p>\u201cReading!\u201d Wakefield shouted. \u201cIs this your still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Griffin replied, and elbowed a short, bandy-legged tough in the face.</p><p>Wakefield drew a pistol, aimed it over Griffin\u2019s head, pulled the trigger, and nearly deafened Griffin with the boom! He looked at Griffin again, frowning, and his lips moved, but Griffin couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>He was jostled from behind and Griffin turned. Deedle was using one of his pistols to beat a man about the head.</p><p>Griffin felt a touch on his shoulder and swung his sword.</p><p>Wakefield jerked up, then cupped his hand about his mouth, shouting. \u201cAre these your men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I be fighting my own men?\u201d Griffin asked in exasperation.</p><p>He dodged aside as a man staggered toward him, then kicked the fellow\u2019s feet out from under him before stomping him once viciously in the head. He glanced around. Most of the Vicar\u2019s men were fleeing in disorder, routed by the more experienced fighting of the soldiers.</p><p>\u201cIt appears you have a business rival, then,\u201d Wakefield observed.</p><p>He drew his sword and leaned down to slap the blade against the face of a charging rough. The man spun with the force of the blow and his own momentum, and Griffin finished him off by hitting him across the back of the head with the hilt of his sword. Griffin watched the man slump to the ground and then turned to Wakefield with a sarcastic reply on his lips.</p><p>But he saw a movement beyond Wakefield\u2019s giant horse, and Griffin\u2019s shoulders tensed in horror instead.</p><p>There at the mouth of the alley, Hero was picking her way delicately toward the fight, the footman beside her armed only with a lantern and a wavering drawn pistol.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Griffin breathed.</p><p>Wakefield glanced over his shoulder. \u201cWhat the hell is my sister doing here, Reading?\u201d</p><p>* *</p><p>THOMAS HAD NEVER knelt to anyone. He was aware as he looked up at Lavinia how humble the position was, but that was appropriate: He was a petitioner for her hand. Indeed, he was desperate for her hand. If Lavinia left him, he\u2019d have nothing. If she asked him, he\u2019d crawl to her on hands and knees.</p><p>Had she any idea the straits she\u2019d left him in?</p><p>But her brown eyes had filled with tears that made them glitter. \u201cYou know you cannot marry me, Thomas. You\u2019ve told me so many times before.\u201d</p><p>She started to turn from him, but he was up and off the rug in a thrice, taking her hand, holding it between his own. \u201cI\u2019ve told you so, but I lied, Lavinia. Both to me and to you. I can marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about Anne? What about your fears of betrayal?\u201d</p><p>He felt ignoble panic rise in his chest. \u201cThey don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYes, they do. Anne horribly betrayed you, and you haven\u2019t trusted a woman since. I can\u2019t live with the constant fear that I\u2019ll do something that you\u2019ll misinterpret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He closed his eyes, trying to control himself so he could make this important plea. \u201cI was a cad, I admit it, to ever doubt you. You never strayed from me when we were together. You weren\u2019t the one who found someone else. I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, hear me out.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cI know I am the problem. Griffin told me that he\u2019d never seduced Anne, yet I refused to give him the satisfaction of believing him. Please, please, Lavinia, trust me. Let me prove I can change.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head, trying ineffectually to wipe at the tears. \u201cWhat of parliament? Or the succession of the marquessate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d He shook his head, searching for the words, he who was known for his eloquence on the floor of the House of Lords. \u201cNone of that matters. Without you, I am a shadow of a man, a mere wisp. Parliament, even the marquessate, can survive without me, but I cannot survive without you.\u201d</p><p>She made a sort of gasping sound.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lavinia,\u201d he said, desperate now. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to change, because I\u2019ve tried to stop and I can\u2019t. I love you and I want to marry you. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Thomas!\u201d She was half laughing, half crying. Her eyes were red, her cheeks blotchy, and strangely she was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>HERO STARTED RUNNING the moment she saw Griffin beside Maximus on his horse. They were lit by flickering torches and in the midst of a desperate battle, but all she could see were the two men. Dear God, was her brother about to kill her lover?</p><p>\u201cMy lady!\u201d George shouted, and blocked a blow from a man with a large stick. \u201cMy lady, please!\u201d</p><p>Griffin ducked around Maximus\u2019s horse. He shoved aside a man in his way, stabbed another with his sword, and punched and then kicked a third. In all of this, he never took his eyes from Hero. Even in the dimly lit alley, his pale green eyes seemed to glow with a savage light. He reached her just as George gave a shout and fired his pistol.</p><p>Hero flinched and turned to see a man falling, bloody, at George\u2019s feet.</p><p>Then her shoulders were grabbed, and she was swung around. Griffin glared down at her. He\u2019d lost his wig and was bleeding from a cut on his forehead. Blackened blood was drying on the right side of his face, his right eye gleaming in the midst of the gore like a demon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She almost fainted from the relief of seeing him alive and whole. Thank God she\u2019d arrived in time. Thank God she\u2019d not have to spend the rest of her life mourning him. Thank God\u2014</p><p>Griffin opened his mouth. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, you bloody stupid woman?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and stiffened. \u201cI just spent the last hour traveling across London to get to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you never to go into St. Giles alone!\u201d He shook her.</p> <p>\u201cI had George\u2014\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cGeorge! One man! And after dark. Have you completely lost your senses?\u201d</p><p>She thrust up her chin. \u201cI was coming to rescue you, you... you cad!\u201d</p><p>Tears of humiliation and hurt were flooding her eyes. She shoved away from him and turned to flee.</p><p>He muttered a completely inappropriate curse and grabbed her from behind. He swung her around, and then his mouth was on hers, hot and angry and oh so alive.</p> <p>She was glad\u2014so very glad\u2014that he was well, even if he\u2019d just been awful to her, that she opened her lips beneath his and wrapped her arms as tightly as she could around his neck. Sight and sound and place disappeared until it was just the two of them, alone in their own world. Her heart was beating loud in her ears. She could smell gunpowder and sweat on him, and the sharp, acrid scents made him more real. More alive. She could taste her own tears on his lips\u2014tears of joy.</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d someone muttered in disgust nearby.</p><p>Griffin raised his head but didn\u2019t take his emerald eyes from hers. \u201cGo away, Wakefield.\u201d</p><p>Hero\u2019s eyes widened, and she glanced wildly around until she saw her brother, still seated on his black horse, staring disapprovingly down at them.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take him!\u201d she cried, and clutched at Griffin\u2019s broad shoulders. Maximus could hardly arrest Griffin if she clung to him bodily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to arrest me,\u201d Griffin said, arrogant as always. \u201cNot if you marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you blackmailing my sister?\u201d Maximus growled.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to.\u201d Griffin\u2019s gaze had returned to hers, and what she saw there suddenly made her heart fly free. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you, Hero.\u201d</p><p>She caressed his jaw\u2014the only part of him not covered in blood\u2014with unsteady fingers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to blackmail me to marry you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared and he pulled her close again. \u201cDo you mean that? You\u2019ll marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her, but just as she opened her mouth beneath his, he jerked his head up.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d A soldier had come running up to Maximus. \u201cThere\u2019s rioting just to the west of here. Shall we send for reinforcements?\u201d</p><p>Hero looked at Griffin in horror. \u201cThat\u2019s where the home is!\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cRight.\u201d He glanced about and bellowed, \u201cDeedle!\u201d</p><p>Griffin\u2019s valet appeared, his hair on end, one arm bloodied, but he was standing upright. \u201cAye, m\u2019lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the Vicar\u2019s men taken the bait?\u201d Griffin asked cryptically.</p><p>Maximus frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Deedle grinned from ear to ear. \u201c \u2019Is men are in and ours are out, m\u2019lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p><p>Deedle nodded. He placed two fingers between his lips and blew a shrill, piercing whistle.</p><p>Griffin turned to Maximus. \u201cI suggest you call your men to you.\u201d</p><p>Maximus raised his eyebrows suspiciously but shouted, \u201cTo me!\u201d</p><p>At once the remaining soldiers started for him.</p><p>\u201cTaking a while, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Deedle said worriedly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge concussion made the very ground shake. Bricks tumbled from the nearest buildings while at the same time an intense light lit the night. The smell of smoke filled the air.</p><p>Hero grabbed for Griffin. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll cut the Vicar down to size.\u201d Griffin grinned ferociously. \u201cNick would\u2019ve liked the pretty trap we set for the Vicar and his men.\u201d</p><p>Maximus, who had been eyeing the explosion, turned to look down at them. \u201cYou blew the still, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Griffin grinned. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea what you\u2019re talking about. But if a still did blow, it might be because a very insistent lady recently showed me the evils of gin and gin distilling.\u201d</p><p>Hero\u2019s heart swelled as tears pricked her eyes. \u201cOh, Griffin!\u201d</p><p>Maximus grunted. \u201cYou\u2019re an annoying prick, but I suppose I must accept you into the family.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Hero.</p><p>She tilted her chin up. \u201cUnless you prefer I elope?\u201d</p><p>Maximus shuddered. \u201cI\u2019d never hear the end of it from Cousin Bathilda if you did.\u201d He leaned down and offered his hand to Griffin. \u201cPax?\u201d</p><p>Griffin took the proffered hand. \u201cPax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Maximus straightened in the saddle. \u201cWhere is this orphanage?\u201d</p><p>SILENCE LOOKED UP at the drunken tough advancing on her and wondered if she would want to live after he finished with her.</p><p>A shout came from behind the man. Since it was merely one of many raucous voices raised in the night, her attacker ignored it. But he couldn\u2019t ignore the gloved hand that slapped down on his shoulder. The drunken lout began to turn, but he suddenly spun in an oddly graceful movement that ended with him face-first on the ground.</p><p>Silence blinked and glanced up at her savior.</p><p>And then she could only stare. The man before her looked like something out of a pantomime. He wore breeches and a tunic patterned all over in a harlequin\u2019s red and black diamonds. On his feet were tall black jackboots, and cuffed black gloves covered his hands. A grotesque half-mask with an enormous hooked nose concealed his features, leaving only his mouth and chin bare. As she looked at him, he doffed a huge wide-brimmed black hat and swept her a courtly bow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Ghost of St. Giles!\u201d she blurted.</p><p>His mouth curled at the corner, but he made no sound, simply gesturing with his hat before him as if to direct her path.</p><p>\u201cI live over there,\u201d she said, feeling a bit foolish for talking with a mute comic actor.</p><p>His mouth tightened, and again he bowed and most definitely directed her in the opposite way from the home.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I can trust you?\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned, which did not at all set her mind at rest. On the other hand, he had saved her, and with such a notorious escort, she had no fear of being accosted again.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She lifted her skirts and then stopped as she saw someone beyond him.</p><p>There on the other side of the street was Mickey O\u2019Connor. He stood facing her, hands on hips, a slight frown between his beautiful brows, making no attempt to conceal himself from her.</p><p>But then why would he have any reason to hide from her?</p><p>He nodded, acknowledging he knew she\u2019d seen him, and she looked away, her breath trembling in her throat. That was when she realized that the Ghost had tightened his fist on the hilt of his sword.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d she said, laying a hand on his arm.</p><p>He looked at her, his head cocked to the side in inquiry.</p><p>Silence didn\u2019t know if she was worried for him or for Mr. O\u2019Connor. She only knew she\u2019d seen enough bloodshed for the night. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once and removed his hand from the hilt of his sword.</p><p>Silence couldn\u2019t help it. She looked again across the street.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s black gaze bored into her. He didn\u2019t look at all happy.</p><p>She deliberately turned away. \u201cThis way, did you say?\u201d</p><p>The Ghost nodded and they set off. For the first couple of minutes, as Silence picked her way over the cobblestones, she felt Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s gaze on her back. She refused to turn around, to acknowledge him in any way, and after a bit she no longer felt the sensation.</p><p>She let out a breath and concentrated on her surroundings. The Ghost walked with an almost soundless tread, light and athletic. His head was up, and he seemed almost to scent the wind. Twice he stopped and turned down a different street as if to avoid the mob. Once he took her arm and urged her into a run, just before she heard shouts from behind them. Oddly, though he never spoke and she couldn\u2019t see most of his face, she never felt afraid of him.</p><p>When at last they came within sight of the temporary home, Silence stopped short. There was a crowd of people outside the home\u2019s doors, but she could see in the light of the lanterns they held that they were soldiers.</p><p>\u201cWhatever are soldiers doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Obviously she didn\u2019t expect an answer, but when she turned, she was surprised to find herself alone. She glanced quickly up the street, but there was no sign of the Ghost.</p><p>The Ghost had disappeared as abruptly as he\u2019d appeared.</p><p>\u201cMen are so maddening,\u201d Silence muttered to herself, and started for the home.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hollingbrook!\u201d Nell appeared at the home\u2019s door and ran toward her. \u201cOh, ma\u2019am! We were that worried for you. Three informers have been murdered tonight\u2014or so they say. There was rioting in the streets, and Mr. Makepeace has been beside himself. I\u2019ve never seen him in such a state before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Winter?\u201d Silence asked distractedly. \u201cIs that Lady Hero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Nell said. \u201cAnd the Duke of Wakefield himself! You can\u2019t credit the excitement there\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>Silence squinted. It looked very much as if...\u201cIs Lady Hero kissing Lord Griffin?\u201d</p><p>Nell nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s engaged to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought she was engaged to his brother, the Marquess of Mandeville,\u201d Silence said, feeling very confused.</p><p>Nell shrugged. \u201cNot by the looks of it.\u201d</p><p>And indeed Lady Hero seemed quite affectionate with Lord Griffin. Silence was still trying to puzzle the matter out when Winter suddenly appeared, hatless and panting.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d He wrapped her in a bear hug, an extraordinary demonstration of affection for Winter. \u201cWe feared the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Silence gasped. \u201cI had to move the baby to a new wet nurse, and by the time I was done, it was already dark.\u201d</p><p>Winter stepped back and closed his eyes. \u201cWell, no more. I don\u2019t think I could survive another night like this one. From now on, we only go out in pairs.\u201d</p><p>Silence nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. If it hadn\u2019t been for the Ghost of St. Giles\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned suddenly and pierced her with a stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, taken aback. \u201cThe Ghost of St. Giles. I saw him. He was the one who escorted me home safely.\u201d</p><p>No need to go into how he\u2019d found her. Winter was already anxious about her well-being without telling him how close she\u2019d come to rape\u2014and worse.</p><p>Winter lifted his head, glancing about the dark street. \u201cHe was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Silence said slowly. \u201cHe brought me here and then disappeared. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Winter shrugged. \u201cThe Ghost always seems to be about when I\u2019m not. I\u2019d like to catch a glimpse of this phantom apparition someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a phantom, that I can assure you,\u201d Silence said. \u201cHe was as real as you and I.\u201d</p><p>Winter grunted. \u201cWell, in any case, we don\u2019t have the time to speculate about the Ghost at the moment. Our illustrious visitors require our attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Hero said she had something to speak to you about,\u201d Nell said. \u201cI just remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Silence asked.</p><p>Nell knit her brows. \u201cSomething about spinning. I can\u2019t think what, but she did seem most insistent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpinning?\u201d Silence couldn\u2019t think how spinning might concern Lady Hero, but then the aristocracy was a breed apart at times. \u201cWe\u2019d best go see.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cI have one last question for you,\u201d the queen announced to her frowning suitors. \u201cWhat is in my heart?\u201d</p><p>Well! Her question was not met with joy by the three princes. Prince Eastsun frowned and for a moment simply opened and closed his handsome mouth before admitting defeat and bowing from the room. Prince Westmoon scowled and stomped out, muttering about the frivolousness of queens and women in general. Prince Northwind shook his head and said, \u201cWho can understand the heart of a woman?\u201d And then he, too, left.</p> <p>The advisers, ministers, and men of letters fell to arguing, but Queen Ravenhair quietly left the throne room and made for the stables....</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>SIX WEEKS LATER...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a priggish ass, and I don\u2019t see why I should bother to even reply.\u201d Griffin threw the letter from Thomas on the breakfast room table.</p><p>Across from him, his wife of only one week continued to serenely pour her tea. \u201cYou need to not only answer him, but also agree to see him for dinner because he is your brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Griffin crossed his arms on his chest and attempted to glare at Hero but was somewhat diverted by the magnificence of her d\u00e9colletage. \u201cIs that a new frock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and don\u2019t change the subject,\u201d she replied with adorable severity. It always rather aroused him when she attempted to be severe with him.</p><p>Of course, his wife could arouse him by reciting the alphabet, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do today?\u201d he asked, ignoring her order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to inspect the progress Mr. Templeton\u2019s made on the new home. He thinks they may actually be done before spring. After that, I\u2019ll stop by the home and see how the spinning lessons are going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d Griffin had already bought a prize ram and breeding ewes. By spring the children would have new wool to spin.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m off to a tea at Lady Beckinhall\u2019s, where I hope to persuade her to join my Ladies\u2019 Syndicate for the Benefit of the Home for Unfortunate Infants and Foundling Children.\u201d</p><p>He made a show of shuddering. \u201cThe name alone strikes fear into my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA syndication of ladies involving both one\u2019s wife and one\u2019s sister,\u201d he replied darkly, \u201cwould strike fear into any man\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly,\u201d she said blithely. \u201cMargaret will laugh when I tell her you said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd prove my point.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look and set down her cup of tea. \u201cNow, as to your brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cName me one good reason why I should see him\u201d\u2014Griffin held up a finger as she opened her lips\u2014\u201cbesides the fact that I\u2019m unfortunately related to him.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled sweetly, which he had begun to realize in the last week was a warning sign. \u201cIt would please your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d was his devastating reply. The fact was that he\u2019d do almost anything to make Mater happy, and Hero well knew it.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d she said, picking up a piece of toast, \u201cit would please me as well.\u201d</p><p>Griffin straightened in outrage at that. \u201cHe hit you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve forgiven him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did give me that incredibly expensive emerald necklace in apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavinia made him do that,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt was still a lovely gesture nonetheless.\u201d She eyed him as she crunched her toast. \u201cAnd that was after he sent me roses daily for three weeks straight. I don\u2019t know why you stopped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhole damned house smelled of wilting roses,\u201d Griffin muttered. \u201cIrritating as hell.\u201d</p><p>His wife looked at him with those diamond eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that if I can forgive him, you should, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He was huhing a lot since marrying Hero. Rather lowering for one\u2019s self-esteem, that. A devious thought suddenly presented itself. Griffin widened his eyes. \u201cIf I endure what will no doubt be a horrible dinner with Thomas, will you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. Lovely, but no fool, was his wife. \u201cI always kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot,\u201d he said silkily, \u201cthat kind of kiss.\u201d</p><p>He watched as pink rose in her cheeks. Married a week and he could still make his wife blush, by God! One had to take one\u2019s victories where one could.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to blackmail me?\u201d she hissed incredulously. \u201cThat\u2019s rather low, even for you.\u201d</p><p>He straightened the cuffs on his coat. \u201cI prefer to think of it as an incentive.\u201d</p><p>She snorted delicately.</p><p>\u201cJust one kiss.\u201d His eyelids drooped lazily at the thought of her kissing him there. \u201cOne tiny, little kiss.\u201d</p><p>It was a delight to see her cheeks flame pinker. \u201cRogue.\u201d</p><p>He smiled lazily. \u201cTease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, and his cock stood at attention. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Which was why, several hours later, Griffin found himself mounting the steps of Mandeville House. Not even the remembrance of Hero\u2019s eyes as she\u2019d murmured that \u201cperhaps\u201d improved his mood. He knocked, half hoping that his brother wouldn\u2019t answer and he could just go home to his wife.</p><p>But the door opened, and he was admitted and escorted into a dining room. Griffin looked around. At one end of a long mahogany table, his brother was seated. One other place setting lay at Thomas\u2019s right hand. Otherwise the table was empty.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Thomas since the day they\u2019d argued. In the intervening weeks, they\u2019d both married, and Thomas\u2014in an interesting role reversal\u2014had endured something of a miniature scandal for marrying the notorious Mrs. Tate.</p><p>Griffin strolled toward Thomas. \u201cWhere is Lavinia?\u201d</p><p>Thomas, who had stood on his entrance, picked up his glass of wine and took a deep drink, eyeing Griffin sourly over the rim. \u201cShe said it would be best if we dined alone.\u201d</p><p>Griffin dropped into his chair. \u201cHero wouldn\u2019t come either.\u201d</p><p>Thomas\u2019s gaze lowered. \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for hurting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well you should be,\u201d Griffin growled. He looked away. \u201cShe says she\u2019s forgiven you.\u201d</p><p>Thomas sighed. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>Griffin stared at his glass for a bit. If he drank it down, he might keep drinking and on the whole, he\u2019d rather be sober when he returned home to Hero and her kiss.</p><p>Thomas cleared his throat. \u201cLavinia says I must tell you that I believe you.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for Griffin to work out that complicated comment; then he straightened in his chair. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>Thomas nodded, sipping his wine.</p><p>Griffin slammed his palm down on the table. All the dishes jumped, and a fork fell off the edge. \u201cThen why the hell didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d</p><p>Thomas scowled. \u201cShe always liked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne?\u201d Griffin asked incredulously.</p><p>Thomas nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo? You were the one she married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I hadn\u2019t had the title\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did have the title,\u201d Griffin near roared. Of all the stupid, soft-brained\u2014</p><p>Thomas slammed his own hand down. A glass crashed to the floor. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! You\u2019ve never understood. I might have the title and Father\u2019s affections, but you have Mother\u2019s and everyone else\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Griffin blinked. \u201cYou were... jealous? Of me?\u201d</p><p>Thomas looked away, a muscle ticking in his jaw.</p><p>And it was suddenly too much for Griffin. He shouted with laughter, holding his belly, doubled over the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that funny,\u201d Thomas said when Griffin paused to take a breath.</p><p>\u201cIt bloody well is,\u201d Griffin assured him. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely talked to me for over three years and all because you were jealous. Jesus, Thomas! You\u2019re richer, older, and scads more handsome than me. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>Thomas shrugged. \u201cShe always liked you better.\u201d</p><p>Griffin sobered. \u201cWho? Anne or Mater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d Thomas stared moodily into his glass. \u201cWhen Father died, I thought I\u2019d be the one in charge. I was the marquess, after all. But then we realized Father\u2019s debts, and she called you home from Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have the better head for business.\u201d</p><p>Thomas nodded stiffly. \u201cYou do. You did. Even though you were only twenty\u2014and two years younger than I\u2014you immediately set to improving our finances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer I\u2019d let us all go to debtor\u2019s prison?\u201d Griffin asked drily.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Thomas raised his face and looked him frankly in the eye. \u201cI\u2019d prefer that I were the one who could save Mother from financial ruin.\u201d</p><p>Griffin stared at him for a moment and thought about what it must have cost Thomas to admit that he wasn\u2019t good at something.</p><p>He leaned forward and poured his brother some more wine. \u201cEvery time you\u2019ve ever made a speech in parliament, Mater has written all about it to me\u2014pages and pages of details, the points you made and the reaction of the Lords.\u201d</p><p>Thomas\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>Griffin nodded. \u201cTruly. Haven\u2019t you ever noticed her in the ladies\u2019 gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Thomas shook his head, looking a little dazed. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you do.\u201d Griffin set the bottle down and leaned back in the chair. \u201cBesides, what good would two financial geniuses in the family do?\u201d</p><p>THE OPENING OF the bedroom door woke Hero that night. She yawned and stretched indolently as Griffin set down the candle he carried and took off his wig.</p><p>It was sadly unsophisticated but they\u2019d decided they preferred to share a room\u2014and a bed\u2014at night. So upon their marriage, she\u2019d moved into his bedroom and was in the process of redecorating the sitting room on one side into a dressing room for her.</p><p>\u201cYou were out late,\u201d she murmured, her voice husky from sleep.</p><p>Griffin, who\u2019d splashed water on his face from the basin on his dresser, turned to her with a cloth in his hand. \u201cThomas wanted to discuss his estates.\u201d</p><p>His voice was relaxed\u2014a far cry from the tension in his body when he\u2019d left this evening for his brother\u2019s house. \u201cIt went well, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough. He\u2019s very interested in the new weaving venture.\u201d He threw the cloth to the dresser top and prowled toward her, his gaze roaming over the silk coverlet she held to her chest. \u201cAre you wearing anything under there?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes demurely. \u201cNo... Well, yes.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow as he shrugged out of his coat. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head.</p><p>His gaze went to her left ear. \u201cAh. Your diamond earbob.\u201d He tugged at his neckcloth. \u201cWhere\u2019s the other one?\u201d</p><p>She lifted one bare arm out from underneath the covers and pointed mutely at the table beside the bed.</p><p>He dropped his neckcloth and waistcoat onto a chair, then came over to look. Griffin picked up the other earbob. \u201cIs this the one you threw at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She lay back against the fluffy down pillows.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He toed off his shoes and crawled over the bed at her, the mattress sinking beneath his weight. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, feeling the acceleration of her pulse. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He straddled her, kneeling on the coverlet, trapping her beneath, and leaned over her. Gently he took her earlobe in his warm fingers, and she felt him insert the fine gold wire into her ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shivered.</p><p>He cocked his head, examining his handiwork. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are my favorite,\u201d she said.</p><p>His eyes moved to hers, amused, aroused, and dangerously possessive. \u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to the earring.\u201d</p> <p>She arched her brows innocently. \u201cWeren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He bent and licked her throat.</p><p>Goose bumps rose over her skin, making her nipples come almost painfully erect.</p><p>\u201cI think I first fell in love with you when you threw that earbob at me,\u201d he whispered against her skin.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d she gasped. She wanted to take her arms out from underneath the covers, but his weight on the sheets prevented her. \u201cYou were making love to another woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot making love,\u201d he contradicted her choice of words. \u201cI never made love until I met you. And besides, it doesn\u2019t matter. I forgot her the moment I saw you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, though her lips trembled. \u201cDo you expect me to believe such balderdash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he murmured, tugging the sheet lower on her bosom. \u201cBelieve me and love me in return.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, and she met his gaze, suddenly serious. \u201cI do. I do love you.\u201d</p><p>A corner of his mouth quirked up. \u201cWhen did you know?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, wishing he\u2019d go back to kissing her, wanting at the same time to draw this out endlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re fishing for compliments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I am?\u201d He took the coverlet between his teeth and tugged it down beneath one breast. He hovered over the nipple, close enough that she felt his hot breath, but he didn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>\u201cI think it was when you kissed me at Harte\u2019s Folly,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou thought I was Thomas.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t! I was only teasing you by pretending I thought you were he\u2014you\u2019d made me so irritated. I\u2019d never mistake you for\u2014Oh!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d leaned down and delicately taken her nipple between his teeth. She felt the flick of his tongue against the sensitive tip, and then he was sucking strongly on her.</p><p>She moaned, low and shockingly animal.</p><p>He let go of the nipple. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never mistake you for another,\u201d she whispered, watching him from beneath half-closed lids. \u201cWe talked about true love on that first night. Do you remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d He pulled the coverlet down another inch and exposed her other breast. Idly he played with her nipples. \u201cI had an uneasy feeling, even then, that you were the one for me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, having trouble forming words with his hands working so exquisitely on her. \u201cYou are my true love, Griffin, now and forever. Sometimes when I think how close I came to turning away from you out of pure cowardliness, I want to weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he murmured, brushing kisses over her lips, still pinching and fondling her nipples. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. We are together\u2014and we\u2019ll remain together. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d she whispered beneath his lips.</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d he said just before kissing her deeply.</p><p>When he raised his head again, she was wet and wanting, but he still had her pinned beneath the coverlet.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to let me go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, looking very satisfied. \u201cI think I rather like you in this position, unable to move or object to whatever I want to do to you.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed a little, feeling the slide of the silken covers against her bare skin. \u201cI do like this, but it does have one drawback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked absently as he traced circles on her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI might find it hard to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s easy enough for...\u201d He trailed away as he obviously rethought her words.</p><p>\u201cNot there,\u201d she purred. Really, she\u2019d had no idea she could make such a sound.</p><p>His gaze flew to hers, suddenly very green and hopeful. He was off the bed in a thrice, doffing his clothes eagerly.</p><p>Hero took the opportunity to remove the covers. She lay like a wanton, head propped on one hand, watching as her husband, nude and gloriously erect, turned to her.</p><p>His gaze swept over her naked form and came to rest on what she knew was the blush on her face. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you as well.\u201d She inhaled, feeling very scandalous as she crooked one finger. \u201cCome here and I\u2019ll give you a kiss you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Queen Ravenhair walked into her stables and found there, away in the back, her stable master currying her favorite mare. \u201cMy suitors have all fled, Ian,\u201d she said to the man.</p><p>The stable master looked faintly surprised. \u201cYou know my name, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, drawing nearer. \u201cI wonder if you might answer me a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d said he.</p><p>\u201cWhat is in my heart?\u201d</p><p>The stable master threw down the curry brush and turned to face the queen. He looked at her gravely with warm brown eyes. \u201cLove, Your Majesty. Your heart is filled with love.\u201d</p><p>She raised a haughty eyebrow. \u201cIndeed? And will you tell me what is in your heart, Ian?\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer and took her dainty, white hands in his own big, calloused ones. \u201cLove, Your Majesty. Love for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think you ought to call me Ravenhair, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d she murmured as she kissed him.</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed. \u201cI am far from perfect, my darling Ravenhair, but I would be the happiest man in the world if you would take me as your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will be the happiest woman in the world to be your wife.\u201d She smiled back, her heart overflowing with joy, and rose on her tiptoes to whisper in his ear, \u201cI don\u2019t think I truly want perfection anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u2014from Queen Ravenhair</p><p>\u201cMamoo!\u201d Mary Darling giggled as she knocked over the tin cups Silence had carefully helped her stack on the kitchen floor.</p><p>The cups fell with a great clatter, and the little girl clapped her hands in glee.</p><p>\u201cGoodness! That was very loud,\u201d Silence said fondly.</p><p>The baby bounced on her bottom. \u201cMo\u2019! Mo\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, we\u2019ll stack them once more, and then, young lady, I think it\u2019ll be time for a nap.\u201d Silence had found that though Mary Darling might protest mightily at the thought of a nap, she was much happier with one.</p><p>\u201cYou look cheerful this afternoon, sister.\u201d Winter came in the kitchen and set down his bundle of books.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Silence was aware that Winter had been keeping a close eye on her since William\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Winter made a sudden horrible face at Mary, which sent the baby into gales of laughter. \u201cI think that cap becomes you.\u201d</p><p>Silence smiled a little sadly. It wasn\u2019t the cap, she knew. It was little Mary Darling. One couldn\u2019t let oneself wallow in grief with an active baby to care for. And perhaps that was for the best. She stroked a finger over Mary\u2019s downy cheek. Life had to go on, after all.</p><p>\u201cIs it stew again?\u201d Winter peered into the pot on the hearth.</p><p>\u201cBeef and cabbage,\u201d Silence replied.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Winter never seemed to notice what was set before him, but like all men, he had a deep appreciation for tasty food. \u201cI\u2019ll just go and wash before luncheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she called after his retreating back. \u201cI\u2019ve still got to put Mary down for a nap.\u201d</p><p>He waved over his shoulder to indicate he\u2019d heard her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope Uncle Winter doesn\u2019t start reading a book up there,\u201d she confided to Mary.</p><p>The baby chortled and knocked over a tin cup.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hollingbrook!\u201d Joseph Tinbox, one of the home\u2019s older boys, ran into the kitchen. \u201cLook what I\u2019ve found on the step.\u201d</p><p>He held out a small wooden box.</p><p>Silence stared at the offering like it was an adder. Their step had been mercifully free from any gifts since the morning of the riots, and she\u2019d been hoping that perhaps the giver had forgotten them.</p><p>\u201cShall I open it?\u201d Joseph asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Silence said a little too sharply. She inhaled. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at your afternoon lessons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw!\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cNow, Joseph.\u201d</p><p>Joseph wrinkled his nose but slumped off obediently to his lessons.</p><p>Silence picked up the box with trembling fingers. She prized open the lid and stared inside. A lock of hair lay there, tied with a scarlet ribbon. She picked it up between thumb and forefinger, but no note was hidden underneath.</p><p>\u201cWhose do you suppose it is?\u201d she whispered to the baby.</p><p>It was a black lock, the hair so dark it shone blue-black. In fact, it was very like Mary Darling\u2019s own hair. Now that her curls had grown in thickly, they\u2019d revealed themselves as inky black. Silence held the lock to the baby\u2019s head experimentally as Mary bent over her tin cups.</p><p>The hair was a perfect match.</p><p>But the lock didn\u2019t come from Mary Darling\u2019s head. Silence would know if someone had cut it, and besides, Mary\u2019s hair was still too short. No, the lock of hair was long and curling, and really rather beautiful. A woman with hair like this\u2014</p><p>Silence suddenly dropped the lock in shock.</p><p>Or a man. She knew of one man who had long, curling, inky-black hair. She gazed in horror at the baby playing before her. The baby she\u2019d nursed and played with and sung to like she was her very own for the last seven months. The baby she\u2019d given her heart to.</p><p>Mary\u2019s hair matched Charming Mickey\u2019s hair exactly. </p> </body></html>"]
