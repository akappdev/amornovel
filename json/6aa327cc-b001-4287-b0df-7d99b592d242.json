She stumbled, righted her spiked heels and hobbled toward the main office of the run-down motel where Jacob had grown up.</p><p>Now, he only planned to stick around long enough to get his teenage\u2014orphaned\u2014sister\u2019s life in order before he returned to his career as an Air Force in-flight mechanic. Okay, so he was technically on sick leave while his arm recovered from a line-of-duty bullet. But he hoped to be back in his flight suit, tooling around the sky with his C-17 buddies in two more weeks.</p> <p>Fourteen days certain to be jam-packed settling his sister\u2019s life\u2014and his old man\u2019s near-bankrupt \u201cestate.\u201d</p><p>That alone should be enough for his plate. Pulling his gaze off the woman, Jacob adjusted his healing arm in the sling with a wince and shifted his attention to the Dr. Phil rerun again in hopes the shrink could offer up some insights on how to help a teenager with an infant get her life on track. Fixing his sister\u2019s situation seemed harder than keeping a multimillion-dollar military aircraft in smooth working order.</p><p>Still, curiosity hauled his gaze right back to the parking lot as the woman\u2019s coat flapped open. Her slinky dress, racy-red lingerie peeking free with each stormy gust, just didn\u2019t match the Junior League face.</p><p>She huddled inside her coat and started up the office steps. She probably needed to call a friend, and the phones were out.</p><p>The woman wrapped her arms around her willowy body and tucked her head into the storm. She must be from room sixteen, since his only other customer had been a horse rancher who\u2019d checked out an hour ago. Jacob hadn\u2019t seen the woman up close when she\u2019d arrived the night before. She\u2019d been slumped asleep in the car while \u201cMr. Smith\u201d had paid cash for their room.</p> <p>Jacob glanced toward the parking spaces. Mr. Smith\u2019s white Suburban was long gone, snow already piling in the tire ruts.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Sympathy and frustration stuttered through Jacob like the bullets that had come his way during a simple assignment hauling a congressional entourage around Europe. Apparently this woman\u2019s wild night out on the tiny town hadn\u2019t unfolded as planned.</p><p>Double damn. Already he could feel warrior instincts honed in bloody battle zones stirring to life within him.</p><p>Jacob pushed to his feet, snagging his remote control from beside the television. Extending his arm, he thumbed the remote, silencing Dr. Phil.</p><p>He might not be wearing his uniform, and the woman may not need his help. But that wouldn\u2019t stop him from throwing himself in the middle of her problems when she came through the door. The only way to ensure she went out the door all the faster.</p> <p>Fear seared her roiling stomach as she clutched the icy doorknob. She gripped the edges of her coat and burrowed inside to protect herself from the punishing winds.</p><p>Waking up alone in a run-down motel with nothing but sleazy clothes, a hundred dollars and no memory had been bad enough. Now, she would surely freeze to death before she discovered her name and why she\u2019d had blood on her hands.</p><p>Crunching her heels into the ice for traction, she tugged on the door to Clyde\u2019s Travel Lodge. She slipped anyway, her hand whipping off the knob. The woozy sensation she hadn\u2019t been able to shake since waking threatened her balance. She grappled for the rail. Her sweaty palms bonded to the freezing metal. Or maybe it was blood residue, although she\u2019d scrubbed and scrubbed until her hands were as raw as any Lady Macbeth pivotal moment.</p><p>Hang tough. Stay calm. She steadied her feet and breathing. There had to be a logical answer.</p><p>Only a couple more steps. She could manage that. The manager or clerk would have some record of her name, all the spark she would need to fire her memories.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>The hundred dollars, hotel key and EpiPen on the bedside table hadn\u2019t brought any recollections. The telephone book in her room had helped some, even if the phones were out of order. At least she knew she\u2019d awakened in the small town of Rockfish, Washington, and that she could order carryout from Marge\u2019s Diner until 9:00 p.m.</p><p>Great. Just what she needed, a blue plate special to erase what little she did remember\u2014bloodred dress and hands.</p> <p>She grasped the gold D initial necklace, the only thing that felt right in her whole insane morning. Inhaling a bracing breath that threatened to freeze her from the inside out, she grabbed the doorknob again and twisted. The wind ripped the door from her, banging it against the wall. She stumbled inside and slammed into a broad male chest.</p><p>\u201cSteady there.\u201d A strong hand gripped her arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, excuse me.\u201d She winced, her own voice still sounding as unfamiliar to her as her face looked in a mirror.</p><p>\u201cNo harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>The deep voice rumbled over her, jarring along her ravaged nerves.</p><p>Nausea born of panic roiled again. Had she met this man earlier? If she glanced up, would he recognize her?</p><p>She scavenged for a smile and let her gaze travel up the chest in front of her. A T-shirt with an Air Force logo peeked between the parted fabric of unbuttoned blue flannel. His left arm was in a sling, but his large neck bespoke strength that sent a fresh blast of apprehension through her.</p><p>Her gaze upward seemed never ending, taking this guy to at least a few inches over six feet. Hmm...he had a dimpled chin. She found that reassuring, and she needed reassurance more than she needed an hour in front of that roaring fireplace.</p><p>Broad cheekbones stretched just below slate-blue eyes.</p><p>Brooding eyes stared without a flicker of recognition.</p><p>His hand dropped away. \u201cCome on inside before we heat the whole state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d She sidestepped him and studied the breadth of his shoulders as he wrestled the door closed. Heaven help her if he wasn\u2019t trustworthy.</p><p>He pivoted to face her, scratching a hand along his close-cropped black hair. \u201cWhat can I do for you, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>That was it? All he had to say?</p><p>There went any hope of him knowing her. She wanted to pitch all her fears right at his feet, but feared she was more likely to toss her cookies.</p><p>That Air Force T-shirt seemed to hint she could trust him, but still. He worked here, so whatever connection he had to the military was over or through a friend. Maybe he was just an air show junkie, and God, her mind was rambling.</p><p>Bottom line, she was helpless to anyone who might take advantage of her.</p><p>A logical voice urged her to call the police, and she would, as soon as the phone lines were back in working order and she could unscramble her mind enough to think clearly. Meanwhile, she would follow her instincts, instincts being all she had.</p><p>Moving on to discovering what the register held. \u201cI\u2019m ready to check out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. You\u2019re already paid up. Just drop off the key.\u201d</p><p>She stuffed her hand in her pocket and clutched her fingers around the chilly steel beside her wad of cash and the EpiPen\u2014not that she even knew what allergies to avoid.</p><p>If she passed the key over, she would be officially homeless. So what if her only bed waited in a rustic motel so old it didn\u2019t even have key cards?</p><p>She stifled a hysterical laugh. She knew about key cards, yet didn\u2019t know her own name. \u201cWhen\u2019s checkout time again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon.\u201d</p><p>The ancient Field and Stream wall clock seemed to mock her, ticking away those last twenty-one minutes. She sifted through her muddled concentration for her next question.</p><p>His cool eyes settled on her dress. \u201cUh, but you can stay longer if you need to. I\u2019ve got a busload of senior citizens due in, but not until this evening, if they can make it through the storm.\u201d</p><p>At least she could stay a few more hours without using her precious store of cash. \u201cDo you mind printing out a copy of my receipt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA copy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor tax purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTax purposes?\u201d His eyes slid down her slinky red dress then up again without censure, but with obvious disbelief. \u201cSure. I gave one to your, uh, husband, but it\u2019s no trouble to shoot out another.\u201d</p><p>Husband. The word surged through her with an odd mixture of hope and the metallic taste of fear. Where was he? \u201cThanks. He lost his copy. I\u2019m supposed to pick up another one, you know, taxes and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your husband.\u201d Those brooding eyes shifted from her to the empty parking lot before returning.</p><p>\u201cHe should be back soon.\u201d She resisted the urge to fidget like a first-day kindergartner. \u201cCould I see the owner?\u201d Preferably, a much older, grandfatherly kind of guy without piercing eyes that saw too much.</p><p>\u201cThat would be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Clyde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClyde was my father. He\u2019s dead. The place belongs to me and my sister now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to be grieving when he mentioned his dad, so she didn\u2019t bother with condolences. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob Stone.\u201d</p><p>Her nerves began to unravel like a rolling ball of yarn she couldn\u2019t quite catch. \u201cMay I please have my receipt, Mr. Stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Jacob, ma\u2019am.\u201d The man tucked his thumbs in his back pockets, looming over her, compelling, silent and dangerous. With a curt nod, he stepped away. \u201cAll right, then, one copy on its way.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped with a slow exhale. \u201cJust Jacob,\u201d clerk, manager and owner of Clyde\u2019s Travel Lodge, circled behind the counter. He tapped through a few keys and set the printer into motion. The clicking sounded unnaturally harsh, echoing the only noise in the sparse room.</p><p>She fingered her necklace like a security blanket, tracing the D and looking around for something familiar. She must have seen this place the night before.</p><p>A brown artificial leather sofa nestled beneath the picture window overlooking the parking lot. The style was up-to-date, but the cracks in the Naugahyde upholstery showed the toll of weather blasts. Three vending machines lined the paneled wall to the side with a brick fireplace directly across. A cheaply framed landscape poster labeled Mount Rainier hung over the mantel. The television and an office chair behind the registration counter rounded out the sparse decor.</p><p>Just Jacob ripped the paper free from the printer. It was all she could do not to jump out of her skin.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She forced herself to take it from him slowly, casually. Their hands paused, side by side. Hers seemed so small and vulnerable beside his larger, roughened one. The paper rattled in her trembling grasp as she took it from him.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. J. Smith. Her right hand clenched over her bare ring finger. Damn. The guy she must have trysted with hadn\u2019t even been original. Tears burned her eyes, then turned icy on her still-chilled skin.</p><p>She spun away, paper crumpled in her grip. Not even sure where she was going, only knowing she had to run, she charged out the door. The snowstorm swirled a thick white bubble around the parking lot. She couldn\u2019t see a thing past the line of tiny motel units.</p><p>Total isolation.</p><p>Her head hurt. Her whole body hurt. God, her brain was so fogged she couldn\u2019t think, much less make decisions while she waited to call the police. She sagged against the railing, mindless of the damp cold seeping through her clothes as she stared out at nothing. A nothingness vast as the void in her mind.</p><p>And the only one who could help her fill it was a man with shadows in his eyes that sent fresh shivers along her freezing skin.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>M ore contradictions. Jacob watched the woman stumble back into the hazy storm. She leaned her body weight into dragging the door closed.</p><p>Once he\u2019d seen those tear-filled eyes, he expected a sob story and an eyelash-fluttering plea for help. Instead she\u2019d braced her spine so rigidly, even the fifty-mile-an-hour gusts outside couldn\u2019t have knocked her over. Prideful without question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The clothes relayed one image, her frail body another, and that haughty Midwestern voice, yet another. His gaze traveled over the woman. Around thirty, medium height. Whispery brown hair trailed her, riding the wind and revealing delicate cheekbones to match those dainty wrists and ankles. Her fresh, heart-shaped face might as well have home fires and bridge club tattooed across her forehead. He could almost smell the cookies baking through the plate-glass window.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be making cookies anytime soon if she froze to death wearing that neon number.</p><p>Who the hell was she? And why did he care?</p> <p>So her scum boyfriend had ditched her in a hotel, leaving her stranded. It wasn\u2019t Jacob\u2019s problem. She hadn\u2019t even asked for his help. He\u2019d helped her anyway by extending her checkout time until the phones were working again and she could call a friend to pick her up. Problem solved.</p><p>Jacob reached for his remote and began easing himself into his chair, which offered him a too-perfect view of the woman collapsing on the top step.</p><p>He\u2019d already started toward the door when she jerked upright. She gripped the railing and began heaving onto the snowbank beside her.</p><p>Aw, hell. Jacob shrugged out of his sling and into a coat with a wince, grabbing an extra jacket for her. He wrenched open the door. Cold air in front and warmed air on his back vise-locked him until he jerked the door closed. He lowered himself beside her and waited.</p><p>Slowly she straightened and grappled in her pocket, pulling free a tissue.</p> <p>He draped the extra coat over her stockinged legs. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, dabbing the wadded Kleenex along her mouth like his grandma used to do after a cup of tea. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll be all right in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Jacob stared down the endless length of the two-lane highway. A familiar truck droned closer, a plow wedge on front. Just like any other day here. Except for the woman beside him. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure I agree. Seems like you have a problem Ms.... What was your name again?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers fluttered to her necklace, the D glinting. She frowned. Her face cleared as her hand fell to her lap. \u201cDee. Dee Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmith, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Smith.\u201d</p> <p>Let her keep her little secrets. Maybe she didn\u2019t want her indiscretion to become public knowledge. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry, but it\u2019s fairly obvious you\u2019re stranded. Is there someone I can call to give you a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one.\u201d</p><p>That stunk. He remembered the feeling from when he was a kid with a dad who didn\u2019t give a crap. Now he had people he could call on 24/7 anywhere, anytime. He could give a shout out to any of his Air Force friends stationed back at Charleston Air Force base in South Carolina. He even had some closer who\u2019d transferred to the C-17 base in Tacoma.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take that sense of family for granted, not for one second.</p><p>Dee slid her hands under the coat. \u201cIf you really meant it about staying in the room another few hours, I\u2019ll just rest, then call a cab when the phones are up and working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo cab\u2019s going to come from Tacoma to this microdot on the map, especially not in this weather. It\u2019s dicey if the roads will even stay open much longer.\u201d</p><p>What would she do now to dodge telling him her real story? Playing mind games with each other could be fun, if she didn\u2019t have that bleak expression plastered across her face.</p><p>He sat beside her and waited. He was patient and thrived on puzzles, like putting the pieces together in an engine so things worked right again. Restoring order, even to a car, had given him a sense of control as a teen stuck in a chaotic home.</p> <p>The rust-rimmed truck on the highway slowed and swerved into the parking lot. It bounced along the rutted ice, plowing with methodical sweeps. His ear tuned to listen for any warning noises from the engine, but the hum sounded a helluva lot better now thanks to his tune-up last weekend. Installing the new battery one-handed had been a challenge, but he\u2019d enjoyed the familiar scents, routine, being able to fix something in his hay-wire world. Apparently not much had changed since he\u2019d left.</p><p>Dee pointed to the teenage driver. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>With each quick turn of the Ford 250, the girl\u2019s ponytail bobbed just above her parka.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my sister.\u201d Who shouldn\u2019t be out in this storm, and certainly not with her baby in tow. But Emily had run wild on her own for years. Their father had been long on smiles, jokes and unkept promises, but short on maturity, structure and follow-through. He didn\u2019t give a damn what his kids did so long as they didn\u2019t make any demands on him.</p><p>Guilt kicked at Jacob all over again for not taking Emily along when he\u2019d left. But the state wouldn\u2019t pull her out of her father\u2019s care to stay with a military brother who was deployed most of every year. His job hadn\u2019t changed, and he needed to figure out some way for a seventeen-year-old unwed mother to care for herself and her baby. \u201cShe uses our dad\u2019s old truck to clear driveways and side roads before school for extra money. School\u2019s canceled and she shouldn\u2019t even be out at all. No help for you there, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>He needed to move this woman along and have a talk with his sister. Emily avoided discussing the future as if somehow that would make their problems disappear.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dee\u2019s blue lip quivered as Emily\u2019s truck disappeared around the office to clear the back lot.</p><p>As much as he needed to move on, he couldn\u2019t just walk away, not when tears hovered on the edges of her eyelids. \u201cHey, now, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying.\u201d She sniffled.</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d The starch layered back into her voice and spine.</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d His hands raised in surrender.</p><p>Icy sludge from the plow gathered and slapped to the side. Dee drew her feet in, tucking Jacob\u2019s coat around her ankles. Trim, delicate ankles, like the rest of her.</p><p>A slow burn started inside him.</p><p>She was prettier up close than he\u2019d originally thought, not that he planned to do a thing about it beyond admiring the view. \u201cI can give you a ride when the storm passes, but you\u2019re probably stuck here for at least another night until the roads clear.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed. \u201cHow much are the rates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need a loan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo handouts. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her pride had a way of biting folks when they least expected it. He\u2019d been so busy flying around the world to save people in other countries he\u2019d let down his own sister. \u201cI can give you a ride into town later.\u201d He held up a freezing finger to stop her. \u201cJust think it over and get back to me.\u201d</p><p>Why was he so hell-bent on settling this woman\u2019s problems? He had enough responsibility in that truck. Let the mystery woman snag a nap and come to her senses. She would either find someone to help her or accept his offer for a ride. No sweat either way.</p><p>Jacob pushed to his feet. He had better things to do than freeze his butt off for someone he didn\u2019t even know.</p><p>But first, he would shovel the walkway one more time. Just to wait for his sister to finish so he could help with her baby daughter. Right?</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He kicked through the snow and yanked free the shovel embedded in a four-foot drift. Ouch. Just what his healing arm needed. The gunshot wound was six weeks old, the fractured bone about healed, but the incision from surgery still pulled like hell.</p><p>His muttered curses filled the air with puffy clouds. Jacob scooped a trail along the walk and flung it to the side, burying the spot where she\u2019d thrown up. He kept shoveling, losing himself in the mundane task.</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t move. The wind kept howling down from the mountains.</p><p>Jacob shoveled past her and stopped, resting his arms on the handle. \u201cHow bad are things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst.\u201d She dabbed her face with the tissue again, grandma-style.</p><p>He believed her. Hell, he\u2019d been there in this very same place. Which made him wonder where she was from. Somewhere close by? He tried to recall what state the Suburban plates had sported, but he couldn\u2019t remember having read what Mr. Smith wrote on the check-in form. He\u2019d only made sure all the boxes were filled out. Regardless of how close or far away she lived, how damn sad to be this alone.</p><p>Jacob let the icy air clear away the bitterness. He couldn\u2019t be like his old man and turn a blind eye to other people\u2019s needs.</p><p>\u201cI have a job open here to tide you over for a few days. Doesn\u2019t pay much, but you can have a room to sleep in and all the Continental breakfast doughnuts you can eat until you figure out what to do.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait before you answer. The job\u2019s nothing glamorous. You\u2019ll be cleaning rooms. It\u2019s dirty, hard work, even when there are only a few rooms filled. You\u2019ll earn every penny I pay you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed tightly together before she blurted, \u201cThere\u2019s something you should know.\u201d</p><p>More secrets? More obligation. Not a chance. \u201cHold on. I don\u2019t need your life story or anything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a high-pitched, nervous sort of sound. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not likely to spill it anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in trouble with the law?\u201d</p><p>She twisted her wind-raw hands together. \u201cNot that I know of. But I may not be around long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, this motel might not be around much longer, either.\u201d Selling the place\u2014if he could even find a buyer\u2014was an option, if he could persuade his sister to leave. \u201cLet\u2019s just get through this next batch of tourists.\u201d He leaned forward on the shovel handle. \u201cAnd no drugs.\u201d</p><p>Her nose tipped with an air a mite too haughty for a woman in her position. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Yet, again, he believed her, with not even one good reason to call upon, and a thousand bad ones telling him she was trouble. \u201cThen that\u2019s all I need to know for now. About the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it. Thank you.\u201d Her eyes met his, lit with hope and gratitude.</p><p>Her pretty face shone with a gentle beauty that threatened to draw the air from his lungs more effectively than the biting wind. What the hell had he just done?</p><p>Lord, she hoped fate would cut her a break. Dee wrapped the coat tighter around her legs and considered her options.</p><p>Jacob Stone\u2019s offer had seemed the perfect answer, but \u201cMr. Smith\u2019s\u201d fake registration and apparent desertion led her to believe her instincts on men hadn\u2019t been stellar even when she\u2019d possessed a full set of memories to draw upon. God, she was so scared.</p><p>What kind of person was she? Someone who stayed in cheap motels with men who slipped away the next morning? She tried to wrap her mind around that image of herself, and it didn\u2019t fit.</p><p>Did amnesia change a person\u2019s basic nature? Perhaps.</p><p>Hopefully the phone lines would be up soon. She could put in a call to the cops, even if the roads were impassable. Maybe she had a big, fat account full of money somewhere and could spend her hundred dollars without concern while she waited.</p><p>Except that didn\u2019t feel right, either. Just as she knew she wasn\u2019t the one-night-stand kind of woman, she also knew she needed to cling to every penny of that hundred dollars.</p><p>Taking the job was the best solution for now. Having a plan didn\u2019t stop the fear, but at least her hands stopped shaking.</p><p>Dee draped Jacob\u2019s extra coat over her arm and struggled to her feet, hoping her wooziness had fled for good. The mere thought of ammonia made her want to gag. \u201cOkay, Mr. Stone. Point me to the mop and bucket so I can get to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jacob. And you should change first.\u201d His gaze lingered a second too long on her dress.</p><p>She yanked her coat closed, unsure if she should bristle at his order. The guy did have a way of taking charge. She reminded herself not to be a temperamental ingrate. \u201cWhich rooms should I start with?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned on his shovel as if trying to decide whether to push the clothing issue further. Blowing snow hovered around his booted feet as he shifted his gaze to the truck sweeping through the parking lot. He stuffed the shovel into a drift. \u201cCome on inside, and I\u2019ll get you set up.\u201d</p><p>Dee started up the steps. \u201cHow many rooms will you need cleaned if the tour bus shows?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, she pivoted at the door. Jacob knelt at the base of the porch, scooping his fingers through snow. How odd. But she didn\u2019t dare rush him.</p> <p>Jacob shaped the handful and arced his arm back. He let the snowball fly, nailing the truck\u2019s hood. The Ford kept rumbling forward. He packed together a second missile and thudded the back window. The truck stopped.</p><p>The driver\u2019s-side window rolled down and a teenage face poked out, a face with a hefty addiction to eyeliner. \u201cYeah, bro? Did I miss someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPark it, Emily. School\u2019s canceled. Build a snowman or something.\u201d He blew into his cupped hands, wincing as he moved the arm that had been in a sling earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost through here.\u201d Wind streaked her wheat-blond ponytail, revealing the crimson strip dyed through.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, Jacob. Whatever.\u201d She rolled up the window, kicked the truck in gear and proceeded to plow the next row.</p><p>Jacob lobbed another snowball into the retreating truck bed. \u201cDamn fool girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer or me?\u201d Dee couldn\u2019t resist mumbling.</p><p>He either didn\u2019t hear or chose to ignore the comment. Jacob stomped his feet as he turned. \u201cLet\u2019s get your supplies. Only one room needs cleaning. We can test you on that. The rest only need light touch-ups, some dusting and airing.\u201d</p><p>As they walked inside, he rambled off a list of tasks. She registered his clipped phrases, all the while absorbing details around her to fill the terrifying emptiness within. She glanced at the framed buffalo prints over the fireplace. A faded map of Washington spread above a brochure rack. The scary ache didn\u2019t even begin to fade.</p><p>Jacob Stone was the only person she could remember speaking to since waking, a strangely quiet man who took in stray amnesiacs and worried about his teenage sister on the road.</p> <p>He and that young girl were the only people she\u2019d seen face-to-face. Years of experiences with others had been lost, shrouded by an impenetrable fog. It was enough to make a person crazy.</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t already.</p><p>He stared through his windshield at the lodge with her inside.</p><p>She\u2019d been in and out of sight most of the morning. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the shape of her, especially when the wind plastered her clothes into a tighter fit like now as she ducked into another room. Heat from the vents didn\u2019t come close to the temperature pumping through him.</p><p>Want and hate, both hot, pumped through him.</p><p>Women screwed up everything. They always wanted more, more, more from a guy. She was just like the rest in the end. She was the messed up one, not him.</p><p>So what if he watched her through binoculars while parked on a side road? That didn\u2019t make him a perv since she belonged to him anyway. Yeah, she still fascinated him even though he\u2019d already had her.</p><p>He hated that about her, the way she had a hold over him. There were times he thought he would do anything to get rid of her. Then she drew him in again with her smile, her laugh, her touch.</p> <p>Claustrophobia filled the vehicle in gusts as thick as the exhaust puffing from the tailpipe. He should just go. Somebody might see him lurking around. He could come up with an excuse, but it would seem weird. More than ever he needed to appear blameless.</p><p>Things would look bad enough when he got rid of her for good.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>D ee attacked the tub with a rag.</p><p>Surely routine household chores should stir a memory. How many tubs had she scrubbed over the years? One too many as of today since Jacob had underestimated the number of dirty rooms. Did his regular maid have bad eyesight?</p><p>Jacob Stone had been right about one thing. Cleaning was dirty, hard work. And she thanked God for the job plus the monotonous distraction it provided.</p><p>She\u2019d done more than dust and air the extra rooms, but she felt obligated. Jacob would have been well within his rights to toss her into a snowbank. Of course with any luck, someone would come looking for her soon, whisk her off to a hot meal and soft bed, a bed she hadn\u2019t made.</p><p>Meanwhile, she would pay her way while she waited to reclaim her identity. Her pride demanded it. Pride? The notion seemed misplaced given her current mess, but she didn\u2019t have much else left.</p><p>Dee slumped against the bathroom wall and clutched her legs to her chest. What had robbed her of her past? She\u2019d scoured every inch of her head, and there wasn\u2019t a telling lump to be found, just a sore spot that could have come from brushing her hair too hard.</p><p>Could she trust someone on the tour bus to help her? Possibly, but not worth betting the bank. That just left her new boss.</p><p>What a puzzling man. Not that she had much to compare him to. He seemed determined to help her when he had absolutely no obligation.</p><p>Around midday, he\u2019d slipped through the door, set a plate of food on the table and silently lumbered back out before she could speak. While she hadn\u2019t been able to tolerate more than a mouthful of the sandwich, she\u2019d stared out the window at his footprints long after he\u2019d been swallowed by the circling snow. His thoughtfulness had filled her with a sense of security far more nourishing than two slices of bread and some turkey.</p><p>Dee stretched her legs the length of the minuscule bathroom. Every muscle resisted, tightening, urging her to curl up and sleep.</p><p>Not a chance. She had to break out the vacuum and get back to work before her boss caught her napping on the job.</p><p>She flung the can of scrubbing bubbles into the supply bucket just as voices swelled from the next room. Dee conquered her aching muscles and stood, ducking her head out the bathroom door. \u201cHello? Who\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>The television blared to life from the stand. She stepped into the room and found the girl from the plow truck\u2014Emily, Jacob\u2019s sister\u2014pitching aside the remote control.</p><p>\u201cHi, there.\u201d Emily sat cross-legged in the middle of one of the unmade beds, a jelly-filled doughnut in one hand, foam cup of milk in the other resting on her knee. On the television, a game show contestant puzzled over an answer that could win her a Winnebago and a year\u2019s supply of beef jerky.</p><p>All of that faded for Dee as her gaze focused on the sleeping baby in the middle of the bed. Swaddled in a pink sleeper with footies, the infant appeared to be no more than two or three months old.</p><p>Jacob had a child and recruited his sister for babysitting? She\u2019d just assumed from his bare ring finger that he was single.</p><p>Dee notched down the volume with the remote. \u201cI would tell you to make yourself comfortable, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t mind some company while you worked. I\u2019m Emily. Emily Stone.\u201d She patted the sleeping baby on her little round belly. \u201cThis is Madison.\u201d</p><p>Still no clue who the infant belonged to and Dee didn\u2019t bother asking. Her overtaxed brain seemed to do better by assimilating information as it came to her.</p><p>Emily appeared to be settling in for a long stay, and Dee wasn\u2019t sure she had enough energy for the mental gymnastics needed to dodge more questions. \u201cWeren\u2019t you going to build a snowman?\u201d</p><p>Emily tore her doughnut open. \u201cLike I can wait another minute without the inside skinny on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to know.\u201d What an understatement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. I figure I\u2019ll just hang out. Madison\u2019s gotta eat soon anyway.\u201d Emily sipped her milk. Her curious eyes peered over the rim.</p><p>Dee eyed the cup, her stomach simultaneously growling and rolling. Best to stay away from food. She took in the girl\u2019s Army fatigue pants and tight white T-shirt, hair-thin silver chains floating along her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Emily licked away her milk mustache.</p><p>The girl wasn\u2019t going to leave without something. The truth, or as close as she could guess, seemed a safe bet.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend skipped out on me.\u201d Dee spritzed the mirror with Windex and began wiping.</p><p>\u201cThat bites. Guess I\u2019m really lucky to have Chase.\u201d The baby whimpered and Emily lifted her like a pro.</p><p>Then she hiked up her T-shirt and latched the baby onto her breast.</p><p>Dee blinked, surprised. Well, that solved one mystery, and brought an unwelcome swell of relief that the baby was Jacob\u2019s niece.</p><p>Emily frowned, her hand cupping Madison\u2019s head as the baby nursed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think to ask. Do you mind my nursing her in front of you?\u201d</p><p>Dee shook off her distracting thoughts. \u201cNo. Of course not. We all have to eat, right?\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s face smoothed into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re cool. Good.\u201d The sheets rustled. A small slurp sounded, before Emily continued, \u201cOkay, so your guy blew out. How did you end up with a bottle of Windex and a broom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping out to pay my bill until the storm passes.\u201d</p><p>Emily set her cup on the end table. \u201cMust have been some party last night.\u201d</p><p>At least she could answer that one honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat really bites.\u201d Sticking her finger into the center of her doughnut, she scooped out the filling. She sucked it clean and flung the rest of the pastry in the trash can. \u201cDo you think my brother\u2019s hot?\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s hand froze on the mirror. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot. A real hottie. Good-looking. Well, for an old guy, anyway.\u201d</p><p>How old am I? The question blindsided her. When would she get used to questioning the most elementary things about herself and coming up empty? Hopefully she wouldn\u2019t have to.</p><p>So how old was she? Emily seemed a child. Jacob Stone looked to be around thirty and felt like a contemporary. Dee decided that put her somewhere in her early thirties, as well.</p><p>She swiped along the edges of the mirror. No one could call Jacob anything but virile. \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly ancient.\u201d</p><p>Emily grinned smugly before continuing. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t live here in this dump, in case you were wondering. He\u2019s in the Air Force, stationed in South Carolina. He\u2019s an in-flight mechanic for one of the big cargo planes,\u201d she said with unmistakable pride as she shifted the baby to the other side to feed. \u201cHe\u2019s served a lot of time in the Middle East. He even got hurt on a mission last Christmas.\u201d</p><p>His broad chest in that T-shirt came to mind, along with the sling he\u2019d first worn. \u201cThat must have been scary for you.\u201d</p><p>The teen stared down at her baby\u2019s head and smoothed a hand over the fine blond hair. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough couple of months, with having Madison, then Jacob getting hurt and Dad dying.\u201d</p><p>Dee ached to hug the young girl carrying so many adult problems at once. She started to move toward her when Emily tossed back her head with a smile and stand-off bravado. \u201cSo, do you think Jacob is hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot meaning to be rude, but I just met the guy and I\u2019m not in any position for a relationship right now.\u201d She wasn\u2019t up to matching wits with the ponytail contingent. \u201cUm, I really need to make that bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem.\u201d Emily secured the baby in the cradle of her arms and moved to a chair. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get in the way. I just don\u2019t get as much time to talk to people as I used to.\u201d</p><p>Those simply spoken words without even a hint of self-pity tugged at Dee more than if the girl had poured out buckets of tears. She understood too well the fear from losing control of her world.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the company.\u201d Dee scooped off the musty spread and whipped a fresh one into a fluttering parachute over the bed. \u201cWant to tell me about your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Chase. He\u2019s, like, so hot,\u201d she said, her dialect an odd mix of Generation Y meets farm town as she listed his every \u201cawesome\u201d attribute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee clutched the top sheet to her chest. Generation Y. How could she recall such catchphrases but not her own name? She swallowed down a fresh well of nausea and searched for why she\u2019d hooked on the phrase.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She remembered about key cards and movies, but no real life experiences to accompany the information. She sagged to the edge of the bed.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>Dee jerked. \u201cHuh? Oh, yes, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m a little distracted today.\u201d She swallowed hard and searched for normal conversation. \u201cSo, uh, is Chase Madison\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded, thankfully not offended by the question. She hitched the baby on her shoulder and tugged her shirt back in place. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get married when we\u2019re older.\u201d</p><p>A tap sounded from the door just before it opened. A blast of air funneled into the room as Jacob stepped inside, his broad shoulders momentarily sealing the entry.</p><p>His height no longer intimidating, her nerves smoothed as if an iron had flattened all the disruptive wrinkles. How did he do that? Manage to calm her world with a job offer and a sandwich?</p> <p>Jacob slammed the door closed behind him. He swiped the baby from Emily\u2019s shoulder and lowered his oversize body into the seat to finish burping the infant. \u201cHey, there, runt. How many doughnuts did your mama pilfer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one, that you know of.\u201d Emily grinned without a flicker of remorse. \u201cMadison needs the fruit in that raspberry pastry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit eating up the profits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeduct it from my portion of the inheritance from Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he grumbled, his face creasing into an almost-smile.</p><p>The conversation hummed on, but Dee couldn\u2019t focus on anything except the tableau of that tiny baby held so securely in oversize hands.</p> <p>Her breath hitched. Emily was right. Jacob Stone was hot. A glance at those trim h*ps and long legs encased in overwashed denim sent a liquid heat flooding through Dee that rivaled any sugar jolt from a raspberry tart.</p><p>What kind of woman did that make her? Did she get warm and soft feelings over every man who crossed her path? She didn\u2019t like that image of herself. Could she simply be drawn to Jacob because he\u2019d been the one to toss her a lifeline?</p><p>Emily grabbed her coat off the back of the chair and reached for her daughter. \u201cI\u2019m outta here. You old folks reek of gloom and doom.\u201d</p><p>Jacob propped a boot on the edge of the bed, blocking Emily\u2019s escape. \u201cWhere\u2019re you going? The weather\u2019s not showing any signs of letting up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to Chase\u2019s.\u201d Emily draped a thick yellow blanket over the baby. \u201cDon\u2019t say no or I\u2019ll just sneak out. You\u2019re my brother, not my father, and even he didn\u2019t rag on me every time I wanted to go somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He slid his foot to the ground. \u201cTake the truck and be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Gramps. I\u2019ll even call you on your cell if I can pick up any reception in this weather.\u201d She jerked a thumb over her shoulder. \u201cAnd get this lady into some warmer clothes and shoes before she, like, loses a toe to frostbite. Of course, if she wears anything of yours, she\u2019ll be a fugitive from the fashion police.\u201d</p><p>Police. Dee\u2019s throat closed with a new thought. What if the police were after her? She couldn\u2019t imagine herself as a criminal. But she wouldn\u2019t have imagined she\u2019d choose a low-cut silk dress if she couldn\u2019t see the proof glaring back at her from the mirror.</p> <p>And she didn\u2019t even want to think about what the hundred on the bedside table had meant.</p><p>Jacob tipped back his chair. \u201cThanks for the fashion commentary, kid. You\u2019re one to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth hurts.\u201d Emily tossed her ponytail over her shoulder, red streak glinting. \u201cLater, dudes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to call,\u201d he shouted after the closing door.</p><p>Emily had just assumed he would loan Dee clothes, no question or hesitation. She had to admit, he did have a way of taking charge and reordering her world with seeming ease.</p><p>Jacob swung his feet up to occupy the vacated chair. Chilly silvery-blue eyes whispered over her. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re not staying in that dress because it\u2019s your favorite. No suitcase?\u201d</p><p>Dee backed a step as if that might distance her from the impact of that shivery gaze. She wasn\u2019t even sure whom to trust. Keep focused. Cell phone. He had a cell phone. She should have thought to ask about one earlier. Now she could call for help and find her family\u2014or perhaps end up in jail. \u201cUh, no. I don\u2019t have a change of clothes.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the chair arms and shoved to his feet. \u201cMeet me over at the office when you finish up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. About ten more minutes.\u201d She tucked the spread along the pillows, taking more time to even the edges than she needed until he left.</p><p>Ten minutes and she could try for a cell phone connection. Regardless of the outcome, she wanted to know. All she needed to do was ask him for the phone.</p><p>Was she ready for what she might find?</p><p>Jacob refilled the coffeemaker in the lobby while he waited for Dee to finish her call. Apparently she\u2019d thought of a friend to contact after all.</p><p>At least she\u2019d cleaned the rooms before cutting out. He would be ready if the bus managed to make it through the storm, and the regular maid would be over her bout of flu soon.</p><p>Dee\u2019s muffled words wafted from the other room. He settled in the creaky leather chair behind the check-in desk and let her soothing tones flow over him. She had a nice voice, gentle and soft like a wind whispering over airplane wings. If only she weren\u2019t shoveling lies his way faster than a snowplow.</p><p>Her voice quieted. Jacob tugged open a file drawer and tried not to watch the sway of her h*ps as she glided down the hall connecting his rooms to the reception area.</p><p>Dee paused in the doorway, her shoulder resting against the frame. She clutched the phone to her chest. \u201cThanks. The connection was crackly, but I got through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all set then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>So much for a return to peace. \u201cYour ride can\u2019t make it out here yet?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her grip tightened around the cell phone until one of the buttons chirped. \u201cIs the job open long-term? Well, as long as you plan to keep this place open. I may need it for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got someone who comes in to clean.\u201d Her panicked eyes compelled him to add, \u201cBut Grace\u2019s arthritis is acting up, and she could use the extra help.\u201d</p><p>Which was the truth, except now he had two housekeeping employees and a floundering business. Great. He would bankrupt the place at a time he needed to secure a future for his sister.</p><p>\u201cThanks again for letting me use the phone.\u201d She leaned to place it on the counter. Her dress gaped open, giving a full view of creamy br**sts encased in lace.</p><p>Jacob shifted his gaze to a file, not nearly as interesting but a hell of a lot less tempting. \u201cLet\u2019s get you into something warmer.\u201d</p><p>The now predictable battle waged in her eyes, pride versus practicality. She glanced down at that slinky little dress and nibbled her lip, then her spine straightened to a debutante stance that matched her face far more than the clothes. He could see pride had won.</p><p>Dee clasped the neckline closed. \u201cThank you, but you\u2019ve done enough already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offering to let you raid my closet. Emily\u2019s right about my wardrobe\u2014or lack of one.\u201d Since he wore a flight suit most of the time, he didn\u2019t need much in the way of civilian clothes. He gestured for her to follow him to the hall that connected the front office to the living quarters. \u201cThere\u2019s a lost-and-found box of unclaimed items folks have left in the rooms. You can help yourself.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched her toes in her shoes and looked out the ice-laced window. Starch leaked from her spine. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure it\u2019s all right. Consider it trade for the cleaning I\u2019ve done today. No handouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard about the joy of giving? Consider it an early Valentine\u2019s Day gift.\u201d Only a week away. Did she have someone besides Mr. Smith out there? Shaking off the thought, Jacob swung open the supply-closet door. \u201cRifle through and take anything you need. You can scrub a few extra sinks if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Her thin shoulders slumped before she pivoted to face him. She reached, her trembling fingers hesitating an inch shy of touching him. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful.\u201d</p><p>The heat of her hand crackled through the air and scorched his chest. An image of lace burned an imprint in his mind. His thoughts twisted along paths he had no business traveling, paths that led to wrapping his body up with her, even if only for a mind-numbingly short time.</p><p>He should swaddle her in a few layers of clothes and march her out the door for more reasons than he\u2019d originally thought. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Jacob lost himself in the routine of paperwork. For all of four minutes. Maybe he should shovel more snow one-handed\u2014ouch. Heaven knew that could keep him busy and cool him off. Or was there enough snow in a Washington winter for that just now?</p><p>He tipped his chair for a better view into the hall and let himself study her for an unrestrained moment. She\u2019d made a small pile of clothes to use, a larger pile of obvious discards neatly folded to the other side.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cDid Emily get to her boyfriend\u2019s house okay?\u201d</p><p>Jacob thudded his chair to the ground along with his thoughts, better all the way around. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She hooked an arm over the rim of the box, her slim legs tucked to the side. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only trying to make polite conversation, fill the silence a little. We\u2019re stuck here together, after all. I didn\u2019t mean to be a pest. Just say the word if you don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to be rude. I\u2019m buried in paperwork.\u201d There. That sounded like a polite excuse.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He scrolled down the computer screen and began cross-referencing expenditures for tax returns. His father hadn\u2019t been much for bookkeeping. Jacob just prayed the old man had actually paid his taxes.</p><p>He needed to come up with enough money to get Emily through the college years. His pay didn\u2019t come close to covering that. Plus, even if he could convince her to move in with him, she would need child care during school hours and someone to stay with her when he was deployed.</p><p>Dee cleared her throat and coughed, still dainty sounds. \u201cLittle Madison is precious. And the baby\u2019s father seems...involved? It was nice of you to let them have time together today.\u201d</p><p>Jacob slipped in a backup CD. \u201cLike I had a choice. As Emily said, I\u2019m her brother not her father.\u201d</p><p>Pain flashed in Dee\u2019s eyes before they turned flat as a slap of mud on a windshield. He\u2019d been curt, but the whole situation frustrated him. He wanted to beat the crap out of Chase, but Emily insisted she loved him and they were going to get married. The situation made his blood boil, so he was better off staying quiet.</p><p>The rustling of clothes brought his attention back to the present as Dee sorted through the box. How could one small woman explode into his life so fully in the span of a few hours?</p><p>\u201cI have big feet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jacob pivoted in his chair, doing a slow take toward her.</p><p>Dee sat in the middle of the discarded pile. A tennis shoe dangled off the end of her toes like Cinderella\u2019s stepsisters trying on the glass slipper.</p><p>She snatched the shoe off her foot. \u201cDid I say that out loud? Sorry, but my feet are kind of big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only just noticing?\u201d This was the strangest woman he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, just forget sometimes that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t have snow skis for feet.\u201d</p><p>If he didn\u2019t get her outfitted soon, she would never return to her room. He gave up the fight and moved to help her. He tucked into the closet and pulled out another box. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacob knelt beside it. Beside her. Damn, but he\u2019d gone from putting distance between them to landing himself six inches away. \u201cDig deep. There\u2019s a pair of gym shoes near the bottom that might come closer to fitting.\u201d</p><p>Dee peered inside, keeping a white-knuckled grip on the vee neck of her dress. It didn\u2019t make one bit of difference. Funny thing about the male imagination, he didn\u2019t actually have to see what was beneath that dress to have a clear mental picture.</p><p>He buried his hands in the box, rummaging around until he found the near-new Nikes. Jacob tossed them onto her pile. He also grabbed a ski sweater, a long one, and added it to her stack, as well. \u201cYou can go shopping with your first paycheck. Which reminds me. If you\u2019re going to work here long-term, you\u2019ll need to fill out one of these.\u201d</p> <p>Jacob lumbered to his feet, knees and ankles popping as he stood. He shuffled through a stack of papers on his desk and passed one to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour W-2 form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-2?\u201d Dee\u2019s face turned whiter than the snow in the parking lot, her wide brown eyes the only splash of color.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just fill in your name and address. I\u2019ll take care of the rest when I file it. You know. For next year\u2019s taxes.\u201d</p> <p>Dee sagged to the edge of her bed. She wanted to crawl beneath the covers and never come out. The Tacoma Police Department hadn\u2019t told her anything useful on the phone, instead insisting she needed to come in once the highway cleared. They\u2019d relayed only enough to let her know she didn\u2019t fit the descriptions from any missing persons\u2019 reports.</p><p>She clutched her little wad of clothes closer, bringing to mind an image of Emily cradling Madison earlier. Dee pressed her small bundle to her belly and rocked. Tears begging for release clogged her chapped nose. Still she rocked, refusing to cry. If she started, the fear would win. Just like if she crawled under those covers she might never tunnel back out.</p><p>At least she had a home, four paneled walls with her choice of two beds. Hers sported red plaid comforters to go with the shiny veneer furniture and cheap water-color of Puget Sound. Yes, she had a home. For now.</p><p>The W-2 form glared at her from beside the TV where she\u2019d tossed it. How would she talk her way around this one? She wouldn\u2019t, not in a shimmery crimson dress and do-me-sailor pumps.</p><p>Dee unrolled her bundle of clothes like some hobo\u2019s pack. Two pairs of sweatpants. A couple of T-shirts. An overlong sweater. And tennis shoes. She\u2019d relented and let Jacob toss in three pairs of his socks.</p><p>She peeled off the dress and panty hose with great relish. Forget practicality. She flung both into the trash. Without question, that can would be emptied pronto by the Lodge\u2019s newest housekeeping employee.</p> <p>As she stood in her lace bra and panties, Dee realized her body looked no more familiar than her face. How surreal to become reacquainted with herself at thirty-some-odd years old.</p><p>She extended her arms, twisting the right to one side and then the other arm. She discovered a faded, inch-long scar just below her left elbow and paused to trace it with her finger.</p><p>What else didn\u2019t she know about herself?</p><p>On impulse, she tugged off her bra and checked the tag: 34B. Not overly endowed, but enough to catch the attention of a certain sexy-eyed man.</p><p>She shrugged back into the bra and told herself to quit losing focus. Who she\u2019d been didn\u2019t matter as much as who she became from this point forward. She wouldn\u2019t repeat her \u201cMr. Smith\u201d mistake by turning weak-kneed over the first hunk to cross her path.</p><p>Dee whipped a T-shirt over her head and stepped into sweatpants, wriggling them over her hips. Her hands paused midtug. She couldn\u2019t have seen what she thought she had, could she? She eased the sweats down a notch.</p><p>She stared at the map of stretch marks scrolled across her stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She blinked and looked again.</p> <p>Nausea kicked into overdrive. Her hands twitched away. The pants snapped back, covering what she wasn\u2019t ready to view.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she muttered, not even caring that she was talking to herself since she\u2019d decided she might well be crazy anyway. \u201cStretch marks can come about any number of ways. Maybe I\u2019m a diet junkie with a ballooning weight problem. I\u2019ve just got babies on the brain because of little Madison.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she inched the pants lower, following the milky-white ladders all the way to\u2014</p><p>A scar. A bikini-cut, puckered scar. Just like a Cesarean section scar.</p><p>Her legs turned to soup. Dee folded into a heap on the floor. All the bottled tears and terror gushed free. Fists pressed to her stomach, she scavenged for control, strength, reason in a world turned inside out.</p><p>Her time to plan had ended. If she had a child out there somewhere, she had to find her or him. Fast.</p><p>And that meant trusting Jacob Stone with everything and pray he wasn\u2019t another \u201cMr. Smith.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>J acob pushed away from the computer. The numbers weren\u2019t going to change anytime soon and the busload of seniors should be arriving any minute now. At least he could accommodate them.</p><p>Whatever Dee\u2019s secrets, she made one hell of a great worker. She\u2019d accomplished more in a day than most would in a week. He\u2019d found nothing wrong with any of her rooms. Not at all what he\u2019d expected from a party girl.</p><p>More than her face didn\u2019t fit the profile some of her initial behavior indicated. She could have cried or pleaded her way into an extension on her room, and most men would have caved. Dee hadn\u2019t even tried.</p><p>She\u2019d shown a lot of grit on a day that would have taken most folks down. He admired that. Emily liked her, too.</p><p>He sat upright.</p><p>Could Dee be the answer to his problems? An idea started to form in his mind. She seemed to be down on her luck, with no one to call. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t mind relocating.</p><p>He\u2019d already begun working on a transfer to McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma. He qualified for a family humanitarian transfer, given he was his sister\u2019s guardian\u2014Madison\u2019s, too. Emily didn\u2019t want to move even an hour away from Chase, and Jacob would still be gone too long and often for the teen to be alone out here, especially with a baby.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t trust a stranger with his sister, but getting to know more about Dee certainly had merit.</p><p>Through the window, he saw her step from her room, the halogen lights casting a domelike effect over the snow-covered parking lot. The Cascade Mountain Range loomed dimly in the distance. Her brisk strides carried her across concrete, snowflakes sprinkling down around her. At least she wasn\u2019t shivering this time, just moving with efficiency in her new-used gray sweatpants. Somehow she made even grungy workout clothes look elegantly sexy.</p><p>No sex thoughts, dude. He needed to get his mind back on the plan. Find out more about Dee Smith. His life had been fraying at the seams for long enough. Time to start pulling things back together, starting tonight with Dee.</p><p>She pushed inside, her nose pink from the cold.</p><p>He stood to help her close the door, catching a whiff of her clean hair, which only made him itch to test the feel of it between his fingers. \u201cNice pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She glanced down and plucked at the loose cotton. \u201cOh, they\u2019re definitely warmer. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dee slipped out of her coat. Her freshly washed hair crackled into a static halo. The coal-black sweater left her face paler than before, and he worried she\u2019d worked too hard. Were her eyes red rimmed from tears or the elements?</p><p>Either way, she needed him as much as he needed her at the moment. He just had to decide how to approach her in a way that wouldn\u2019t leave her feeling pressured about her job.</p><p>Five minutes ago, he would have laughed at the thought of asking Dee to walk across the street with him. Now, he warmed to the idea of getting to know her better\u2014for his sister\u2019s benefit. \u201cHave you had anything to eat since lunch?\u201d</p><p>She dropped the W-2 form onto the check-in counter. \u201cNever mind about food. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Dee sat at the kitchenette table in Jacob\u2019s back-room apartment. She flattened her palms against the scarred oak surface, the only way to keep them from shaking. Forget trying to drink the can of Coke waiting in front of her.</p><p>She had scrounged the courage to talk to him, only to have the telephone repair crew put in their appearance. Jacob had asked her to wait in his apartment since he wanted to talk to her, too. She would bet good money his topic would be less upsetting.</p><p>The barnlike room echoed with silence. Located off the Lodge\u2019s lobby, it held the basics, a sofa and oversize recliner. The roof angled up over a bed across the room tucked in a loft. Her gaze skittered away and back to the living area. Given the masculine air, she imagined his father must have lived here. From her time cleaning, she now knew that Emily lived in two hotel rooms with connecting doors, located beside this apartment. Emily and her baby.</p><p>Dee swallowed hard. The scar on her stomach itched.</p><p>How could a mother simply cease to exist? She must have hired a babysitter if she\u2019d planned to meet with \u201cMr. Smith.\u201d Or her child could be with his or her father.</p><p>Her ring finger was bare, no cheater-mark tan line in sight to show she\u2019d worn a ring recently. While not proof positive, it reassured her somewhat.</p><p>Dee refused to believe she might be an unfaithful spouse. Regardless, she must be late with pickup or a phone call, or would be soon. Someone would report her missing.</p><p>Him or her? A son or a daughter? How awful not to know even that much. Not knowing didn\u2019t make the urge to protect any less powerful.</p><p>Of course, having a C-section scar didn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019d kept the child. Maybe she\u2019d been in a situation like Emily\u2019s and chose to give her newborn up for adoption?</p><p>Another possibility speared her. Heaven forbid, the baby might have died.</p><p>All maybes aside, she had to operate on the assumption that she did have a live child out there somewhere, and that meant enlisting Jacob\u2019s help.</p><p>His heavy tread sounded in the hall just before Jacob ducked through the doorway. \u201cSorry you had to wait. Phone lines are in working order again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Nerves bubbled in her throat like a foaming soda. She\u2019d been ready to tell him and now the words wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cI checked in with the dispatcher, and the tour bus is an hour away. So I have some downtime for a late supper.\u201d He opened the refrigerator and shoved aside a gallon of milk, unveiling a covered pot. \u201cPickings are pretty sparse around here. Good thing Emily ate with Chase\u2019s family before coming home.\u201d</p><p>He walked with ease around the minuscule kitchen, maneuvering with a lanky-limbed grace to pull out stoneware bowls, turn on the stove, place the pot on the burner. He didn\u2019t do anything quickly, but with steady purpose, opening and closing drawers as he worked. \u201cMarge\u2019s Diner serves up good country cooking, but I don\u2019t want to leave Emily here alone to deal with all those tourists.\u201d</p><p>Jacob stirred the stew. \u201cRockfish isn\u2019t large, but it\u2019s a tight-knit community. Emily will have already told Chase\u2019s mom about you, which is the same as putting an ad in the Rockfish Weekly, but faster since it comes with daily updates. By Sunday, you\u2019ll be the hot topic at church potlucks along with the latest Jell-O mold recipe.\u201d</p><p>Dee let him talk without interrupting. His bass tones washed over her, instilling a peace she hadn\u2019t felt since she\u2019d awakened, peace she desperately needed now more than ever. Had she always been attracted to this sort of man? Or had her episode with Mr. Smith rattled her into an awareness of men who wore honor on their sleeves?</p><p>Or in Jacob\u2019s case, a worn Air Force T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWe might as well preempt them with a trip to Marge\u2019s tomorrow and introduce you around. You can meet almost everyone there. The roads should open up for regular traffic by supper tomorrow.\u201d Jacob lounged a lazy hip against the counter. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him until his words registered. He couldn\u2019t be asking her out to eat. Could he? The roof seemed to lower, shrinking the room. Beside Jacob Stone, everything seemed small. He probably had plenty of women bringing him Jell-O molds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course he wasn\u2019t asking her out. She\u2019d taken a long look at herself, and she didn\u2019t find the final product all that impressive. She seemed more like a regular robin with plenty of beige and brown, splashed with that garish red dress across her middle.</p><p>Dee gripped the can to quell her shaking. \u201cSure. I should meet everyone and dispel rumors. I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin your reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d He rubbed a thumb along his forehead, then turned back to the counter. \u201cFirst, we have to take care of food now. Is there anything you can\u2019t eat? Any allergies I should know of?\u201d</p> <p>She thought of the EpiPen she kept close. This seemed like the perfect opening. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jacob glanced over his shoulder. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allergic to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His brows met for a moment before he shrugged. \u201cThen it\u2019s leftover stew. Any problems with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>He pivoted on one heel to face her, a tic starting in the corner of one eye. \u201cDon\u2019t feel obligated to stay for dinner if you\u2019re too hung over from your night out.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going well at all. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen feel free to explain what you did mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She braced her back against the chair. \u201cThe first thing I remember is waking up here this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s whole body straightened into a steely line of tension. Muscles rippled beneath his Air Force T-shirt.</p><p>Her hands clenched so tightly the aluminum can dented. The ping reverberated in the silence. If he didn\u2019t talk soon, she would snap. \u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour \u2018Mr. Smith.\u2019\u201d Jacob stomped across the yellowed linoleum for two lengthy paces before kneeling at her feet. \u201cWe have to get you to a doctor, make sure you aren\u2019t having some adverse reaction to the drugs. You were sick earlier, and you\u2019re pale. You may not be over the worst.\u201d He scrubbed a restless hand over his military-short hair. \u201cDamn it, I wonder if he used Rohypnol or GHB.\u201d</p><p>His words offered a flicker of hope. Could that be it? \u201cAmnesia drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, episodic amnesia meds. Creep in a bar drops one in a woman\u2019s drink. She blacks out for a while, then forgets what happened to her the night before.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment tasted more bitter than bile. \u201cOnly one night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoughly. That happened to the girlfriend of someone in my squadron about a year ago. The experience really put her through hell.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll get somebody in here to handle the desk while\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019m gone. I\u2019ll throw the truck in four-wheel drive, and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He pressed a broad palm to her forehead. \u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>The comfort of his touch left her on shaky ground, but she couldn\u2019t afford to weaken now. \u201cI haven\u2019t just forgotten a few hours. I can\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><p>Dee lifted a trembling hand from her can and nudged the W-2 form toward him with one finger. \u201cI can\u2019t fill this out because I don\u2019t know my real name or address. I can\u2019t tell you anything about myself.\u201d</p><p>His gaze shifted from compassionate to suspicious. \u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went from suspicious to piercing blue. Then he laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Another laugh rolled free, a dark rumbly sound like an incoming storm. \u201cOh, yeah, I heard you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m laughing at myself, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow that doesn\u2019t make me feel better right now.\u201d</p><p>Jacob pulled the bubbling stew from the burner and pitched the pot holder into the sink. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you have amnesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d He lounged against the counter. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bump on your head. Right?\u201d</p><p>She reached to feel around under her loose hair and yeah, the tender spot was still there. A lump, too? Or just a lumpy skull? Tough to tell, but maybe that was the cause. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He nodded, obviously doubtful. \u201cI would have chosen the alien abduction route. Has more flair. Maybe even toss in an Elvis sighting for fun.\u201d</p><p>Her hand drifted to her stomach, just over her scar and a churning well of panic. She\u2019d thought through a thousand scenarios where someone might take advantage of her vulnerability, but she\u2019d never considered she wouldn\u2019t be trusted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a huge gash on my head to offer as proof. But you have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>She stuffed down a sense of steely pride and anger she could ill afford right now.</p><p>His chest rose with each steady breath. \u201cYou know, Dee Smith, there\u2019s one thing that absolutely pushes my buttons, and that\u2019s someone who lies to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmnesia?\u201d He nudged the form back to her. \u201cIf you want to keep your job, you\u2019ll have to come up with a better story than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Jacob snorted. He\u2019d meant what he said about hating liars. His father had backed out on promises, concocted grandiose schemes, flat out fabricated too many times. A need for truth, people he could trust, had driven Jacob to join the military.</p><p>After thirteen years in the Air Force traveling the world, he\u2019d seen it all. But in all that time he hadn\u2019t come across a Dee Smith yet. \u201cDo you really think I intend to pass out a pay slip without running a background check or filing paperwork?\u201d</p><p>Apparently she did. There went the possibility of hiring her on as help with Emily.</p><p>Dee\u2019s head fell to rest on her folded hands. \u201cPerfect end to a perfectly wretched day.\u201d</p><p>Jacob refused to let the dejected slump of her shoulders sway him. \u201cYou can always tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d She sat up again in the dinette chair.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in some kind of trouble with the law\u2014\u201d</p><p>She tipped her face toward him, her defeated expression replaced by tight-lipped frustration. Or could it be anger?</p><p>\u201cHmm. Am I in trouble with the cops? How would I know? Aliens erased my memory in their sensory deprivation chamber. My whole history is stored on their spaceship with Elvis flying it through the galaxy at light speed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><p>Spunky as well as prideful. If only the evening had led to dinner instead of this. She\u2019d had a bad day? In the past six weeks he\u2019d been shot and lost his father.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Dee snatched her coat from the back of her chair and charged toward the door, arms pumping.</p><p>\u201cRunning away again? I\u2019m getting mighty damned tired of chasing you out into the snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho asked you to?\u201d</p><p>She had a point. She also had a great set of h*ps twitching beneath that bulky sweater and his body had picked one hell of an inconvenient time to react. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my room.\u201d She spun to face him, her hair swinging a satiny blanket around her face. \u201cIt is still my room if I pay for it, isn\u2019t it? Even if I don\u2019t work here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to finance that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElvis floated me a loan before he left.\u201d Dee stuffed her arms into her coat and marched through the archway.</p><p>Yeah, right, she\u2019d gone to get money. She would probably hole up for the night until she could cut out or concoct a better story.</p><p>Jacob glanced at the empty chair across the room, a seat with a missing spoke on the back. He\u2019d been thirteen, tipped the chair and fell over. His mother had been alive in those days and had given him an icepack for his sore head.</p><p>No amnesia there. In fact, too many memories floated around this place.</p><p>Jacob pulled a spoon from the drawer with half the anticipation he\u2019d felt when starting the meal. He turned to start eating straight from the pot\u2014and stopped.</p><p>Dee stood framed in the archway, her fists clutched by her side, her cheeks flushed from the elements.</p><p>Passing time with her wouldn\u2019t be a hardship. Except she didn\u2019t look all that happy with him. Her eyes glinted with icicles that rivaled the spikes frozen from his eaves.</p><p>Dee glided across the room like a debutante and placed folded bills on the table. \u201cThere\u2019s enough to cover tonight. No need to drive me into town tomorrow. I\u2019ll hitch a ride on the tour bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have somewhere to go after all.\u201d He tossed his spoon on the counter. Just as he\u2019d predicted, she would slip from his life as quickly as she stumbled into it.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I guess that\u2019s it.\u201d Jacob slid the cash from the table and wove the folded paper through his fingers, flipping it twice. He didn\u2019t need or want her money, just the woman who\u2019d had the patience to pass time with a mouthy teenager.</p><p>Lifting her hand, he pressed the cash into her palm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the room. You earned it today. I don\u2019t think the IRS will come after me for one day\u2019s work-for-a-room trade off.\u201d</p><p>Her hand felt good in his, small and soft. Her pulse fluttered against him like a bird, her bones easily as fragile. He couldn\u2019t make himself let go.</p><p>With a twitch, she tried to pull away, then grew still, too still. Tight lines around her mouth eased. Her brown eyes shifted, melting into a warm shade of chocolate.</p><p>She swayed, ever so slightly, toward him.</p><p>Still he cradled her hand in his, his forearms so close to her br**sts he could feel the heat of her. He could also smell the lingering scent of hotel cleaning supplies, but it mingled with something essentially Dee. Something unique, intoxicating, more unique than any of those high-priced perfumes he\u2019d seen marketers hocking on television.</p><p>Of its own volition, his head dipped. His chin brushed just beside her temple. He filled his lungs and senses with another lingering breath of her hair, of her. Dee. \u201cJust tell me your name. I can help you through whatever\u2019s going on. Running never solved anything.\u201d</p><p>Hypocrite. He forced himself not to flinch. He hadn\u2019t been around for his sister.</p><p>Dee\u2019s hand fisted in his. Easing back a step, she placed the money on the table by the salt and pepper shakers before turning on her heels.</p><p>Regret and frustration jockeyed for dominance in his testosterone-fogged brain. Why was his gut twisting into knots over this woman he\u2019d only just met?</p><p>Pausing, she spun back and carefully peeled off three more dollars. She slapped them on the table. \u201cHere. This should be enough to cover my call on your cell phone to the Tacoma Police Department.\u201d</p><p>Dee cleared the doorway before he could close his mouth.</p><p>The Tacoma PD? Why would someone running from the law call the cops? She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She also wouldn\u2019t lie about calling the cops to get his sympathy. A fabrication like that could be too easily traced.</p><p>Could she have been telling the truth after all?</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He sprinted after her, right back into the storm.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cI told William we shouldn\u2019t travel in this storm.\u201d An older woman gripped the tour bus driver\u2019s hand as she disembarked.</p><p>Dee held the lodge door open as the driver braced the frail woman with a hand to her back. Idling in the parking lot, the silver bus chugged exhaust into the night. Snowflakes danced in the headlight beams.</p><p>After Jacob\u2019s damning disbelief, she\u2019d dashed from his apartment straight into a rolling tide of guests swelling through the door in search of a warm room. She\u2019d absorbed the sight of that tour bus like a piece of salvation rumbling a diesel tune in the parking lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee tucked her hands in her pockets. She should have held her temper in check. Perhaps she should have concocted a story to tide him over until he\u2019d driven her into Tacoma. But she couldn\u2019t ignore the sense of urgency to discover if she had a child out there who needed her.</p><p>Not that she could have convinced him, anyway. He\u2019d looked like a six-foot-four-inch immovable wall, with his jaw set and eyes so cold. He didn\u2019t appear any more approachable now, towering behind the registration desk sorting through the crowd of exhausted travelers. Casting the periodic brooding stare her way. Like now.</p><p>Dee studied the bus driver, deciding on the best approach for bumming a ride. The guy was somewhere in his early fifties perhaps, with sandy-gray hair. His patience with the older lady boded well.</p> <p>Time to start begging. \u201cDo you need some help?\u201d</p><p>The driver glanced up. \u201cOh, hi. Just keep catching the door there, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Dee pressed her back against the frosted glass.</p><p>The driver\u2019s eyes flickered over Dee with appreciation as he guided the woman inside. \u201cThanks. Only another thirty-five more people to go.\u201d</p><p>Dee gave him the obligatory laugh. He offered a light chuckle in return.</p> <p>Jacob glanced over from the registration desk and frowned.</p><p>Tough. She refused to be moved by his proprietary scowl. He\u2019d had his shot at playing Sir Galahad, and he\u2019d blown it.</p><p>Although could she really blame him? Would she have believed someone who told her the same story? She honestly didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Dee tucked her coat tighter around herself and turned to the driver. \u201cCan you spare a minute to talk?\u201d A smile picked up the corners of his mouth. She needed to squelch those ideas fast. \u201cI could use a ride into town.\u201d</p><p>His eyes crinkled with the rest of his smile. \u201cStranded, huh? Wouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve run into that with this remote route. Let me get these folks unloaded first, then we\u2019ll see what we can work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d There went the rest of her money. But she no longer had time to wait for a more cost-effective alternative. She had to get into Tacoma, fast, and Jacob had decided to turn stubborn.</p> <p>Okay, she\u2019d turned irritable. But his suspicions had hurt, a lot.</p><p>Her mind wandered to the moment he\u2019d held her hand, his touch surprisingly gentle for such a large man. Her body had stirred with an odd mix of hope, security and a dangerous yearning she didn\u2019t dare explore.</p><p>Then he\u2019d asked for her real name.</p><p>Hitching a ride on the tour bus offered her best choice. She didn\u2019t have the energy or brain power to spare on complications, and Jacob Stone grew more complicated with each falling snowflake.</p><p>Dee stifled the well of exhaustion and moved to assist the remaining thirty-five disembarking seniors.</p><p>An hour later, Dee trudged through the parking lot to her room. After the last of the guests had checked in, she\u2019d pigeonholed the bus driver to cement their plans.</p><p>Jacob had darted pensive scowls their way, frowns she\u2019d ignored. If only her jittery stomach could have been as easily controlled.</p><p>Talking with the driver, she hadn\u2019t dared discuss her amnesia this time, merely saying her boyfriend had ditched her in the motel and she needed a ride into town to file a police report against the abusive jerk. She hated lying, but the cover story sounded good for getting her where she needed to go.</p> <p>The driver had agreed to her offer of twenty dollars since he would be driving a few blocks out of his way. By midafternoon tomorrow, she would be at the station.</p><p>Tugging her key free from her coat pocket, she counted along the doors until she came to her room number.</p><p>And the dark shadow lounging outside.</p><p>A six-foot-four-inch shadow.</p><p>\u201cConvince me.\u201d Jacob\u2019s gravelly bass mingled with the wind whistling through the eaves.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince me you\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>Like she could convince this rock of anything. Dee stuffed her key in the lock. \u201cI\u2019d rather go ice swimming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery mature.\u201d</p><p>She twisted her doorknob. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit running away.\u201d He angled toward her, his shoulders blocking the meager parking lot lights as well as the force of the wind. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you. You have to admit the amnesia thing\u2019s pretty far-fetched.\u201d</p><p>Did he have to be so persuasive and big and sexy? The heat of him seeped into her while the wind whipped around his body.</p><p>She flattened her back against the door. \u201cI can\u2019t change the truth to suit your idea of believable scenarios.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d Shivering, he hunched his shoulders deeper into his jacket. \u201cDo we have to talk out here? Wind chill\u2019s gotta be ten below.\u201d</p><p>Being alone with him in a room with beds didn\u2019t seem wise. Neither did freezing to death. If he\u2019d planned to hurt her, he could have done so any number of times throughout their day alone together.</p><p>Bottom line, she wanted him to believe her.</p><p>Dee twisted the knob, backing the door open. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>Following her, Jacob ducked inside. Her room wasn\u2019t small, but Jacob filled it all the same.</p><p>She draped her coat on the edge of the first bed, turned up the heat, considered what to say and why it was so important that he believe her this time. Jacob lounged against the wall until she sat at the small table, then lowered himself into the chair across from her, silently.</p><p>Words churned inside her, but she stifled them. Better to let him set the tone.</p><p>Jacob stretched his legs in front of him. \u201cWhat did the Tacoma police have to say when you called them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I\u2014Oh, the three dollars.\u201d She\u2019d forgotten about that part of her tirade. Apparently her mouth ran away from her in the midst of a good rant, another element of her personality to file away with the good and bad she\u2019d deciphered so far.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said I need to come in. I described myself, and they did concede there weren\u2019t any obvious missing persons\u2019 reports to match me. They\u2019ll run my prints and do a more thorough search when I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re willing to let them fingerprint you and run your picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Dee leaned forward, sensing she might finally be making headway. \u201cJacob, I don\u2019t have a tidy explanation for you. I woke up in this room, alone and scared out of my mind. I had to look at the telephone book to find out where I was. There wasn\u2019t even a purse or wallet with identification. Just a little money and this.\u201d She scooped her hand into the neck of her sweater, pulling free the necklace. \u201cThe closest I could even come to a name is a tarnished D. For the last time, I swear to you I don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d</p><p>A piercing stare later, he asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something this morning? Why scrub bathroom floors all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked at yourself in the mirror lately? You\u2019re pretty darned intimidating, and I\u2019m pretty darned vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>The first hint of a smile eased through his perpetual scowl. \u201cOkay, I can buy that. But what changed your mind? I didn\u2019t magically shrink.\u201d</p><p>She resisted the urge to rub her stomach. The police would have to know about the possibility of a child since it might help, but she wasn\u2019t ready to share something so private. She settled for part of the truth. \u201cWatching you with Emily and Madison made you seem more approachable.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his feet at the ankles and studied his boots until Dee thought she might spring across the table and shake him.</p><p>Jacob glanced to Dee, the furrows smoothing from his brow. \u201cSo you have amnesia.\u201d</p><p>A sigh racked through her. He believed her. He didn\u2019t look happy about it, but she could live with that. No matter what she\u2019d done before, he didn\u2019t think she was a liar. \u201cYes. I do,\u201d she whispered, her mind screaming, And I\u2019m so scared. Help me, please.</p><p>Jacob watched the fear flood her face. Any second, he expected her eyes to fill with tears.</p><p>They never did. Every line of her body cried out her grief all the same.</p><p>He set his caged instincts free. His gut told him to trust her and not let old defensiveness rule him. Simply accept her story. If his instincts were wrong, he would only be out a ride into town.</p><p>If his instincts were right, this woman needed him, badly. A woman who balked at asking for a pair a shoes, needed him.</p><p>Something primal stirred within him, latched on and wouldn\u2019t let go. Caveman in action? Maybe. Who was he to fight nature? Especially when it came in such an appealing package. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to our original plan then. I\u2019ll run you into town tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She twisted the necklace around her fingers until they turned bloodless. \u201cWhat about the motel? Who\u2019ll take care of the desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy regular cleaning lady should be back tomorrow. She can handle checkouts and then carry the cordless for incoming calls while she cleans. We\u2019ll leave early so we have plenty of daylight if the weather turns rogue again. You need to be looked over by a doctor before we head to the station\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on! I just want a ride, not a cavalry charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about your medical history?\u201d</p><p>She winced.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re a diabetic?\u201d he pressed. \u201cOr have some other condition? Head injuries can cause all sorts of problems. You need to have a doctor check you over. I have an old squadron pal stationed here. He\u2019s married to a flight surgeon.\u201d</p><p>She sagged in her seat. \u201cGood point. But do you have to be so pushy?\u201d</p><p>A grin tugged through, easing the knot in his stomach. \u201cMilitary bluntness.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have to help her long. She must have family or a boss wondering over her unexplained absence. Or a husband.</p><p>Jacob shied away from that thought like the plague.</p><p>His gaze snapped to her hand. She wasn\u2019t sporting a wedding band or a cheater mark on the pale, slim finger. Small consolation since he knew that wasn\u2019t proof positive. Meanwhile, he needed to keep her safe until the police could match her with a missing persons\u2019 report.</p><p>He could control his attraction. He had to. She needed him, whether she wanted to admit it or not.</p><p>Which meant keeping constant watch over her.</p><p>If she had some illness lurking, he couldn\u2019t let her sleep in her hotel room by herself. Even a simple head trauma necessitated being monitored through the night\u2014by him. Jacob wasn\u2019t sure what would be more difficult, convincing Dee that he should stay with her, or resisting the urges that coursed through him while he shared her room for the night.</p><p>One fact shone through without question. She wasn\u2019t sleeping alone.</p><p>\u201cSleeping with me at the apartment will be more convenient than your room.\u201d Jacob crossed his feet at the ankles.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dee\u2019s hands clenched in the loose folds of her oversize sweatpants.</p><p>She did bristle easily. He linked his fingers over his stomach. \u201cOr we can stay in your room if you prefer, but I\u2019d rather be closer to the registration desk and Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you realized that. These beds aren\u2019t long enough for me.\u201d He stood and waited. The dazed look hadn\u2019t melted from her face yet. \u201cAre you ready? How long does it take to gather up your spare sweats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time at all, because I\u2019m not gathering anything.\u201d Dee held up her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m grateful for all you\u2019ve done. But even if I weren\u2019t ready to fall flat on my face, I wouldn\u2019t pay you back by sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>Sleep with Dee. Now there was an enticing image. This probably wasn\u2019t a good time to think about the fact that he\u2019d been six months without sex since breaking off his last relationship. \u201cAs appealing as that sounds, it\u2019s not what I\u2019m suggesting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>Did she sound disappointed or was it only his over-active libido leading him into wishful territory? \u201cGiven your droopy eyes, you would probably crash before the first kiss, anyway, and wound my ego forever.\u201d</p><p>A grin tugged at her full pink lips, which in turn tugged at his self-control. Damn it all, she wasn\u2019t even his type. He usually went for the more chatty, flamboyant sorts who filled the conversation, which left him free to stay quiet.</p> <p>This woman had listener written all over her.</p><p>Tucking her into bed, alone, was the smarter move. \u201cI\u2019m talking wake-ups every two hours in case you have a concussion. It\u2019s easier if we stay in the same place, rather than me tromping through the parking lot in fifty below wind chill to wake you up to count my fingers.\u201d</p><p>Strawberry-red crawled up her face. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m a paranoid granny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re alone and don\u2019t know who to trust.\u201d Hell no, she wasn\u2019t paranoid. He wanted nothing more than to rip the bedspread off one of those mattresses and tangle his body with hers. But a rivaling need churned inside him, a need to protect her, find out who had handled this woman so carelessly.</p><p>He tipped her chin with his knuckle. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m not going to jump you while you\u2019re passed out.\u201d</p> <p>Did she know that she kept moving ever so slightly against his touch while she stared into his eyes? Just when he considered extending his reach and cupping her face in his palm, she nodded, leaning back. \u201cThank you. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Restless, Jacob stood and paced around the room, snagged her coat, turned the heat down. He yanked the door open. \u201cLet\u2019s get moving.\u201d</p><p>Frigid air blasted them. The wind nearly lifted Dee off her feet like Mary Poppins. Jacob allowed himself to drape an arm around her shoulders as they charged across the parking lot, sleet and snow stinging his skin.</p><p>Lord, she felt good against him.</p><p>Inside the lobby, Dee dipped from under his arm without meeting his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll just get some extra sheets,\u201d she mumbled as she all but sprinted for the supply closet.</p><p>Jacob shut off the coffeemaker and followed slowly. He found Dee tucking the beddings along the sofa cushions. He braced a shoulder against the archway leading from the hall to the living area. \u201cThanks. But I can take care of that myself. I\u2019m going to catch up on some paperwork out front, then I\u2019ll probably end up falling asleep in the recliner.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Dee sank to the edge of the couch and slid off her shoes. \u201cGoing to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Bed.\u201d He jabbed a thumb over his shoulder toward the loft. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s over there.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw set. \u201cYour bed is over there. My bed is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Her tennis shoes thumped to the floor. \u201cI knew you would be this way. Don\u2019t you get tired of being so predictable? Stop with the male strutting ritual. A recliner isn\u2019t a bed. If your feet hang off the edge of the motel room beds, you really can\u2019t expect to fold yourself onto this sofa. I\u2019m almost half your size. The couch is fine for me.\u201d</p><p>The woman would argue with a rock.</p> <p>\u201cDee, I\u2019m going to be up most of the night anyway. You might as well be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to sleep if you\u2019re on the sofa or in a chair.\u201d</p><p>Jacob almost laughed. Her eyelids were millimeters away from sliding closed. She\u2019d be asleep sitting up if he kept talking.</p><p>He shifted his weight to one leg. Why not let her think she\u2019d won? He could move her after she zonked out, probably less than sixty seconds from now. \u201cOkay. Have it your way. Enjoy the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I will.\u201d She lined her shoes with precision beside the sofa. After a self-conscious glance over her shoulder, she whipped the sweater over her head, unveiling the T-shirt beneath.</p><p>Carefully she folded the sweater into an exact square and put it on top of her pile of meager possessions. Seeing her take such care with cast-off clothing, Jacob wanted to buy out Macy\u2019s.</p><p>Dee slid beneath the sheets, tugging the blankets up to her chin. He watched her eyelids flicker. Just sixty seconds and temptation would be deeply asleep.</p><p>Jacob shoved away from the archway and flipped off the light switch, leaving only the fluorescent bulb over the stove on. Moonbeams filtered in through the skylight over his bed.</p><p>Sixty seconds suddenly seemed like a hell of a long time.</p><p>Burrowing deeper under the blankets, Dee flattened her spine against the sofa back. \u201cHopefully by tomorrow I\u2019ll be sleeping in my own bed. Or maybe I\u2019ll be curled up in some bay window, watching the snow and drinking hot cocoa. I think I like hot chocolate with whipped cream. It sounds good, anyway.\u201d She sighed, a heavy sound full of resignation. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to notice I\u2019m missing soon. A person can\u2019t simply disappear without somebody noticing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he lied. He\u2019d seen enough cruelty in the world to know otherwise.</p><p>\u201cMy family must be so worried.\u201d Her words slurred together.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Lord, he hoped so.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call the station again in the morning before we set out for the hospital.\u201d Her breathing grew slower, deeper with each word.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing. Bet you\u2019ll be glad to see the last of that cleaning bucket.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to have drifted off, so he eased forward a step. Dee burrowed her head into the pillow, and he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who left me here. What did he look like?\u201d</p><p>Jacob called to mind the face of the man who\u2019d signed the register, a scumbag he very much wanted to deck. \u201cAbout five foot ten. Medium build. Midthirties with blond hair.\u201d He struggled to remember more about a guy he\u2019d seen for all of about five minutes. \u201cHis clothes looked expensive, good quality Gore-Tex as if he knew what he needed for this kind of weather. And no wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>Now that he thought about it, he remembered glancing at the guy\u2019s finger since he\u2019d checked in as a Mr. and Mrs. \u201cI wish I could give you more.\u201d</p><p>Especially since it was her only hope for a link to her old life. Even if the link sucked, big-time.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s too much to hope for that he got lost looking for morning coffee.\u201d Her voice faded into a final shaky sigh.</p><p>A tiny, scared sigh that stabbed clean through him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out who you are,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Jacob stepped away from the kitchen counter.</p><p>Sixty seconds complete. Dee\u2019s chest rose and fell in the even pattern of heavy sleep. He ambled over and knelt beside her.</p><p>Only in his life for one day and he would never forget her. What made her so special? Sure she was pretty, but not a knockout by technical standards. And she was so delicate\u2014but stubborn.</p><p>She had a fire and grit he respected. No whining or clinging-vine crap; she\u2019d pulled herself through a day that would have sent most people diving into a bottle of Valium.</p><p>Jacob eased his arms under her, slowly, watching for signs of stirring. There weren\u2019t any. She\u2019d fallen asleep hard and fast, her slender body deadweight.</p><p>Dead? His gut fisted. He\u2019d been so concerned with concussions, he hadn\u2019t considered foul play.</p><p>He should have considered that straight up. Jacob forced himself to recall every detail of \u201cMr. Smith\u2019s\u201d face, his vehicle. Hopefully the Suburban plate number could be traced. He had it on file.</p><p>And if it couldn\u2019t be traced...That implied a danger for Dee he didn\u2019t even want to consider.</p><p>Jacob tucked her more securely against his chest. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from dropping his head closer and inhaling, tightening his grip and savoring her softness she\u2019d hidden beneath the sweater all day.</p><p>If John Smith had wanted her dead, it wouldn\u2019t have been difficult. There must be another answer, and they would find it at the police station.</p><p>He would help her through the police procedural red tape in a way her tour bus buddy never could. The Tacoma PD would damn well do their best to find out who this Dee Smith/Jane Doe was. He would make sure of that.</p><p>Gently he lowered her to his bed. He draped the quilt over her and stroked the hair from her face. Silky strands slid through his fingers, glistening in the beams shimmering through the skylight. His battered knuckles skimmed petal-soft skin.</p><p>A man could lose himself in her softness.</p><p>But she needed to remember her past, and he was a man who wanted to leave his behind.</p><p>Standing by the lobby coffee machine, Dee sunk her teeth into a cream-filled chocolate doughnut. She would vacuum carpets until the end of time for more of these.</p><p>She stared at Jacob through the plate-glass window as he warmed his truck for their trip into town. All faded denim and elemental power, he made her mouth water for more than doughnuts.</p><p>Jacob\u2019s deep voice had reached to her through the night, comforting, protecting, wrapping itself around her like the quilt. She might not have always known where she was, but his voice had anchored her as she embraced another snippet of sleep.</p><p>Man, she was hungry, ravenous, wide-awake and better rested than she could ever remember feeling. A laugh snuck free. Like that was a stretch given she had a little over twenty-four hours\u2019 worth of memories.</p><p>What had he thought as he\u2019d moved her to his bed? The notion of him carrying her was both frustrating and more than a bit exciting.</p><p>Putting that first horrible day behind her made the world seem full of possibilities. It was okay to lean on Jacob, just a little. They were only riding into town together.</p><p>She watched him prepare the truck. Methodical. Steady. He moved with even-paced determination. He stepped from the cab, leaving the blue Ford running, puffy clouds billowing from the exhaust pipe.</p><p>Snow dusted his jet-black hair and shoulders. He really should wear a hat. She almost grabbed one for him, but stopped herself. She could already envision his sleepy-lidded look if she shouted out the door to him like some overprotective mother or schoolteacher.</p><p>His arms reached an impossibly long stretch across the windshield to scrape ice. Just below the waist of his navy ski parka, his jeans pulled taut against his backside. Chocolate melted in her mouth, warm and full over her taste buds.</p><p>Jacob knelt to disconnect the electrical cord from the block heater and thoughts of long, chocolate-flavored kisses slid away.</p><p>Block heater. A unique piece of equipment. The special addition to cold-weather-area vehicles to protect the battery. That wasn\u2019t standard information except for someone who lived in extreme climates.</p><p>Yes. She wanted to dance. A real clue. Maybe more would come to her throughout the day. And if she were from this region, that would make locating her all the easier.</p><p>Background information. A small bit, but so important to a woman with little enough to call her own, and a driving need to find out if she had a child.</p><p>Dee dashed for the door, ready to share her revelation. \u201cJacob, guess what?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, snowflakes hanging on those long lashes of his. For a moment, no clouds darkened his eyes, just a pale, clear blue for her to fly into.</p><p>She forgot how to talk. Thinking became temporarily optional, as well, while she let his eyes glide over her.</p><p>Dee cleared her throat. She pointed to the cord dangling from the truck grill. \u201cThat\u2019s a block heater.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. His blue eyes became moody and impenetrable again. \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA block heater. I know what it is. I can see one in my head. I have one. I must be from the North, or was at some time.\u201d</p><p>A half smile kicked up one corner of his mouth. \u201cGood, good. Go with it. What does the car look like?\u201d</p><p>Dee closed her eyes and thought, hard. Squinting though one eye at Jacob, she said, \u201cBrown, maybe?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. Model? Make?\u201d</p><p>She grappled for the memory. She should have chased the thought while it was fresh.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d His hand cupped her shoulder. \u201cYou did well. Don\u2019t force it. It\u2019s a positive sign you\u2019re remembering bits and pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d The weight of his hands reassured her enough to push out the question she\u2019d been afraid to ask but had to have answered. \u201cDid you see Mr. Smith\u2019s car when he checked in?\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s broad hand cupped her shoulder. \u201cWhite Suburban. I checked my files this morning, and he had dealer plates, in-state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot great, but maybe the police can still track him.\u201d</p><p>She looked up into those wolflike eyes, eyes that had greeted her hourly during the night.</p> <p>With a final squeeze, Jacob\u2019s hand fell away. \u201cEmily\u2019s got the front desk until Grace arrives in another half hour. Let\u2019s hit the road.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulder felt bare without his comforting touch. She hadn\u2019t known to miss that comfort three seconds ago. How silly to mourn its loss now.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Dee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dee roused herself from a blatant stare at his bare head with its beautiful hair and reddened ears. \u201cYeah, just let me grab one more thing from inside.\u201d</p><p>Dee gripped the rail for balance as she dashed up the steps. Without giving herself time to think why, she headed straight for the coatrack and snatched Jacob\u2019s hat.</p><p>Chapter 6</p> <p>\u201cW ho\u2019s your doctor friend?\u201d After over a half hour of ten-ton silence, Dee tried yet another attempt to jump-start a conversation. This guy had pensive down to an art form, and she needed a distraction from the nerves eating up her stomach lining.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jacob glanced from the road to Dee sitting in the truck cab beside him. The knit cap lay between them on the tan tweed seat.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about the doctor I\u2019ll be seeing.\u201d She shifted to face Jacob.</p><p>Jacob hooked his wrist over the steering wheel. For a moment, it seemed he wouldn\u2019t answer, merely let the telephone poles whiz by at a monotonous pace. A toolbox in the backseat rattled in the silence. \u201cLike I said before, she\u2019s the wife of an old crewmate from South Carolina. He\u2019s stationed here at McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma now. Actually they both are since she\u2019s a military doctor\u2014Kathleen Bennett.\u201d</p><p>From the solemn set of his jaw, he probably wanted to drop her and all her problems. Although it stung being considered little more than a nuisance, she couldn\u2019t blame him for not wanting to chat it up with his annoying amnesiac tenant. \u201cI\u2019ve imposed on you enough. Let\u2019s go straight to the police station.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid from the road to her with the slow shake of his head. \u201cYour health comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of waiting for answers. I need a name, a real name.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop the notion that she wanted to meet Jacob on a more even footing, as an independent woman meeting an intriguing, sexy man, rather than the whole dependency scenario. \u201cBesides, I won\u2019t have insurance until we know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Bennett won\u2019t charge you anything. I already called ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Frustration made her want to clench her fists and pitch an unholy tantrum. \u201cWhile I appreciate your help, I should have some say in my own life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d His mouth curved into one of those rare, one-sided smiles. \u201cOf course you should.\u201d</p><p>What would a full wicked smile that twinkled in his eyes look like? This wasn\u2019t the kind of distraction she needed. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the station now, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink for a minute. You\u2019ve been in contact with the Tacoma PD every couple of hours and nothing\u2019s coming through. They\u2019re running the license plate from the Suburban now. I didn\u2019t want to scare you when we discussed it before, but we need to be sure nothing\u2019s seriously wrong. Finding out who you are won\u2019t be worth a damn if you pass out on the precinct floor.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps his one-word answers hadn\u2019t been so bad after all. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t I have already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for the doctor to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right, and I\u2019m irritable. There\u2019s so much beyond my control, I can\u2019t stop grasping at any little thing I can manage. Does that make any sense?\u201d</p><p>His smile faded altogether. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Back to one-word answers. So much for conversation.</p><p>Dee stared out over the endless stretch of snow road, mountain peaks just visible through the misty fog. She monitored the mile markers, city limits now only ten miles away.</p><p>Anticipation tingled through her at the notion of discovering her identity and hopefully answers about a possible child. Even so, she couldn\u2019t stop a sliver of regret from mingling into the mix. Regaining her memory could mean saying goodbye to Jacob.</p><p>Jacob was more than ready to say goodbye to whoever had been following them since they\u2019d left the Lodge.</p><p>The snowy haze made it difficult to keep track of cars around them beyond headlights beaming through soupy weather. But he\u2019d seen the same light-colored SUV peek through the fog again and again. He couldn\u2019t be sure of the paint job with all the sludge on the vehicle, but he also couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Mr. Smith\u2019s white Suburban.</p><p>Of course with so many SUVs around here, the odds of seeing slush-covered Suburbans were high. It could be coincidence. He\u2019d tried slowing, speeding up, even taking a side road and still he could swear they had a tail.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to stress out Dee further, especially not before a doctor\u2019s okay on her health. At least she wasn\u2019t pressing for conversation anymore and he could keep his full attention on making sure they made it to the base safe and sound.</p><p>No one would get through the front gate without proper identification.</p><p>He checked the rearview mirror again. Nothing but snow and a sedan now. Still, the unease itched. Maybe he was being overly cautious.</p><p>But until he knew what had happened to Dee, he couldn\u2019t relax his guard.</p><p>\u201cThere are no drugs in your system.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Kathleen Bennett\u2019s words brought Dee a mixed swell of relief and disappointment. Relief over nothing toxic in her system, and disappointment that the answer wouldn\u2019t be simple.</p><p>She took in the military doctor, a flight surgeon who wore a green flight suit with a stethoscope around her neck. The woman inspired trust with a brisk no-nonsense confidence that Dee appreciated. She would focus on that, trust that and try not to think overlong about Dr. Bennett\u2019s slight swell of pregnancy that made Dee\u2019s stomach clench.</p><p>She forced back the need to take Jacob\u2019s hand. While he\u2019d sat in the waiting room throughout her morning full of exams, she\u2019d asked that he be allowed to join her afterward.</p><p>Watching him walk so confidently through his military world at McChord Air Force Base sparked confidence in her\u2014and a yen to see him in his flight suit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send your blood work out for more extensive testing, but so far there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary.\u201d Dr. Bennett tucked her pen behind her ear into her red braid and flipped through the chart. \u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got a bump on you head, but not severe enough for us to be concerned about.\u201d</p><p>Jacob swallowed, a long, slow ripple of muscle along his strong neck.</p><p>He was worried? For her? He\u2019d hidden it well earlier in the truck, so distant and moody, only relaxing somewhat once they crossed through the front gate of the base.</p><p>Regardless, she wanted to clutch his hand in gratitude rather than for comfort. Someone cared what happened to her. How small and incredible a thought.</p><p>Jacob pressed, \u201cWhen will we hear back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week at the most.\u201d</p><p>Dee winced. \u201cSo many tests. Expensive tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d</p><p>Jacob had, she must mean, but Dee couldn\u2019t afford to argue. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Bennett flipped another page on the chart. \u201cYour psychiatric evaluation came back basically normal.\u201d</p><p>An airplane roared overhead and Dee flinched. Just the jolt of the unexpected noise, right? Not freaking out with a panic attack, damn it. Still she had to ask, \u201cBasically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re displaying moderate signs of anxiety, but that\u2019s perfectly normal given the situation. I\u2019d be more concerned if you weren\u2019t at all stressed by the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>A calm settled over her for the first time. \u201cYou believe me.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cOh, yes, you passed that part of the psyche eval with flying colors. I can prescribe something for the anxiety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d A thought occurred to her. \u201cAlthough I was carrying an EpiPen with me and I have no idea what I\u2019m allergic to.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Bennett frowned. \u201cWere you wearing a medical alert bracelet?\u201d</p><p>A good thought on the doctor\u2019s part, but, \u201cNo, and I haven\u2019t found one anywhere in my room.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her pen from behind her ear. \u201cIt could be any one of a million things. The most common allergies I see are to bees, peanuts and shellfish. You should probably avoid those and keep the epinephrine close. I\u2019ll send you home with a few extra to keep around, just in case one gets lost. I\u2019ll also give you a printout of symptoms to be aware of in case of an allergic reaction.\u201d</p><p>Dee slid her hand into her pocket, her fist closing around the medicine. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d The doctor scribbled a notation on her chart, then tucked the pen back into her red braid. \u201cYou\u2019ve managed well so far, but don\u2019t hesitate to let me know if something changes.\u201d</p><p>Jacob stepped from behind the gurney as if to block the door. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have for us?\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s hand fell to rest on the barely visible pregnancy bulge as if to soothe a restless child. \u201cTo be honest, Dee, I can\u2019t explain why you\u2019re suffering a memory loss. Until you remember, we have no way of knowing. On the bright side, you\u2019re a healthy young woman, somewhere in your early thirties, I would guess. You\u2019ve had your appendix and tonsils removed. You\u2019re O Positive and don\u2019t wear glasses. You weren\u2019t battered, attacked or raped. No signs of a sexually transmitted disease.\u201d</p><p>She paused, shuffling uncomfortably for the first time.</p><p>Dee couldn\u2019t take her eyes off that hand circling a pregnant stomach. She already knew the answer before she asked the question. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been pregnant at least once, delivering by Cesarean section.\u201d</p><p>Dee exhaled, surprised how hearing what she already knew still sucker punched her. A baby. A child. Son or daughter. She squeezed her eyes shut for three calming breaths.</p><p>She opened her eyes and found Jacob\u2019s hands clenched by his sides. She should have prepared him for this. It hadn\u2019t been fair to surprise him, but how could she have slid it into polite conversation? By the way, I have this nifty scar on my belly that leads me to believe I\u2019ve had a baby or two. Oh, yeah, and don\u2019t forget the sexy stretch marks.</p><p>Jacob cleared his throat. \u201cAny idea when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot recently, judging by the incision. Again, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do more for you than that.\u201d</p><p>Jacob pivoted on his boot heels toward Dee, and she turned away. She couldn\u2019t face any more questions from Jacob, not yet. \u201cThank you, Doctor. At least I know I\u2019m not dying or crazy. That\u2019s something, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d The doctor squeezed Dee\u2019s arm.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. She wasn\u2019t content to let time take its course and hope someone might be looking for her. She had a child to find.</p><p>She\u2019d also started a new life, a life rapidly filling with people, responsibilities and debts to repay. Emotional as well as financial. To do that, she needed to hop off the gurney and stop feeling sorry for herself. She pulled her attention back to the doctor\u2019s words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJacob, I want to take a look at your arm before you two head out to the police station. And don\u2019t bother to tell me you\u2019re fine. I know all about the ego you boys tote around, and I\u2019m not backing down.\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s arm. How could she have forgotten his injury just because he\u2019d ditched his sling? She\u2019d been so immersed in her own mess that she hadn\u2019t even given him any warning of what they would hear. She was being selfish, especially after all he\u2019d done for her.</p><p>Now if she could just scavenge some communication skills she had no way of knowing she possessed.</p> <p>Hunger roared to life within him, a hunger fired by more than the woman walking beside him as they left the police station and settled into his truck.</p><p>They\u2019d filed an official report. During their afternoon at the station, they hadn\u2019t learned anything new from the police about her. The cops had actually been more interested in the fact that the Suburban plates hadn\u2019t appeared in any data bank. Had Mr. Smith written down the wrong number by accident or on purpose? No way of knowing.</p><p>Jacob gripped the steering wheel tighter. He\u2019d done all he could for today. With a trip to the doctor and the cops. Now he couldn\u2019t avoid thinking about what they\u2019d learned from Doc Bennett.</p><p>Dee had a child.</p><p>Just when he\u2019d thought he couldn\u2019t be surprised anymore, there came the latest bombshell. Jacob slid the key into the ignition and cranked the engine. He hooked his arm along the seat, turning to look out the rear window as he backed out.</p> <p>Seeing Dee stopped him cold.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t crying, not outwardly. She simply sat, her fingers gripping the lap belt over her stomach. And she was shaking, not much, but enough for him to notice. Her teeth began chattering.</p><p>\u201cThe heat should kick in soon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded tightly, her face front, her gaze veering neither left nor right.</p><p>He slid the truck back into Park. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Dee nodded again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me a little here.\u201d</p><p>Her head tucked, the bare curve of her neck showing through the glide of her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in. That\u2019s all. I\u2019ll be fine. How\u2019s your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cleared to go back to work when my leave\u2019s over in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so relieved to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s fists squeezed around the seat belt until her knuckles shone white as the tender line of her neck. He\u2019d watched plenty of women pump out tears over the years, but he\u2019d never seen one try so valiantly not to cry.</p><p>It caught him like a quick uppercut to the jaw. Anger began to take a backseat to sympathy and something else. Something dangerous that lured him to sling an arm along the back of her seat. \u201cYou\u2019re not fine.\u201d</p><p>She dipped her head lower and mumbled, \u201cRocket scientist as well as military hero and motel mogul.\u201d</p><p>Jacob felt a chuckle escape. How could he not admire her grit? He should have realized she\u2019d fire back, a way of going numb rather than launching into overemotionalism.</p> <p>He notched a knuckle under her chin and lifted her face. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out who you are. And we\u2019re going to find out about your child. I know you don\u2019t always welcome my help, hell, anyone\u2019s help, but I\u2019m in for the long haul. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged away, swiping the back of her hand across her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you before about the C-section scar.\u201d</p><p>At least she\u2019d begun to thaw, not that it relieved him the way it should have. \u201cI know now, and we\u2019re doing all we can. The world won\u2019t end if we sit tight for a few minutes while you have a good cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSobbing my eyes out won\u2019t fix anything.\u201d</p><p>She had that much right. Why then did he want to convince her she needed a good three-hanky vent?</p><p>Jacob unbuckled her seat belt and allowed himself to cup her shoulders. Even through her coat, he could feel her fragile bones, but he now knew she had a steely spine for support.</p><p>He tugged her toward him. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She resisted, as he\u2019d known she would.</p><p>\u201cI just need to hold you for a second, okay?\u201d</p><p>Her back bowed as she angled away. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He reminded himself he was only convincing her because she needed to be held. Not because he was locked in the grip of some fierce longing to press her against him and reassure himself. \u201cBecause you\u2019re all right. I was worried about you. And because I know you must be scared as hell wondering if you have a kid out there somewhere!\u201d</p><p>Dee sniffled and Jacob smiled, not because he was glad she\u2019d begun crying but because for once he understood her. He could handle tears, dish out comfort. He pulled her to his chest. His forehead fell to rest against her hair. Motel shampoo mixed with the lingering antiseptic scent of the hospital.</p><p>For years, he\u2019d accepted that the honed instinct to protect couldn\u2019t be shut off at the end of a mission. The need to protect the woman in his arms throbbed through him. It scoured him, tearing away boundaries, leaving behind something more basic, fundamental, elemental.</p><p>His hand traveled up to cradle the back of her head, his fingers massaging her scalp. The very feel of her sizzled up his arm, shooting straight through him with a need he\u2019d stamped down for longer than he cared to remember.</p><p>God, he wanted her. Not that he could do a thing about it. The woman had just been subjected to a traumatic morning filled with an invasive physical and a police interrogation.</p><p>With shaky restraint, Jacob fenced in his own needs and continued rubbing gentle, small circles into her head. A moan whispered from her lips, nothing much, just a small little breath of sound.</p><p>A small sound that charged the air.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his arms, tighter, then crawled to his shoulders and into his hair. She tilted her face just as she pulled his down to meet her.</p><p>What the hell? He\u2019d promised himself he wouldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. She was.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jacob.\u201d She skimmed her lips over his.</p><p>Cradling her to him, still half-afraid she might be as fragile as she looked, Jacob brushed her mouth with his in a tender salute. The thread of longing between them pulled tauter, drawing him deeper. Gently he traced her lips, then teased her tongue with his, tasting morning coffee and acquainting himself with the unique flavor of Dee.</p><p>She flattened herself to him. Her fingers gripped the neck of his shirt and tugged, hard. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>So much for thoughts of restraint.</p><p>His mouth settled over hers with a firm rightness he could have never predicted, and wasn\u2019t quite sure he could handle while maintaining any semblance of sanity.</p><p>Dee all but wrapped herself around him as she kissed him back, fiercely, with an intensity that rocked all his plans for reserve. Maybe he\u2019d thawed her a little too much. Her kisses had a frenzied edge that went beyond passion.</p><p>A chill settled over Jacob. She didn\u2019t really want him, just somebody, anybody to shake her from the numbing sensation that had come from her messed-up life.</p><p>Talk about the proverbial bucket of cold water. If\u2014when\u2014he made love to her it wouldn\u2019t be in the front seat of a truck, and it wouldn\u2019t be because she was running from something.</p><p>He wanted her running to him.</p><p>\u201cDee, we have to stop.\u201d With more than a little regret, he untwined her arms from around his neck. \u201cWe\u2019re in a parking lot.\u201d</p><p>And damned if that didn\u2019t make him start looking over his shoulder again as he\u2019d done during their drive into town. Luckily nobody appeared to be paying any attention to a truck with fogged windows.</p><p>She stiffened, then flung herself away against the seat. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that. Like you haven\u2019t already got a thousand reasons to think all sorts of crazy things about me, I go adding more ammo to the impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thinking anything other than you needed to blow off some steam, and this isn\u2019t the right way. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Well, it wasn\u2019t, but it would be once he could suck in a few more breaths.</p><p>Her sigh rippled through the air before she nodded and smiled, a wry, wobbly grin that caressed his hand. \u201cWhat a first kiss, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first kiss. Even if I\u2019ve been kissed a thousand times before, it\u2019s not like I remember any of them. So this is it. My new first. Is that strange or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what.\u201d A new chill seeped through Jacob, dousing his need more effectively than a dive into a snowbank.</p><p>Yes, he wanted her, and he couldn\u2019t help but notice she might want him a little in return. But they had a problem.</p><p>He\u2019d considered any number of reasons why he shouldn\u2019t lunge across the truck cab and convince her to find the nearest bed\u2014or even ask her out to dinner and a movie. She had a life out there somewhere. He had a mess of a life here.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t considered one fundamental reason to tread warily, if at all.</p><p>This woman beside him, a woman who signed into a motel as \u201cMrs. Smith,\u201d a woman who\u2019d given birth to a child, a woman who might well have a husband, this woman was for all intents and purposes\u2014a virgin.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>H e hated that damned virtuous act of hers. Of anyone, he knew how she really acted in bed.</p><p>His foot pressed the accelerator, the SUV\u2019s tires gripping for traction even with the four-wheel drive. He forced his focus back on the road as he neared the Lodge. He just needed to see her, find out what she was doing, be sure she wasn\u2019t making it with some other guy.</p><p>Everybody should know what a slut she was. They should hear the truth about her, but he couldn\u2019t tell them. He\u2019d needed to be attentive, loving. Appearances mattered. What people thought of him mattered if he ever wanted to put his life back together again.</p><p>He turned off the highway onto the side road, hunting rifles rattling in the floorboards as he bumped and jostled toward the out-of-the-way restaurant. All he\u2019d wanted was money and a way out of the ball-and-chain life he\u2019d been stuck with.</p><p>So why didn\u2019t he just leave? Loose ends. If it weren\u2019t for their kid, he would have walked away from her a long time ago.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait for luck to turn his way any longer. He needed to take fate into his own hands.</p><p>Dee stared out the truck window. She wanted to ask more about Jacob\u2019s military world, a place where he felt comfortable, even if the gates and fences and airplanes roaring overhead left her feeling a bit claustrophobic. But Jacob was even more reticent than he\u2019d been on the drive earlier.</p><p>Perhaps the icy roads simply demanded his full attention.</p><p>At first, she\u2019d wondered if Jacob\u2019s moodiness could be a by-product of her having thrown herself at him. What had she been thinking? Obviously she hadn\u2019t been thinking of anything but soaking up the comfort of his strength.</p><p>Dee spun thoughts of him over and over as they drove along the gravel road toward Marge\u2019s Diner. She could imagine him in a uniform. The mental picture was more than a little exciting, the brooding, twenty-first-century warrior. It seemed right somehow.</p><p>The same man running a motel for years on end...That image didn\u2019t gel at all. Already she recognized his need for action, his inescapable manner of taking charge. It wasn\u2019t frenzied, just even-paced, steady, as he took care of everything from filing a police report to making sure she remembered to eat.</p><p>Jacob slowed the truck, wheels crunching across the diner\u2019s parking lot. Trucks and Suburbans dominated the unmarked spaces. A replica of a prairie schoolhouse sat perched by a lake. The candy-apple-red building splashed color onto the otherwise gray mountainous horizon. A pier spiked out of the frozen waters, providing a narrow wooden path above the sheet of ice.</p><p>Not at all what she\u2019d expected.</p><p>She\u2019d been looking for some fifties throwback diner with jukeboxes and counter service. Had she subconsciously substituted something from her own hometown into expectations for Jacob\u2019s area? She reached into her mental recesses in hope of finding the face of her child.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacob parked between a pair of slush-caked 4X4s. \u201cReady to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The shadowy vision melted like the ice cream she would never see eaten. Disappointment avalanched over her, nearly smothering her with frustration. Dee reached for her seat belt and jabbed at the button. \u201cYeah. Sorry. I\u2019m actually hungry.\u201d</p><p>Three jabs later, she still couldn\u2019t wrestle the buckle open. Jacob covered her hand with his and released the latch. His hand didn\u2019t move away with the seat belt. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Could have been everything. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of how it feels like a memory is right there, but I can\u2019t chase it down.\u201d</p><p>Absently he caressed the inside of her wrist with a callused finger. \u201cMaybe while we\u2019re waiting for supper, we could play some word association games, see if we can stir up your past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d She wanted to imprison his hand. Better yet, haul him back into the truck, into an embrace, the only place she\u2019d been where the insidious whispers of loneliness had faded.</p><p>Instead she allowed herself a selfish moment to rest in the heat of his eyes as they studied her, as they held her in a grip equally as powerful as his arms ever could be. His musky scent permeated the interior of the truck, and she breathed in the reassurance of pure Jacob.</p><p>Gently he released her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get moving.\u201d</p> <p>So much for making new memories. She would be better served hunting for the old.</p><p>Climbing the diner steps, Dee leaned against Jacob\u2019s arm until they reached the double doors. Nerves pattered a jig in her stomach. She assumed she understood the basics of etiquette, but she didn\u2019t want to embarrass Jacob, even unwittingly.</p><p>Part of her wanted to hide out in her dark but familiar motel room until she remembered. Another, stronger part of her insisted she step back into the world if she ever hoped to regain her past and find her child. To do that, she needed Jacob\u2019s help. The diner could well provide a wealth of information about him, a man who intrigued her, yet unsettled her. A man she had to trust with everything.</p><p>She strode into the restaurant with the long-shot hope that someone might recognize her. The inside of Marge\u2019s Diner matched the outside decor. Long, rough-hewn picnic tables filled with customers lined the room, everyone from families to a table of military members in uniforms\u2014more flight suits to torment her imagination. Apparently the appeal of this place enticed people to drive a long way in crummy conditions.</p><p>Dishes clanked, and voices mingled. A family of five studied the daily specials posted on a chalkboard over the cash register. The board also listed instructions not to tattle, spit, pinch or pull ponytails.</p><p>Dee loved it. She unwrapped her scarf from around her head, a sense of utter rightness coaxing her to step farther inside. She needed a haven, some bit of peace to end a day that had stunk. \u201cOh, Jacob, this place is great. No wonder it\u2019s packed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a feeling you might like it. You\u2019ll have to tell Marge when she brings our order.\u201d Jacob followed the waitress as she pointed to the empty table for two in the back.</p><p>A table that waited just past a field of inquiring faces.</p><p>Nerves returning like a bad penny, Dee stumbled back a step. She couldn\u2019t shake the notion that someone was staring at her. Maybe they all were.</p><p>When they found out about her amnesia, would they label her a liar as Jacob had initially? Or would they think her a nutcase? \u201cMaybe we should order takeout and go back to the motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFried walleye demands to be eaten while hot.\u201d</p><p>As he guided her toward the table, Jacob offered nods and offhand greetings to people who called out and slapped him on the back.</p><p>A hulking tall man in a green flight suit pushed back from his table and stood. \u201cHey, Mako, everything must have gone okay at the base. I didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d be done so fast.\u201d</p><p>Jacob stopped, placing a steadying hand between Dee\u2019s shoulder blades. \u201cDee, this big guy is married to Doc Bennett. Bronco, this is Dee.\u201d</p> <p>She extended her hand, preparing for a crushing grip. Yet the aviator shook with a firm but not-too-tight clasp. She\u2019d liked his wife and found she already liked the husband, too. \u201cYour wife was very generous with her time today. I appreciate it more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with Mako. That makes you one of us and we take care of our own.\u201d</p><p>How much did he know of her problem? She didn\u2019t plan to put it out there and he politely didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>Jacob turned to the other man at the table who was holding a fistful of French fries. \u201cThis is Crusty.\u201d</p><p>The wiry guy cranked a megawatt grin as he dumped the fries back on his plate, swiped his hand across his flight suit and shook hers with an energetic pump. \u201cGreat to meet you. My wife is gonna be torqued that we all got to see you first. Well, and that we saw Mako, too. Maybe you can talk this fella into accepting one of our dinner invitations before he heads back to Charleston.\u201d</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t know what to say to all of that so she simply smiled in return. Within seconds the men were discussing the flight the two had just completed and Dee let herself relax. Then suddenly she didn\u2019t feel so calm after all.</p><p>Back to Charleston. Somehow she\u2019d forgotten what Emily said about Jacob being stationed somewhere else.</p><p>Panic bubbled in her stomach. How could she have become so dependent on a man she\u2019d known for a day and a half? But her life consisted of just those few hours and he\u2019d filled most of them.</p><p>She forced her breathing to even out while they finished their conversation. Then, thank goodness, Jacob powered ahead without pausing to give anyone else a chance to ask the questions stamped in their curious eyes. She shook off the uneasy sensation of being gawked at and charged forward.</p><p>He held the chair for her before settling across the table. She forced her hands to steady, reminded herself to relax.</p><p>With a fingernail, she flicked the edge of a menu that peeked from inside an old school primer. \u201cCan we not tell people about my, uh, memory issue just yet? I don\u2019t want that to be everyone\u2019s first impression of me\u2014crazy amnesiac lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever lowers your stress level. I didn\u2019t say anything to the guys over there, in case you were wondering. I spoke straightaway with the doc and she\u2019ll keep patient confidentiality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Dee stole another glance at the diner\u2019s patrons and wondered if everybody would treat her problems with as much care as Jacob had.</p><p>Table by table, diners stopped staring and returned to their meals. Except for one group over by the potbellied stove soda dispenser. Emily was standing there, draped over a teenage boy. They were with a group of seemingly normal, everyday kids.</p><p>A fragment of Dee\u2019s peace edged away. What kind of life did her own child have? Was she missed along with trips to the park and ice-cream parlor? Dee couldn\u2019t decide which bothered her more\u2014her child crying for her or not missing her at all.</p><p>Jacob drummed his straw against the table absently. \u201cLet\u2019s try a word association game.\u201d</p><p>Anything sounded better than waiting around for her past to magically unveil itself. Of course, it also made her all the more vulnerable to Jacob. What would she reveal unwittingly? \u201cOkay. Ready whenever you are.\u201d Liar.</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>An empty hall echoed. \u201cHouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHouse.\u201d</p><p>Stenciled cartoon airplanes along a wall. \u201cNursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>Love. \u201cChild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHusband.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. She drew a blank. Her head throbbed with the effort of trying to force an image. She pressed her fingers to her aching temples. \u201cIt\u2019s fading.\u201d</p><p>Jacob touched her elbow. \u201cWe\u2019ll try again later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Dee swiped her hand over her forehead, feeling wobbly and caught between two worlds. She looked around the room to ground herself in the moment.</p><p>Her gaze hooked on Emily feeding French fries to the teenager she guessed to be Chase. His mother must be watching the baby, because Madison wasn\u2019t anywhere in sight. Chase\u2019s clothes hung from his frame. Broad shoulders filled out his oversize T-shirt and open button-down. Dee couldn\u2019t help but think that if Emily were her daughter, she\u2019d blow that boy out of the water for putting his hands so low on Emily\u2019s hips, especially in public.</p><p>She could see the tension in Jacob\u2019s jaw, felt an echoing frustration. What was the right answer for those two? She honestly didn\u2019t know. They were stuck in such an awkward age, hiding all those confused feelings behind too much hair and droopy pants, teenagers trying on new personas like hats.</p><p>Was she much better off? Trying to find pieces of herself and patch them into a whole person.</p><p>Even if she discovered her old identity, she wondered how much of the new creation she would carry with her. She couldn\u2019t imagine emerging from this ordeal as if it had never happened. Certainly her short time knowing Jacob would be imprinted on her brain long after she left Rockfish and this moody man behind.</p><p>\u201cSupper was nice.\u201d Clouds puffed into the night air as Dee spoke. \u201cThanks for the fried walleye.\u201d</p><p>Outside Dee\u2019s motel door, Jacob leaned against his truck fender. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>He watched Dee clutch the doorknob behind her back. Was she reluctant to say good-night, too?</p><p>They\u2019d shared a room once, but concerns for her health had offered a substantial cold shower. Tonight, especially after that kiss, his resolve was weakening.</p><p>A fleeting image of waking up next to her tormented him. He couldn\u2019t leave fast enough. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob\u2014\u201d Her voice reached to him.</p><p>Glancing back over his shoulder, he asked, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your taking me to the diner and introducing me around. I needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything special.\u201d As a matter of fact, it had felt too comfortable.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not to you. But to me, it was blessedly normal, kind of like...catching snowflakes on your tongue. Magical in its simplicity. Thank you for that gift.\u201d</p><p>Then she smiled. Just smiled, but the happiness spread all the way to her eyes.</p><p>Her beauty blindsided him like a surprise whiteout.</p><p>How could he have ever thought her merely pretty? She radiated something incredible that far surpassed an average word such as \u201cpretty.\u201d</p><p>A lock of hair slid free from her scarf and lifted with the circling winds. Drawn to Dee in spite of his better judgment, he shoved away from the truck and stopped in front of her. The wind at his back, he shielded her.</p><p>Her fingers fluttered upward and landed lightly on his head, dusting snow away. \u201cYou really should remember to wear a hat.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cSure, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Her arm dropped back to her side again. Hurt dimmed her eyes. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He kept forgetting how prickly she could be. He folded the ends of her scarf over each other and resisted the urge to smooth his hands along her shoulders, cup the softness just below her coat. \u201cYou need to sleep. You didn\u2019t rest much last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did you.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t tonight, either, with her scent still clinging to his sheets. Not that it mattered if he washed them. After a day spent together in the truck cab, his senses were saturated with her fragrance.</p><p>Dee traced squiggly patterns in the snow with the toe of her tennis shoe. \u201cI enjoyed meeting your friends today. You must be itching to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>Work which would take him away from here\u2014and her.</p><p>A wry grin tugged one side of his face. \u201cYeah, I have to admit, I miss it, the flying and the camaraderie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after getting shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d</p><p>The day spread out through his mind, the surprise of it all coming during a low-key mission. \u201cMy C-17 was transporting a political contingent across Europe for goodwill visits to a number of countries over the Christmas holidays. On the last stop in Bavaria, some radical crook with an agenda tried to assassinate the\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSenator from South Carolina\u2014Ginger Landis.\u201d Dee blinked fast, her eyes widening with surprise. \u201cI remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly. \u201cI remember seeing the report on TV\u2014\u201d she snapped her fingers \u201c\u2014a wide-screen television...\u201d Her cheeks puffed, her excitement dimming. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it. The memory of where I was then...It\u2019s gone.\u201d She shook her head, her gaze focused on him again. \u201cBut ohmigod, you were shot. I do remember from the news report that you got some kind of medal for saving an old lady at the ceremony.\u201d</p> <p>Saving the world while his sister needed him more. \u201cI just happened to be in the seat next to someone who needed help. The rest was instinct, not some great heroic decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right, whatever.\u201d She cocked her head to the side. \u201cHow amazing it must feel to make such a big difference in people\u2019s lives. No wonder you\u2019re itching to get back.\u201d She studied her chewed-down fingernails. \u201cOnly a couple more weeks until you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not out the door yet. I need to settle Emily, or convince her to come with me to Charleston until I get a transfer to Tacoma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just assumed she would be going with you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to leave, not even to live in Tacoma.\u201d His sister was too enamored with Chase to go even an hour away.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she a senior? Graduation is only about four months away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a junior, Chase is a senior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t want to lose any time with him.\u201d His jaw flexed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been around enough to get a read off of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re an adult, living your life.\u201d She grazed her fingers just above his gunshot wound. \u201cPutting yourself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had some lucky breaks as a teenager. Thanks to joining the local Civil Air Patrol I made connections, found direction in the training and flying along for rescue missions. I got out of here. I need to pay back that debt.\u201d</p> <p>Her face softened with understanding. \u201cYou don\u2019t like owing anyone anything, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Debts gave over power to someone else and he needed to be in control. \u201cI had hoped Emily would find the same. She was a member of Civil Air Patrol, too, along with Chase. Then she got pregnant and dropped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your sister, your father, too.\u201d Her puffy breaths met his, entwined and swirled between them, brushing the air with their combined heat. Memories of Dee\u2019s mouth on his pulsed through his mind, then lower.</p><p>Control would slip away completely if he didn\u2019t haul butt away from her. Now. He\u2019d made it halfway to his truck before her voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cJacob,\u201d she called out. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten that kiss. Something like that is kind of tough to forget, and believe me, I\u2019m an expert at forgetting.\u201d</p><p>He paused. Snow gathered on his shoulders, he stood still for so long before looking back.</p><p>She stuffed her mittened hands in her pockets. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to throw myself at you a second time. I just want to talk. I\u2014\u201d she hesitated, before gasping in a deep breath \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t want to be alone. All that\u2019s waiting for me inside that room is a cold bed and a clean tub. Jacob, my heart hurts when I think of my own child. My arms feel so empty for a baby I can\u2019t even remember.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s jaw quivered. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m a mass murderer? Or a bank robber on the run.\u201d Her voice deflated to a whisper. \u201cOr a married woman.\u201d</p> <p>Her words pierced through him as cleanly as the bullet he\u2019d taken in his arm. A person who lived by definitive lines of right and wrong, he knew he couldn\u2019t have her until he\u2019d ruled out the possibility of a husband. Damn it, where was the man, and why wasn\u2019t he tearing up the world searching for Dee?</p><p>With one finger, he traced a slow, deliberate path over her jaw. This woman could make a man forget how to breathe.</p><p>His fingers splayed across her cheek.</p><p>More than a little regret pulsing through him, he let his hands fall to rest on her shoulders and turned her toward her door. \u201cGo to sleep, Dee.\u201d</p><p>It was for the best. Her life was complicated enough. She needed his help. She definitely didn\u2019t need to plunge into some relationship with a guy who would only be around for two weeks.</p><p>She might have been better off cutting her losses and staying in Tacoma after all.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>D ee shoved the lost-and-found box to the back of the closet. Over the past week, the container had filled. Rapidly. Jacob had the most absentminded patrons on the planet. And they all wore a size seven.</p><p>She\u2019d been pleased to discover the first pair of jeans and a flannel shirt, yellow with flowers that made her smile as she rubbed the baby-soft fabric against her cheek. How lucky could she get?</p><p>Much luckier.</p><p>The next day, she\u2019d unearthed Gore-Tex gloves, then snow boots and a hat, followed by another pair of jeans and a cashmere sweater\u2014with a tag from the Gap still attached under the arm.</p><p>If she got any \u201cluckier,\u201d she\u2019d be Irish.</p><p>Dee fingered the cuff of her pink sweater. He really needed to stop with the gifts before her IOU pad overflowed. She was tempted to sit on her pride awhile longer and see how far Jacob would carry the magical lost-and-found game. Aside from the fact she desperately needed the clothes, the tokens had also carried her through a week of disappointments as they uncovered nothing earth-shattering about her identity.</p><p>Thanks to Jacob\u2019s quizzing, she\u2019d had small breakthroughs. She and Jacob often sat in front of the lobby fireplace eating popcorn and flipping through magazines to see if any of the pictures prompted a memory. Flashes taunted her, but offered her nothing concrete.</p><p>The smell of roses on a corsage pinned to a prom dress.</p><p>The wind on her face during a childhood bicycle ride with a friend.</p><p>The sound of planes roaring overhead...At a base? During an air show?</p><p>Regardless, she couldn\u2019t help but notice how often her impressions included something to do with the military lately. Could she be blending her present with Jacob into her past? Or were the memories real? She honestly didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Sometimes she wondered if she might be fighting herself because the present seemed so appealing. And handsome. And hot. Dee smoothed her hands along the fuzzy softness of her new sweater.</p><p>Still, the time had come to put a stop to Jacob\u2019s charity.</p><p>This didn\u2019t seem the best time to approach him, though, with so many people around. Were his friends always so social on the weekends?</p><p>His military pals from the diner had apparently spread the word about her because a half dozen had come to check her out. She couldn\u2019t keep the names straight, especially when they rarely went by a real name, instead using their call signs such as Picasso and Tag. Crusty and Bronco had both brought their wives and kids\u2014she\u2019d been happy to see Kathleen again.</p><p>Jacob had a wide circle of friends and support. She envied him that, even as he wrestled with arranging his life. Her gaze shifted to Emily, who was on the sofa, writing in her journal while the baby slept in her swing.</p><p>For once, it wasn\u2019t snowing. The sky stretched across a mountainous forever, interrupted only by the occasional airplane from the base rumbling past. Dee rubbed her hands over the goose bumps raising along her skin.</p><p>Restlessly, she closed the closet door and parked herself behind the computer. She\u2019d found doing random Google searches sometimes sparked a memory.</p><p>Emily shifted on the sofa, Naugahyde crackling. \u201cGuys are kinda dense, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Dee swallowed a laugh. \u201cWhat brought that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d Dee nodded toward the window.</p><p>Outside, Chase helped Jacob salt down sidewalks\u2014when the teen wasn\u2019t lobbing snowballs at random targets.</p><p>\u201cWell, Chase comes to pick me up last night, and he\u2019s so clueless. He doesn\u2019t even walk to the door. He just honks the horn. I don\u2019t expect him to, like, open doors and pull out chairs and all that stuff, but he could at least ring the bell, don\u2019tcha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the polite thing to do.\u201d Dee swept aside Emily\u2019s feet and sat beside her. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met his mom?\u201d Emily shot a glare out the window and mumbled, \u201cOr maybe he doesn\u2019t want to mess with having a kid.\u201d</p><p>The baby swing clicked softly.</p><p>Life hadn\u2019t played fair with the girl, either, Dee thought.</p><p>Emily locked her journal and pitched it to the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal really. I\u2019ll just freeze Chase out for a little while longer until he gets the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could tell him.\u201d She couldn\u2019t squelch the longing to dispense maternal wisdom about boys and dating.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Emily hitched her knees up to her chest and tugged her baggy T-shirt over them. Her face turned moony-eyed with adolescent longing as she stared at Chase.</p><p>Was she much better, Dee wondered, watching Jacob, starving for a glimpse of him? He hadn\u2019t made a move on her all week. That should have been good, except it gave her too much time to get to know him, really know him across the dinner table.</p><p>She liked what she\u2019d found\u2014too much.</p><p>Even if she wasn\u2019t a married woman, she couldn\u2019t afford distractions, not now. And Jacob was a great big, hunkish distraction. \u201cDo you have plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three of us are gonna drive into Tacoma for a movie to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day\u2014if I decide to forgive him.\u201d</p><p>Valentine\u2019s Day? She hadn\u2019t even thought to make note of the date; now she couldn\u2019t think of anything other than the holiday reserved for lovers.</p><p>Emily cast another baleful look at the window. Chase grabbed the shovel at his feet. Jacob launched snowballs baseball-style for the boy to smack.</p><p>Could Jacob really be as wonderful as he seemed? Okay, occasionally moody, but wonderful all the same.</p><p>Had the father of her child been this great? Did he drive her to distraction with just a look?</p><p>Valentine\u2019s Day really stunk when a person\u2019s love life sucked.</p><p>Emily\u2019s fingers walked along the sofa back to pick at a crack in the upholstery. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Dee shook herself free of the self-pity. The kid didn\u2019t need any more worries than she already had. \u201cOf course. Just feeling lazy today, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Emily picked at Dee\u2019s cuff. \u201cNice sweater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Dee acted on a hunch and continued, \u201cMy favorite color. You really did a great job matching up my size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I figured you were\u2014Hey!\u201d</p><p>Dee leaned back, her eyes narrowing. \u201cHe sent you shopping, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man.\u201d Emily slouched into her clothes. \u201cJacob\u2019s gonna kill me for spilling the secret. How did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t envision him wandering through racks at the Gap.\u201d A laugh slid past Dee\u2019s lips, followed by Emily\u2019s giggle. \u201cThank you. But no more charity for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s nothing like shopping on someone else\u2019s dime, and you really needed the clothes.\u201d Her brows pulled together. \u201cYou like everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, of course I do\u2014How much more is there?\u201d</p><p>A wicked grin crept up the girl\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Besides, how could I turn him down? He watched Madison and sprung for a supper for Chase and me.\u201d</p><p>Frustration chugged through Dee. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think of what all of this cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit worrying. He\u2019s got a steady job and savior complex. It\u2019s best to just let him have his way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee could sense more coming and held her silence while the teen pulled her thoughts together. Her computer search could wait. The baby swing clicked away in the silence.</p><p>Emily finally sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to take my own advice and just go live with Jacob.\u201d She glanced at Madison. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a lot of choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie. I wish I had an answer for you.\u201d Dee tugged on the hem of her latest charity gift.</p> <p>Jacob took care of everyone, shoveling driveways, pulling cars out of ditches, even helping finance teenage dates. Three days of cleaning with Grace had clued Dee in that Jacob wasn\u2019t paying for much. The woman had cataracts for crying out loud. She couldn\u2019t see dust until it flew up her nose.</p><p>Emily pegged it, all right. Jacob suffered from a major case of protector syndrome.</p><p>Which meant she wasn\u2019t anyone special to him, just another stray wandering into his life. She couldn\u2019t shrug free of the feeling she wanted to be more.</p><p>Problem was, Jacob deserved to have someone who could take care of him, as well. He deserved an equal, not another charity case.</p><p>Why did that Jacob Stone have to screw up everything? The man was too damn possessive of her, a female who wanted to haul butt with her child.</p> <p>His kid.</p><p>The Suburban cranked to life. He\u2019d planned everything to a tee, how to shake free of her while keeping his kid close, but now Stone was helping her. Before long, she would be able to stand on her own and that would threaten all of his plans. He needed more time, something that bastard could ruin.</p><p>He backed the SUV out of the parking space before pulling onto the highway. Once he cruised to sixty miles per hour, he slid in a CD, cranking the volume so the kid in back would settle down. Shouldn\u2019t take too long since he\u2019d already figured out the tyke\u2019s favorites.</p><p>He would have to wait until his child fell asleep tonight before making a move to regain control. But without question, something needed to happen soon to shake things up.</p><p>And what was the best way to get back at a man who didn\u2019t scare easily? Hit him where he was vulnerable. Mess with his woman.</p><p>Luckily, he had access to Dee\u2019s room key.</p> <p>Sitting in the back of the Ford pickup and watching the stars, Jacob didn\u2019t hear Dee\u2019s footsteps until she tossed a blanket into the truck bed. He lowered the beer from his mouth. \u201cGet back inside where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>He winced at his own irritable tone, not that it seemed to deter Dee.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s a balmy forty degrees out here tonight. And no wind chill. The snow\u2019s even melting. I barely need a coat.\u201d She hooked her knee on the tailgate and hefted herself up. \u201cMind some company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d had a crap day.</p><p>His time with Chase hadn\u2019t netted any great reassurance either way. The guy vowed he loved Emily, but acted like more of a playmate with Madison.</p><p>Then he\u2019d realized Emily had screwed up the cash drawer again, coming out short.</p><p>And to top it off, Dee looked too damn hot in the new clothes. Helping her was playing hell with his libido. The pink sweater had hugged her br**sts all day long.</p><p>Just staring at her coat, he wanted to slip his hands beneath and find the soft cashmere\u2014the even softer woman. \u201cDee, go back inside.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring him, she closed the last two feet between them, working her way over the slick patches of metal. Parking lot lights hummed in the silence as she stood, unmoving, hands stuffed in her coat pockets.</p><p>Somehow he couldn\u2019t scavenge the words to make her leave. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re cranky.\u201d Without giving him time for a comeback, she jabbed her thumb upward. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up. I want to spread out the blanket to sit on.\u201d</p><p>He eased to his feet. Why did she have to invade his space, showing up all hot and smelling good when he just wanted to drink his beer and watch the Northern Lights in peace? \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have the best seat in the house.\u201d</p><p>Best seat? She couldn\u2019t mean the double entendre the way he would have in referring to her. Still, a grin teased at his face.</p><p>Her startled gaze flew to his, down to his backside and up again. A flush crawled up her cheeks that threatened to raise the temperature five degrees. \u201cI, uh, your seat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest place to view the Northern Lights, I meant,\u201d Dee said in a prim, schoolmarm tone. She whipped the blanket out and plopped down. \u201cCome on. Sit.\u201d</p><p>He recognized a determined woman when he saw one. Arguing would get him nothing but fired up and frustrated\u2014more frustrated. And he didn\u2019t really want her to go.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She flung a wad of something into his lap before dragging a corner of the blanket over her shoulder.</p><p>Jacob uncurled one hand from his bottle and picked up...a hat. He set his beer to the side and turned to Dee. \u201cYou have a thing about hats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, put it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy.\u201d A half smile touched his lips, if not his mood. He reached for Dee\u2019s scarf. Did she know she swayed toward him anytime he brushed near her? Like now. Slowly, he unwrapped the length from around her ears. Dee listed forward. It would be so easy to cover her mouth with his and lose himself in her softness.</p><p>He tugged the stocking cap over her head. \u201cHat\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>Taking more time than he needed, he pulled her hair free from the back, brushed stray strands away from her face. He ached to pitch aside his gloves and warm her skin with his.</p><p>The puffs of air coming from her mouth grew faster, heavier. \u201cI meant for you to put it on yourself.\u201d</p><p>His smile hitched higher. \u201cTo quote Emily, \u2018Duh.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He flipped the collar of his coat up and retrieved his bottle. One long swallow later, he relaxed against the cab of his truck. He wasn\u2019t drunk, even though he wanted to be, just buzzed enough to forget why he needed to send Dee back inside. So he let her stay.</p><p>How tempting could she be, swaddled in a wool coat with an oversize knit cap on her head? Too tempting after his having spent the day battling his hunger for her. He\u2019d all but gawked through the window at her like some drooling adolescent.</p><p>Damn, she was cute.</p><p>Jacob tipped the bottle back again.</p><p>She pointed into the distance toward the lights striping the sky over the Cascade Range. \u201cThat\u2019s Mount Rainier, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, except around here we call it \u2018The Mountain.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She chewed her top lip. \u201cThat could be a sign, then, that I\u2019m not from this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. Nice catch on your part. The way you\u2019re putting pieces together, it\u2019s only a matter of time until you have your memory back.\u201d He wanted that for her, even as he wondered how it would affect whatever the hell was drawing them to each other.</p><p>\u201cI remembered something. I think my Internet cruising may be working at sparking memories.\u201d</p><p>The beer turned flat on his tongue. He should be happy for her, and all he could think was, Now she\u2019ll leave sooner.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Tell me about it,\u201d he prompted as he\u2019d done often during their memory-jogging sessions. Except now her voice held an edge that told him this one was about more than a simple prom dress.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much really. Just a snippet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her legs and canted forward. \u201cI was looking up stuff on Valentine\u2019s Day and I came across an article about Valentine\u2019s Day getaways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValentine\u2019s Day? Oh, hell, that\u2019s today isn\u2019t it? The holiday for women.\u201d</p><p>She elbowed him. \u201cFor guys, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d He grinned, then remembered...\u201cTell me about your memory.\u201d A memory sparked by Cupid would likely be about some other guy. He wished he\u2019d brought a six-pack of beer out with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m swimming in an indoor pool, and there are mountains showing through the glass wall, like it\u2019s a resort area.\u201d</p><p>He so didn\u2019t want to hear about her romantic getaway with a Mr. Smith. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wade back toward the stairs, and I\u2019m calling out to someone about not forgetting the baby\u2019s water wings.\u201d</p><p>Hell. He\u2019d been a selfish ass thinking of his own needs when it came to her memory. He\u2019d all but forgotten she had a child in the picture.</p><p>She glanced at him, her eyes unblinking. \u201cYou know, water wings, those little inflatable things that go around children\u2019s arms when they\u2019re swimming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Over Dee\u2019s shoulder, hazy lights streaked across the sky, as magnificent as ever, but he focused on her.</p><p>\u201cThen I hold out my hands for my baby, and man, I\u2019m happy.\u201d She tipped her face up, a Madonna glow shimmering from her like the nimbus glow overhead. \u201cI can already feel the weight of that chubby little body settling against my breasts. I can smell baby shampoo and powder. And I reach just a little more...into empty air.\u201d</p><p>Strain pulled lines into the corners of her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder if it might be better remembering nothing. These hints are...torture. I don\u2019t even know for sure if the child I\u2019m remembering is mine. Maybe I was helping a friend or even some stranger as I longed for a kid I don\u2019t have anymore.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the pain in her eyes made him want to gather her in his arms and take life\u2019s blows for her. Jacob lifted his bottle. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said through a watery chuckle. \u201cI think I do.\u201d</p><p>Dee gripped the neck with her thumb and three fingers, pinky extended, and sipped.</p><p>She grimaced.</p><p>He allowed himself a rusty chuckle. \u201cGuess we can surmise you\u2019re not much of a beer drinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a nice bottle of Merlot on hand would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>The curve of her grin enticed him to forget with an intoxication that beat anything waiting for him in a bottle.</p><p>Northern Lights continued to shoot their paths, silver and pink fingers of light surging across the sky. He had a beautiful woman beside him on Valentine\u2019s Day. It was the perfect setting for seduction\u2014any other night.</p><p>Dee scratched a fingernail along the beer label. \u201cSometimes I wonder if I\u2019m making these memories up, creating a past that I want to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cNo. But it\u2019s easier to accept than thinking about a child going to bed without his or her mother.\u201d Her fists clenched. \u201cDamn it, Jacob, why isn\u2019t anyone looking for me?\u201d</p><p>The frustration in her voice slayed him\u2014and justified his near-savage need to touch her. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell to rest against his chest. \u201cYou would never do it, let someone you care about fade away.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d done just that with his sister.</p><p>Jacob shoved the thought aside for the moment and focused on Dee.</p><p>She relaxed against him. \u201cWhen I have these flashes, I know how I felt. Even when I can\u2019t see everything, the emotions are so clear.\u201d She tilted her face up to his. \u201cI love this child, so it must not be a stranger after all. How can I feel so much for a person I wouldn\u2019t even recognize on the street? Is that crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d The warmth of her seared his side, firing a need to pull her closer. But first he had to know. \u201cWhat about when you\u2019re asking for the water-wings? How do you feel about the person you\u2019re talking to? What do you hear in response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAirplanes,\u201d she blurted, then looked down at the beer bottle between them, still cradled in her hand. \u201cSilly, and not at all helpful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abruptly she tipped back the bottle for a long gulp at odds with her pinky waving defiantly in the night. She swiped her wrist across her mouth and passed the beer back to him. \u201cHere, take it before I finish it all.\u201d</p><p>Their fingers brushed as he reclaimed his drink. He wanted her, wanted to lose himself in her softness, her innocence.</p><p>With a last, token effort at distancing himself from Dee, Jacob emptied his longneck with a final swallow. Damn, but he could taste her on the glass. And damned again if he didn\u2019t intend to indulge in a fuller sampling of undiluted Dee.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>D ee watched Jacob lower the bottle, his lips still damp from the beer they\u2019d shared. She couldn\u2019t look away from his mouth, couldn\u2019t stop wanting to kiss him again. But she wouldn\u2019t be the one to make the first move, not this time. Parking lot lights shimmered with a muted glow while she waited, thirsty for the taste of Jacob.</p><p>Reaching past her, he set aside the longneck. His arm brushed hers, the heat of his chest warming her until her br**sts tightened in response beneath her coat. His eyes stilled her and embraced her with a stormy blue desire, an ache mirrored inside her.</p><p>She could see he needed her, maybe for all the wrong reasons, just as she\u2019d needed him after the doctor visit. Suddenly what should be wrong felt incredibly right.</p><p>She swayed forward.</p> <p>\u201cAh, Dee.\u201d He groaned her name, low and husky, more beautiful coming from his mouth than a simple syllable should have any right to be.</p><p>His hand shot up to cup the back of her head, tuck under the hat and flick it free. Her hair swirled around her as his fingers combed sensuous paths along her scalp.</p><p>Endless seconds later, Jacob\u2019s mouth skimmed hers. Relief swelled through her as she nestled where she\u2019d burned to be all day, all week, for as long as she could remember. He claimed her mouth. Claimed, and demanded she do the same in return. He tugged on her bottom lip, enticed until she opened to accept him.</p><p>Dee decided she\u2019d acquired a taste for beer after all, or maybe it was the way the rich ferment tasted on Jacob\u2019s tongue. The warm tang of it induced a heady rush. Surely the buzzing along her every nerve was a by-product of alcohol.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Locking her arms around Jacob\u2019s neck, she explored the breadth of his shoulders as his restless hands slipped beneath her coat to her back, down her waist. God he was big, yet no longer intimidating as she\u2019d feared the first time her eyes traveled up the length of him. She\u2019d learned he used his size for protection rather than intimidation.</p> <p>Dee snuggled closer, couldn\u2019t get close enough. Without breaking their kiss, Jacob lowered her to the quilt and blanketed her with his body as their legs tangled. Dee danced her tongue against his, learning the taste of Jacob, which only served to send her into another dizzying spiral of pure sensation.</p><p>They rolled until she landed on top, and she found she liked it there. Jacob shifted to take her weight fully upon him. She liked that even more, Jacob allowing her some control for a change, even in such a fundamental way.</p><p>A clatter rumbled along the truck bed. Dee tried to block out what she didn\u2019t want to hear. The beer bottle clanked, spinning until it shattered against the icy parking lot.</p><p>\u201cJacob\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean it up later.\u201d He nuzzled her neck again, but the moment had been broken, as well.</p><p>Realization chilled Dee more than the frost in the air. What was she doing? Not five minutes ago she\u2019d been sharing memories of the family she\u2019d most likely left behind, and now she was crawling all over Jacob like some sex-starved teenager because of Valentine\u2019s Day sentimentality.</p><p>Dee pushed herself up beside him. Jacob blinked twice before flinging his arm over his face.</p><p>His arm fell away. \u201cI\u2019m s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d She hugged her knees to her chest in counterpressure against an ache with Jacob\u2019s name tattooed all over it. \u201cI\u2019m the one who should apologize.\u201d</p><p>Jacob jackknifed up as he raked his hands through his hair. It wasn\u2019t long hair, but she\u2019d managed to make a fine mess of it all the same, just like she\u2019d done with her life. And might do with his if she wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with me, Jacob? I told myself it didn\u2019t matter what had happened before, only what I do now, but I can\u2019t even keep my hands off you for a week. I barely know anything about you, like your favorite ice cream or why your friends call you Mako.\u201d She squeezed her knees harder, pushing all the air free until she could only whisper, \u201cWhat kind of a woman am I?\u201d</p><p>He grasped her chin, his grip a fraction past gentle. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell was going on in your life before you came here, either. But regardless of how long we\u2019ve spent together, I do know who you are, the person that\u2019s real, underneath any layer of memories.\u201d His touch gentled to a caress. \u201cThere\u2019s an innocence and goodness in you that\u2019s rare, special. Don\u2019t doubt it for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe him, yearned to grasp his words with both hands and accept them simply because Jacob said so. But that kind of blind faith, a dependency, also raked over an innately pragmatic part of her.</p><p>She had to prove to herself she wasn\u2019t simply a \u201cMrs. Smith\u201d who drooled over any man. \u201cThen why do I want to lie back on that blanket and finish this?\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s jaw flexed.</p><p>Dee\u2019s shivered in response. \u201cNot smart, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His hand shook as he hooked her hair behind her ear. A lone trailer of the Northern Lights shimmered across the sky. \u201cI think you should go inside now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d She scrambled toward the tailgate.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. Heaven help her if he called her back. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cButter pecan ice cream. And Mako started out as Maaco, like the auto repair company, because I can fix any engine on any vehicle. Later the spelling tweaked to Mako, as in the shark, because it sounds cool.\u201d He tipped back his head, eyes tipped toward the stars, conversation over.</p><p>His words settled into her memory along with his assertion that he knew her very well, regardless of time. She wanted...She didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>A final look at Jacob confirmed he\u2019d withdrawn from her. How remote he seemed, with those shadows muting the vibrancy of his beautiful eyes like the aurora lighting the sky then slipping away leaving the world feeling colder and darker than before.</p><p>In spite of all her intentions to be his friend while she pieced her life together, she\u2019d done it again. She\u2019d thrown herself at him. It didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d made the first move tonight. She hadn\u2019t thought to push him away for a long time.</p><p>Still wished she hadn\u2019t pushed him away at all.</p><p>Dee scrambled out of the truck and raced as fast as she dared through the sludge back toward the warm safety and stark isolation of her hotel room.</p><p>Dee sank deeper into the soothing bubble bath, then jolted as she realized the water had cooled. How long had she been in here since tearing off her clothes to soak after the frustrating encounter with Jacob in his truck?</p><p>She swiped at the remaining few frothy patches of soap. She must have drifted off. Too bad she couldn\u2019t wake up and find this whole time had been some freaky nightmare.</p><p>Except she wouldn\u2019t want to wish away Jacob.</p><p>How many of her feelings for him were tied up in dependence? Or some sort of weird crush because he\u2019d saved her? She wanted to think she was above such shallowness, but she didn\u2019t really know that much about herself.</p><p>She did, however, know everything about Jacob so far spoke of honor and goodness. Her attraction to him was based on more than the way he filled out his blue jeans.</p><p>Laughing, she blew bubbles from the back of her hand. Laughter echoed in the small bathroom, bouncing off the tile and back around her until silence fell again.</p><p>Nothing but drip, drip, drip from the faucet.</p><p>An eerie sensation slid over her, chilling her faster than the cooling water. She tried to get a grip. Of course it was quiet. She was alone in her room, but she\u2019d locked the door.</p><p>Had she put on the chain and the dead bolt?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember. How could she have grown so complacent in such a short time? She shouldn\u2019t count on others for her safety. No matter how much help Jacob and his friends offered, they had only known her a short while. How important could she really be to them so fast? She wanted to start relying on herself, to grow stronger to face whatever life she\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>Carefully, she rose from the tub and reached for a towel to wrap around herself. Not much for armor, but she was only confronting ghostly fears, nothing real except her paranoia.</p><p>A bracing breath later, she twisted the doorknob and stepped into the room to\u2014</p><p>Nobody. The motel room was empty but for the two neatly made-up beds and a chair with her hand-me-down blue robe on the armrest. She sagged back against the sink in the dressing area with relief.</p><p>Turning, she reached for her comb and blinked.</p><p>Streaks of bloodred lipstick glared back at her from the mirror. All capital letters. One word.</p><p>DEAD.</p><p>Jacob tipped back the chair behind the check-in desk and thought about his dead father, really thought about the old man for the first time. He\u2019d done a good job of ignoring the man\u2019s presence stamped all over the place, but then Dee had asked about the \u201cMako\u201d call sign, which led to thoughts of learning everything he could about engines in hopes of earning his father\u2019s approval.</p><p>Clyde Stone was gone. Really gone. For so many years, Jacob had worked to gain his dad\u2019s attention, then worked harder to ignore the selfish bastard\u2019s existence.</p><p>Now he was dead and Jacob couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Because of Dee. Because he realized having a past, even a crummy one, was better than none at all.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t had much of a father/son relationship, yet the man had been a towering presence. His father put on such a good face, all smiles and laughter\u2014as long as no demands were placed on him. No wonder Clyde had never gone out of his way to make this business a success. He hadn\u2019t wanted the commitment.</p><p>The last thought stopped him cold.</p><p>Had he picked up that very trait from his old man? Sure, thirty-two wasn\u2019t old to be a bachelor. However, he couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that he usually bailed from any relationship once it grew serious.</p><p>He tipped back his beer and stared through the window at the old truck Emily drove. The vehicle should have long ago been sent to the junkyard. No question it would die soon now that their father wasn\u2019t around to milk more life out of it. They\u2019d spent a lot of hours tinkering with that engine when Jacob had been a teen.</p><p>Those silent moments seeped into his brain\u2014</p><p>A muffled noise jerked him back into the moment, the sound of a door opening outside, crashing against the wall.</p><p>Jacob vaulted to his feet and crossed to the wide window, peering farther down the parking lot. Holy crap. Dee bolted out to the walkway wearing just a robe and untied tennis shoes. Her wet hair rode the wind behind her as she raced toward the office.</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>He threw open the door and caught her as she slipped on the steps. \u201cDee? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Had she suddenly remembered? She definitely looked stunned.</p><p>\u201cSomeone br-broke into my r-room.\u201d Her teeth chattered, with cold or fear or both.</p><p>He could certainly understand because right now he felt chilled to the bone. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>While hauling her into the office, he searched the parking lot for signs of an intruder. He saw plenty of tire ruts and recalled hearing minimal traffic while he\u2019d sat in his truck, but nothing now.</p><p>And hell, he needed to get to Emily and the baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m f-fine. Whoever it was left before I got out of the tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Good.\u201d He pointed to a connecting door. \u201cGo through there, stay with Emily and call the police while I check outside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gripped his arm. \u201cBe careful. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he responded automatically, already focused on the parking lot and looking for whoever had dared threaten Dee.</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>N o one was looking for her. Dee had to accept it.</p><p>She spread her arms to pull the towel taut before folding it. Grace silently folded a second pile while the dryer tumbled a fresh load in the motel laundry room.</p><p>Three days had passed since someone had broken in and written DEAD on her mirror. Not that Jacob had been able to find anyone. Not that the cops had uncovered anything further.</p><p>Other than noting the lipstick tube had been completely wiped clean of prints.</p><p>She\u2019d told them the lipstick hadn\u2019t been there before, but she could tell they thought she\u2019d absentmindedly forgotten. She disagreed then and now. She might not know some things about herself, but she knew for darn sure she hadn\u2019t left out a lipstick tube since she\u2019d taken a careful inventory of her meager possessions after waking up with nothing but a hundred dollars and an EpiPen. She didn\u2019t have a stitch of makeup to her name.</p> <p>Dee reminded herself to be grateful for what she did have. People seemed to accept her in spite of the amnesia.</p><p>At least there were people here who cared enough to notice if she fell off the face of the earth again. Grace, Emily...and Jacob.</p><p>Dee clutched the towel to her belly in counterpressure against the ache that had only increased since their kiss in the truck. An ache she couldn\u2019t fill. Soon, he would be returning to his Charleston base.</p><p>Since she\u2019d landed in Rockfish, the police hadn\u2019t unearthed so much as a nibble on her identity, much less help in finding a child she wasn\u2019t sure she still had. Even a long-shot attempt at hypnosis had been a bust. She and Jacob had garnered more success unearthing memories through simple brainstorming conversations. At times, she felt a change in herself, as if her mind were pregnant with memories, ready to give birth to them. And then nothing...</p><p>Her few memories of her child were real, of that she had no doubt. As days passed, she had to explore the possibility that she\u2019d given up her baby, or that, heaven forbid, it had died. Had she lost her child and a husband, and that was why she had no one left to notice her absence? Reluctantly, her mind traveled that painful path.</p><p>Perhaps in her grief she had lost herself in shallow encounters with men like Mr. Smith. Certainly such all-encompassing pain could make a person want to forget. The scenario, while excruciating, made sense.</p> <p>Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t she be needed enough for someone to look for her? How devastating to think her life mattered so little that she could disappear.</p><p>She had to find answers. The lack of control threatened to drive her crazy. All she could do was continue to try, pester the police and save money for a private investigator.</p><p>Meanwhile, how could she be true to an unknown past while taking a chance on the future before Jacob left?</p><p>Standing outside the lobby closet, Jacob stuffed his military-issue snow parka into his gear bag. As always, the prospect of helping with a Civil Air Patrol search and rescue mission charged him, reminding him of his Air Force job waiting for him.</p><p>Only four days remained before he had to return to Charleston and he still hadn\u2019t settled anything with Emily. His sister was going to have to accept the fact that she had to go with him. Starting tomorrow, they would have to get her school records, begin packing, hire someone to manage the motel...</p><p>Jacob glanced at Dee as she typed on the computer at the registration desk. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Chase any longer. If he shows, let him know I\u2019ve left to hook up with Bronco and Tag. He can meet us at McChord. He\u2019ll have at least a half-hour window before the ground team heads out to start sweeping the area for the missing plane.\u201d</p><p>Dee spun in the chair to face him, her hair swinging to drape around her shoulders. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll pass along the message.\u201d</p><p>Tearing himself away from the power of Dee\u2019s honey-brown eyes, Jacob stuffed a box of packaged MREs\u2014meals ready to eat\u2014on top of his winter gear. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay here alone? I could be gone all night.\u201d</p> <p>With two incidents of missing money from the drawer still unsolved, he worried about leaving her alone, unprotected. The cops hadn\u2019t learned anything more about the intruder. He\u2019d added extra security lights with motion sensors outside. He\u2019d also given Dee a cell phone to carry with her at all times\u2014in spite of her protests of \u201cno charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She stood and perched her hip against the counter, a shapely hip cupped by well-washed denim. \u201cI can handle the phone lines for a few hours without you or Emily for backup.\u201d</p><p>His hands itched. They begged him to fit both palms along those h*ps and pull her toward him. She\u2019d started a thaw inside him that night in the back of the pickup. Her daily presence and that face-life-head-on attitude had ended his solitary days. A primal male part of him urged Jacob to pursue her, consequences be damned, before some other man came back to claim her.</p><p>What would he do then? It wasn\u2019t as if he was any good at long-term. While he might not know much about Dee Smith, any fool could see she was the minivan-and-cookies type. His future mapped out more along the lines of wandering the world\u2014anywhere but Rockfish with all its memories. Even moving to Tacoma shouted at revisiting the place he\u2019d worked so damn hard to leave.</p><p>But she sure did look good in those jeans, and at his dinner table\u2014and in his life. He\u2019d been considering moving back here for Emily anyway, past be damned. Maybe Dee and Grace could run the motel for the few months until he managed the transfer and then...</p><p>\u201cJacob? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He cleared his throat so he could push free a full sentence. \u201cThis counts as overtime, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis counts as doing a favor for a friend.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he zipped the bag to give himself time to think before looking at Dee. \u201cIs that what we are, friends?\u201d</p><p>She fingered the cuff of her yellow flowered shirt, the flannel one he\u2019d sent Emily to buy on her first shopping trip. The color turned Dee\u2019s skin the prettiest creamy shade, like fine china he wanted to hold but worried he might break.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d She leaned forward across the counter. \u201cLet me do this for you. Please.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d become accustomed to having her around, sometimes finding himself surprised at how many ways she\u2019d sashayed her gently curved body and bossy ways into his motel and into his every thought.</p><p>And his life was better for it.</p><p>A knot held tight in his chest uncoiled, relaxed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay? Really? No overtime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo overtime. And thanks.\u201d Jacob hefted his bag and started toward the door.</p><p>\u201cJacob?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want overtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could take me out to eat.\u201d</p><p>Damn, but she\u2019d thrown him another curve. Curves. Of its own volition, his gaze flowed over her. Curves. He needed to erase that word from his vocabulary.</p><p>How could one woman bring such mayhem and peace at the same time? She scared the hell out of him. Given the look on her face, he suspected she\u2019d just scared the hell out of herself, as well. \u201cJust friends going to the diner?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d hidden out at the diner more than once when the prospect of all those motel beds waiting to be used had overpowered them.</p><p>She shrugged, but didn\u2019t agree. He looked deeper in her eyes and saw exactly what he\u2019d feared\u2014and hoped\u2014to find over the past few days. They were becoming more than friends. He wanted this woman to be more than his friend. He wanted to be her lover.</p><p>How many more empty police reports would it take before he could act on that? His body jolted in response at the mere thought.</p><p>Not five seconds ago he\u2019d told himself he wasn\u2019t right for her\u2014regardless.</p><p>Well, dinner wasn\u2019t a raging affair.</p><p>He could take her to supper. They\u2019d eaten together every night like some old married couple, except without dessert sex.</p><p>Jacob stifled a groan.</p><p>Dee ducked her head and picked at her cuff again. \u201cNever mind. Forget I said it. You don\u2019t owe me for helping out. If anything, I owe you. Watching the desk for a few hours won\u2019t even put a dent in my debt.\u201d</p><p>There were those soulful, hurt eyes again, stabbing right through him. He didn\u2019t stand a chance. \u201cWe could hunt down a restaurant in Tacoma that would serve you a bottle of Merlot.\u201d</p><p>The invitation fell out of Jacob\u2019s mouth before he could give himself time to think. And regret.</p><p>She tipped her chin with that Dee spirit he\u2019d come to admire. She recovered quickly, he\u2019d grant her that.</p><p>Dee pulled free a McChord base newspaper from beside the computer and plopped it on the counter. She pointed to an ad. \u201cOr we could go to the base and have dinner at the NCO Club.\u201d</p><p>Jacob walked toward her, slowly, and traced a finger along the edges of the paper. A paper that had been neatly folded to the page in advance, as if she\u2019d been planning this. Another curve. \u201cYou\u2019d like to go to the NCO Club?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed how often she flinched when the military airplanes flew overhead, how she went quiet whenever friends from the base showed up. Had the man who fathered her child been in the service?</p><p>\u201cI can honestly say I can\u2019t recall ever having been to one before,\u201d she rambled nervously, her cheeks pinkening to match the flowers on her shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sure they have Merlot there. We can save Tacoma for another night.\u201d</p><p>Another night. Another date. But not a date. Surely spending his last few evenings away from the intimacy of the motel would be wise.</p><p>He ignored the niggling sense that he was deluding himself and making a mistake, a big one. They were about to take a step forward that couldn\u2019t be backtracked if the bottom fell out later. \u201cAll right then. Dinner at the base.\u201d</p><p>Dee smiled, another curve of hers he\u2019d come to enjoy viewing.</p><p>Just a simple night away from the Lodge, Jacob reminded himself.</p><p>He backed up a step. \u201cGive Chase\u2019s mom a call if he doesn\u2019t show soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. And, Jacob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>Jacob nodded and bolted out the door, wondering how a tiny scrap of a woman had him on the run when he\u2019d faced down enemy threats twice her size.</p><p>Dee settled in for a slow night. No tour buses were scheduled, and the weather forecast would deter most impulsive travelers. Which left her with all night to think about what she\u2019d asked Jacob.</p><p>Man, she had the munchies.</p><p>The vending machines called to her. At least she could feed one hunger without risking more than a couple of extra pounds. She scrounged in her pockets for loose change. After coming up with nothing but two quarters, she hit pay dirt with a one-dollar bill.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d actually asked Jacob out, not that it qualified as a date, really. Just a friendly evening out. A nice, safe step toward starting a new life for herself. She didn\u2019t plan to give up on the old one, but it could be years before she remembered. Meanwhile, she needed to create a life for herself outside the constant wondering and worrying, or she truly would lose her mind. Then she would be of no use to her child or herself.</p><p>After she\u2019d bought a bag of sour cream and onion chips, Dee fed the dollar into the soda machine. It disappeared...and rolled back out. She flattened the bill and tried again.</p><p>No luck.</p><p>A quick trip to the cash drawer built in under the counter left her with change in hand for another try.</p><p>The red Sold Out light glared on both Coke buttons. Dee sighed. She really wanted a Coke. She could always raid Jacob\u2019s kitchen and pay him back later. Heaven knew he\u2019d extended the offer often enough when she\u2019d helped at the desk before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she snagged a can from his refrigerator, Dee heard the front door to the lobby blast open. She swallowed a sip and hollered, \u201cHold on a minute. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>Dee nudged the refrigerator door shut with her hip. In the lobby, she found Chase hovering behind the counter. \u201cSorry, Chase, but they had to go on without you. Jacob said for you to meet them at the base. If you leave now, you can probably make it before the ground crew heads out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, sure.\u201d He jammed his hands in his pockets, his baggy camouflage pants riding low from the extra pressure.</p> <p>She waited, but he didn\u2019t move. \u201cThey\u2019re only about ten minutes ahead of you. Maybe you can call on the cell phone and ask them to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just skip this one.\u201d</p><p>Dee chewed her lip to keep from dishing out a lesson on following through with responsibilities. \u201cYou could hang out with Emily. I think Madison is already asleep.\u201d</p><p>Chase shuffled from foot to foot. \u201cNah, no need. I\u2019ll just hit the road.\u201d</p><p>Her bottom lip was getting a real workout tonight. Rather than argue with Chase, she decided to phone his mother after he left. \u201cGood night, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d He brushed past, his hip bumping the half-open cash register drawer.</p><p>Dee stared at the drawer, trying to deny what she knew to be true. She\u2019d closed it after making change. She wouldn\u2019t have been so careless as to leave the drawer hanging open.</p><p>Chase couldn\u2019t have possibly...She cast a furtive glance at the teen crossing to the door.</p><p>Instinct told her he most certainly had.</p><p>Popping open the drawer the rest of the way, she looked inside. The slot that should have held a stack of twenties now contained a lone bill, as if someone hadn\u2019t wanted to be so obvious as to empty out the space. \u201cHey, Chase. Hold on a sec.\u201d</p><p>His jerky look back over his shoulder, the defensive glint in his eyes, confirmed her fears. He\u2019d lifted money from the cash register.</p> <p>Jacob would be livid. Hell, she was livid. She couldn\u2019t even bear to consider what this meant for Emily and Madison.</p><p>She reacted with her heart rather than her head, wanting to save Jacob from knowing. \u201cPut the money back, Chase, and we can let this go.\u201d</p><p>With a snap of his head, he flicked a hank of walnut hair from his face. The defensive glint evaporated, a belligerent glare taking its place. \u201cWhat money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, so don\u2019t act like I am. Put it back.\u201d</p><p>Chase sauntered forward. Smugness mushroomed from his every step like an insidious threat. \u201cEven if there was money missing, how\u2019s Jacob gonna know you didn\u2019t take it?\u201d</p><p>He stopped almost toe-to-toe with her. The lobby suddenly seemed small...and deserted. Wind moaned through the eaves while Dee struggled not to flinch. How could she and Jacob both have misjudged this kid?</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t look much like a kid at the moment.</p><p>The phone shrieked through the silence. They both twitched, but Chase didn\u2019t budge.</p> <p>\u201cFine, Chase. We\u2019ll play this your way.\u201d She pivoted away to dismiss him, cowardly, maybe, but she wanted him out of the lobby. Now. She reached for the phone.</p><p>His hand fell on her shoulder. Dee\u2019s stomach lurched as if she\u2019d taken a wrong turn off a mountain curve.</p><p>Show no fear. Regardless of how he looked he was just a kid. Pull out the adult authority, put him in his place and get him out the door.</p><p>Dee plastered her best \u201cschoolmarm frown\u201d in place and shrugged his hand loose. \u201cChase, step back.\u201d</p><p>His bravado slipped. Dee almost sagged with relief\u2014until his eyes narrowed with a male arrogance meant to intimidate, insult.</p><p>The phone stopped ringing.</p><p>Where was the child who\u2019d swung a shovel at snowballs? The boy who\u2019d chased his girlfriend through the snow, the young man who held his baby tenderly?</p><p>Chase ambled forward, forcing her to retreat until the backs of her legs pressed against the computer chair. He smiled, but it wasn\u2019t pleasant or in any way childish. \u201cYou have quite a rep around here thanks to all the gossip. No secrets in this town. People aren\u2019t sure what to think of your whacky amnesia claim. You\u2019re not in any position to be talking trash about me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes journeyed a slow drag down her body and back up again, lingering on strategic places.</p><p>A shiver trickled down Dee\u2019s spine like a melting icicle. Without another word, she pushed past him. Maybe she could lock herself in Jacob\u2019s apartment. Chase\u2019s hand snaked out. He grabbed her shirtfront.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast.\u201d He twisted the fabric, yanking her forward. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>The chill iced all the way through her veins.</p><p>Where do you think you\u2019re going?</p><p>His words echoed in her head, deeper pitched.</p><p>Where do you think you\u2019re going?</p><p>A Midwestern twang sounded, rather than Chase\u2019s local lilt.</p><p>Fear gripped her tighter than Chase\u2019s fist on her shirt. Dee\u2019s feet tangled. The shirt pulled taut. Panic frothed, higher, higher still, until she screamed. Couldn\u2019t stop screaming. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d Chase eyed her warily. His hold on her still unrelenting, he shook her. \u201cDon\u2019t get wigged out or anything. Hey now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u2014not so fast, growled the Midwesterner\u2019s voice, a voice from her past.</p><p>Dee jerked. Buttons popped from her shirt. She backed away, her steps clumsy and haphazard, until she slammed against the soda machine. Her teeth jarred. She slithered to the floor and huddled, teeth chattering.</p><p>In her mind, other buttons popped loose. Coat buttons. She swallowed back the nausea and watched pearl buttons spiral across the tile until they blurred into larger, black buttons from her coat.</p><p>You\u2019re not going anywhere with my kid. I\u2019ll kill him before I let you see him again, Deirdre.</p><p>Pain slashed behind her eyes like a needle piercing her skin. White-hot, then frighteningly cold, like a deep sleep or even death. Through the pain emerged a suffocating gush of memories.</p><p>She remembered her name.</p><p>She remembered her child. Her son.</p><p>Both of which might have been cause for rejoicing. Except nausea choked her as, God help her, she remembered her husband.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>J acob tapped his thumb on the steering wheel, eager to return to the Lodge, to Dee.</p><p>The rescue operation had been canceled fifteen minutes out of Rockfish. The missing plane had simply been diverted because of weather. The pilot hadn\u2019t closed out his flight plan, and the alert had gone up. Of course, ninety percent of all missing aircraft ended in the same sort of scenario, so Jacob wasn\u2019t surprised. Just mildly annoyed at the waste of Civil Air Patrol time.</p><p>And the lost evening with Dee, a chance to explore whatever had started changing between them.</p><p>The urge to see her crept over him. A quick call to the Lodge to find Chase wouldn\u2019t be out of line. Jacob pulled his cell phone from his back pocket and punched in the number. Five rings later, he disconnected. Why wasn\u2019t Dee picking up? Could things be that swamped?</p><p>He stared ahead at the approaching lodge and the lot looked sparse as usual. Jacob slowed, headlights sweeping ahead as he pulled in beside Chase\u2019s vehicle. Emily would be glad for the extra time together. Jacob looked into the lobby, but didn\u2019t see Dee behind the desk.</p><p>Hmm...Odd. He opened the truck door.</p><p>A muffled scream filtered through the Lodge window. Followed by another. Then unending pain-filled cries.</p><p>Dee. Dread coldcocked him just before old instincts rammed into overdrive.</p><p>His boots slammed to the icy pavement at a dead run. He skidded toward the motel office. A couple of doors down, Emily poked her head out of her suite of rooms.</p><p>He vaulted up the steps two at a time, through the door and came chest-to-chest with Chase, who was leaving. \u201cChase? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Jacob didn\u2019t wait for the answer as he sidestepped to find Dee. Her screams dwindled to a low whimper. She sat with her back against the soda machine, her arms locked around her knees, hands fisted so tightly they trembled. Her eyes stared wide and unfocused.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>She fell silent, gasping big hiccuping breaths. Footsteps filled the silence. Chase shuffled his feet. Emily skidded to a halt in the doorway. Jacob motioned silently for her to stay back.</p><p>He approached Dee warily. She\u2019d never looked so fragile, not even when the wind had swept her into the lobby for the first time.</p><p>Why had he ever left her alone? \u201cChase, what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. She just freaked out.\u201d Chase backed toward the door until he bumped into Emily, still waiting on the threshold. Jaw slack, she gawked at Dee.</p><p>Jacob knelt beside her. He wanted to haul her into his arms and reassure himself she hadn\u2019t been hurt. Not the smartest move at the moment.</p><p>Go easy. \u201cDee, honey. Talk. You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>She turned those wide, wounded eyes to him, but didn\u2019t seem to see him. Never once had he seen her lose it, not when she had a truckload of reasons for turning into a basket case. Something bad must have gone down. Suddenly he wasn\u2019t too steady, either.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just breathe.\u201d Jacob stroked her hair, then tucked a knuckle under her chin. His hand bumped her fist\u2014her fist clutching her torn shirt closed. Buttons littered the floor around her.</p><p>An opaque curtain of denial fogged Jacob\u2019s mind. No way. He couldn\u2019t be seeing what he thought. But Chase had been running away from Dee, not toward her.</p><p>Jacob scooped a button from the tile. \u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>The lanky teen glanced from the button, to Dee\u2019s blouse and back to Jacob. Chase\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cUh-uh. Not a chance. It\u2019s not what you think. She flipped out, just the way I said. I tried to keep her from going outside without a coat. That\u2019s how her shirt got ripped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were you running away when I got here?\u201d</p><p>Chase hesitated. \u201cUh, I saw you drive up.\u201d</p><p>Jacob wanted to believe him, but his instincts clamored that Chase wasn\u2019t telling everything\u2014shuffling feet, refusal to make eye contact, all the typical signs of lying. Jacob\u2019s jaw clenched. He didn\u2019t want to wrap his mind around the possibility that Chase had assaulted Dee, or even tried.</p><p>A glance at Dee told him she was still out of it. He needed answers from Chase before he could help her. Jacob pinned Chase with an interrogator\u2019s gaze and continued smoothing a hand along Dee\u2019s hair. \u201cBe straight with me now, or you can talk to the police.\u201d</p><p>Emily gasped, stepping forward. Jacob kept his eyes on Chase but directed his words toward his sister. \u201cEmily, go back to your room and take care of Madison.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her wave the nursery monitor but didn\u2019t advance deeper inside.</p><p>\u201cPolice?\u201d Chase eyed the door hungrily. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to her. She\u2019s just acting or something. Come on, man, you know me. Who\u2019s she, anyway, huh? Just some nutcase claiming she has amnesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Jacob sliced the air with his hand. \u201cLast chance, Chase. The truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The teen fidgeted, gulped, tugged at his sagging pants and gulped again. \u201cI hate to tell you this, but when I got here, I found her taking a stack of money out of your cash drawer.\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s hand stilled. His mind turned white-hot. For all of two seconds. Then reason kicked in. Dee wouldn\u2019t steal from him. He wished he could attribute the surety to trust, but logic had saved him from the test. If cleaning him out had been her plan, she could have done so a hundred times over. She was the type who turned over pocket change found in linens while cleaning.</p><p>But what about Chase? Jacob could see it in the boy\u2019s eyes, and the realization made him sick for Emily. He resumed stroking Dee\u2019s hair while he studied the signs of guilt stamped all over Chase.</p><p>The kid had stolen from him. Jacob swallowed the bilious sting of disappointment. \u201cEmpty your pockets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob?\u201d Emily sidled toward Chase. \u201cYou can\u2019t really think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Chase.\u201d A cool core of certainty congealed in him. \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll apologize. But I\u2019m going to get her side of the story as soon as she calms down.\u201d</p> <p>Chase eyed the door again.</p><p>Emily gripped the arm of Chase\u2019s jacket. \u201cProve him wrong. Please.\u201d</p><p>Chase shrugged free. He jammed his hand into his pocket and whipped out a stack of folded twenty-dollar bills. He didn\u2019t even bother making excuses.</p><p>\u201cNo, Chase.\u201d Emily\u2019s chin quivered as the nursery monitor hummed in her hand.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Chase slammed the wad of cash on the counter. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk out of here with it, so there\u2019s not a damned thing you can do to me.\u201d</p> <p>Jacob stared at the money and focused on the feel of Dee\u2019s hair beneath his hand. When would the anger hit him? Logic told him that\u2019s how he should feel. Instead he\u2019d gone numb. Probably for the best, since he had to take care of the mess with Chase and deal with Dee. \u201cSit down, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Jacob snapped.</p><p>Chase dropped onto the sofa. What had Emily seen in this guy? An escape from Clyde? Or more likely choosing Chase because he was surely the sort who would tweak the old man\u2019s nose at every turn.</p><p>Jacob relaxed his jaw, lowered his tensed shoulders and regained control. He needed to distance himself from everything, all of them. Emotions clouded judgment.</p><p>He turned his attention back to Dee and cupped her face in his hands without allowing himself to savor the softness of her skin. \u201cSnap out of it, Dee. You need to talk to me, or we\u2019re heading to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened, then cleared. \u201cJacob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dee.\u201d Relief taunted him, so close. \u201cAre you okay? Are you...hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember everything.\u201d Her eyes deepened, darkened, assumed a different quality.</p><p>The look of a different woman. The real Dee.</p><p>Dee? Hell, he didn\u2019t even know her name.</p><p>But she\u2019d remembered. He should be happy. He\u2019d worked with her for this moment, yet somehow wasn\u2019t ready. Maybe because he knew this was it. Now she would leave.</p><p>His hands slid from her face as he let her go. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember my child...and my husband. He took my son, Jacob. He stole my baby.\u201d</p> <p>Deirdre fingered her \u201cDee\u201d necklace as she waited for the county police. She\u2019d never so much as logged a speeding ticket in her life, yet lately she\u2019d talked to the cops on a regular basis like some criminal. Like her husband. Thanks to her husband.</p><p>The metal chilled in her hand. Her son had given her the necklace for Christmas. He\u2019d bought it at a preschool Santa\u2019s Gift Shop for students to choose gifts for parents.</p><p>Memories she\u2019d chased so vigilantly hurt. Even the beautiful ones stung because of all she\u2019d lost.</p><p>Jacob stepped into the lobby, leaving Emily and Chase in the next room\u2014silent\u2014with the door open, waiting to make their statements when the police arrived. Dee didn\u2019t care if Jacob pressed charges for her sake, but she didn\u2019t blame him for drawing the line at stealing. Chase had been trusted here.</p><p>He tossed her a blue Air Force sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d At least she could quit worrying about clutching her buttonless blouse closed. Still she mourned the loss of her pretty flowered shirt, her first gift from Jacob.</p><p>As she tugged the sweatshirt over her head, Jacob\u2019s scent, his warmth, enveloped her, tempting her to seek the real thing. She had to face the world on her own sometime. Dee whipped her hair free of neckline and took what consolation she could from the generous folds of cotton fleece.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he step away from the counter and sit by her, comfort her in that sturdy way of his? In a flash of insight she understood. Because he didn\u2019t know her anymore. While she didn\u2019t feel any different, Jacob saw a stranger.</p><p>It was a night full of losses. So she introduced herself to this man she\u2019d known just under two weeks, a lifetime in itself for Dee Smith.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Deirdre Lambert. I\u2019m from Reno, Nevada.\u201d How strange to say that after not knowing so long. How could she ever have forgotten? She hadn\u2019t. It had been stolen from her as surely as Chase had taken that money. As the man she\u2019d married had stolen her child.</p><p>Humiliation swamped her as she forced herself to tell Jacob the rest. \u201cThe Mr. Smith who checked me in was my husband\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s fists clenched, the first visible reaction she\u2019d seen from him since Chase had slapped the money on the counter. Could it be jealousy? What should have given her a tiny rush merely saddened her. They\u2019d found the attraction tough enough before, and now her life had snarled into a bigger tangle.</p><p>\u201cMy ex-husband.\u201d She threaded her fingers through her hair and mashed the heels of her hands against her temples. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better back up. There are just so many images crowding my brain, so many thoughts and memories and moments to relive. I feel like I\u2019m in sensory overload.\u201d</p><p>Dee slumped back on the sofa. Still Jacob stood, unmoving. Maybe it was better they didn\u2019t touch. She might shatter like a brittle icicle.</p><p>\u201cBlane, my ex-husband, worked for a company that manufactured airplane parts.\u201d She tucked her knees up under the overlong sweatshirt as if to insulate herself with Jacob\u2019s innate strength. \u201cHis partner was convicted of knowingly selling substandard parts to companies under contract to build military aircraft. After coming across some papers in our old files, I started to suspect Blane might have been involved, too.\u201d</p><p>Now she understood why she winced every time anything military crossed her path. She feared for the people who could be in danger. She couldn\u2019t shake the shame over not having somehow known and stopped her husband.</p><p>Finally Jacob pushed away from the counter to sit beside her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you left him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually we divorced a year ago.\u201d Blane had been cheating on her with a woman at work.</p><p>Dee wondered now how she\u2019d missed the signs for so long. She cringed to think of how she, too, had been caught up in the seeming security of materialism in those days. She wanted much simpler things for herself and her son now.</p><p>Jacob\u2019s warm body waited inches away, but his gaze stayed focused on the picture of Mount Rainier over the fireplace. Not that she could accept any sympathy from him. He demanded such perfection from himself, how could he ever understand, much less condone how badly she\u2019d screwed up?</p><p>\u201cI found out he\u2019d been cheating on me, not some fling even, but a long-term relationship.\u201d So much for pride. Blane had trounced hers like grapes in a wine vat, and the product had been beyond bitter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jacob transferred his gaze to his hands clasped loosely between his knees.</p><p>\u201cBlane didn\u2019t contest the divorce. I obviously didn\u2019t mean that much to him, but he wanted sole custody of our son.\u201d</p><p>Losing Evan was beyond bearing. She certainly understood that all too well. \u201cI fought him and we ended up with shared custody. Once I found out about his illegal dealings, I got scared for Evan. I knew I didn\u2019t have any choice but to go to the police. I was only a day away from turning him in.\u201d She started shaking again. \u201cSomehow he must have figured out\u2014from my expression, or maybe I wasn\u2019t as subtle in probing for information as I thought.\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s face hardened. \u201cHe decided to shut you up.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, still hardly able to grasp that he would hurt her deliberately. Believing he could be capable of stealing had torn a hole in her heart. Discovering he could actually try to kill her...She could still hardly grasp what had happened. The ultimate betrayal by a man she\u2019d once thought she loved. \u201cBlane came by my condo, calm as ever. He had something for Evan in the Suburban, a present for Evan\u2019s fourth birthday since Blane would be traveling for work.\u201d</p><p>Her mind flashed with so many kaleidoscope memories. Evan clutching his favorite blanket with quilted airplane squares, the edges now ragged. Blane\u2019s earnest blue eyes, so like Evan\u2019s.</p><p>How could the father of her precious baby boy be totally bad? Surely his love for Evan was one pure part left in Blane, a symbol of what had been good in their marriage. \u201cA little voice deep inside me whispered that he was up to something, but Evan wanted his toy and Blane. I needed to believe there was something honest left inside him. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike wanting to believe Chase could be there for Emily.\u201d Jacob\u2019s eyes warmed as he finally seemed to see her. \u201cYeah, Dee...Deirdre. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Deirdre. Not Dee.</p><p>Those last four inches might as well have been a mile. She wanted his arms around her as she shared the most painful part, his strong arms, rather than a sweatshirt substitute.</p><p>Damn her pride, she couldn\u2019t make herself ask. \u201cHe forced me into the Suburban and started driving north, stopping here our first night on the road.\u201d She shuddered to think of the red dress he\u2019d made her wear in one of his twisted mind games. \u201cWe left early the next morning before dawn, and I was afraid he might make it to Canada. I tried to plan how to get help from the border patrol\u2014then the snowstorm started and Blane made his move. He tossed me out of the car on an abandoned road.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll kill him before I let you see him again, Deirdre.</p><p>The horror, the fear, the utter helplessness choked her, fresh as if it had happened only moments before. \u201cI hit my head, I think. I must have. Mostly I remember fighting to get to my feet as he drove away with my child.\u201d</p><p>Jacob reached to stroke her hair. She ducked, too raw, too vulnerable to accept the comfort that would send her crying into his arms.</p><p>She had to hold it together, depend on herself and start the search for her child. The search for a trail nearly two weeks cold. \u201cThe next thing I remember is stumbling to my feet, confused. I shoved my hands into my coat pockets to warm them and found the hotel key and a hundred dollars. I could only think of getting back here to my baby. Which doesn\u2019t make sense because they were already leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d been injured and traumatized. You\u2019re lucky you survived out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t kept that key, I probably would have died.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her stomach, the chill of that fearful walk washing over her. \u201cOnce I got back to the room, I must have slept for an hour or two. Then I woke, unable to remember anything.\u201d</p><p>Her every fear had been worse than she\u2019d imagined. She\u2019d been right to question her judgment. She\u2019d trusted and loved a man capable of unspeakable things.</p><p>And he had Evan.</p><p>How could she even think about baring her heart to anyone again? At the moment, she couldn\u2019t think of anything other than finding her son.</p><p>The front door opened. A shaft of frigid air blasted over her as it had that first day she\u2019d woken here. Two uniformed officers stomped snow off their boots. Dee recognized one of them from the day she\u2019d filed her report in Tacoma.</p><p>Again, she would have to tell her story, only this time it would be public knowledge. She straightened her spine and squeezed her hands together until they tingled.</p><p>Drained to her toes, she didn\u2019t relish baring to the world what a mess she\u2019d made of her life. However, maternal instincts fired her beyond normal endurance. She looked at Jacob and gave a fleeting thought to leaning on him while she talked, but tossed the notion aside. Jacob didn\u2019t need the burden of her troubles, problems even worse than she could have imagined. She would do this the best way for both of them...alone.</p><p>\u201cI need to report a kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, Jacob watched the cop slam the police cruiser door shut with Chase inside.</p><p>The noise jarred all the way through him. The officer planned to scare the spit out of Chase for his own good. Knowing this was the right thing didn\u2019t stop him from wanting to grab Chase by the scruff of the neck and send him home like a kid who\u2019d been caught snitching cookies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two hundred and twenty dollars\u2019 worth of cookies, not to mention frightening the hell out of Dee tonight. And what about the lipstick incident on her bathroom mirror? Could that have been Chase, too? But why would he do that to Dee? Deirdre.</p><p>His jaw clenched even as he thought of her bastard of an ex-husband. Jacob forced himself to relax. He would deal with all of those feelings later. First, he had to settle Emily.</p><p>She slouched outside the door to her suite, the baby monitor clutched in her hand. He didn\u2019t need to step any closer. Even in the dimly lit parking lot he could see well enough the accusation in her eyes, along with unshed tears. She didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d turned in Chase.</p> <p>How many more times would Chase let Emily down before she realized she deserved better? But then even Dee, an adult, had been blinded by love. Love for another man.</p><p>God, he felt hollowed out inside. He just wanted to give his kid sister a hug she no doubt needed.</p><p>Jacob stepped forward, but Emily backed away, into her room, closing the door quietly\u2014but firmly. Maybe she would be calmer, more reasonable, in the morning.</p><p>Yeah, right. Jacob shrugged through half the kinks in his shoulders and climbed the porch steps toward Dee, slower than when he\u2019d charged up them earlier.</p><p>As much as he\u2019d lost, she\u2019d lost more. He sliced away his own needs, safer for him, anyway, and focused on hers.</p> <p>Jacob pushed through the motel door and found her curled in the corner of the sofa staring out the window. He tossed his coat onto the coat tree.</p><p>Dee gnawed on a fingernail. \u201cI should have gone with the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s nothing you can do at the police station tonight. They have the number here. Maybe they\u2019ll have some answers when we head into town tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Dee dangled her arm along the couch back, her fingers drawing little circles in the condensation on the window. Outside, snow began spiraling from the sky, heralding an approaching storm. \u201cBlane could be anywhere by now.\u201d</p><p>He knew that, but she didn\u2019t need it confirmed. \u201cThe authorities were searching blind before. Not now.\u201d</p><p>Dee exploded from the sofa. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit here and do nothing. I have to find them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to be patient a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>She ripped a coat off the rack. A surplus of adrenaline oozed from her. \u201cMy son\u2019s out there somewhere. He\u2019s only four. He can\u2019t sleep without his airplane blanket and a story before bed. He\u2019s never been separated from me for more than three nights at Blane\u2019s, and Evan has a life-threatening peanut allergy. I can\u2019t just wait here and do nothing. I never should have let that cop persuade me to sit tight.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by her frenzy. She\u2019d held it together throughout a hellish night. From past experiences in combat, he\u2019d seen enough to know the adrenaline letdown would crash into her soon.</p><p>Two long strides and he caught her. He grabbed her arm just as she reached for the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve done everything you can. Filing a police report. Calling everyone you could think of who might have had contact with your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d She tried to wrench her wrist free, then flailed with her other. Her pitch rose, approaching hysteria. She jerked, scratched, kicked with surprising strength. \u201cJacob, damn it, let me go. I have to do something.\u201d</p><p>He trapped both of her wrists and gave her a light shake. \u201cThink. Even if I gave you the keys to the truck and a full tank of gas, what more can you do tonight?\u201d</p><p>Reason returned to her eyes just before they flooded with tears. She sagged like a rag doll in his grip. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything I can do, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dee, I\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She crumpled against his chest. \u201cOh God, Jacob, this is so much worse than not knowing. I didn\u2019t think anything could hurt that much, but I was so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jacob gentled his hands along her hair again. He gritted his teeth against the need to bury his face in her neck. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold me. Please.\u201d Half sobbing, gasping in air, she burrowed against his chest.</p><p>She squirmed against him as if to nestle closer still. He tried to ignore his reaction to her soft body wriggling against his. As much as he wanted, needed, burned to lose himself inside her and forget about the whole damned evening, she needed something else from him.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><p>Her hands grappled at his shirt, his shoulders, his hair, dragging his head down to hers. Tapping the last dregs of his self-control, he held himself back.</p><p>With a none-too-gentle yank, Dee urged him closer. \u201cKiss me, damn it.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to, needed to, but knew it was wrong. The wrong time. The wrong reason. But she sure as hell felt like the right woman. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s adrenaline talking.\u201d</p><p>Fire snapped from her eyes, full force and full of will. \u201cAdrenaline? Is that what it was yesterday? Or every day we\u2019ve been together and I wanted this?\u201d Her pupils widened until her eyes turned near-black, like heavy storm clouds. \u201cFor all this time I\u2019ve been trying to remember, yet now I\u2019m finding I desperately need to forget. Please, for just a few hours, help me forget.\u201d</p><p>Good intentions fled. All his honorable platitudes seemed to have checked out for the night, and he couldn\u2019t think of a single rebuttal. His fingers flexed around her wrists as he stared into the tear-misted eyes of this woman he wanted more than air.</p><p>Time to quit fighting it. He hadn\u2019t been able to walk away from her the first time he saw her any more than he could turn away now.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>W as she getting through to him? If he turned her down, she would\u2014</p><p>Do what?</p><p>Shriek her frustration at him and the whole world? She\u2019d already done enough shouting for one night, for a lifetime even.</p><p>But the very trait that made Jacob so attractive to her could be the one thing that caused him to pull away. The man was so honorable.</p><p>She needed to forget what Blane had done to her and their child. Just for tonight until she could do something to find Evan.</p><p>\u201cJacob,\u201d she moaned, demanded. Determination fueled her fingers as she shoved his buttons free, working her way from his neck down the camouflage uniform. All those necessary layers of cold-weather wear kept her from finding the salty skin she yearned to taste. She groaned her frustration. His hands covered hers.</p><p>Uh-oh. Here comes more talk of right and wrong and morning-after regrets.</p><p>Stretching onto her toes, Dee grazed her mouth along his neck, up to his ear. She\u2019d never considered herself much of a femme fatale and feared she would fall short now. Blane\u2019s infidelity had torn at her self-confidence. He\u2019d been her first, and after their split, she\u2019d shut that part of her away rather than risk more rejection.</p><p>Would she have ever pursued Jacob so relentlessly before she\u2019d lost her memory? Of course not. How odd that it had taken a hefty dose of amnesia to set her sensuality free. Still, she wasn\u2019t sure her fledgling sense of adventure could withstand Jacob turning from her.</p><p>Pride forced a huskiness to her voice. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2018no.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her faster than any long speech about impulsive mistakes. Pride ducked behind surprise.</p><p>Dee\u2019s grip tightened around Jacob\u2019s collar. \u201cYou don\u2019t think this is a bad idea? You don\u2019t think it\u2019s an adrenaline high that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jacob silenced her with a hard kiss.</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers. \u201cYes, I do think we\u2019re both riding an adrenaline high. But no, I don\u2019t think we should stop. We\u2019ve both wanted this too long to waste it by rushing. Let\u2019s take it slow.\u201d His light blue eyes turned smoky, whispering over her. \u201cReally slow.\u201d</p><p>The hungry sweep of his eyes left Dee with no doubts. He wasn\u2019t going to leave her hurting and alone. Relief turned her legs to soup, like one of those Sunday Jell-O molds left out too long.</p><p>It was going to happen. She and Jacob would be n**ed in a matter of moments\u2014slow, stolen moments.</p><p>He dipped his head to drink unending, leisurely kisses from her mouth. What made the feel of his hands on her so special, so different?</p><p>She met his questing tongue with her own, reacquainting herself with the mind-numbing taste of Jacob. Liquid fire poured straight through her like a swig of his beer.</p><p>He looped an arm around her waist to mesh their bodies and walked her with him, their synchronized steps almost dancelike. Jacob locked the door, flicked a switch activating the No Vacancy light in the window, and backed her into his apartment, never once halting his deliberate homage to her lips. Every brush of their bodies against each other nudged his solid arousal against her stomach, a reminder, a promise.</p><p>Jacob backed her across his darkened apartment until they stood bathed in the moonbeams streaming through the skylight. True to his word, he peeled away her clothes with torturous precision. His broad hands tunneled beneath the sweatshirt as inch by shivery inch, he bunched the fabric up and free.</p><p>Her yellow floral shirt hung loose, draping over her breasts. Jacob fingered the small rips where there had once been pearly buttons. His jaw flexed, and she feared the mood had been broken.</p><p>\u201cJacob?\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he pressed her to him. \u201cI should have been here for you.\u201d</p><p>She feathered her fingers over his brows. So many shadows lingered in his eyes. Insecurities nipped. What did she have to offer? Very little according to Blane.</p><p>She could give Jacob reassurance. \u201cYou\u2019ve been there for me since the second I first walked into the lobby. You\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a real hardship tour, being here for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>In spite of his lighthearted tone, Dee searched his eyes and found a mirror of her own thoughts, an appreciation for the rare window of time they had together.</p><p>She cupped his face in her hands. \u201cI need you. I need you so much tonight.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly slow didn\u2019t seem as important as the urge to be closer. She reached for him as he reached for her. Their hands dodged each other to stroke aside clothes and any lingering inhibitions. They made their way up the loft steps, leaving a path behind them.</p><p>Camouflage draped over yellow flowered flannel.</p><p>Rugged thermal rested beneath a white lace bra.</p><p>When they reached the top step, she wore nothing but her panties. He wore nothing at all.</p><p>Moonlight caressed every inch of Jacob as she longed to. She walked her fingers down his chest, her skin so pale against the bronzed vitality of him. So much strength beneath her hands and she ached to soak some of it up to carry her through the coming days.</p><p>He grazed the backs of his fingers along her jaw, her neck, between her breasts. She gasped, her mouth drying as moist heat pooled between her legs.</p><p>Jacob sealed his mouth to hers, probing deeply, fully, as he would later do with his body. Her senses already heightened from an evening of too much emotion, she hooked her arms around his neck and simply hung on.</p><p>His hands roved, possessed, until he splayed one hand along the middle of her back, the other cupping her bottom. He lifted her, trailing kisses along her jaw. Raised her higher still, his mouth nibbling down her neck.</p><p>Jacob kissed a moist path between her breasts. Her breath hitched in anticipation. He lingered until she wanted to yank his hair in frustration.</p><p>\u201cJacob, forget slow.\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile against her skin, another tantalizing brush that pulled the thread of desire tauter within her. He puffed a teasing blast of air over her just before he latched on. She exhaled, shuddered and arched in a silent invitation for more.</p><p>Dee braced her hands on his shoulders, her arms trembling as her legs dangled. He laved equal attention on her other breast, feasting alternately from both until her head fell back. Her hair swayed along her spine, sending a fresh tingle along her already-shimmering nerves.</p><p>Jacob lowered her to his bed, and in the flash of time before he joined her, Dee devoured him with her gaze. The very size of him thrilled her. Six foot four inches of muscled man, all hard and eager for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he hooked his thumbs in her panties, and she froze. How could she have forgotten? Her scar would glare, bringing the world rushing back between them. Already tears stung. A band of pain constricted her ribs.</p><p>He hovered over her, his brows knit together, his breathing rasping as if he\u2019d shoveled the whole parking lot. \u201cDo you want to stop?\u201d</p><p>Definitely not. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>His exhaled enough relief to combat the best Washington storm wind. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, then? What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just don\u2019t stop, please.\u201d</p><p>His eyes never left her face as he skimmed her panties down her legs and to the floor. Instinctively her hand flew to her stomach and covered the place where her baby had once rested, where a scar remained.</p><p>Jacob\u2019s gaze snapped to her protective hand. His brow smoothed before he circled her wrist and eased her arm away. With one thumb, he soothed the faded incision before he placed his broad palm on her belly. His fingers splayed over her stomach with healing heat. \u201cWe\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>Determination rang from his vow. She wanted to believe him. Even if placing so much trust in him screamed of losing control, she wasn\u2019t left with any choice. If ever a man could accomplish something through sheer will, she believed Jacob could.</p> <p>Her hand fluttered to rest over his, linking. Then he joined her on the bed. Dee scooched up the quilt as he shadowed her body with his, finally blanketing her without letting go of her hand.</p><p>She gripped his fingers tighter and held on. That connection, something so basic and beyond the sexual, anchored her. Just as his friendship had moored her through a time when she could very well have drifted into dangerous waters. She squeezed his hand. \u201cMake me forget. Make us both forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll damn well try my best.\u201d His callused hands snagged along her skin with a sweet abrasion.</p><p>Dee lost herself in a swirl of sensations, his warm body beneath her fingers. She smoothed over his chest, traced a ridged scar along his arm. She shivered at how close he\u2019d come to dying that day.</p><p>His strong, columned neck smelled of wind and musk. She sketched along the muscles on his chest, his abs, lower. As her hand curled around his rigid length, exploring, learning him, she found his need obviously equaled hers.</p><p>Jacob skimmed her scar once again, but continued lower until he cradled the core of her. He circled and soothed until she writhed against him. A lone finger dipped and dampened to rub the sensitive bundle of nerves.</p> <p>So much, almost too much, the intensity built. But she knew where it would lead, or rather wouldn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t want their time ruined by his disappointment.</p><p>She clasped his wrist, tugging his hand upward again.</p><p>Jacob nuzzled her neck and tugged back. \u201cNot yet. Not until you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She rocked her hips, seeking to distract him. A hint of desperation leaked into her voice. \u201cWe have all night.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and braced on both forearms. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just ready.\u201d Shards of inadequacy pelted her, and she tried desperately to dodge them. She didn\u2019t want Blane\u2019s insults to have power over her ever again, especially not now.</p><p>\u201cLike you said, we have all night.\u201d</p><p>His hand soothed her again, sending tantalizing yet frustrating ripples through her. She couldn\u2019t bear to see his disappointment, so she turned her face away before she spoke. \u201cJacob. I can\u2019t. Okay? I don\u2019t, uh, finish.\u201d</p> <p>The stroking stopped, and she wasn\u2019t sure whether to be grateful or not.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had an\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob\u2014\u201d She clapped her hand over his mouth. Heat crept up her face. Why couldn\u2019t she have been more tempting, more anything to have lured him past this point before he found out? \u201cI guess that\u2019s something else I forgot when I was throwing myself at you. It doesn\u2019t have to make a difference now.\u201d She teased her fingertips along his back, over his buttocks and up again. \u201cBeing close to you, that\u2019s what I want, what I need. It\u2019s enough for me, really.\u201d</p><p>During her whole rambling speech, he stared at her with those piercing eyes that saw straight to a person\u2019s soul without allowing a reciprocal peek. \u201cLet me ask you something.\u201d</p><p>Why did they have to talk? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel good?\u201d The backs of his fingers flicked over her breast. \u201cAnd this?\u201d He reached lower. \u201cDoes it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why rush?\u201d He kissed her protest away. \u201cYou say it won\u2019t finish the way I think it will. So? If you\u2019re enjoying it, don\u2019t push me away just because of what you think I expect.\u201d</p><p>It made sense. If only she could believe he meant it. Knowing Jacob, he probably thought he could succeed where eight years in a marriage bed hadn\u2019t. She cringed, envisioning the realization that would steal over his face as minutes passed and he accepted that he\u2019d failed. She\u2019d failed.</p><p>He breathed against her lips. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to do just that and simply bask in the warm tension building from his persistent touch. Where Deirdre would insist he stop, Dee would have taken a risk and let him continue.</p><p>How very much she wanted Dee\u2019s boldness. She could have it, for tonight with Jacob. Dee was the woman he knew, the woman he\u2019d taken to bed.</p><p>She closed her eyes, forgot about passing minutes or possible goals and savored. She gathered every sensation like a treasured gift, the glide of fingers, the caress of lips along her ear as he whispered all the ways he longed to love her body.</p><p>Release crashed over her without warning. Like a wave slapping her, almost painful in its intensity, leaving her struggling for air. Her back bowed off the bed, driving his hand harder, his finger deeper and sending a fresh wave pulsing through her, building until her cries of pleasure rode on the last rush.</p><p>Reality returned in increments. The stars faintly visible through the swirl of snow along the skylight. Jacob sweeping her hair away from her face. His leg nestled between her thighs, a heavy, delicious burden.</p><p>Dee loosened her fingernail-deep grip on his hip, and his mouth tipped in a hint of a smile. His eyes cleared, and he let her in for a rare look that said far more than words. Her friend had returned. Only a hint of male pride gleamed in his eyes, mingling with happiness for her.</p><p>When her heart had slowed to something resembling a slow jog, she squeezed his hand. He dropped a kiss to her forehead and rolled away. Dee almost shouted her frustration until she saw him delve into his bedside table and pull out a small, square cellophane packet.</p><p>A totally irrational wad of jealousy punched her. She chewed the insides of her mouth to keep from asking him whom he\u2019d bought them for.</p><p>Jacob glanced at her. \u201cAfter that night in the back of my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a box the next day. I told myself we shouldn\u2019t end up here. Having these around still seemed smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery smart.\u201d</p><p>He sheathed himself and tucked her beneath him again. With the quilt under her, Jacob over her and the stars glimmering through the skylight above, Dee couldn\u2019t help but remember that kiss. How much he\u2019d needed her then. How much they needed each other now.</p><p>Eyes locked on each other, he entered her slowly, as her body stretched to accommodate him. He stilled, bearing the bulk of his weight on his forearms. She gazed up at him, almost seeing him anew during that instant of being joined for the first time.</p><p>Then he moved, and she lost the ability to think about beginnings\u2014inevitable endings. So long. It had been so long, if ever, since she\u2019d felt such an incredible heightened sense of awareness. Rather than forgetfulness, she\u2019d found an awakening that surpassed anything she could have wished for.</p><p>They found the rhythm unique to their union, neared the edge and fought it off, prolonging the sensations like a gift that would be snatched away once they accepted it.</p><p>Finally his heaving chest, their sweat-slicked bodies, signaled an end, and she almost mourned the pleasure she knew was an instant away. Again, his hand found her, circled, a single nudge sending her spiraling until she felt as if she\u2019d flown through the skylight, free-falling into the night.</p><p>With a hoarse shout, he joined her. She reached to hold his hand as her body accepted him.</p><p>She feared her heart wasn\u2019t far behind.</p><p>With Dee\u2019s sleeping body curled against him, Jacob could almost allow himself to forget they had to put their feet on the floor and resume life in a few hours.</p><p>Gently he loosened her grip on his hand. When she didn\u2019t stir, he draped the quilt over her arm and up to her creamy, bare shoulders. He skimmed his thumb along her collarbone, to the hollow of her throat.</p><p>Already he stirred again at even the thought of crawling beneath that quilt and losing himself inside her. If he thought once more would satisfy his need for her, he would. But he knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>Jacob snatched his hand away and shoved to his feet.</p><p>It was only supposed to be about sex, a release, a momentary escape for both of them. Of course, it could have been all about sex for her. How clearly he could see her beautiful face flooding with surprise just before shifting to lazy-lidded pleasure.</p><p>He bit off a curse. The last thing he wanted from her was gratitude for introducing her to good sex. Great sex.</p><p>His need for more told him he\u2019d already gotten too close. She\u2019d become too important. He should back up, gain distance and perspective for her sake as well as his.</p><p>Jacob whipped a pair of sweatpants off the back of a chair and slid into them. Each step from the loft should have offered him the distance he needed. Instead her every breath whispered through the room, tempting him. Even the skylight seemed to silhouette her in some center-stage way.</p><p>Where did they go from here tomorrow?</p><p>Thinking of Chase in lock-up for the night, Jacob scrubbed a hand over the back of his neck. His hormones had been so tied in knots over Dee, he\u2019d let his guard down and messed up with Chase. His hormones could cost him focus in finding her child.</p><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t turn his back on her now. Jacob dropped into the recliner and tapped the telephone beside him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he could be the kind of man she wanted long-term, but he could sure as hell help her with her here and now. No more waiting to get back on the job. With sunrise nearing, it was time to tap into the extra help his military network could provide.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>S itting on the edge of the bed, Dee faced the morning with a mix of anticipation and dread. She clutched the telephone after speaking with her parents in Colorado about taking a photo to their local police station. She wanted to believe she would be holding her child just as tightly by the end of the day.</p><p>Through the skylight the clouds hovered above, heavy and gray as the first morning light fought the overcast conditions as fiercely as she struggled to keep her mood positive, to hold on to the comfort she\u2019d found in Jacob\u2019s embrace through the night.</p><p>He paced in the hall, cell phone to his ear. He moved with tense, purposeful strides, freshly showered and wearing his flight suit for a trip to the base after they spoke with the police. He\u2019d already been on his cell when she woke up, still talking when she took her shower and then called her parents. She itched to know what he\u2019d uncovered.</p><p>Replacing the cordless receiver into the charger, she listened to Jacob\u2019s end of his cell phone conversation.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve updated the APB on Lambert, including the boy?...Good...Uh-huh...Even better.\u201d</p><p>Hope surged through her. She tugged her pink sweater over the low waistband of her jeans, the cashmere a poor substitute for Jacob\u2019s embrace, and padded down the loft steps.</p><p>\u201cAny hits from the ferries at Puget Sound?\u201d His gaze flicked over to her, lingered for a moment, smoked with a banked fire, then his attention returned to the conversation. \u201cUh-huh. I\u2019ll see if she can come up with anything more about his plans to cross the border.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Could he have already found a lead? Her emotions as tender as her body, she craved even a sliver of reassurance that her son would be in her arms soon. Jacob certainly appeared invincible, capable of anything in his flight suit.</p><p>Even in socks and no boots.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly, Spike. Tell your Mountie bud I owe him.\u201d He thumbed the off button on the cell and looked at Dee.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d She could see her answer in his eyes, and it wasn\u2019t good. She\u2019d told herself not to hope, but that didn\u2019t stop the stab of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a friend on base with the Office of Special Investigation to see if they could get any inside scoop since your ex was up on charges that would affect military safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man you called Spike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Special Agent Keagan. We\u2019ve been back and forth on the phone for a few hours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he said?\u201d She scrambled to process all he was telling her, but kept thinking of how her husband had put all of these military people in danger just for money. She hoped all the potential damage had come to light when his partner had been arrested, but could there be more?</p> <p>Finding Blane became even more important, something she wouldn\u2019t have thought possible.</p><p>\u201cThe cops have updated the data in the NCIC\u2014National Crime Information Center. A warrant had already been issued for Lambert\u2019s arrest for custodial interference based on your statement to the police last night. They\u2019ve put a trace on all his credit cards and his cell phone. They\u2019re also keeping an eye on his, uh, mistress. Her phone records will be monitored, as well. I wish I had more for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done so much. Thank you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t thought about him taking the other woman along later. At least the policeman last night had the forethought to jot down the woman\u2019s name. Then the rest of Jacob\u2019s words trickled through her brain. \u201cYou said you\u2019ve been speaking with him off and on for hours. Did you manage to snatch any sleep?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked to the bed, with its rumpled sheets and musky air of sex. \u201cI\u2019m used to catching power-naps when we have a long flight.\u201d He cocked his head to the side. \u201cHow did the conversation with your parents go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple. Everything\u2019s taken care of on their end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat rough, huh?\u201d He stepped closer, a simple reach away, the uniform stretching across the broad chest she\u2019d slept against through the night.</p> <p>She tried not to let the hollowness inside her echo through to her voice. \u201cThey\u2019re not demonstrative people, and we haven\u2019t spoken in so long. I didn\u2019t expect a great emotional outpouring. They\u2019ll take care of what needs doing with Evan\u2019s picture. Wiring me money. That\u2019s all I can ask.\u201d</p><p>Indignation snapped in his eyes. \u201cI happen to think you can ask for about anything you need at a time like this. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m here for you, and that includes helping you through this.\u201d</p><p>For all of four more days remaining in his leave time?</p><p>The words went unspoken between them. Still she could almost hear the clock ticking away their time together. She wanted to believe she would be holding Evan by nightfall, but she had to accept the reality that she could be searching for him for a long while\u2014on her own.</p><p>An uncomfortable silence stretched. Morning-after awkwardness? Maybe. She hadn\u2019t expected declarations of undying love, certainly wasn\u2019t sure she could have handled it if he\u2019d said any such thing. Her one brush with love and marriage had left her burned beyond belief.</p><p>All past problems aside, because of Evan she couldn\u2019t think beyond the next few hours, much less into any kind of future. She needed to hold on to the hope that with her returned memory, she would find her son. \u201cI\u2019ll scrounge up some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Jacob watched Dee make tracks toward the door, her signature spunk starching all the way up her spine. He hated that his rotten mood had kept him from reaching out to her after sex.</p><p>The phone calls\u2014his and hers\u2014had left him frustrated, edgy and feeling too damned inadequate. She deserved better from him.</p> <p>Halfway across the room, she paused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to leave for another hour. There\u2019s nothing to accomplish by showing up early.\u201d He extended his arms. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Still she hesitated.</p><p>Dee usually had such a grab-life attitude, he kept forgetting about those tender feelings. He could use the time to gather more information about her past while indulging her in some morning-after cuddling women seemed to need. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched a lot of sunsets together.\u201d He nodded to the picture window across the room. \u201cLet\u2019s watch a sunrise.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of their ritual after supper, her shoulders relaxed. She inched toward him.</p><p>He spread his arms wider. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome get me.\u201d</p><p>Jacob couldn\u2019t hold back the smile. His Dee had returned, and he\u2019d missed her even during those few short minutes she\u2019d been gone.</p><p>He tugged her arm as he sank into the recliner. She curved into him as he settled his chin on her head. A perfect fit. \u201cMy ID of the man who checked you in matches Lambert\u2019s description. The search was broad before, but now they\u2019re checking out ferries, bus stations, airlines. The border patrol has been alerted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks too late. He\u2019s probably already left the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll find him in Canada.\u201d</p><p>Her bare foot peeked from the hem of her jeans. He smiled, remembering her surprise that first day at finding she had big feet. Jacob cupped the graceful arch in his hand and warmed her skin. \u201cThat picture from your parents will be a big help to the police.\u201d</p><p>Dee stiffened in his arms, hesitated, then said, \u201cTheir photo will be at least six months old. Hopefully somebody can get to one of my more recent snapshots soon.\u201d</p><p>Six months old? Odd. His friends all had pictures of their kids littering tabletops and albums, a new batch cropping up almost by the week. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing until somebody gets to yours.\u201d</p><p>She shifted in his lap, her bottom wiggling against him again. Jacob gritted his teeth, damn near cracked a crown.</p><p>Her face rested against his chest, her lashes fluttering against his skin. He tamped down temptation, then shot it all to hell by tunneling his hand under the quilt to cup her warm skin. She sighed and sagged into his touch.</p><p>Patting her back wasn\u2019t enough. He needed to fix her whole world and make sure no one ever hurt her again. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>Dee swiped her wrist under her nose. \u201cI hope so. It\u2019s just tough to trust my judgment after the way I fell for a man like that. I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents in years. Other than sending them an occasional picture of Evan, we haven\u2019t had contact since I married Blane.\u201d</p><p>That explained the old picture. But it didn\u2019t explain how a parent gave up on a child. That he couldn\u2019t understand. Hadn\u2019t anyone stood by this woman the way she deserved? \u201cHow long were you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou married young, then.\u201d And went right from her unforgiving parents to an unfaithful husband. No wonder she instinctively resisted leaning on anyone.</p><p>\u201cI was a late-in-life child for my parents. They petted me, took care of everything for me. Sounds pretty pathetic when I say it out loud.\u201d She traced along a patch on his sleeve, her fingers sketching over a stitched flag. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like Blane. I made my first big stand in marrying him, and was too prideful to admit to them I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody makes mistakes. That\u2019s life. Sounds like your parents didn\u2019t give you a chance to learn from making them.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s hand abandoned the quilt to cup his face. \u201cYou\u2019re sweet, trying to let me off the hook like that, but I\u2019m responsible, too. I can\u2019t bear to think of all the military members he has put in jeopardy for greed.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let himself think overlong on how the man had been sending defective parts for the very planes Jacob had worked to keep in perfect condition. A crash because of mechanical failure would be a guilt he couldn\u2019t live with.</p><p>His grip tightened and Dee winced. He stared into those brown eyes and saw the hurt and shame she couldn\u2019t hide. \u201cDee, it\u2019s not your fault. None of it. You\u2019re not responsible for what your husband did and you\u2019re not to blame for how your parents have acted.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her before she could argue, because he couldn\u2019t wait another minute to taste her, and because he knew she\u2019d have to close her eyes.</p><p>Dee ended the kiss with a brief tug on his bottom lip. \u201cGuess I inherited that stiff-necked prideful nature from my parents, a part of why they had no reason to miss us when Blane dumped me in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>What would happen to Emily and Madison if the next time he flew into combat, he didn\u2019t make it home? Chase hadn\u2019t proven himself to be much in the way of support\u2014emotional or otherwise. Jacob\u2019s grip around Dee tightened. He couldn\u2019t stand to think of his sister as vulnerable and alone as this woman.</p><p>She snuggled closer and continued talking. \u201cIt still gives me chills to think of how easily I fell off the map. I\u2019d quit my job to move away from Blane, so even my friends weren\u2019t expecting to hear anything from me. I\u2019d put all my furniture in storage and moved into a resort weekly rental condo while I lined up job interviews in nearby towns midyear\u2014I\u2019m a preschool teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains your obsession with hats.\u201d And why she\u2019d been so good with Emily and Madison.</p><p>Jacob\u2019s arms twitched protectively around Dee as his thoughts flew back to the previous night. Chase would spend another few hours in jail before his parents would be able to spring him. Jacob forced his breathing to level out and reminded himself he hadn\u2019t had a choice.</p><p>No one would hurt her again, not Chase, not her worthless son of a bitch ex-husband.</p><p>Jacob thought of the uncharacteristic red dress. Another clue he\u2019d missed. His instincts had all but clubbed him over the head that the clothes didn\u2019t match the woman inside. \u201cThe red dress wasn\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLambert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tossed out my clothes when I was sleeping. I still can\u2019t believe I even managed to fall asleep that night. I just remember lying down beside Evan to help him settle and I must have drifted off for a few minutes out of sheer exhaustion. When I woke, he\u2019d undressed me, thrown out my clothes and had that red dress waiting. Just the style his mistress liked.\u201d Shuddering, Dee tugged the blanket closer around herself. \u201cBlane always did have a sick sense of humor. I could have died out there without warm clothes and he would have gotten away with Evan.\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s muscles contracted, and he forced himself not to hold her too tightly. He wanted to kill Lambert, with his hands, a gun, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Dee squirmed in his arms, and Jacob loosened his hold. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She snuggled closer as rays of sunshine pushed through the clouds to glitter off the picture window glass.</p><p>Their night together had ended.</p><p>Dee stared at the computer screen in the police cubicle. Her picture stared right back from a god-awful driver\u2019s license photo. Shoulder-length hair had been restrained with a headband. Her smile was overbright, her eyes wide as if the flash had caught her unawares.</p><p>Little had she known how life would blindside her just as unexpectedly.</p><p>Amazing how much younger she\u2019d looked a mere three years ago, mistakenly thinking she had her world in order\u2014marriage, son, job. All a sham. A false sense of security. She\u2019d been too young and trusting. Not anymore. She owed Evan.</p><p>She also owed Jacob for his faith when he\u2019d had no reason to take her in. Steady and constant, he sat next to her, walking her through the process of telling her story\u2014again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The detective nodded to the computer. \u201cOkay now, Mrs. Lambert. You\u2019re who you say you are.\u201d</p><p>Startled, Dee glanced up. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ma\u2019am.\u201d The older man scratched a hand along his graying buzz cut. \u201cNo disrespect meant, but it wasn\u2019t a given without some kind of confirmation. We have a saying around here. \u2018In God we trust\u2014\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2018But everyone else is suspect,\u2019\u201d Jacob finished.</p><p>Dee glanced from one to the other, both so confident, both with hundred-year-old cynical eyes. She needed to be more like them to survive. \u201cWhat a way to live.\u201d</p><p>The detective clicked the keys and a new image emerged. \u201cYour husband, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Unable to scrounge enough spit to speak, Dee stared at the photo of Blane, blond, wiry and too handsome for words even in a mug shot.</p><p>The corner of Jacob\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cHer ex-husband?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. Part of her wanted to tell them all this wasn\u2019t happening, deny she\u2019d even met that traitorous toad. She would simply ditch her Deirdre Lambert self. Except she\u2019d already learned the past couldn\u2019t simply be ignored. The past had happened, as she remembered clearly now. Her child\u2019s father would have a criminal record.</p><p>What a heritage for her son to carry.</p><p>She grieved for Evan that she hadn\u2019t chosen more wisely. Yet without Blane, she wouldn\u2019t have Evan.</p><p>The chair creaked as the cop leaned back. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring his accounts, tracking for any credit card activity, keeping a watch on his cell phone account and his girlfriend\u2019s telephone. If he\u2019s found over the border, a Canadian arrest warrant will have to be issued, along with a request for extradition.\u201d</p><p>Jacob nodded through the steps, but Dee\u2019s head was reeling. \u201cEven if we find Blane, I\u2019ll have to wait for a bunch of diplomatic mumbo jumbo to clear before they can arrest him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I know it sounds\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds like he\u2019ll have enough warning to run with my son again\u2014\u201d She forced her breathing to even out. \u201cSorry. I just want him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d The older officer clicked through a series of codes and the screen changed again. \u201cThis came through just before you arrived.\u201d</p><p>A child\u2019s face appeared. Evan\u2019s face. She bit back a cry.</p><p>Jacob braced a hand low on her back. \u201cOther than the hair color, he looks just like you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to speak without letting loose a flood of tears.</p><p>The detective pivoted back to the screen, the chair squeaking a low keen. \u201cHe will be logged into the data base for the NCMEC\u2014National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\u201d</p><p>She twisted her hands together, but they still shook. Her child was on his way to appearing on a milk carton.</p><p>Her hand gravitated toward the computer screen as if she could somehow touch Evan. The silky blond hair. The gap between his front teeth that showed when he smiled, which he did often. Her shy but happy child.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so little, only three\u2014\u201d She pressed the back of her wrist to her mouth. \u201cNo wait. He had his fourth birthday a week ago, and I missed it.\u201d Anger kicked through her, steeling her spine. \u201cDamn Blane for taking that away from me, too\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped short as two police officers with snow on their shoulders approached the cubicle, both with sober expressions.</p><p>Anxiety gripped her stomach. The cops both looked at Jacob, who promptly slid a bracing arm around her shoulders.</p><p>Her spine stiffened. \u201cDon\u2019t try to break the news gently. I want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>The older of the two policemen stepped closer, his expression shifting to one of total sympathy. \u201cMa\u2019am, we checked the highway location you gave the officer last night and we found the spot where you struggled with your husband. The road was clear enough for us to see tread marks. So we blocked off the lane and swept away the rest of the snow.\u201d</p><p>Tread marks? What was the worry over some leftover rubber? She stifled hysterical laughter. \u201cHe sped away. Of course he skidded for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, the tread marks lead into the river.\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s arm tightened around her even as he remained silent.</p><p>She blinked fast, unable to process what she was hearing. \u201cI saw him leave. I saw it.\u201d</p><p>The policeman fidgeted with his hat in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019ve already uncovered the vehicle\u2014\u201d he paused, then gentled his voice further \u201c\u2014and a man\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, gasping gulps of air. Pain blinded her, stabbed through her whole body into a great gaping hole in her heart. \u201cNo. No, no, no, I saw them drive away. My memory is clear now.\u201d</p><p>Nausea swamped her at even the possibility they suggested. But it couldn\u2019t be true.</p><p>It. Was. Not. True.</p><p>My God, hadn\u2019t she seen the Suburban leave?</p><p>The detective behind the desk rolled his chair closer, his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou need to prepare yourself and consider that you could be remembering what you wanted to see. You suffered a head injury. Your brain could still be trying to protect you from what you saw.\u201d</p><p>No. The mind couldn\u2019t be so deceitful. Still, uncertainty nipped her.</p><p>If the officers were right, that meant her child was...dead. An unbearable thought.</p><p>Unbearable enough to make her lose her mind completely after all?</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>H e hated being confined this way, in a tiny room with nothing much more than a too-small bed and a couple of dreary windows. But he had to keep a low profile now more than ever.</p><p>At least he could be grateful the police hadn\u2019t uncovered anything more about him. Beyond the incident with Dee, which could be easily explained away, they had nothing on him. He intended to keep it that way so he could start his new life, free of past mistakes.</p><p>He just had to figure out what to do about the kid, then he could move forward. He shifted on the crummy mattress, dreaming of the day when he would have a new place of his own with first-class bedsprings and a big-ass television. Not much longer and he would have everything he required\u2014the money\u2014to make his move. He simply needed to be patient.</p><p>If only patience didn\u2019t involve confinement to a lone room when he wanted to be outside, on the move. Free.</p><p>And it was all Dee\u2019s fault, damn her.</p><p>Yeah, he wanted a clean break. But he also craved revenge.</p><p>He wondered which urge would win.</p><p>The biting wind slapped Dee\u2019s face as she walked with Jacob down the cement steps, stirring smaller memories of her son, how he needed his ears covered. Evan succumbed to infections so easily.</p><p>What a ridiculous thought when he really could be dead. The full import of the possibility hadn\u2019t hit her. This wasn\u2019t denial, damn it, because she refused to believe it was true in the first place.</p><p>She simply followed Jacob, numb, climbing into his truck. A few miles later\u2014how many she wasn\u2019t sure\u2014she blinked through her fog enough to look around and realize...\u201cJacob, you turned the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>His eyes stayed forward with unwavering focus. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBase? I know you\u2019d planned that originally, but things have\u2014\u201d she swallowed hard \u201c\u2014things have changed given what the police found in the river.\u201d Maybe he was taking her to the military doctor again. Perhaps he thought she\u2019d totally lost it.</p><p>His hands stayed steady on the steering wheel as the truck charged ahead. \u201cYou told me you saw your ex drive off with your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the skid marks...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be some other explanation,\u201d he said with unshakable conviction.</p><p>Hope teased at her insides. \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>He glanced in her direction, his strong jaw as set as his voice. \u201cI heard it in your voice. You know what you saw.\u201d</p><p>He believed her, even when she could barely believe in herself. The notion rocked her hard at a time when she already wasn\u2019t feeling too steady. But if Jacob thought there was a chance Evan wasn\u2019t in that river, she would grasp on to that possibility with both hands.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t give up on her child as long as there was any chance to find him. \u201cYour friend Spike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ask him to keep looking for information on your ex, he will search.\u201d</p><p>Hope fanned stronger, hotter, burning away the fog of grief clouding her mind. \u201cThey\u2019re even coming in on a weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re already waiting. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust the police. I just believe the more people we have working on this, the better.\u201d He passed her his cell phone. \u201cWhile we\u2019re driving, you should check your voice mail on the phone at your new place and on your cell.\u201d</p><p>She should have thought of that herself. Thank goodness Jacob covered all possibilities, even if this was a long shot. The police hadn\u2019t tracked any calls from Blane\u2019s cell. Still, she might find something else and right now any tiny lead felt vital to her sanity and to her son\u2019s safety.</p><p>Phone gripped in her hand, she started punching in the access code she now remembered. How wonderful to have such a basic part of her life back.</p><p>And most wonderful of all, Jacob believed her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t given up. He\u2019d navigated the necessary official channels, and now they would strike out on their own. After so long of depending only on herself, this felt surreal. Wonderful. Almost too much.</p><p>Too easily she could grow accustomed to this sort of support, then how would she survive on her own again?</p><p>Jacob walked with security through the multiple doors closing off the OSI offices from even the protected confines of a military base. If there were answers to be found, he trusted they would surface here.</p><p>He would have liked to come here first, but recognized the need to go through official steps beforehand. The police needed as much information as possible. And the time he and Dee had spent speaking with them gave his friends a chance to follow up on their own leads.</p><p>Dee\u2019s calls to check her messages hadn\u2019t netted anything but a few telemarketing hang ups and two job offers. Pretty much what he\u2019d expected. But he\u2019d thought giving her something to do would help her feel more in control.</p><p>The last door hissed open as the vault door seal released. Inside waited Special Agent Max Keagan, along with a couple of crew friends\u2014Bronco and Crusty. The two pilots, both family men, appeared solemn faced. No doubt envisioning the hell of this happening to one of their children. Jacob hadn\u2019t spent much time with Madison, but the little angel had a way of wrapping her fingers tightly around a person\u2019s heart.</p><p>He could only imagine what Dee was going through.</p><p>Dee looked around. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to say thank you. You\u2019ve all gone above and beyond.\u201d</p><p>Bronco lumbered up from his chair and offered it to her. \u201cThis is what we do for each other. If you\u2019re with Jacob, that makes you one of ours, remember? We take care of our own.\u201d</p><p>Special Agent Keagan scrubbed a hand over his spiked blond hair as he clicked through computer keys. He held up a hand in greeting but stayed silent.</p><p>Crusty produced a box of doughnuts. \u201cHe\u2019s been tapping into some connections at border patrol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case they went to Canada.\u201d She shook her head as a no-thank-you to the food.</p><p>Crusty scooped up a jelly-filled pastry. \u201cRight. There\u2019s camera footage at those stations and satellite photos. We\u2019re still looking into the possibility he hopped a ferry.\u201d He downed half the doughnut in one bite. \u201cSpike\u2019s got all sorts of superspy tricks up his sleeve for narrowing the search.\u201d</p><p>Keagan\u2019s fingers slowed. Without turning away from his computer, he waved over his shoulder. \u201cWhen was the lipstick-on-the-mirror incident? Exact date.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacob rattled off the information then asked, \u201cWhy? We thought that was Chase causing more trouble.\u201d</p><p>Keagan snagged a gulp from his bottled water before returning to the keyboard. \u201cMaybe, maybe not. I\u2019ll check around and see if Lambert\u2019s crossing back and forth over the border. So far, though, there\u2019s not even a peep from him. He\u2019s not at work. No credit card activity.\u201d</p><p>Dee started shaking again. \u201cThey\u2019re not dead. They can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Keagan patted the air in a calm-down motion. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they are. There are plenty of ways to pay for things without credit cards. Until I have definitive proof to the contrary, we\u2019re going to keep looking for your boy. My wife and I have a son, too.\u201d His gaze fell briefly to the photo of a newborn in blue grinning as he held a toy dolphin. \u201cI\u2019ll search for your child as if he were my own.\u201d</p> <p>Her hand shook as she reached to stroke a finger along the edge of the gold frame on the agent\u2019s desk. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jacob hoped like hell that Dee was right about her ex driving off. \u201cWould he really risk coming back here just to torment her? Why not make a clean run with Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the logical choice, but...\u201d Keagan trailed off.</p><p>Dee\u2019s face turned paler. \u201cHe\u2019s not logical anymore. Or rather, he\u2019s even more unbalanced than before, especially if he somehow found out I didn\u2019t die that night.\u201d</p><p>Jacob leaned forward, elbows braced on his knees. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s buying time while he sets up a new identity. He wouldn\u2019t have had much warning that Dee was on to him.\u201d</p> <p>Dee\u2019s eyes widened before blinking faster, darting from side to side. He couldn\u2019t imagine what it must be costing her to climb inside the mind of her crooked, cruel ex-husband.</p><p>Basically all the options here stunk.</p><p>Her ex and son could be dead. Or the criminal was on the road somewhere far away with her child.</p><p>Or Lambert was close by, determined to succeed in killing Dee this time.</p><p>Dee fidgeted with her seat belt as she watched Jacob charge up the steps back into the Lodge. He was closing the place\u2014indefinitely. He planned to hide out with Dee in visitor\u2019s quarters on base, while sending Emily and Madison to stay with Grace and her family. Grace was already inside Emily\u2019s room helping her pack for the baby before they would leave together.</p><p>Meanwhile, Special Agent Keagan was still working his secret ops magic to pick up her ex-husband\u2019s trail.</p> <p>She refused to consider the body in the river was Blane\u2019s. He\u2019d simply ditched the vehicle. He was trying to cover his tracks.</p><p>And the dead body? She said a prayer for whoever had died, because she had to believe dental records would prove it wasn\u2019t Blane.</p><p>Everything was happening so fast. She\u2019d known Jacob to be a man of action, yet his lightning-fast preparations left her head spinning. In his typical Jacob manner, he never seemed to hurry, yet arrangements had been made before she could blink.</p><p>Dee tucked her toes under the dash and soaked up the heater\u2019s blast, anything to keep her occupied. She\u2019d already packed her meager gear earlier and brought it with her to the police station so she could be mobile if they found Evan. Now Jacob insisted she wait here for him while he finished a couple of last-minute details.</p><p>Damn, she was restless. After waiting so long, a few more hours shouldn\u2019t matter. But they did.</p><p>Her life had changed too much, too fast. She and Jacob had slept together, a new memory that needed to be analyzed, pondered, savored. Except fear for Evan left her nearly breathless.</p><p>As Jacob posted a Closed sign on the front entrance of the hotel, a room door swung wide. Emily stepped out, saw Jacob and stopped. He opened his mouth, and his sister shoved her hands deeper into her pockets. Emily\u2019s shoulders rose as her eyes turned sulky. Jacob\u2019s mouth closed. He nodded and turned away, disappearing inside.</p><p>Dee could hardly believe what she\u2019d just seen. Emily couldn\u2019t actually be angry with Jacob. Chase had been the one in the wrong.</p> <p>Except logic didn\u2019t always come into play with adolescent emotions.</p><p>Dee wanted to leap from the truck and shake Emily by her two layers of oversize sweaters. Instead Dee rolled down the window. The teacher in her wouldn\u2019t let the teen skulk away. \u201cEmily? Over here.\u201d</p><p>Emily jerked and nearly slipped on a patch of ice, her heavy eye makeup smeared from tears. She glanced over her shoulder before turning back. Her feet skated along the ice as she warily approached.</p><p>The moody teen scratched her boot heel through the sludge, the baby monitor in hand as she hugged herself. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better than last night.\u201d Of course, that didn\u2019t say much since she\u2019d been mighty damn low.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She kicked a chunk of ice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your kid.\u201d</p><p>The ache with Evan\u2019s name on it threatened to overwhelm her, but she wouldn\u2019t let herself fall into a hole of forgetfulness again. She was stronger now. \u201cThank you, Emily. It\u2019s a scary time for me.\u201d</p><p>Emily swiped at the sludge with her boot again before backing away. \u201cGuess I should go.\u201d</p><p>Dee reached through the window to grab Emily\u2019s elbow. Helping her would help Jacob, and he offered so few opportunities for anyone to give back to him. \u201cNo school today?\u201d</p><p>Emily eased her arm free. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Her life was such a mess she couldn\u2019t keep the days of the week straight. Some candidate for straightening out a sullen teen. \u201cWhere\u2019s Chase?\u201d</p><p>Emily studied a snowdrift. \u201cHome, released to his parents who\u2019ve locked him in his room for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>So much for pointing out Chase\u2019s brush with the police. Maybe a direct approach might be best. \u201cI know it seems like your brother was rough on Chase last night, but Jacob would have been within his rights to do a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>What a mixed blessing to have regained her memory at such a horrible cost to Jacob and his sister.</p><p>Emily twirled the nursery monitor by the flexible antennae. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think about seeing it from your brother\u2019s side. Jacob made the hard choice, even if it\u2019s tough to admit it.\u201d Dee gripped Emily\u2019s arm before she could bolt away. \u201cI do understand how much it hurts when the man you love lets you down.\u201d</p><p>The teen blinked back tears and seemed ready to thaw...Then she backed away. \u201cI gotta go help Grace pack Madison\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>Part of Dee screamed Emily just needed time to reason through the crazy shift in their world. But she\u2019d seen how a day of unresolved anger could stretch into years of alienation. Heaven knew she\u2019d learned that lesson the hard way with her parents, a mistake she planned to fix as soon as she found Evan.</p><p>It was past time he met his grandparents. If only she hadn\u2019t waited too long. The regret would be unbearable.</p><p>She stepped out of the truck and charged after Emily. \u201cYour brother loves you. I\u2019ve seen that. He wants to help you but doesn\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>Emily spun on her heels, anger as bright as her unshed tears. \u201cSure he loves me. He just doesn\u2019t want a screw-up like me or Chase in his life. We\u2019re not all perfect like him, you know. Wait till you mess up, then you\u2019ll see. He\u2019ll dump you just like he\u2019s dumping me onto Grace.\u201d</p><p>The barb hit home and stuck like a prickly bur. Kids didn\u2019t fight fair. She should have remembered that from her teaching days.</p><p>Dee understood well enough how it felt to have a family member\u2019s disapproval, but Jacob was different. \u201cHe\u2019s not like your father.\u201d Or mine. \u201cHe\u2019s here for you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said Emily wanted to stay in Rockfish, the reason he wasn\u2019t taking her and the baby with him. Jacob took care of everyone.</p><p>But he never let anyone get too close to him.</p><p>Emily backed away. \u201cI don\u2019t need this psychobabble crud from you. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>Intellectually Dee understood Emily was transferring her anger from Chase over to Jacob. Yet as Dee watched Jacob lope down the steps with a Thermos of coffee in hand, she couldn\u2019t help but remember Emily\u2019s words.</p><p>Such a perfectionist himself, how would Jacob accept failures from others? She had her fair share of flaws. Her perfectionist parents had frozen her out for years because of one mistake.</p><p>Climbing back inside the truck, Dee shook off her own emotional baggage and focused on Jacob. While in many ways a loner, he never turned his back on anyone in need. He took care of lost souls like herself\u2014like his sister\u2014on a regular basis. Yet how close did he allow himself to become in return? How much of himself did he share?</p><p>A woman could lean on those broad shoulders forever.</p><p>Would he ever lean on her?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t settle for less than everything from a man ever again. If she and Jacob didn\u2019t learn how to share control, find some balance between them, she feared she would lose Jacob as well as Evan. The chill inside her spread, and she couldn\u2019t seem to jam her feet under that heater enough to warm herself.</p><p>Jacob opened the driver\u2019s-side door, a blast of cold air gusting inside. Dee suddenly realized they would be alone together for the night.</p><p>When they arrived at the base\u2019s visitor\u2019s quarters, would they be staying in one room or two?</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>T ossing aside his duffel bag next to the tiny microwave, Jacob wondered if Dee had expected him to get two rooms rather than one.</p><p>A moot point since he was lucky to have snagged even this last available visitor\u2019s quarter. She had been antsy and distant since he closed the door on the small space with a bed, a blue sofa and corner mini-kitchen. She would likely wear a hole in the carpet if she kept walking around.</p><p>Worries for her son, he could understand. He\u2019d felt that radiating from her every pore when he\u2019d held her while they\u2019d watched the sun come up. This was different.</p><p>She\u2019d been so certain the Suburban hadn\u2019t gone into the river. Could she be doubting now? He didn\u2019t even want to think of what it would do to her if that body turned out to be her ex-husband.</p><p>He needed to calm her, if he only knew where to start. Right now, she\u2019d taken to staring out the window as if she might find answers there.</p><p>Parents always wanted to talk about their children. He\u2019d learned that from his friends and a woman he\u2019d once dated who had a kid from a prior relationship.</p><p>He sat on the sofa and hoped that would encourage her to join him. \u201cTell me about Evan.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s head swiveled away from the window toward Jacob. Pain glinted in her eyes like icicles on the bare oaks outside, then melted with her tender smile. \u201cEvan loves chocolate ice cream and anything that flies. He has this plastic plane, a tub toy, that he\u2019s carried around forever, like his blanket.\u201d She sniffled and scrubbed the back of her wrist under her nose as she leaned against the wall. \u201cI promised him a toy aircraft carrier for his birthday.\u201d</p><p>Her ache lanced at him with surprising force. He\u2019d felt empathy before, but this was something more. Her pain was his. His investment in finding Evan became all the more personal. \u201cWe\u2019ll have another birthday for him with a huge cake and a trip to one of those places with goofy people in costumes, where kids can play video games.\u201d</p><p>How easily the word we slid from his mouth, bringing images of creating a normal family life.</p><p>\u201cHe would like that.... His birthday.\u201d Her hand fluttered to rest on her stomach. \u201cHe was an emergency C-section delivery. The placenta began to separate, and the doctor had to go in\u2014\u201d She blushed, staring at her crossed feet. \u201cOops, TMI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much information.\u201d She tugged the hem of her sweater, molding cashmere to the gentle swell of her breasts. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hear all the details.\u201d</p><p>Jacob waited for her to continue. He wouldn\u2019t let her shut down now that he finally had her talking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee shoved away from the wall, pacing restlessly, straightening a basket with coffee essentials, nudging the duffel upright with her toe, straightening the bedspread. \u201cI used to mourn having lost out on the childbirth experience. Now I thank God for that scar.\u201d She turned to Jacob. \u201cIt made me work harder at regaining my memory. Who knows how long I would have floated otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn lady.\u201d He admired the fortitude she had to possess in order to trudge through biting Rockfish winds to get back to the hotel after her ex had left her for dead on a deserted road. \u201cI think you\u2019d have punched through the fog before long.\u201d</p><p>Dee paused from evening out the mini-blinds to smile. \u201cThank you again for all you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want her gratitude. What did he want? She was important to him. A couple of weeks ago he would have said too important and run like hell. \u201cNo thanks needed. And, Dee? We\u2019re going to find your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that with such confidence. I envy your self-assurance.\u201d She crossed to the sofa and dropped to sit beside him. \u201cI\u2019ve made so many mistakes, Jacob\u2014big screw-ups. I can\u2019t help but wonder if this is my punishment, that I\u2019ve somehow brought this on myself and Evan\u2019s the one who will pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes.\u201d He\u2019d made his own fair share in not connecting with his sister. Hell, look at how he\u2019d never managed a serious relationship in thirty-two years. \u201cWorry about your child, cry for him, shout out your frustration. That\u2019s normal. But put the blame where it belongs. On Blane.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in mute denial.</p><p>Jacob silently damned Blane Lambert to hell for making Dee so wary. Evan and Dee, and even Jacob, were all having to pay. \u201cMistakes are tough to accept, especially when the stakes are so high. I\u2019m not giving up until I find him. You have to trust me to do this with you.\u201d</p> <p>A spark fired in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s all great\u2014\u201d she held up a firm finger \u201c\u2014as long as I get to be an equal partner in reclaiming my life and my son. While I\u2019m grateful for your help, I can\u2019t sit back and count on you to do everything for me. I need to take charge, to have some control.\u201d</p><p>She flattened her hand against his chest. Memories of making love to her rolled through his mind like a video on fast-forward. He wanted her again, but needed to think about her. She was going through hell right now, had to be suffering from huge emotional fallout after all they\u2019d learned at the police station and from Spike.</p><p>Jacob stared at her hand on his chest. She might need him to lay off, but then again, she might need the comfort after hearing about the Suburban in the water, the body near it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even want to think about the implications himself, so he couldn\u2019t imagine how torn up she had to be. The air hung heavy between them as he looked back down at her. \u201cDo you want me to sleep on the sofa?\u201d</p><p>A smile, her first today and not much of a smile at that, but a definite tilt to her lips tipped into her cheeks as she swayed toward him. Then he saw the heat, the desire, the need to escape firing into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIn the bed, with me,\u201d she said with conviction, sliding her arms around his waist and tipping her face in an unmistakable invitation for a kiss. \u201cOr we could stay here together on the sofa for now, the bed later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Because that\u2019s exactly where I want to be.\u201d He reminded himself now wasn\u2019t the time to talk about futures when hers was so uncertain. All the same, he couldn\u2019t help but want more from her. And the more he wanted, the more he stood to lose.</p><p>She\u2019d come full circle, starting in one small lodging room, ending in another. Only this time, she wouldn\u2019t let the world control her.</p><p>She\u2019d meant what she\u2019d said. She wanted to share his room, Jacob\u2019s bed.</p><p>The thought threatened to scare the warmth right out of her. But her every maternal instinct screamed that her son was alive and she knew she was doing everything possible to find him, thanks to Jacob\u2019s help. She couldn\u2019t find Evan tonight, but she could soothe her heart and soul enough now to carry on the fight tomorrow when she might need every scrap of strength she possessed to cope with whatever they discovered.</p><p>Dee angled forward and found his mouth. Jacob looped his arms low around her waist. Kiss for kiss, he twined his tongue with hers, exploring, tasting, demanding.</p><p>She pressed against him until he relented and leaned back on the sofa. Anchoring him, she flattened her tender br**sts to his chest, rolled her h*ps against his already rigid arousal. His hands reached for her shirt, and she shoved them away, pinning them to his sides. This was her show, her night to lose herself if only for a few hours.</p><p>Dee inched away from him, her mouth being the last thing to break contact. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>His brows lowered over his moody eyes. He paused, then raised his hands in surrender. Layer by layer, she tossed aside his clothes, rediscovering every patch of his skin with her mouth until tendons strained along his neck.</p> <p>Again Jacob reached for her. \u201cDee, enough.\u201d</p><p>And again she pushed aside his questing hands. \u201cNot nearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d he growled. \u201cThen it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. We\u2019ve still got the bed later.\u201d</p><p>Employing the same slow precision with which she\u2019d tossed aside his clothes, she repeated with her own. None of her prior insecurities remained as she shrugged off her bra, stepped from her jeans and whisked away her panties. His gaze heated with appreciation as he watched, further firing her own need.</p><p>Dee scooped his pants from the floor and pulled free his wallet. A quick search uncovered just what she\u2019d expected. He\u2019d come prepared.</p><p>She plucked out the condom and braced her knees on either side of his hips. Dee clasped him, silencing him as she unrolled the condom with a languorous stroke.</p><p>Groaning, he palmed her back and brought her down to him, skin to skin for the first time in what felt like forever. Dee sighed, gently brushing herself along the tempting rasp of the hair on his chest\u2014then gasped as his hands cupped her bottom.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said again, his voice leaving no room for argument.</p><p>They rolled from the sofa in a tangle of arms and legs. Jacob twisted at the last minute, and she landed on top of him.</p><p>Exactly where she wanted to be, in control.</p><p>She wriggled until her legs straddled him again. As she lifted to ease herself on him, he grabbed her hips. With a growl of frustration, she clasped his wrists and pinned his arms to the floor.</p><p>Dee took him inside her, control slipping elusively away as the heat of him filled her. Jacob\u2019s jaw clenched as he battled for restraint. She reveled in pushing him to the edge before he\u2019d even had a chance to touch her.</p><p>He shook his hands free of her grasp and filled them with her breasts, his thumbs circling her already pebble-tight peaks. She slid her hands over his and pressed while her h*ps rocked against him.</p><p>He palmed the small of Dee\u2019s back and began rolling her off him. She resisted. He braced a leg around hers and started to flip Dee to her back. Again, she resisted, her eyes sparking a mix of mischief and resolve.</p><p>He stroked her hair from her face, searching her eyes. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>Jacob hooked her leg over his hip and flipped her to her back in a smooth sweep that left her gasping, gripping his shoulders to secure herself the swirl of sensation.</p><p>He drove into her with powerful thrusts she met and equaled. She found new strength in his, new reserves she never knew she possessed.</p><p>Jacob reached between them and stroked her, teased her. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Dee tensed her leg around him, her body trembling with the force of powerful emotions she only just barely contained. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She watched her words register in his mind a second before she catapulted him over the edge, Jacob\u2019s hoarse shouts of completion sending an aftershock through her. Somewhere in her fogged brain, she heard him gasping, too.</p><p>Was he shaking or was she?</p><p>He gathered her to his chest, buried his face in her hair, and she wondered what the hell had just happened between them.</p><p>You\u2019re mine.</p><p>Her words or his? On a day filled with too many questions, she couldn\u2019t find the answer before sleep overwhelmed her.</p><p>The ringing alarm clock pulled Dee from sleep. She waited for Jacob to hit the snooze button, but the warm weight of his leg between hers didn\u2019t move. The steady beat of his heart thumped beneath her ear as she squinted against the morning light piercing through the mini-blinds.</p><p>Slowly the layers of grogginess peeled away and she realized it wasn\u2019t a clock, it was the\u2014</p><p>\u201cPhone, damn it.\u201d Jacob bolted upright and reached to snag the receiver. He scrubbed a hand over his face, then up to his mussed hair. \u201cJacob Stone here.\u201d</p><p>Dee gasped, sat up, praying he\u2019d picked up in time. No one knew to call them here except for his friend with the OSI. Anyone else would have used his cell phone number.</p><p>She hugged the plaid cover to ward off the chill of the winter morning and abrupt wake-up after the night of warm comfort in Jacob\u2019s arms. Still, she was immediately alert. Tense. Waiting for any news of her little boy.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he barked into the receiver, paused, frowned, glanced at her with inscrutable eyes. \u201cUh-huh. Right. She\u2019s here with me.\u201d</p><p>Bad news? She prepped herself for the possibility the body in the river could be Blane\u2019s after all. She couldn\u2019t let herself think about the possibility they had found her precious son in those icy waters.</p><p>Even the thick swaddling of a bedspread couldn\u2019t ease the cold that thought brought.</p><p>She bit her lip to keep from asking questions. If she interrupted him, the information would only come slower from whoever had called.</p><p>Jacob extended the phone toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s Spike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe border patrol? He found something?\u201d She could barely allow herself to hope everything could be resolved this quickly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYour home phone. Someone called and left a message, someone claiming to be Evan.\u201d</p><p>She forgot to breathe. Something she didn\u2019t realize until the room grew dim and Jacob grasped her arm. She gasped in air.</p><p>\u201cSpike wants to play the tape over the phone for you to identify the voice.\u201d</p><p>Dee grabbed for the receiver and cradled it to her ear, a lifeline to her son. Please, please, please. \u201cAgent Keagan? This is Dee Lambert. I\u2019m ready whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>She kept her eyes focused on Jacob\u2019s face, needing the contact. The strength. Oh God, she couldn\u2019t face another letdown if this wasn\u2019t her baby boy.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, hold on just a second while I patch through the recording.\u201d</p><p>A crackle sounded then cleared. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>The one word squeezed the air from her lungs. She gripped the phone as if she could somehow strengthen the connection.</p><p>\u201cMommy? I don\u2019t feel so good. Please come and get me....\u201d</p><p>A dial tone echoed as the call faded away. A click sounded, followed by Keagan coming back on the line to ask her a question she could barely hear over the roaring in her head.</p><p>Now she couldn\u2019t stop breathing, gasping, shaking. She forced her lips to move. \u201cIt\u2019s him. It\u2019s Evan.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>H e stared out his bedroom window at his parents\u2019 silver Suburban and wished like hell he could just drive away from here.</p><p>Chase punched his pillow and imagined he could sock Jacob Stone for putting him in this crappy situation. He flung the goose down lump away, envisioning it was Emily, getting the hell out of his life once and for all. No more trying to trap him with her clingy demands to spend time with her. He liked the kid, sure, but he just wasn\u2019t ready to be a dad yet. He wanted to play the field awhile longer. He was only just turning eighteen tomorrow, for God\u2019s sake. There were so many women out there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like Dee.</p><p>Man, she was hot and didn\u2019t even know it, a big part of her appeal. He flopped back on his bed, remembering the time he\u2019d snuck into her room while she\u2019d been bathing. He\u2019d only wanted to freak her out a little to rattle Jacob. So he\u2019d used some of his mom\u2019s lipstick to write on Dee\u2019s mirror.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped to shake up Jacob and yeah, while he\u2019d been watching, he\u2019d seen the man get totally pissed off. He should have felt victorious.... But afterward, nothing had changed. Jacob hadn\u2019t bolted back to Charleston with Emily in tow. Chase\u2019s world was just as junked up as before and ready to explode.</p> <p>For nearly a year the pressure in his head had built and built. He\u2019d been about to break up with Emily this time last winter so he could go out with this other girl.</p><p>Then Emily had told him she was pregnant and now he had to make like he was a devoted dad when he was dying to bang this chick in his study hall. He could have walked away from Emily easily enough, though, at first, but his parents had put the screws to him about doing the right thing, blah, blah, blah.</p><p>He had to be free of her, and if that meant he had to leave the kid behind, too, then so be it. Now would be a good time to make his move, anyway, with all the local cops in a tizz because of Dee\u2019s ex-husband.</p><p>Lucky bastard. Nobody seemed able to turn up squat about him. The guy had done a kick-butt job of covering his tracks. Disappearing into thin air.</p><p>Chase sat up, an idea sparking. Maybe that\u2019s what he should do. Screw it all and leave this place. Sure he would miss Madison, but it wasn\u2019t like the cops were letting him see her, anyway, since the misunderstanding at the Lodge. He\u2019d only been helping himself to some money from the cash drawer, his due for things like shoveling the walk and helping out with the kid.</p> <p>He swung his feet to the floor and opened his bedside table. There it was. His passport. He\u2019d heard about tons of jobs with the oil pipelines coming out of Alaska. He could use the rest of the money he\u2019d taken from the Lodge\u2014enough for a bus or train ticket.</p><p>Eighteen tomorrow, he could start a new life in Canada, just like that \u201cMr. Smith\u201d who\u2019d been smart enough to offload his excess baggage.</p><p>And if Emily was wise, she would stay the hell out of his way or she would find herself in Dee\u2019s shoes\u2014dumped for dead by the side of the road.</p><p>So close.</p><p>Squinting her eyes against the early morning sun, Dee could hardly believe her child had been so close all along. Less than an hour away according to the phone trace on the cell call that had gone through. Thank goodness Evan had left the phone turned on long enough for authorities to trace the location.</p><p>Amazing how little time it took these days, but then maybe Jacob\u2019s friend Spike really did know the \u201csuperspy\u201d tricks Crusty had credited him with. Her heart warmed whenever she thought about the outpouring of support from those men she barely knew, men who\u2019d dedicated all their time and energy into helping her find Evan.</p> <p>Now Jacob drove as fast as he could, given the crummy conditions on the rutted, icy back road. The police wanted her to go to the station and wait while they pursued the matter.</p><p>Not a chance would she sit around. She was closer to the target location than the police and her child had said he was sick. Nothing would keep her from finding him as quickly as possible. She gripped the EpiPen in her pocket and prayed Blane hadn\u2019t accidentally fed Evan anything with peanuts.</p><p>Dee was willing to meet authorities at the site\u2014if she could see Evan and reassure herself he was well. She had to be there the minute they found her son. How frightened he would be to ride in a cop car. As much as she respected the local police, she knew the hoops they had to jump through sometimes to stay within legal boundaries. And frankly she didn\u2019t trust that they would get their paperwork together before Blane had a chance to bolt away. She couldn\u2019t take that chance with Evan\u2019s life at stake.</p><p>Seconds whipped past with each jostle down the weathered road deeper into the forest north of Rockfish. Anticipation, tentative hope and more than a little fear spiraled inside her as they drove deeper into the cluster of icy firs. They hadn\u2019t seen a house in at least ten or more minutes.</p><p>Jacob slowed, turning off the engine to coast silently downhill as the seasonal road narrowed to nothing more than sludgy dirt.</p><p>Dee held up her hand. \u201cI know. Don\u2019t get my hopes up.\u201d As if she could actually control that. Still, she tried to be logical so Jacob wouldn\u2019t worry about her wigging out. \u201cIt was just a cell call and the phone turned off shortly after that. They could be gone now.\u201d</p><p>He simply nodded, his eyes on the road, keeping his silence.</p><p>Even as they coasted, engine soundless, every crunch of the tires over the irregular road overly loud. She knew intellectually their approach was stealthy. Still, she couldn\u2019t stop wincing at every little noise.</p> <p>When the clump of towering firs began to thin, he pressed the brakes and pulled out binoculars, scanning in the morning light filtering through the evergreen branches. She watched his expression for a hint....</p><p>His jaw flexed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the hope from her voice. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>He passed the binoculars to her. The casing still warm from his hands, she whipped them up to her eyes, pointed them where Jacob had looked last and found...</p><p>A blue truck with a camper attached to the back.</p><p>Someone was actually here, in the deserted area where a cell phone call had come through. Blane and Evan? The curtains were closed, so she had no way of knowing if anyone was inside, but still...</p><p>She prayed the camper didn\u2019t hold a group of hunters. \u201cI guess we have to wait for them to step out or for the police to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wise.\u201d He reached to squeeze her arm before taking back the binoculars. \u201cWe can still watch. If they are inside and he tries to leave with Evan, we can stop him.\u201d</p><p>The conviction in his voice left her with no doubts. Jacob would die before letting her son get away again.</p><p>Die?</p><p>For the first time she realized she\u2019d pulled him into a potentially lethal situation. Blane had already tried to kill her once, had tormented her with the lipstick incident. And she gave far more credence to those moments when she\u2019d felt someone was watching her. But she knew Jacob wouldn\u2019t turn away now. She also knew he wouldn\u2019t be going into this alone.</p><p>Hopefully neither of them would if the police showed up soon.</p><p>Jacob sat up straighter in his seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d She tugged at his arm. Damn it, why hadn\u2019t he brought two sets of binoculars?</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d He turned to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his shoulder. \u201cSit here? You\u2019ve got to be out of your mind. I\u2019ve had enough of sitting and waiting to last a lifetime. Two lifetimes even.\u201d She thought of how often her parents had made all the decisions, and later how Blane had pushed her into the life he wanted for her. She wouldn\u2019t be shoved aside to a passive role any longer. \u201cI will not lounge around while you play Rambo.\u201d</p><p>Jacob\u2019s mouth twitched in an almost grin.</p><p>Dee swatted his arm, frustration leaving her nerves tattered. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>His face smoothed into genuine concern. \u201cI know you are, but so am I. There\u2019s a man walking around, a guy wearing some kind of parka with a hood up, but he looks like your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the binoculars from his hands and peered through until she saw...the back of a man in heavy winter gear. His height was right, but she couldn\u2019t tell anything more unless he faced her, which, damn it all, he didn\u2019t do before disappearing behind the camper.</p><p>She dropped the binoculars to her lap. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>Jacob reached for his door. \u201cI\u2019ll try for a closer look, then.\u201d He turned back for the binoculars. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I promise. Lock the doors.\u201d</p><p>She realized she wouldn\u2019t be able to sway him. And Evan might not be there, in which case she was wasting valuable time arguing with Jacob.</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d Dee flipped up the collar of his coat and kissed him, hard.</p><p>All the shared passion of the night before linked her to him. She could have sworn his kiss held the same for those hungry five seconds until he broke away.</p><p>Before she could find the breath to speak, Jacob ducked out of the truck and strode away. His boot prints in the snow left lengthy-strided reminders of his strength.</p><p>How long would she have to wait? Long enough to go stir-crazy, no doubt. She eased her door open so she could listen better.</p><p>Wind whistled through the evergreens in gusts. Snow-laden branches swayed in a creaking dance overhead. The occasional icicle crackled, snapped, spiraled down to spike into the snow inches away from Jacob. He circled left, ducking around a fir. To her right, wind chimes tinkled on the breeze like a child\u2019s sweet laugh.</p><p>A child\u2019s laugh?</p><p>Dee held herself immobile and strained to listen, half certain her intense wishful thinking made her imagination play tricks on her. The high-pitched lilt sprinkled the air again. Definitely a wind chime. Was there someone singing along in time? Her hope burned so intensely she worried about trusting her own ears.</p><p>She tipped her head to the wind and listened.... Again, she heard a young voice singing along. A strong, healthy voice. Her breath caught in her chest. Did Jacob hear, too, even though the voice came from the opposite direction he\u2019d taken?</p><p>Dee\u2019s gaze skated left. Should she follow Jacob and tell him\u2014or track the voice herself before it faded away?</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have to wait for the answer. Blane wasn\u2019t going to defeat \u201cDee\u201d the way he had \u201cDeirdre.\u201d She had to be there for Jacob and Evan.</p><p>Jacob had helped her trust herself, to take an active role in going after what she wanted. Never again would she be the Deirdre who\u2019d run away from Blane so intensely she lost herself in the process.</p><p>Dee stepped from the truck. Her tennis shoes crunched against the hardpacked snow. She winced, as if Blane might hear and somehow know she\u2019d come for their child.</p><p>Quit being ridiculous.</p><p>Dee picked her way through the sinister beauty of the frozen branches. The tinkling notes lured her closer, chimes and something else. Like those late-night infant whimpers and whispers that only a mother heard, each elusive sound sent Dee\u2019s maternal instincts on full-scale alert.</p><p>Then she heard it. Precisely. Chimes followed by the unmistakable giggle of a child.</p><p>Her child. Every cell within her cried out for her baby, a voice she\u2019d recognized since hearing his first tiny wail.</p><p>Adrenaline pumped stinging heat through her as she wove past another fir. She ducked behind a towering trunk and listened. Again, Evan\u2019s laugh kissed the air. Dee pressed herself against the ice-slicked bark and peeked around.</p><p>Air whooshed from her lungs. Behind the camper where their binoculars couldn\u2019t have seen, Evan danced through the snow in his navy-blue snowsuit with energy and health to spare. Scooping up a fistful from a drift, he packed it into a ball and pitched it at the wind chimes abandoned on the branches of a twisted oak tree by some long-ago camper. He giggled as his aim proved true.</p><p>That laugh wrapped around her soul and squeezed. Love pounded through her with an intensity that rivaled labor contractions, along with a relief so intense she could hardly contain it all. Tears chased each other down her cheeks. Her arms ached with an emptiness she would soon fill.</p><p>Evan.</p><p>She almost bolted forward before she remembered the inherent danger. Where was Blane? And Jacob? Dee scanned the small clearing and found no one.</p><p>Adult-size boot prints left twisting paths, some older and half-filled with fresh snow. The deepest, most recent ones led to the cab of the vehicle. Through the window she saw...Blane was inside.</p><p>Cranking the engine.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be leaving Evan. No way. He must be warming the car, in which case, time had run out for them. God, where was Jacob? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This could be it, a sliver of time to regain her child. If she waited for Jacob, Blane might come retrieve Evan before they could stop him. He could step out at any second.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t afford to wait. Tears froze on her cheeks as she sprinted from behind the tree trunk\u2019s protective cover. Her heart slammed against her ribs with each pounding footstep. Only a few more yards and she would have him.</p><p>Evan turned. His laugh rose into a squeal. \u201cMommy!\u201d</p> <p>What a beautiful word, a name she feared she would never hear again. Her arms locked around him and held tight. The sweet smell of him filled her senses.</p><p>\u201cEvan!\u201d Her breath hitched on a sob, and she hugged tighter. \u201cI have you, baby. Mommy\u2019s got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed you, Mommy.\u201d His sweet words puffed clouds into the subfreezing air. \u201cYou was gone a long time, so I snuck Daddy\u2019s phone away and called you.\u201d</p><p>With a familiarity that broke Dee\u2019s heart all over again, Evan clutched a lock of her hair and nuzzled it to his face. So often as a baby he\u2019d done that very thing, like clasping a security blanket. How frightened and confused he must have been during his time away from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now and nothing\u2019s going to make me leave again.\u201d The sound of the revving engine sent shivers down her spine. Blane was so close. Enough of happy reunions. She needed to get Evan away, fast. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go for a ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Daddy?\u201d Evan glanced over his shoulder. He gripped her hair until she winced.</p><p>\u201cShh, sweetie,\u201d Dee whispered as she stumbled back toward the cluster of trees. Evan\u2019s extra weight threw her off balance. She forced herself to sacrifice speed for a more surefooted pace. The last thing she needed was to sprawl in the snow. \u201cIt\u2019s Mommy\u2019s turn to see you for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He smiled, innocently oblivious to the trauma all around him. \u201cI was sick from the candy bar but Daddy gave me a sticky pin.\u201d</p><p>Thank God Blane had remembered about the extra Epis she always kept around Evan. \u201cGood, that\u2019s great. But I need you to be very quiet. We can talk all you want once we get to the truck.\u201d</p><p>Hugging her son closer, she started back toward where she\u2019d come. If she could just make it back out of the clearing, she would have cover. Where was Jacob? Taking on life solo stunk. She could have used his clear-thinking steadiness.</p><p>And suddenly, there he was, tall, strong, dependable. Only a few yards away with his back to her he darted around a thick evergreen. Did she dare call out to him and risk alerting Blane? What choice did she have? She would have to take the chance.</p> <p>\u201cJacob!\u201d she called, gasping, stumbling as her feet hooked on a root. She twisted to protect Evan as she tumbled into the snow.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d Jacob shouted as he broke through the trees, one arm outstretched. The dread on his face broadcast far greater concerns than a simple fall in the snow.</p><p>\u201cDeirdre,\u201d a chilling voice echoed from behind her.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Ten yards too far away to help, Jacob watched Dee tumble to the snow with her son clutched to her. A medium-build, blond man who matched Lambert\u2019s mug shot with eerie accuracy approached her, gun in hand.</p><p>Jacob felt as if his brain had been cleaved in two. One part of him assessed the situation with a calm of old. The other part urged him to fling himself on top of Dee and her child, shield them from the evil only three steps away. Why the hell had she left the truck?</p><p>\u201cDeirdre,\u201d the man beside her called, each step toward her a menacing promise. He kept his eyes fixed on Jacob, his gun trained on Dee.</p><p>Her body jerked as if she\u2019d been slapped. Dee\u2019s face tightened and she squeezed her eyes shut as Evan whimpered in her arms.</p> <p>\u201cBlane.\u201d The whispered name carried a wealth of disillusionment. She curved her body protectively around a strong-limbed preschooler to keep him from seeing the gun.</p><p>Jacob absorbed the waves of pain radiating from her as if they were his own. And they were. He\u2019d brought her here, to this. He\u2019d promised to find her son and keep them safe.</p><p>Frustration and rage both slammed into him. And love. Hell, yeah, love.</p><p>He loved her so damned much his chest hurt with each icy breath. No more dodging the truth. What a time to figure it out.</p><p>Evan tipped up his face and thrust out his bottom lip. \u201cHurted my nose when we tripped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetie.\u201d She clutched him tighter, pressing his face against her chest as if to comfort while keeping his eyes shielded from the horror unfolding. \u201cWe\u2019ll wash the scratch very soon.\u201d</p><p>Lambert closed in on Dee. \u201cWell, my dear, imagine seeing you here, and with such a hulking companion. I thought you\u2019d died out on that road, but you certainly landed on your feet\u2014\u201d he paused, gesturing with his gun to her crumpled in the snow \u201c\u2014figuratively speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very much alive,\u201d Dee answered through gritted teeth and poorly disguised fury. \u201cUnlike that man in your Suburban in the river.\u201d</p><p>Blane shrugged. \u201cSkidding away from you, I blew out my tires. I needed another ride that would be able to pull the trailer I\u2019d already arranged to pick up. So I pulled over and pretended my car had broken down until the perfect Good Samaritan stopped by\u2014one with a big truck.\u201d</p><p>The implication slapped over Jacob in an icy splash. Lambert had left Dee for dead, then hadn\u2019t hesitated to kill a total stranger just to steal his vehicle. The bastard was pure evil.</p><p>Then Jacob\u2019s brain snagged on an earlier part of the man\u2019s diatribe. Lambert had thought Dee died, too. But he had to know she was alive if he\u2019d been stalking her at the Lodge. It didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Regardless, Jacob had to get the man the hell away from Dee and Evan. \u201cLambert, you want to deal with me. We don\u2019t want to risk the kid getting in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He waggled the gun in his gloved hand. \u201cWho says I\u2019m going to shoot anyone? I just keep this around for protection against intruders. Right, Evan my boy?\u201d His face creased with a wry smile. \u201cAlthough a target as big as that fellow wouldn\u2019t be tough to hit if I wanted practice.\u201d</p><p>Jacob hoped Lambert would take a potshot at him, because then the gun would be away from Dee and Evan. If he could be certain the shot wouldn\u2019t be deadly and leave Dee without protection, he would rile Lambert into shooting now. \u201cGo ahead then. You must have been itching to do this all those times you lurked around my place.\u201d</p><p>Lambert scowled. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? The last thing I wanted was to see her again.\u201d</p><p>Jacob searched for words to stall the man until the police could arrive. \u201cThen why not leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd live like some two-bit car thief on the lam? I hardly think so.\u201d He gripped Dee\u2019s arm and yanked her to her feet none too gently. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for my new ID to come through. I\u2019d already started the process to get out of the country, but then Dee screwed up the timetable by digging through my old files. I just needed another couple of weeks to finish the transition of my assets into a shelf corporation so I would be free to travel under my new identity.\u201d</p><p>A \u201cshelf corporation.\u201d Jacob narrowed his eyes with understanding. He\u2019d heard of that. An old corporation with no activity was allowed to linger \u201con the shelf\u201d until someone wanted to buy into it, usually to give age to a new business. Some had begun opting in to create a new holding for assets.</p><p>A crafty way to shield an old identity.</p><p>Lambert would have been able to conduct all transactions under the banner of his new company, his name never coming under the radar. He could have gotten clean away, losing himself in another country.</p><p>The possibilities shifted around in his mind. If the guy\u2019s explanation could be trusted, then who had followed them into Tacoma, and who tormented Dee that night at the hotel?</p><p>He\u2019d been so sure when he\u2019d seen the Suburban following them...One like the silver vehicle Chase\u2019s parents owned.</p><p>Hell. The realization exploded in his head. He had to trust that Emily would be safe with Grace\u2019s family because he didn\u2019t have the luxury of placing a timely call at the moment.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Dee reached up, her palm poised as an ineffective plug for the gun. Her eyes darted frantically between them. \u201cJacob, take Evan.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was she up to? He only knew he wanted her away from the barrel of that weapon. She really couldn\u2019t expect the man would let Jacob leave with the boy.</p><p>Jacob glanced at Evan. The sweet-faced kid had snuggled against Dee\u2019s breast. A sight so damned beautiful, Jacob struggled for air. Beautiful\u2014except for the fact the kid was trembling, his confused eyes darting back and forth between his parents.</p><p>Dee inched away from Lambert and carried Evan toward Jacob\u2014without a protest from Lambert. Why wasn\u2019t the guy stopping her?</p><p>Suddenly Jacob understood. Lambert honestly didn\u2019t want to frighten his kid. He didn\u2019t want his child seeing him shoot the boy\u2019s mother. This psychopath did love his son in a warped sort of way, and Dee had bargained on that to buy them time.</p><p>How long would it keep Dee safe? Only as long as she had Evan in her arms. The way the kid clung to his mother\u2019s neck, it didn\u2019t appear that he would let go anyway.</p><p>Jacob had to predict Lambert\u2019s next move, or he\u2019d be left flatfooted and Dee could die. The fog of rage threatened to swallow him.</p><p>Concentrate. At least Lambert seemed content to keep up appearances for Evan and pay lip service to civility.</p><p>Where were the police? Spike had been leaving from the base, which meant he could be as much as forty-five minutes behind.</p><p>Jacob backed away from Lambert, his eyes never leaving Dee.</p><p>Dee pressed a kiss to her son\u2019s cheek. \u201cI love you, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, Mommy.\u201d His smile spread from ear to ear.</p><p>Dee\u2019s eyes met Jacob\u2019s and held. In the warm chocolate depths he saw trust and, God yes, love. Both directed at him at a time he couldn\u2019t afford to soak up the amazing beauty of the moment.</p><p>Then he saw a firm resolution that chilled him clean through. He could see she planned to\u2014</p><p>Shove Evan toward Jacob with a twist of her body that placed her back completely to Lambert. She flung herself backward. Toward her ex-husband.</p><p>Directly in the path of his gun.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jacob shouted even as he wrapped his shoulders around her son, covered his face.</p><p>The gun exploded. Dee\u2019s body jerked, her eyes wide. Blood staining her coat collar, she crumpled to the ground.</p><p>A roar of denial rolled through him. Jacob thrust Evan behind him and launched himself onto Lambert, throwing all the fury inside him into the charge. They stumbled backward, boots stamping for purchase on the packed ice. He rammed the bastard\u2019s arm against the camper with a satisfying snap. The gun dropped into the snow a second before Jacob downed Lambert. Their bodies slammed into a frozen snowdrift. It hurt. Not enough.</p><p>Lambert landed a gut punch with his uninjured fist and Jacob welcomed the reverberating pain that narrowed his focus. He steadied his vision. \u201cThis is for Dee, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He plowed his fist into Lambert\u2019s face. Twice. Lambert\u2019s eyes rolled back into his head as he sagged into unconsciousness.</p><p>Jacob held his fist aloft and resisted the urge to beat Lambert into a pulp. His rage demanded more than justice. He wanted revenge for Dee.</p><p>Dee. Reason pushed its way through the haze of fury.</p><p>He had to check her, get her to a doctor, but he couldn\u2019t risk Lambert coming to. Wasting a critical minute, Jacob hefted the man up and tossed him in the back of the camper. He jammed a branch across the back to lock him in.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d Jacob shouted, racing to where she lay in the snow, Evan kneeling beside her, patting her face, crying, shell-shocked.</p><p>Jacob\u2019s hands skimmed her body. Where was the gunshot wound? His fingers settled on her neck. He found a pulse. Faint, thready, but beating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Air gushed from his lungs.</p><p>Carefully, he opened her coat and found blood staining her sweater along her collarbone. He heard a crunch of snow behind him and stiffened, ready to go on the attack\u2014only to see Evan eyeing him warily.</p><p>Jacob forced his face to smooth. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m a friend of your mom\u2019s, and I\u2019m going to take good care of her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMommy? Mommy, wake up.\u201d Evan\u2019s voice shook.</p><p>No time to check the damage, he scooped her in his arms. \u201cYour mommy\u2019s going to be fine, kiddo. Come on with me and we\u2019ll take her to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Evan stared up at him with watery eyes. \u201cWhat about my daddy?\u201d His chin quivered. \u201cHe shot my mommy.\u201d</p><p>Jacob had tried his best to shield the boy. No child should have to see that. \u201cYour father is resting inside.\u201d Of course the kid had no reason to trust him, a stranger. Jacob searched for the right words. \u201cRemember how your mom wanted you to go with me? You need to do this for her.\u201d</p><p>He would carry them both if he had to, but he hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that.</p> <p>Evan\u2019s face cleared and he nodded, casting a frightened glance back at the camper. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s Mommy\u2019s turn to have me for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood job, kiddo.\u201d Jacob grabbed the keys from Lambert\u2019s truck, just in case, and charged back into the woods with Dee cradled to his chest. He could get her to a hospital faster than any ambulance would find them out here.</p><p>He\u2019d heard about domestic violence cases going wrong, but never had he expected to be in the middle of such a horror. His boots pounded through the snow, his pace slowed because of the child huffing alongside him. Dee\u2019s child. He would keep Evan safe for her.</p><p>And Emily. God, he couldn\u2019t wrap his brain around the notion that Chase had been so unbalanced, following Dee around, making threats. This could have been his sister and her child out here.</p><p>Hell, it could be his sister now.</p><p>Jacob neared the truck just as the police pulled up along with a Land Rover he recognized as belonging to Spike. Help had arrived. The police would take care of Lambert, and Jacob would make damn sure to tip off Spike about Chase so Emily and Madison would have protection ASAP.</p> <p>Thank God with a blaring siren, one of the cops could get Dee to the hospital faster and he intended to be by her side the whole ride there, never letting her or her son out of his sight.</p><p>As he held her unconscious body in his arms, he just prayed it would be soon enough.</p><p>Dee grappled through layers of consciousness. No cottony amnesia fog for her. This felt more like digging through dirt to reach the surface of the life she desperately wanted to reclaim.</p><p>Could anyone sleep this deeply and ever awaken? How much easier it would be to stop struggling through the fog and\u2014ouch. The pain socked her out of left field.</p><p>Only she couldn\u2019t stay asleep to hide from the ache. Her mind wrapped around her reasons for living, compelling reasons.</p><p>Jacob and Evan.</p><p>She battled, and pushed and fought her way back until a pinpoint of light beckoned. Prying her eyes open, she winced at the brightness and squeezed her lids shut again. Slowly, she eased them open, letting her pupils adjust to the rays streaming in through her half-open blinds.</p><p>Where was she? Panic slashed at her as she groped for answers. The antiseptic scent filled her nose. She looked around at what appeared to be a hospital room, searching for something, anything familiar.</p> <p>Her gaze rested on a chair tucked in the corner of the room. A large hulk of a man sat cradling a small, sleeping boy in his arms.</p><p>Dee\u2019s world came sharply into focus. She remembered everything. Blane hadn\u2019t won. She recognized Jacob and Evan, two precious faces she would never forget.</p><p>Blane\u2019s attack, his threats, all came jumbled back with nauseating force. Dee studied every inch of Jacob, and he seemed unharmed. A sigh shuddered through her.</p><p>Jacob\u2019s eyes were closed. His head was tipped back against the reclining chair. Evan slept curled in his lap, chocolate ice cream staining the sides of her son\u2019s mouth. Jacob had obviously discovered the way to Evan\u2019s heart quickly.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d done with hers.</p><p>She absorbed the image of them both and let the love fill her. Her still-slumberous mind wandered dreamy paths and she envisioned them as a family. The two looked nothing alike, Jacob so dark and angular, Evan so fair with a rounded face. Chances were Evan would never be as tall as Jacob.</p><p>No one would ever mistake Evan for Jacob\u2019s biological son. But with Jacob\u2019s influence, Evan would resemble Jacob in all the ways that counted.</p><p>She\u2019d found so much beneath that brooding exterior. He\u2019d shown her honor, constancy and a fierce protective love she hoped to claim.</p><p>Jacob shuffled, woke and stared back at her for seconds that seemed to stretch into forever before he spoke. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please. Give me a moment before the hospital frenzy takes over.\u201d Evan stirred, and she lowered her voice. She wasn\u2019t ready to share Jacob and Evan with the world, not yet. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He stood slowly, his big hands carrying her son with gentle strength. \u201cYou were shot in the shoulder, but the bullet passed through without hitting anything vital.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d meant what happened with Blane, to Jacob to make him look so haggard, but now she realized those shadows under his eyes were for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she reassured even though she actually felt more than a little weak and breathless. But alive. They were all alive. So she asked again, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlane is in custody.\u201d</p><p>She searched his eyes for details of how that must have happened, what had occurred after the shooting, and saw only a fierce protectiveness in Jacob\u2019s expression. She knew. He\u2019d been there for her, for her son and for their future because here he stood vital and alive.</p><p>More details from the showdown spilled through her mind, of how Blane hadn\u2019t been the one stalking her. \u201cWhat about Emily?\u201d She struggled to sit up, her heart pounding. \u201cPlease say they have taken Chase back in for questioning.\u201d</p><p>Jacob nodded reassuringly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Take it easy. I was able to tip off Spike when he showed up a few minutes after you were shot. He took care of sending police over to Grace\u2019s right away. Chase is at the station now. Emily and Madison are fine. A little shaken up, but okay.\u201d</p><p>She sagged back on her pillow, relieved, somewhat drained, but mostly happy. It felt good to smile. To hope. She reached out her hand, twisting it free of the tangle of the IV to touch Jacob\u2019s arm. He held her sleeping son against his chest, Evan\u2019s arms draped over the broad shoulders as he tucked his face into Jacob\u2019s neck.</p><p>A sight she could enjoy forever. She skimmed from Jacob to her son and traced each tiny feature she\u2019d feared never seeing again. The feel of baby-soft skin soothed her ragged nerves and a few of her fears. It would be a while yet before she could let him out of her sight.</p><p>Apparently Jacob had known that. Children in hospital rooms were usually a taboo. He must have executed some major arm-twisting for her to see Evan when she woke. \u201cThank you for having him here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>A tap sounded on the door. Apparently their time alone would be cut short after all.</p><p>Emily peered around the door. \u201cDee? God, I can\u2019t believe...Wow, you\u2019re already awake.\u201d The teenager rushed to her side. \u201cYou\u2019re really awake. The nurse said...\u201d</p><p>Jacob circled around to stand by his sister, more of that protectiveness radiating from him. \u201cI haven\u2019t pressed the call button yet.\u201d</p><p>Emily flipped her ponytail over her shoulder, shifting from foot to foot. \u201cI won\u2019t stay long. Grace has Madison and she\u2019s really kind of a handful today, so I need to get back to her. I just had to see you.\u201d Her gaze slid up to her brother. \u201cAnd you, too.\u201d</p><p>A corner of his mouth tipped. \u201cYou\u2019re speaking to me now, are you?\u201d</p><p>She clutched the bedrail in a white-knuckled grip. \u201cThe police are talking to Chase again. He showed up at Grace\u2019s house and the cops were only a minute behind him.\u201d Guilt, frustration\u2014pain\u2014all mingled in her blue eyes the same color as Jacob\u2019s. \u201cI heard him admit to stalking you, Dee.\u201d</p><p>Jacob secured Evan against his shoulder, his eyebrows pinching in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this had to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Emily picked at Dee\u2019s hospital blanket. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, isn\u2019t it? Loving somebody only to find out he isn\u2019t who you thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Dee covered the girl\u2019s hand with her own. \u201cYes, sweetie, it is.\u201d</p><p>Emily allowed the comfort long enough for a nurse\u2019s cart to rattle past before a half smile reached her lips if not her eyes just yet. \u201cYour kid\u2019s really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s yours.\u201d Dee ached from more than the gunshot wound as she thought of that little baby without a reliable father.</p><p>Emily\u2019s smile faltered. \u201cThis mother thing is tough to do alone.\u201d</p><p>Dee nodded and waited for Jacob to speak up, willed him to step in and be the kind of brother, support, family Emily needed. He needed them, too, even if he didn\u2019t realize it yet.</p><p>She stared between the two stubborn siblings....</p><p>Jacob cleared his throat, his stance still assertive, pushy even, but his eyes gentle. \u201cI can get a transfer to Tacoma, but it wouldn\u2019t come through until the summer. You know the courts aren\u2019t going to let you live alone, but I want you to have choices. I can pay Grace to stay with you until I move here, or you can come with me to Charleston. I have friends there who would help out while I\u2019m TDY.\u201d</p><p>Dee wanted to be a part of the picture, but knew it was too soon to have those sorts of expectations from a man she\u2019d known all of a couple of weeks.</p><p>A man she\u2019d already grown to love more than she\u2019d realized was possible. But a love formed with wide-open eyes and a wiser heart this go-round.</p><p>Emily braced her shoulders, her chin high, and for the first time, Dee could see the family resemblance in these two strong-willed siblings.</p><p>The teen tossed her head, her ponytail swishing with its red stripe of defiance glinting. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me around here anymore. If you really don\u2019t mind having us, Madison and I will go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Good.\u201d Jacob secured Evan with one arm and reached to pull Emily to him with the other.</p><p>Dee heard a couple of whispered words go back and forth that sounded a lot like \u201clove you, kiddo\u201d and \u201clove you, too\u201d before Emily pulled back with overly bright eyes to match her grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two\u2014or three\u2014alone.\u201d Emily smoothed a hand over Evan\u2019s head before backing away. \u201cDefinitely a cute kid.\u201d</p><p>The door swished closed behind her.</p><p>Dee pressed a kiss to her hand then her fingers to Evan\u2019s forehead. She wanted to hold him. If only she weren\u2019t so unsteady. She needed to gather him up and rock him as she\u2019d done so many times before.</p><p>Thanks to Jacob, she would have that chance. \u201cYou could set him on the recliner and let him sleep while we talk. I need to hear more about what happened, starting with Chase.\u201d</p><p>Jacob lowered Evan back to the recliner, then returned to Dee\u2019s bedside.</p><p>She pushed herself up to her elbows and raised the bed. Jacob stuffed his hands in his jean pockets, looking so tall and strong. If only he would reach down and take her hand.</p><p>\u201cSpike and the cops showed up right after the shooting. As I said, I tipped off Spike about Chase as we were loading you into the police cruiser to come to the hospital. Lambert is in custody. With kidnapping and assault charges pending\u2014not to mention investigating the murder of the man in the river\u2014Lambert won\u2019t be out anytime soon. They\u2019ll have plenty of time to make a solid case about his role in defrauding the airplane manufacturers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t the way she\u2019d ever envisioned her marriage ending, but at least she and Evan were safe. Thanks to Jacob.</p><p>She scoured Jacob for signs of injury. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>His hand fell to rest on her shoulder, warm and heavy. \u201cJust a couple of bruised ribs.\u201d He waved aside her concern. \u201cI thought there was no way we could all walk out alive. But together, we pulled it off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me.\u201d He lowered the bedrail and sat beside her.</p><p>Her pride be damned, she had to know how he felt, where she fit into all of his plans with moving and Emily. \u201cI love you, Jacob. I know it\u2019s only been a couple of weeks, but I\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger to her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain it to me. I understand. Sure, we\u2019ve only known each other a short while. But for me, it\u2019s more than long enough to be sure I love you, too. I want to be with you and take the time to show you just how much.\u201d His eyes narrowed with intensity. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stuff away my feelings until they freeze up like my old man\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She curved her hand to his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like your father. You\u2019re the most giving man I\u2019ve ever met. If anything, I wish you would let me do more for you, let me know what you need.\u201d</p> <p>Jacob\u2019s face tightened as if the next words pained him. \u201cI need you. I need your stubborn, sometimes bossy, grab-life attitude. Military relationships are tough, with long separations, the stress of dangerous deployments\u2014\u201d</p><p>This time she pressed a finger to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve been through the toughest situation possible. I believe I can handle anything as long as we\u2019re in it together, partners.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved under her touch. \u201cThat\u2019s a promise I can easily keep.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her face to his. Their lips met, and she felt the love, a total giving and acceptance of self flow between them.</p><p>Passion was easy, an emotion that carried them away. The tender give-and-take of their kiss, however, was a hard-won gift, one she would never take for granted.</p><p>He cupped her face in one hand. \u201cSo you and Evan will come to Charleston with me until I get a transfer back here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharleston or Tacoma, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as we\u2019re all together.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out her tarnished gold necklace. The D glinted in the fluorescent lighting of the hospital room. \u201cThe nurse gave me this when they checked you in.\u201d</p><p>Jacob leaned forward, slid it around her neck. \u201cLean forward and I\u2019ll hook it for you, Deirdre.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the necklace and read the letter. \u201c\u2018Dee.\u2019 I\u2019m Dee. This time I know who I am.\u201d</p><p>His smile grazed across her lips with the promise of a future full of love, children and sunsets. A future full of memories just waiting to be minted. </p> </body></html>"]
