Everywhere. It was every where. On the bedcoverings. On the floor. On the table. On his hands. His arms.</p><p>The taste...still in his mouth. Rich, hot, full.</p><p>He swallowed the last vestiges on his tongue. Ambrosia.</p><p>He blinked, trying to focus, but his head pounded. When he tried to lift himself up, his sore muscles protested. Yet, life shimmered through him. His skin prickled, alive. Dimitri tried to breathe, but every breath he took in was laden with the scent. Bloodscent.</p><p>And then he remembered.</p> <p>He remembered how it had happened.</p><p>Horror seized him.</p><p>And only then did he look over at the bundle of blankets and clothing, the lifeless form in a triangle of sunlight on the floor. One pale, plump arm hung out, marked and torn. Blood seeped everywhere: through thick quilts and the heavy layers of her dress. The mass of graying hair, loose and streaked with blood.</p><p>No. No. He held his temples, closed his eyes.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>And even as he sat there in a room half shadowed and half blazing with sun, Dimitri was filled with loathing and hatred.</p> <p>No more.</p><p>I don\u2019t want this. I want out.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear me, Lucifer?\u201d he said, his voice hoarse and broken. \u201cI want out of this. Release me.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Naturally.</p><p>For like all angels, fallen or no, Lucifer\u2019s preferred method of communication was via dreams. In the deepest of night.</p><p>When one was the most vulnerable. The most suggestible.</p><p>The most easily lured and tricked.</p> <p>\u201cRelease me, you damned bastard!\u201d</p><p>But Dimitri already knew there was no way out. He\u2019d already attempted it, tried to break the covenant in the last year since he\u2019d left Vienna. He\u2019d already denied himself what Lucifer had recreated him to need, twenty-five years ago: blood. Rich, warm, lifegiving.</p><p>The devil\u2019s Mark, depicting the insidious crack in his soul, was imprinted on his back and would never leave him. Thus it had been, for two decades.</p><p>And his attempt at self-denial, his attempt to thwart the devil and to break free?</p><p>The result was on the floor, a horrifying mess of limbs and tendons and mutilated flesh, destroyed. Dead.</p><p>Murdered.</p><p>Dimitri pinched the bridge of his nose, hard, a black ball of anger swelling inside him. His eyes stung.</p><p>Damn it all...he\u2019d tried.</p><p>He\u2019d left Vienna after the fire, left a world of opulence and hedonism that he\u2019d never truly enjoyed, and refused it all. A year ago.</p><p>For a year, he refused to feed, to drink from anyone. He\u2019d die first, damned or no. Surely if a vampire didn\u2019t drink of the lifeblood, he\u2019d grow weak and die. He\u2019d force Lucifer to release him.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t worked at all, and it was his very weakness that had caused this tragedy.</p><p>For when the old woman had found him, near death, weak after a year without sustenance, he\u2019d been naught but a loose-limbed mass of bone and flesh. Ready to leave the life he\u2019d been tricked into, back when he\u2019d saved Meg twenty years ago. When he\u2019d given up everything for her.</p><p>The old woman found him here, and tried to help him\u2014for she couldn\u2019t have known. She was an innocent. She induced him to drink ale and broth, neither of which could save him.</p><p>And Dimitri: all through the night and into the day, day after day, he watched those solid blue veins. He lusted for the curve of her plump neck. He had to close his eyes to keep from taking what every humor in his body demanded.</p><p>And he was in control, despite the burning pain from Lucifer\u2019s Mark\u2014the agony that bespoke of the devil\u2019s displeasure with Dimitri. He resisted. He fought it.</p><p>Nothing was stronger than his resolve. Not even the devil.</p><p>Until she nicked her finger with a knife.</p><p>And he smelled the blood.</p><p>1</p><p>WHEREIN LORD CORVINDALE IS REDUCED TO ANALYZING HANDWRITING</p><p>One hundred thirteen years later</p><p>London</p><p>Who in Lucifer\u2019s bloody hell did Miss Maia Woodmore think she was, giving orders to an earl?</p><p>Dimitri, the Earl of Corvindale, glared down at the elegant script covering a piece of thick stationery. Feminine, perfectly formed, with only the occasional embellishment and not one ink splotch, the words marched across the page in ruler-straight lines. Even the descenders and ascenders were neat and properly aligned so that none of them over lapped. The stationery smelled like feminine spice and lily of the valley and some other intriguing note that he refused to expend the effort to define.</p><p>Naturally her demand was couched in the most proper of syntax, but Dimitri was obviously no innocent when it came to female machinations. Though he strictly avoided women\u2014all of them, especially the mortal ones\u2014he was well-schooled in the way they worked and in reading between the lines, so to speak.</p><p>And from what he read between the lines here, Miss Maia Woodmore was annoyed and filled with indignant self-righteousness, just as she had been during that incident in Haymarket three years ago. And she expected him to jump to her whim.</p><p>Lord Corvindale, it read, forgive me for contacting you in this untoward manner, but it is only upon the specific direction of my brother, Mr. Charles Woodmore, that I am doing so. (Here he could fairly feel her outrage at being ordered thus by her sibling.)</p><p>Mr. Woodmore (who I understand is a business associate of your lordship\u2019s) left word that, should I not receive correspondence or communication from him within a fortnight after leaving on his most recent trip to the Continent (which would be by yesterday\u2019s date, 18 July, 1804) that I must contact you in regards to the wardship of myself and my two sisters, Angelica and Sonia (the latter of whom is safely ensconced at St. Bridie\u2019s Convent School in Scotland).</p><p>Dimitri paused in this, his third perusal of the letter, to blink and frown at the precise, if not overlong, sentence. And then he went on to roundly curse Chas Woodmore for somehow convincing him to agree to this madness. It had been more than six years ago that Woodmore had culled such a vow from Dimitri, who\u2019d hardly given it another thought since.</p><p>Naturally he never expected Woodmore to do anything as imbecilic as he\u2019d done, running off with Narcise Moldavi instead of killing her brother, which was what he\u2019d gone to Paris to do. Narcise\u2019s brother, Cezar, one must assume, would be livid.</p><p>But at least Woodmore had made arrangements for the safety of his own sisters, in the event Cezar Moldavi realized who was behind his sister\u2019s abduction\u2014or perhaps it was an elopement, not an abduction. He would have no compunction about taking out his ire on three innocent young women.</p><p>Cezar certainly hadn\u2019t changed since Vienna. If anything, he\u2019d become even more obsessed with power and control.</p><p>Dimitri returned to the letter, trying not to acknowledge the exotic perfume that permeated the paper. One of the many curses of being Dracule was his extraordinary sense of smell. Not terribly pleasant, when out and about on the streets of London, and even less so when trying to avoid scenting something he wished to ignore. Reluctantly he read on.</p><p>My brother impressed upon me the seriousness of this manner, and it is only because of his specific and unrelenting urgency that I dare send this letter.</p><p>I wish to assure you, Lord Corvindale, that the only reason I am contacting you is because of my brother\u2019s express wishes. There is truly no need for you to concern yourself with the guardianship of myself and my sisters, for Chas has often been away on business trips and we have fared just as well during his previous absences with the chaperonage of our cousin and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Fernfeather.</p><p>He recalled that, based upon his single previous interaction with her, Miss Maia Woodmore was also this long-winded in person.</p><p>In addition, my upcoming wedding to Mr. Alexander Bradington will shortly put me in the position to act as chaperone for my younger sisters.</p><p>Dimitri realized he was crinkling the paper and he reminded himself that the written word, regardless of from whom it came, what language it was in, and what message it bore, was precious. Yes, he\u2019d seen the engagement announcement in the Times some months ago. The news had been welcome to those who followed that sort of on dit\u2014which certainly didn\u2019t include the reclusive Earl of Corvindale.</p><p>At that time (Miss Woodmore\u2019s perfect hand continued in its no-nonsense manner) your services as guardian to my sisters and myself will no longer be necessary.</p><p>In fact, (here her penmanship became the slightest bit thicker and perhaps even more precise) I see no reason for you to bestir yourself in regards to my sisters and myself at all, Lord Corvindale. Despite my brother\u2019s concern, which I can\u2019t help but believe is overly cautious and more than a bit exaggerated, Angelica and I shall fare perfectly well in London on our own until Chas returns.</p><p>I look forward to receiving a response at your earliest convenience.</p><p>Which meant, Dimitri knew, immediately upon receipt of the letter. Miss Woodmore was thus doomed to disappointment, for the message had arrived early this morning, when he was still asleep at his desk. Not that he would have jumped to respond to her anyway.</p><p>She signed her name simply, Maia Woodmore.</p><p>And there, for the first time, was a bit of feminine embellishment, just on the lower curve of the M and on the upper swoop of the W.</p><p>Unfortunately for Miss Maia Woodmore, Dimitri had already been...what was the word? Bestirred.</p><p>Indeed, he\u2019d been more than merely bestirred relative to their guardianship. And, he snarled to himself, it was only going to get worse. He was going to have to bring the chits into this very household if he meant to keep them safe from Moldavi and his private army of vampire goons. Damn Chas Woodmore\u2019s mortal arse.</p><p>Dimitri happened to know that Moldavi was in Paris with his nose permanently inserted in the crack of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s arse\u2014or perhaps this fortnight he was licking the new emperor\u2019s bollocks\u2014and it would take him some time to send his men after Woodmore and his sisters. But not very much time, despite the war between their two countries.</p><p>Which meant that Dimitri must move quickly.</p><p>He looked around his study, swathed in heavy curtains to keep out the sun. Books and papers were piled everywhere and shelves lined the walls, crammed full with even more tomes and manuscripts. An utter mess, Mrs. Hunburgh claimed, but she wasn\u2019t allowed into the chamber at all except for a weekly dust and sweep. No one else was allowed in but for the occasional visit by Dimitri\u2019s butler or valet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And blast it, he\u2019d intended to visit the antiquarian bookstore next to Lenning\u2019s Tannery again today. He meant to ask the blonde woman, who dressed as if she were a thirteenth century chatelaine instead of a shopkeeper, about references\u2014scrolls, papyruses, whatever\u2014from Egypt in particular. He cursed under his breath. Now he wouldn\u2019t have the chance.</p><p>Napoleon Bonaparte had brought chests and crates of antiquities back from his travels through and conquest of Egypt, and the objects were being sold and distributed throughout Europe. Surely there was something in the ancient world of pharaohs and sun gods that would help Dimitri banish the demon of darkness who\u2019d lured him into an unholy contract decades ago. Even though Vlad Tepes, the Count Dracula, had made his agreement with Lucifer in the fifteenth century, Dimitri suspected that his ancestor hadn\u2019t been the first mortal to sell his soul\u2014and that of his progeny\u2014to the devil. The legend of Johann Faust had become popular after Vlad\u2019s agreement, but there had to have been others since the beginning of time. He\u2019d studied manuscripts and writings of the Greeks and Romans, even some from Aramea and other parts of the Holy Land.</p><p>Perhaps there would be something he could glean from the Egyptian antiquities and hieroglyphs that would give him direction. Not that anyone had been able to break the code of the Egyptian alphabet yet, but Dimitri was determined to try his hand at it.</p> <p>After all, he had forever to do it.</p><p>And now the stele that had been found in Rosetta several years ago by the French, and was currently in the possession of the Antiquarian Society here in London, looked promising for translating the hieroglyphs. Thus, Dimitri was hopeful. He would love to get his hands on the stone himself, but that would mean having to be around people and playing politics and listening to gossip and jests and having to avoid the sun in public company...and all sorts of things he\u2019d much rather avoid.</p><p>He\u2019d considered stealing\u2014rather, borrowing the so-called Rosetta Stone for a time in order to work on it himself, but in the end decided against it. Perhaps he might break into the British Museum, where it was kept, and make a rubbing of it one night\u2014if he didn\u2019t have to spend his bloody time accompanying debutantes to masques and balls. His jaw hurt where his teeth ground together.</p><p>There was no way around it.</p><p>The two elder Woodmore sisters would soon be overrunning his solitude, upsetting his household and interrupting his studies. And, blast it all, so would Dimitri\u2019s own so-called sibling, Mirabella\u2014for naturally, he\u2019d have to bring her into Town, as well. He\u2019d adopted the foundling as his sister some years ago\u2014and he supposed he\u2019d put off her debut as long as he could. The very thought of three debutantes in his house made him grind his teeth sourly.</p> <p>All of them would be disrupting his schedule and nattering on about parties and fetes and balls and whatever else they did. Squealing, laughing, atomizing perfume and spilling powder\u2014and Luce\u2019s dark soul, Dimitri would have to ensure no one had any rubies with them.</p><p>Bloody black hell.</p><p>But Dimitri knew that the worst of it was going to be the very proper, very demanding presence of Miss Maia Woodmore.</p><p>Here. In this house. Under his very nose.</p><p>If Chas Woodmore was still alive when they found him, Dimitri was going to kill the bastard.</p><p>Maia Woodmore was fuming\u2014which was something she rarely lowered herself to do.</p> <p>In fact, unlike her younger sister Angelica, Maia had forced herself to become a paragon of poise and containment and propriety. Except, it seemed, in the case of contrary, arrogant, annoying earls named Corvindale.</p><p>It was as if all of the men in her life\u2014whether she wanted them there or not\u2014had decided to go off all shilly-shally and leave her to pick up the pieces and manage their leftovers. A task she was, thankfully, more than capable of doing, regardless of whether she wanted to or not. After all, it seemed as if she\u2019d always been in charge, forever trying to make things right, trying to keep her younger sisters safe, well loved and well cared for.</p><p>At least, since their parents died.</p><p>Included in Maia\u2019s mental tirade, along with Corvindale, was her elder brother Chas, who was always haring off somewhere and leaving her to manage things\u2014not an easy task when one was an untitled, unmarried, somewhat-rich young woman of the ton. It was his great fortune that she was not only up to the task, but efficient and capable of doing so.</p><p>And also included in her annoyance was her fianc\u00e9, Alexander Bradington, who\u2019d proposed on her eighteenth birthday, and then went off on a trip to the Continent three months later. He\u2019d been gone for eighteen months.</p><p>But the Earl of Corvindale was the absolute worst of the bunch.</p><p>Alexander had been engaged in Rome and Vienna for the past several months, delayed because of the war with France\u2014which was hardly his fault, she allowed. But she missed him, and if he were here, they could just get married and chaperone Angelica and Sonia themselves.</p><p>Chas had once again gone off on some mysterious business trip, but this time, things were different. He\u2019d left behind a note that made it sound as if the world was to end like it had in Pompeii, or France was to invade if he didn\u2019t return within a fortnight. To Maia\u2019s increasing concern, he hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d be blazingly furious with Chas for foisting her and Angelica on the dratted Earl of Corvindale if she weren\u2019t so worried that something horrible had happened to their brother.</p> <p>But Corvindale was here in London, and he had not only ignored her very polite missive\u2014which had only been sent out of courtesy\u2014but now, as she looked up at his dark, hawkish, arrogant face, he raised an eyebrow and eyed her as if she were some sort of crawly insect.</p><p>\u201cOf course I received your letter,\u201d Corvindale said. His voice was flat with boredom. \u201cI am the only Corvindale, am I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t deign to respond,\u201d Maia replied, attempting, rather admirably she thought, to keep her voice level. Although, due to the fact that they were in the midst of a rather large crush at the Lundhames\u2019 annual summer ball, she did have to raise its volume to be heard over the conversation and music buffeting against them.</p><p>She and Angelica hadn\u2019t chosen to attend this event merely because they expected Corvindale to be here; in fact, she rather assumed he wouldn\u2019t bother to show at the Lundhames\u2019 any more than he had lowered himself to respond to her letter. Everyone knew the earl was a recluse who cared only for ancient manuscripts and scraps of parchment.</p><p>But here he was. Lifting that dark brow and looking down at her from his excessive height as if he couldn\u2019t spare the time to converse with her. Well, she fumed, the feeling was quite mutual.</p><p>\u201cI consider the fact that we are conversing a fair response,\u201d Corvindale replied. \u201cParticularly since, as I recall, we\u2019ve never been properly introduced.\u201d His dark eyes gleamed.</p><p>Maia\u2019s face, blast her fair skin, went warm, and likely pinker than the roses on the shoulders of her cornflower-blue gown. No, indeed, they hadn\u2019t ever been formally introduced. But she certainly knew who he was\u2014the tall, imposing man whose very presence at any social event was cause for the gossips to strain in their corsets to get a glimpse of him...let alone happen to speak with the rude, prideful earl.</p><p>And he certainly knew who she was...and not just because he and Chas had been business associates for years, and occasionally they\u2019d attended the same events. She\u2019d hoped that Corvindale hadn\u2019t realized it was she during that horrid night at Haymarket she\u2019d come to think of as the Incident.</p><p>Maia held her breath so that the flush would dissipate and tried not to meet his eyes. Surely he wouldn\u2019t be rude enough to mention the Incident if he did realize it had been she. But he couldn\u2019t have recognized her. After all, she\u2019d been dressed like a boy.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to set your mind at ease, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he said, the boredom having returned as he glanced at the cluster of people behind her. \u201cI will send instructions on the morrow with arrangements for you and your sister to move to Blackmont Hall until your brother returns.\u201d</p><p>He would send instructions? With arrangements? She folded her lips together in an effort to keep from telling him exactly how she felt about being told what she would do and how and when\u2014without any consultation on her part\u2014and by a man she had fairly detested on sight. Even three years ago.</p><p>How kind of you, Lord Corvindale to at least apprise me of your intentions. Just like every other man in the world, including her brother, he had no regard for her opinion or feelings. It was as if she had the mind of a china doll. If they only realized how much she handled on a daily basis, how much she knew and comprehended about their world and its history.</p><p>She certainly had no intention of leaving her home at the drop of a pin to live at his, but Maia didn\u2019t have the time or the desire to discuss the \u201carrangements\u201d with him further, for the prickling lifting the hair on her arms indicated that her headstrong sister Angelica was about to get herself into some sort of improper situation.</p><p>Unlike her two younger sisters, Maia hadn\u2019t been blessed with the Sight from their half-Gypsy grandmother. Yet, she possessed a keen intuition for brewing trouble that often manifested itself in a simple sort of knowing.</p><p>The Sight works in strange ways. Her Granny Grapes had said that, more than once when Maia expressed juvenile envy that her sisters seemed to have acquired the Sight, but she had not. That was when she was young and childish and didn\u2019t realize what a terrible burden it was for Angelica and Sonia.</p><p>So childish. But she\u2019d long grown past that, realizing that her role was to protect and care for her more vulnerable sisters, particularly after the death of their parents. And she excelled at that, just as she did everything else. Except translating Greek, which she found a necessary evil, but the effort worthwhile.</p><p>And, she supposed, that sort of intuitive, prickling knowing when something was wrong, or odd, was perhaps her own version of the Sight.</p><p>\u201cVery well, my lord,\u201d Maia said, making her voice sound rather like a queen agreeing to an audience with her subject. \u201cI shall review your correspondence on the morrow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned before he could respond, and immediately spotted Angelica in an intense, probably improper, conversation with Lord Dewhurst and his companion Lord Brickbank. Her sister was fresh and lovely in an Empire-waisted, butter-yellow gown, with her dark, almond eyes and gypsyish coloring. Not the usual peaches-and-cream coloring of every other female Londoner, like Maia herself.</p><p>And it took Maia only one good look to know that the Viscount Dewhurst was precisely the sort of man she had warned her sister about. A tawny-haired, golden god of a man with an insouciant smile, melting eyes and a neckcloth that had probably taken a dozen tries to fold properly, he was a rake of the first order, no doubt about it. The way he was eyeing Angelica as if he couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away was enough to make Maia herself feel all warm and tingly deep inside.</p><p>If Alexander ever looked at her like that, Maia would probably melt into a pool of skin and bones at once. She already felt warm and heart-rushed when he kissed her and slid his hand around the neckline of her bodice.</p> <p>But, interestingly enough, Angelica wasn\u2019t speaking to Dewhurst. She seemed to be engaged in conversation with the red-nosed Lord Brickbank, who was staring at her in confusion.</p><p>\u201cAngelica,\u201d Maia snapped, moving toward her sister. It was beyond unseemly for her to be talking with two men that neither of them formally knew, and it was up to Maia to put a stop to it without causing an even greater scene. If she hadn\u2019t been distracted by the earl, this wouldn\u2019t even be a problem.</p><p>But before she could do so, Angelica gave a short little curtsy and took her leave of the gentlemen. Seeing Maia, the younger woman smiled saucily at her sister, then slipped off to dance with Mr. Tillingsworth for the new quadrille.</p><p>Well, at least the worst harm Mr. Tillingsworth would do to Angelica would be to put her into a catatonic state as he talked about his cats, ad nauseam. That was the benefit to dancing a country dance instead of walking through the garden or park with an uninteresting gentleman. At least during the dance, one was separated from one\u2019s partner often enough that it gave one a rest from an uninspiring conversation, whereas when one took a turn about the room or the patio, one could hardly hope for such a reprieve.</p><p>Angelica thus engaged, that left Maia exactly where she wished to be: unencumbered, and able to relax her vigilance long enough to enjoy a dance set herself. Despite the fact that Alexander wasn\u2019t even in England, there was no reason she couldn\u2019t participate in one of the box or line dances.</p> <p>Casting a quick glance at Angelica, who was just setting up in the new set, Maia checked her dance card and noted that Ainsworth was her next partner. At least he wouldn\u2019t stomp on her feet, like Mr. Flewellington had done earlier.</p><p>As Maia bowed to Lord Ainsworth, she happened to notice Corvindale. He was standing in a secluded corner\u2014a rarity in such a crush, but somehow he\u2019d managed it\u2014and was glowering. She couldn\u2019t tell at whom he was glaring; it was a general scowl, directed, it seemed, to the room at large.</p><p>There were women, she supposed, who would find the earl\u2019s dark, arrogant looks attractive\u2014and would suffer his less-than-charming personality. He had a fine nose, long and not too broad, and a wide, square jaw. His cheekbones were high and sharp, giving his entire face the look of a stone bust finished with a large chisel rather than the finesse of a rasper or sandpaper. And since he tended toward dark colors in his clothing, his large shoulders and height were even more pronounced.</p><p>Maia lifted her nose and smiled at Ainsworth and tried very hard to push away the uncomfortable prickling of the fine hairs on her arms. The very last thing, the last thing, she wanted was to be living in that man\u2019s house\u2014guardian or no.</p><p>The chit had no idea how much danger she and her sister were in. If she did, she wouldn\u2019t be lifting her pert little nose at Dimitri from across the room after telling him she would \u201creview your correspondence on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>He willed the annoyance away, waiting for his fangs to retract into their sheaths. And the pounding to cease rushing through his veins.</p> <p>The last time he\u2019d been this discomfited by a woman had been the day Meg told him she was leaving. This was, of course, a completely different case. But the fact remained: Miss Woodmore made his blood boil and his veins bulge.</p><p>And not in a good way.</p><p>If the ever-proper miss had any concept how quickly he\u2019d acted since he\u2019d learned of Chas\u2019s disappearance, how thorough he had been in ensuring that the youngest of her sisters would remain safe at St. Bridie\u2019s (what a ridiculous name for a convent of nuns since none of them would ever become brides) in Scotland, and the fact that since three days ago and unbeknownst to them, she and her middle sister had been under his protection, her haughty look might be deflated into something more grateful.</p><p>But probably not. The more cornered and surprised she was, the more indignant she became. After all, he\u2019d experienced her sharp tongue once before when she was cornered and surprised. She simply didn\u2019t remember it.</p><p>And aside of that, he saw no reason to inform Miss Woodmore of the danger lurking in the background. Chas Woodmore\u2019s secret life was just that\u2014a secret, just as the existence of the Draculia was also undisclosed to the world at large.</p><p>Dimitri remained still, watchful for any sign that Moldavi had acted sooner than he had expected. His arms were folded across his middle as he scanned the room. Filled with colors too bright and bold, too many people, and, worst of all, a veritable mash of smells\u2014most of them unpleasant or too strong\u2014the ballroom represented everything he\u2019d tried to avoid for...oh, the last century or more.</p><p>Emphasis on the more.</p><p>Most of his acquaintances assumed that Dimitri\u2019s avoidance of all things unrelated to his studies had to do with the fire in Vienna when Lerina died, but they would be wrong. Certainly, the event was a contributing factor, but his distaste for the life of a Dracule went much deeper than the loss of an investment and an accidental death. His discontent had started with Meg, twenty-four years earlier when he\u2019d saved her life and first become Dracule.</p> <p>But the culmination of his journey to the life he lived now\u2014the rigid, solitary, ironically Puritan one\u2014had been That Day. That morning, when he\u2019d awakened to find that even a year of denying himself had not released him from Lucifer. It had, in fact, bound him to the devil all the more tightly because of his murder of the old woman whose name he\u2019d never known. An old woman who\u2019d simply tried to help him.</p><p>He\u2019d not made the same mistake since. He now consumed sustenance, never allowing himself to become so desperate as to maul a person to death\u2014as most vampires were able to do.</p><p>He simply no longer took the blood from living bodies, thus denying himself the pleasure and satiation of the past. There was hope that, perhaps one day, the self-denial would be enough to grant him release from a demon who thrived on selfishness and self-centeredness. In the meantime, he studied every ancient document he could get his hands on, looking for another way.</p><p>Any way.</p><p>And the ever-present ache from his Mark, radiating down and behind his left shoulder, was a constant reminder of Lucifer\u2019s fury with him. The rootlike black marking extended from beneath the hair at the left side of his neck down over his shoulder and halfway down his back. It was a visible sign of his cracked and damaged soul, and the more annoyed Lucifer became, the more it throbbed and filled, rising up like twisting black veins.</p><p>The Mark twinged now as Dimitri edged against the wall to allow a promenade of three to mince past. They\u2019d circled by thrice since he\u2019d come to stand here, and he eyed them darkly. One of the women\u2014the one in the center\u2014met his yes boldly as they brushed by in a wave of at least five different floral scents, along with powder and body heat, and Dimitri acknowledged her with a cold, uninterested look.</p><p>Women, especially mortal women, were the last thing on his mind.</p><p>Miss Woodmore was smiling as Ainsworth hooked her elbow and spun her in a neat circle before moving on to the next steps in the dance that separated them, and then brought them back, glove to glove. At least the dress she wore wasn\u2019t pink or yellow, but an unassuming blue with discreet pink roses on the shoulders. It clung and slid along her hips and thighs like damp silk as she moved through the paces, and Dimitri wondered darkly if Chas had seen and approved of that frock.</p><p>A sudden waver in his vision and a heaviness in his chest had Dimitri removing his gaze from the dancers and focusing on a couple strolling past. The female half was wearing ruby earbobs and a matching necklet, which was the reason for his flash of light-headedness. But she was far enough away, and she didn\u2019t pause, so the weakness passed almost immediately.</p><p>Yet another reason to avoid fetes and balls and dinner parties and Almack\u2019s and court. And even, as often as he could manage, Parliament. How he hated sitting in the House of Lords and listening to those mortals natter on about postage laws or minting coins or other inconsequential things like tea taxes. It had been the worst during that mess with the Colonies and the stamp tax imposed on them.</p><p>Yes, one never knew when one might be accosted by a ruby, and since Dimitri had been unfortunate enough to acquire that particular gemstone as his Asthenia, he must always be on guard from that danger.</p><p>Each of the Dracule, along with gifts of immortality, speed and extraordinary strength, also had a specific weakness endowed upon him by their partner in the dark covenant: Lucifer. Since the ruby festooning Meg\u2019s neck was the first thing Dimitri had seen when he woke from that fateful dream one hundred and thirty-eight years ago, his Asthenia was the bloodred gemstone.</p><p>Thus, other than a wooden stake to the heart or a decapitating sword, which would kill him, sunlight and rubies were the only things that would weaken or harm him. Despite that inconvenience, he could appreciate that his Asthenia wasn\u2019t something as commonplace as silver.</p><p>Suddenly Dimitri\u2019s eyes narrowed. By the damned bones of Satan, there was Voss again, sniffing around Angelica Wood more.</p><p>Despite his reluctance for the guardianship, Dimitri took his responsibility seriously. Thus he was out from his alcove in a flash and making his way smoothly across the room. He would appear unhurried to anyone watching him, but in reality, he moved faster than a breath. He made his way from one side of the room to the other, through and around and between the crush of people, in an instant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t so much anger as it was annoyance that burned through Dimitri as he approached the handsome, well-dressed man. Also a member of the Draculia, Voss, the Viscount Dewhurst, had just returned to London from somewhere in the New World\u2014Boston, perhaps\u2014after a decade of absence. Dimitri would have preferred him to stay away even longer than that, but one couldn\u2019t always have what one wished, as was evident by a variety of events in the past few days. This was the second time he\u2019d found Voss accosting Angelica Woodmore tonight, however, and that fact did not sit well with Dimitri.</p><p>If he had to guess, he would surmise that Voss had heard the rumors that the middle Woodmore sister possessed the Sight. And Voss, being not only a rake of the highest order, but also a man who dealt with the buying, selling, and otherwise hoarding of information, was likely intent on taking advantage of the absence of the chit\u2019s brother\u2014and what he perceived as Dimitri\u2019s lack of interest in the girls\u2014to see what Angelica could add to his inventory of knowledge.</p><p>As he drew closer, he heard Voss murmur something to Angelica about a waltz. And at the same time, Dimitri became excruciatingly aware that Miss Woodmore was approaching from the opposite direction. Her bronze-honey hair fluttered in wayward wisps about her temples as she bore down upon Angelica and her erstwhile suitor.</p> <p>Dimitri turned his attention to Voss, and, coming up unnoticed behind the man, said, \u201cMiss Woodmore will not be hastening anywhere with you, Voss. Most especially not to a waltz.\u201d</p><p>He heard the man\u2019s annoyed curse under his breath, but to his credit, he turned without hurry. \u201cBy Luce, Dimitri, have you not yet attended to that violinist\u2019s flat string I mentioned earlier? It\u2019s beyond annoying. I\u2019m certain that a mere look from you would tighten it up perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re after,\u201d Dimitri said, shifting between Voss and the spicy-floral-scented Miss Woodmore, who\u2019d taken her younger sister by the arm and was towing her off in a different direction, \u201cbut I suggest that you remain far away from Angelica Woodmore unless you wish to find yourself in a most uncomfortable position. Neither Chas nor I will suffer your attentions to her or the other Miss Woodmore.\u201d</p><p>Voss gave him that lazy, hooded-eyed look that worked so well to seduce the ladies\u2014even aside of the hypnotic thrall that the Dracule utilized to get what they wanted, when they wanted it. \u201cOf course. The last thing a vampire hunter like Chas Woodmore would tolerate is one of the very creatures he hunts sniffing around his sisters. Never fear, Dimitri,\u201d he continued in that smooth, mocking tone, \u201cthere are plenty of other fish in the sea\u2014or, as I like to think of it\u2014lovely, narrow wrists, or slender, delicate shoulders to slide into. There\u2019s nothing like that pleasure is there? The penetration...sleek and quick, and then the sudden flood of liquid heat, rich and full.\u201d His voice had dropped seductively.</p><p>Then Voss worked up an ironic smile. \u201cBut, of course, you wouldn\u2019t have any recollection of such a pleasure, limiting yourself as you do to bottles of cow\u2019s blood from your favorite butcher.\u201d He gave a sad shake of his head. \u201cI cannot fathom for what purpose you\u2019ve chosen the path of abstinence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you cannot,\u201d Dimitri replied coolly. He didn\u2019t even bother to display the tips of his fangs. \u201cSuch discretion would be beyond your sensibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscretion?\u201d Voss\u2019s laugh rang out. \u201cLet\u2019s call it what it is\u2014self-flagellation, or even martyrdom. What a gray life you must lead, you emotionless bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Dimitri said, \u201cstay away from the Woodmore sisters. I\u2019m fully aware of your penchant for taking whatever is offered\u2014and seizing your desire when one is not forthcoming\u2014and then leaving whatever remains as you saunter on to your next victim. Not to mention your carelessness and silly games.\u201d</p><p>At last, Voss\u2019s face darkened and his eyes burned with a dangerous red glow. \u201cWhat happened in Vienna with Lerina was an accident, Dimitri, and well you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be the case,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s clear that even tragedy hasn\u2019t caused you to change your manipulative ways in the century since.\u201d</p><p>Without deigning to wait for the other man\u2019s response, Dimitri turned and stalked off. Angelica Woodmore had been taken away by her capable sister and Voss wouldn\u2019t dare make another attempt to accost her. At least, not tonight.</p> <p>Once the Woodmore sisters were safely home, Dimitri could return to his solace and uninterrupted studies for the last time in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Although...perhaps on the way home, he might walk through some dark, infamous street in St. Giles or along the river, just so he could be accosted by a gang of thieves or other blackhearts. He was in the mood for a good brawl.</p><p>Might as well enjoy as much of the night as he could, for tomorrow, his home would be invaded.</p><p>2</p><p>OF EGYPTIAN QUEENS</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there now.\u201d Maia smiled at Corvindale\u2019s sister, who sat across from her and Angelica in the closed carriage. She glanced at their other companion and chaper one, Aunt Iliana, and included her in the smile. \u201cThe Mid summer Night\u2019s Masquerade Ball is one of the most exciting events of the Season.\u201d</p><p>Mirabella looked as if she were about to explode with anticipation for her first Society event, and Maia couldn\u2019t blame her a bit. The poor thing had been left in the country for the past seven years with hardly a visit or communiqu\u00e9 from her elder brother. At seventeen, she\u2019d never been presented at court, and her wardrobe was horribly outdated.</p><p>It was really quite irresponsible of the earl\u2014not to mention inconsiderate. How was the girl ever to make a match?</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t move about in Society until she was introduced at court, and until that happened, she couldn\u2019t even think of meeting a potential husband.</p><p>Maia was still seething over the way Corvindale had fairly yanked the proverbial rug out from under her and Angelica\u2019s feet to get them moved to his London residence, with nary a thought to their preference or opinions. It had happened two days ago, so quickly and efficiently that she would have been in awe if she hadn\u2019t been so infuriated.</p><p>Certainly Maia was used to being the one in charge. And there had been times when she\u2019d wished for a reprieve. But not this way, and not because of an ill-tempered earl.</p><p>The morning after the Lundhames\u2019 ball, as promised, Corvindale\u2019s note had arrived. It simply stated that they would remove to Blackmont Hall after receiving their normal afternoon callers, and they would stay under the earl\u2019s guardianship until Chas returned. Before Maia could fly to her study and snatch up stationery to respond in the negative, the earl\u2019s staff had arrived to pack their things, and the next thing she knew, the earl was there, as well.</p><p>Just as immovable and emotionless as a brick wall, he was, and nothing she said had any effect on him except to prompt that arrogant lifting of the eyebrow.</p><p>He\u2019d arrived just in time to catch Viscount Dewhurst\u2014who\u2019d surprised them all by calling that afternoon\u2014as he attempted to woo Angelica in a private corner of their library. Maia had to admit gratitude toward Corvindale for interfering in that matter, for Angelica had seemed more than a little starry-eyed when the viscount had arrived. And the more she saw of Dewhurst, the more certain Maia was that the man was of no good character\u2014a rake and a rogue and the last sort of man with whom her beautiful sister should become enamoured. Someone like Lord Harrington would be a much better choice for Angelica.</p><p>Not only had Corvindale sent Dewhurst on his way, but Maia had also heard him say that the viscount had to leave immediately for Romania.</p><p>As for tonight, since Corvindale had considerately supplied them with a chaperone in the form of Aunt Iliana\u2014who turned out to be a delightful matron, although no one was certain whose aunt she was\u2014Maia really only needed to be concerned with herself. Aunt Iliana seemed like just the sort to watch them all like a hawk, but to have an enjoyable time herself.</p><p>Maia fully intended to do so, as well. The urge to relax a bit, to be anonymous and be not quite so on her guard for propriety\u2019s sake, stirred inside her. When was the last time she\u2019d actually allowed herself to have fun?</p><p>Nevertheless... \u201cDo try to behave with some decorum tonight, Angelica,\u201d she lectured her sister as they prepared to disembark from the long line of carriages. They\u2019d arrived at the Sterlinghouse residence. \u201cPut on a good example for Mirabella.\u201d</p><p>Angelica blasted her with a dark look as she gathered up her flowing Greek-style black gown. She was dressed as one of the Fates, complete with shears and a skein of thread.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you have cause for worry tonight,\u201d Angelica whispered back with an arch look. \u201cNo one will recognize me until we remove our masks, and so until then, all of my behaviors will be anonymous.\u201d She held up the black velvet mask trimmed with a gold and silver lace fall that would offer only teasing glimpses of her cheeks and mouth. \u201cYou shall have no scandal by association.\u201d</p><p>Hmmph. Maia barely held back a roll of the eyes. At least she didn\u2019t need to worry that Angelica would be coaxed into a dark corner by Dewhurst, as he was presumably long gone to Romania.</p><p>\u201cEven you could do something scandalous, Cleopatra,\u201d Angelica murmured, \u201cand no one would know!\u201d</p><p>Maia drew herself up and the royal staff nearly rolled off her lap. If Angelica only knew how difficult it was to act stiff and proper all of the time. And why she seemed so unfailingly prim. \u201cI certainly would not,\u201d she hissed back, her heart pounding. Having once nearly gone into the abyss of scandal, she would take care never to venture near its edge again. There was that lurking fear that if she relaxed even a trifle, she\u2019d slide back into that black hole of impropriety...and this time, there would be no escape. \u201cAnd how many times do I have to tell you, I\u2019m Hatshepsut, not Cleopatra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares about Hatshep-whoever? No one could tell the difference anyway,\u201d Angelica said dismissively. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no asp on my staff,\u201d Maia pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re to don our masks before entering?\u201d asked Mirabella, finally able to get a word in.</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll be announced as we arrive, but not with our real identities,\u201d Maia explained before Aunt Iliana could speak. \u201cOnly by our character or costumes.\u201d</p> <p>She gestured with the gold mask in her hand and caught their chaperone\u2019s indulgent eye. At least the elder lady didn\u2019t seem to mind Maia\u2019s managing ways\u2014which was more than she could say for her own sister. \u201cEveryone is to be unmasked at midnight. Although last year, the unmasking was much later,\u201d she continued. \u201cNo one was ready until nearly one o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our turn,\u201d Angelica said as the voices of the driver and footman reached them. She was out of the carriage before Maia could respond, followed by Aunt Iliana and Mira bella.</p><p>Taking a bit longer, ensuring that her long, whisper-thin glittery-gold gown didn\u2019t expose anything scandalous\u2014like an ankle or a knee\u2014Maia allowed the footman to help her alight.</p><p>When she stood still, the hem of her gown pooled on the ground in soft waves over her feet, which were encased in sandals with soles so thick that they made Maia as tall as her sister. Instead of hanging in one single-paneled skirt, the gown was actually six panels that overlapped, but that were only sewn together to just below the waist. This meant that there was ample opportunity for the long slits to show the sheer, lace shift she wore beneath it.</p><p>Not for the first time, Maia wondered if she\u2019d made a mistake in selecting such a potentially scandalous costume. But she\u2019d loved it the moment the dressmaker showed her the design, and that was the whole purpose of masquerade balls\u2014anonymously walking the line of propriety. And, frankly, she\u2019d hoped that Alexander would be back from Europe to accompany her to this ball so that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered whether it was on the line of scandalous or not.</p> <p>Deep inside, worry gnawed at her. Would he ever return? Had he changed his mind? She pushed the unpleasant thoughts away. Despite his occasional letter, the doubts had been coming more often than not lately. For all of her exterior confidence, Maia felt the fear of rejection, of scandal, of humiliation looming in her future.</p><p>And unlike most other problems in her life, this was one she couldn\u2019t manage or control. She simply had to wait.</p><p>But here she was, without an escort, dressed in a column of cloudlike gold, with an underskirt as sheer and silver as a moonbeam...and completely anonymous. Between the several inches of added height, and the mask, along with the fact that dark horsehair curls had been interwoven with her chestnut hair, it was impossible that she would be recognized; especially since no one would expect prim Maia Woodmore to wear such a thing.</p><p>So she allowed herself to relax a bit more than she normally would.</p><p>The butler announced, \u201cHer Majesty, Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile.\u201d Maia tried to correct him, but there was an angel and a Queen Elizabeth behind her, and the latter\u2019s farthingale skirts bumped Maia out of the way as she moved forward, so she gave up. She\u2019d practiced walking in them, but there was no sense in getting herself unbalanced while on these high shoes.</p><p>Maia caught a glimpse of Angelica as she disappeared into the crowd. Aunt Iliana was on her heels, with Mirabella clinging to her arm, and Maia, for once, found herself not needing to be vigilant.</p> <p>She\u2019d hardly taken two more steps when she came face-to-face with a knight. She couldn\u2019t see his face, of course, but behind the mask, his eyes seemed familiar.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty,\u201d he said with a little bow. \u201cI see that you\u2019ve been neglected by your swains. Would you care for a glass of sparkling champagne punch\u2014or perhaps the effervescent lemonade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glass of the punch would be divine,\u201d Maia replied. She loved champagne, but very rarely had the opportunity to taste it.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I return, perhaps you would care for a dance?\u201d he added with another bow.</p><p>\u201cBut of course.\u201d</p><p>And thus the evening began, and soon slipped into a whirlwind of dancing and revelry. Once, as she spun carefully through the steps of a reel, Maia caught sight of a tall figure in a dark mask with a red and black waistcoat making its way quickly through the crowd. He seemed to move with great speed, despite the crush, and for some reason it put her in mind of Corvindale.</p><p>That had the effect of souring the evening, and Maia shouted to her current partner\u2014a lanky court jester\u2014a request for a cup of punch. The jester agreed, and led her away from the fracas that was the dance floor.</p><p>But her mood had been spoiled, for the very thought of the earl reminded her of their exchange in his study yesterday afternoon. It was the first chance she\u2019d had to actually speak to him when he wasn\u2019t ordering her and Angelica about, and he\u2019d been abominably rude, ensconced in his gloomy office with fascinating-looking books stacked hither and yon. He\u2019d practically shouted at her when she tried to open the curtains to give him some light.</p> <p>Even now, she flushed at the memory of his clipped voice as he looked up from his desk, clearly loath to be interrupted. \u201cWhat. Do. You. Want. Miss Woodmore.\u201d The periods between each word were clearly enunciated, along with the telling absence of a question mark.</p><p>She\u2019d had to swallow a retort at his overt rudeness, and instead marshaled her manners. One really couldn\u2019t shout at an earl, especially when one was a guest in his home. She\u2019d said placating things like, \u201cMy sister and I are very appreciative that you\u2019ve agreed to our brother\u2019s request to take on our guardianship.\u201d And she\u2019d actually managed to sound sincere, and to subdue the urge to lecture him on working in such dim light. \u201cAs I mentioned in my letter, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d made such arrangements with you until he went missing. We\u2019ve always had Mrs. Fernfeather and her husband when Chas has been gone. Regardless...I do not wish to impose upon you\u2014your household any longer than is strictly necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is one thing on which we are in agreement, Miss Woodmore.\u201d</p><p>By that point, her fingers had clutched her gown so tightly it would be horribly crumpled by the time she loosened it. \u201cAnd so I wanted to make you aware of our plans to repair to Shropshire as soon as arrangements can be made for the house there to be opened. My fianc\u00e9 will be arriving from the Continent in short order and once we\u2019re wed, you\u2019ll no longer be responsible for me, of course. My sisters, including the youngest, will come to live with me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn odd time to be planning a wedding, with your brother missing, Miss Woodmore. Or are you in such a hurry to marry that you intend to get the deed done before you even learn what has happened to him?\u201d</p><p>The memory of those words even now sent anger flashing hotly through her. She\u2019d been trying very hard not to worry constantly about Chas\u2019s mysterious absence\u2014not to mention Alexander\u2019s continued nonappearance (for her claim that he was arriving shortly had been a bald-faced lie)\u2014and the earl\u2019s implication that not only did she not care about her brother\u2019s disappearance, but that there might be a reason for rushed nuptials, infuriated her. Pie-faced worm.</p><p>Maia realized she was worrying and fuming again, and she happened to look up as the court jester handed her a cup of sparkling wine punch. It was remarkably cold and quite delicious, with its effervescent bubbles, and she drank it rather more quickly than she should have.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should procure you another one, my lovely Cleopatra?\u201d asked the jester. \u201cOr would you prefer to get some air?\u201d</p><p>Maia declined to correct him about her costume and at the same time, decided she wasn\u2019t about to fall into his little trap and go out into the dark garden. She\u2019d noticed the way the jester had been eyeing her jouncing bosom as they moved through the enthusiastic steps of the reel. He was just the sort to pretend to bump against her and slide his hand around to cup a breast. At least she wasn\u2019t wearing a gown with a lowcut bodice, but instead, a heavy Egyptian collar covered her shoulders and the front of her chest.</p><p>\u201cAnother cup of punch would be lovely,\u201d she replied, adjusting her mask.</p><p>At least she knew she had no chance of meeting up with Corvindale tonight, for when she\u2019d mentioned the masquerade ball, he\u2019d snorted his contempt for the whole concept and dismissed her from his study.</p><p>And she\u2019d been more than happy to leave his arrogant presence, too, Maia thought as she drank a second...or perhaps it was a third...cup of sparkling wine punch. To her mortification, she had to muffle a tiny little burp from the bubbles.</p><p>\u201cMadame?\u201d</p><p>The jester had moved in rather close to her person, and she realized he\u2019d asked her a question.</p><p>\u201cAnother dance?\u201d she repeated. That would be the second in a row, which wasn\u2019t quite the thing if one wasn\u2019t dancing with one\u2019s fianc\u00e9, unless one wanted to be all over the Times\u2019s on dits...but then, she was in a mask. And no one would need to know it was the proper Miss Maia Woodmore dancing two sets in a row\u2014</p><p>And then she realized it was a waltz.</p><p>A thrill of excitement slipped through her. What a dangerous thought. To perform the waltz, the scandalous dance from Vienna that had caused the matrons at Almack\u2019s to lift their noses and tighten their jowls at the very thought of the debutantes participating...!</p><p>Chas hadn\u2019t even officially allowed Maia to waltz with Alexander...although she had managed to do so one time, briefly, in a secluded corridor, without her brother\u2019s knowledge until it was too late. And she\u2019d loved it.</p><p>Loved being spun through the space in his strong arms, their bodies close together, their thighs brushing, the scent of his clothes and hair pomade close and fresh\u2014</p><p>Maia realized the jester was waiting for a response, and also, at the same time, that her face was quite a bit warmer beneath her mask. And she was feeling quite a bit more relaxed and happier than previously...</p><p>\u201cI should love to waltz, sir jester,\u201d she said boldly. And offered him her arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d taken two steps toward the floor when a large figure garbed in black and ruby appeared, blocking their path.</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to fetch my partner for me,\u201d he said, speaking directly to the jester. \u201cI was just about to collect her for our dance.\u201d</p><p>Maia was so surprised that she couldn\u2019t speak, and apparently the jester was similarly afflicted, for he merely stared at the man for a moment. She blinked hard, for it almost seemed as if the man\u2019s eyes had glowed red for an instant...but then the impression was gone. Then, without another word, the jester bowed, turned and walked away\u2014almost as if he\u2019d been hypnotized.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty,\u201d said the new arrival, offering her an arm. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him, trying to see behind the mask and to read his eyes, to determine whether she recognized him. There was an aura of familiarity about the man, and for the flash of a moment when she took his arm and felt a little jolt of awareness, she wondered if it might be Alexander. It would be just like him to surprise her thus.</p><p>But she quickly revised that thought, tucking it away as wishful thinking. She\u2019d forgotten for a moment her added height; this man was too tall to be her fianc\u00e9. His eyes were shadowed by the holes in his mask, which was unrelieved black and left only the very bottom of his face exposed. He wore a dark cloak, and beneath it a waistcoat of bloodred and black, with a brilliant red neckcloth that all but obscured his white shirt. A thumbnail-size ruby in the shape of a diamond studded the center of his neckcloth. She realized he was the tall figure who\u2019d attracted her attention when she was dancing.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked, looping up the extra length of the panels of her skirt into her hand.</p><p>He steadied her as they reached the floor and instead of turning her to face him, he shifted to come around to the front of her. \u201cThe Knave of Diamonds,\u201d he said, lifting her right hand in his gloved one and settling his other one lightly on her waist.</p><p>Although the country dances often required a touch at the hip or waist, and arms linking with arms, the position of the waltz was so different, so intimate, because it wasn\u2019t a passing position. And as she rested her gloved fingers on his shoulder, felt his fingers close around hers, and the burning weight of his hand at her waist, Maia felt warm, and a little dizzy.</p> <p>He hesitated a moment before stepping into the dance, and she allowed him to direct her as they moved forward. The first few steps were stilted, as if he had to discover or learn the rhythm, and even then, they didn\u2019t spin and whirl with the same smooth alacrity as some of the other dancers. For some reason, she liked the fact that he wasn\u2019t so very practiced at the waltz.</p><p>Nevertheless, Maia felt as if she floated on a cloud, held steady by the firm grip on her hand and waist. Even with the tall shoes and the unfamiliar three-beat step, she hardly stumbled at all.</p><p>She glanced up at him to find her partner looking out over her shoulder, as if scanning the room. This gave her the chance to examine what little of his countenance was exposed by the mask; namely, the shape of his chin and the formation of his mouth. Even his ears and hair were covered by a black tricorn, and the collar of his cloak came up to shadow his neck and the edge of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cHatshepsut, I presume,\u201d he said, glancing down at her as they began their second turn about the floor, still relatively slowly and carefully. \u201cAn exceedingly original choice of costume, despite the fact that she dressed as a man on many occasions.\u201d His voice was low, hardly more than discernible to her over the sounds of conversation and music.</p><p>\u201cBaring my lower appendages would not have been appropriate, even in the spirit of accurate costuming. But you are correct,\u201d she said, keeping her own tones pitched low in hopes of disguising her identity. Although her partner definitely wasn\u2019t Alexander, she also sensed that he was someone she knew. \u201cI am Hatshepsut. Everyone else thinks that I\u2019m Cleopatra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFools, all of them. Where is the asp if you are meant to be Cleopatra?\u201d</p> <p>His comment surprised a little laugh from her, and she saw his lips move, relaxing into fullness from their hard, serious line from a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cBut of course, no one truly knows what Hatshepsut looks like,\u201d she admitted. \u201cOr if she was anything more than a queen regent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. But we expect to learn more if the stele from Rosetta is ever translated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can only hope! Until we can read hieroglyphs, there will be holes and blank spots in our knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it remarkable that you are even aware of Hatshepsut\u2019s existence, let alone such details about her questionable reign,\u201d he said after negotiating a particularly tight turn that made her a bit dizzy. \u201cAs well as the importance of the Rosetta Stone.\u201d</p><p>Emboldened by her continued anonymity...and perhaps by the champagne punch...Maia launched into a candid speech that she would never have imposed on a gentleman under different circumstances. They preferred to talk on their own topics, not that of their partners. \u201cI\u2019ve indulged my fascination with Egyptian history for many years now. It started when I read my brother\u2019s copy of Biblioteca Historica in order to help him with his Greek. Ask me about the Babylonians or the Indians, and I know little about them. But if one reads Herodotus or Diodorus, for example, there is much to be learned about the Egyptians. And now that more antiquities are being shipped back from Egypt, I can actually see them in the Museum. That makes it all the more real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assisted your brother with his Greek?\u201d Was there a note of humor in the knave\u2019s voice?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like it any better than he did, but I was determined...\u201d Maia\u2019s voice trailed off as she realized how she\u2019d been babbling. She bit her lower lip and swallowed. One of the things that had put off some of her early suitors had been her tendency to lecture and overexplain. Not that the knave was a suitor, of course, but she well knew that gentlemen did not like women who talked. Alexander was an exception, and he had indulged her interest in Egyptology by taking her to the British Museum on two different occasions.</p> <p>Of course, he didn\u2019t have the foggiest idea who Hatshepsut or even Rameses III were, but that didn\u2019t bother Maia.</p><p>\u201cVery interesting.\u201d The knave seemed to stop whatever else was about to come out of his mouth and clamped his lips together.</p><p>As she looked up at him, Maia realized suddenly that when one was confronted by a masked individual, one\u2019s attention tended to focus on the parts that were exposed\u2014in this case, his mouth. And she found those lips to be more fascinating than they really should be, tracing their shape with her eyes, memorizing them. Wondering what it would be like to kiss them, for they seemed soft and full and very mobile.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he said suddenly, his hands tightening on her, and Maia realized she\u2019d become somewhat dizzy. The room had a bit more spin than the dance steps warranted, and she clutched the top of his arm, her face warm beneath her own mask, her heart suddenly slamming in her chest.</p><p>Oh. Maia blinked and focused on something over his shoulder\u2014anything to turn her mind from the sudden, unexpected thoughts about his mouth. She couldn\u2019t remember feeling this odd before.</p><p>\u201cHow many glasses of champagne punch, Hatshepsut?\u201d</p><p>Her attention flew back to him and his gaze fixed on hers, shadowed and dark behind small round eyeholes. His intense regard knocked the breath out of her as if she\u2019d been punched. Or perhaps it was the champagne punch that made her feel breathless and warm and loose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tipsy,\u201d she retorted, forgetting to keep her voice low.</p><p>Those lips quirked into something that might have been an almost-smile, and he replied, \u201cNaturally. Perhaps some air would be in order?\u201d</p><p>She suspected that he didn\u2019t believe her; and in all fairness, she wasn\u2019t certain whether to believe herself. She was feeling rather odd, in a pleasant, tingly sort of way. \u201cPerhaps it would be best, though I am loath to cut short my rare opportunity to waltz.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he drew her from the dance floor, managing them through the other swirling partners. Oddly enough, once removed from the smooth rhythm of the waltz, Maia felt even warmer and lighter in the head, and she actually bumped against him in mortifying clumsiness. He tightened his arm and led her away from the crowd, where she was able to draw in cooler, cleaner air devoid of attar of roses\u2014which seemed to once again be this Season\u2019s favored scent, as well as every other of the last years since she\u2019d been out.</p><p>Maia\u2019s heart hadn\u2019t ceased its heavy pounding, and in fact seemed to increase as the Knave of Diamonds directed them away from the loud, close ballroom. Toward an alcove down one of the corridors, near which an open window offered a waft of breeze.</p><p>Perhaps it was because there was no other competition for her attention, for she was away from the music filling her ears, the mishmash of the smells associated with such a crush, and the need to concentrate on the unfamiliar dance steps...that Maia found herself overly aware of the strong arm to which she found herself clinging.</p><p>Literally clinging.</p><p>How many glasses of champagne punch had she had? There\u2019d been one before the court jester...or perhaps two? And then another\u2014</p><p>\u201cI do hope you aren\u2019t about to cast up your accounts on my waistcoat, your majesty,\u201d he said, easing her away from him a bit, even as he steadied her step. Those high-soled shoes were rather an inconvenience.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d she demanded, suddenly indignant. \u201cOf course I shouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u201d</p><p>No, indeed not. She simply would not allow it to happen, no matter how odd she felt. And she did feel a bit odd.</p><p>She blinked hard, realizing that she, the very proper Miss Maia Woodmore, was using the Knave of Diamonds to keep the floor from tilting and, quite possibly, her knees from buckling.</p><p>Pulling away from the knave, she found that she was able to stand on her own, even on the platformlike shoes that put her face just...a bit...below...his.</p><p>Maia looked up from the brocade waistcoat and the ruby-studded, bloodred neckcloth that was much too close to her face, willing herself to focus on the matter at hand\u2014which was...well, she wasn\u2019t certain. They hadn\u2019t been conversing, exactly, had they? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes traveled over a stiff black collar that brushed his jaw, hiding the full shape of his face, then beyond a square chin...and to that same mouth that had fascinated her as they spun gently, if not smoothly, around the dance floor.</p><p>It was a mouth that, when relaxed, boasted a full lower lip and a slanted upper one\u2014soft and smooth without being the least bit feminine when it wasn\u2019t flattened grimly.</p><p>\u201cHatshepsut?\u201d Those lips moved, firming in something like exasperation. \u201cDo you need to lie down?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she retorted, annoyed again. \u201cI am perfectly capable of holding my cups. I merely got a bit dizzy from the dancing. It was so very close in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. As long as you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be much too tall, sir knave, and a bit overbearing\u2014\u201d she heard herself commenting, the words simply pouring from her \u201c\u2014but, despite what nonsense comes from it, you have been blessed with a well-formed mouth.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause for a moment, and then he replied, \u201cAh.\u201d The syllable sounded a bit strangled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an expert on mouths, you know,\u201d she continued, vaguely wondering why she was so fascinated by his lips. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t normally examine them quite as closely as one might think, unless the rest of the face is masked, and excepting if one is intending to kiss said mouth...and even then, one might not even have the chance to do so before the kiss commences.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said again after she paused.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ve only been kissed by a limited number of pairs of lips,\u201d she said. Purely for clarification.</p><p>\u201cAnd how many pairs would that be?\u201d His voice rumbled deeply. Those lips were rather flat again.</p><p>She paused, pressing her own lips together in thought. Her mask shifted as she did so, and Maia was grateful for the reminder that she was still blissfully anonymous. \u201cPerhaps three. No, four. Hmm. Perhaps...no, four.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t count Mr. Virgil. He didn\u2019t deserve to be counted, and the very thought of him made her feel ill. She looked up at her companion. \u201cFour, my lord knave.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes locked, his so dark and shadowed behind those small holes that she could hardly fathom that they could have such a hold on her. But they did. Her stomach felt as if the bottom dropped out, leaving her warm and nervous in a very pleasant way.</p><p>Thanking God and all the angels in heaven for the fact that she was masked and completely anonymous, she whispered boldly, \u201cBut perhaps there might be a fifth.\u201d</p> <p>And Maia held her breath.</p><p>3</p><p>IN WHICH THE KNAVE OF DIAMONDS HAS AN EXCEEDINGLY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE</p><p>Dimitri couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>The sudden surge of blood, pounding and insistent, filling his vision, stunned him.</p><p>The force of need, of a long-renounced instinct, suddenly burst free. His fingers trembled, his fangs threatened to shoot forth, bulging inside his swelling gums. He had to lower his eyelids to hide the hungry red glow lest Miss Woodmore see.</p><p>Foolish, damned, stupid, mad bastard.</p><p>What in Luce\u2019s hell had he been thinking, taking a woman like her away into a dark corner? Especially a woman who riled up his ire as easily as his frustration?</p> <p>But he had no more thoughts; they scattered like a shattered goblet as her gloved hand rested against the ruby-colored glass pin adorning his neckcloth. Taller somehow, she lifted her face the fraction that she needed to, putting herself there. Right there. A breath away.</p><p>Saliva pooled in his mouth. His skin flushed beneath his mask. It had been so long since he\u2019d wanted to kiss a woman. He tried to fight it away, but the Mark on his back raged and burned hotter, reminding him of how he\u2019d denied himself unnecessarily. Her lips beckoned, plump and pink, and he wanted to see if they tasted as sweet and lush as they looked. The searing heat blazed even stronger now that Lucifer felt him wavering, and it radiated down Dimitri\u2019s back and through his limbs.</p><p>Embattled by pain, overwhelmed by desire and long-denied need, he couldn\u2019t keep himself from bending to her, covering her lips.</p><p>She surrounded him: her spicy, sweet scent, her confident demeanor, her small hands, the pool of her sparkling gown. Her mouth...that entity that alternately exasperated and teased him, with its top lip that was just a bit fuller than the bottom...softened beneath his, fit to his lips, and gently brushed across his to one side. Her mouth was warm and lush, and she left a little wake of prickling, a dusting of pleasure on his sensitive mouth...and then she lifted away.</p><p>He went back for more, no longer fully master of himself. He found her lips again and took a longer, deeper drink from her taunting mouth. She made a soft, delicious moan that sent a new blaze of desire shuttling through his belly, her lips moving desperately against his. The world was red and hot, and the scent of her floral spice filled Dimitri\u2019s consciousness.</p><p>Perhaps it was this\u2014the recognition of the tantalizing scent, its familiarity and corresponding forbiddance\u2014that enabled him to grasp the last wisp of control and drag himself away. God and the Fates, not her.</p><p>Not anyone, but most of all, not her.</p><p>Fingers tightening into each other, gouging through the gloves into his palms, he stepped back, his heart pounding in his ears, his breathing much too loud. His fangs were out of control and fighting to be free, and he had to turn away, closing his eyes to hide the proof of the demon he was.</p><p>His ruthless control regained\u2014albeit tenuously\u2014he cleared his senses of the heat and sweetness he\u2019d tasted, swallowed hard. Tried not to breathe too deeply, for fear that scenting her would make it begin all over.</p><p>And the crack that had begun to form in his ordered world he snapped viciously together.</p><p>Terrified by what she might see in his eyes when he opened them, Dimitri was weak with relief when he saw that she had turned slightly away. Looking down, he noticed her hand still somehow settled on his chest. She seemed to be wavering through her own battle for control.</p><p>Or, more likely, stability.</p><p>Dimitri wasn\u2019t certain whether he ought to curse the champagne punch that she\u2019d indulged in, or to be grateful for its intoxicating properties.</p><p>\u201cAnd so that makes five,\u201d he said, relieved that his voice was cool and steady. Emotionless. He barely remembered to keep it low, to a mere murmur, to further obscure his identity. Fate protect me from that at least. \u201cI wonder if, at the next masque, you might attempt to make it an even half dozen pairs of lips to taste?\u201d</p><p>At that, she looked up at him and he nearly went for her again. Her lips were swollen and glistening, half-parted with surprise beneath the curve of her mask. He blinked, drew in a breath and focused on the roaring pain blazing over the back of his shoulder. A satisfying reminder that he was, despite it all, still in control.</p><p>And still in defiance of the devil\u2019s will.</p><p>Then in an instant her lips allowed a smile to flicker over them and she surprised him yet again when she replied, \u201cNo, my lord knave. I think it might be prudent to stop at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d He had to offer her his arm in order to get her back to the dance, away from the temptation of this secluded alcove, and the mere thought of what had just transpired.</p><p>He had some blood whiskey in the coach. That would help steady him, dull the awakened need. Later, he could stir up some trouble in the depths of Vauxhall. He\u2019d had a very satisfactory brawl in St. Giles the night after the Lundhames\u2019 ball, where he\u2019d tossed five blackhearts into the River after they\u2019d tried to stick him with a knife and relieve him of his purse. Never say he wasn\u2019t doing his part to clean up the thieves of London.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do believe I shall stop at five,\u201d she replied as they walked along. She wasn\u2019t weaving like she had been earlier.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a shame that my fi\u2014my husband\u2019s kisses were never quite so...potent. Perhaps it\u2019s best if I keep this memory as my last random tasting.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri kept his mind blank, refusing to allow himself to absorb her words and the variety of implications therein. He didn\u2019t even need the reminder that she was betrothed. That fact simply didn\u2019t enter into the equation of his base stupidity; his actions had nothing to do with Miss Maia Woodmore in particular.</p><p>It could be any woman who tempted him thus, for he rarely indulged in the pleasures of the flesh. And even then, it was brief and impersonal. No kissing was ever involved.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d he replied, \u201cHatshepsut. And here we are, back to the party. I release you to your dances and your subjects, knowing that there is no longer a chance that you might be coerced into sampling the kiss of a highwayman or Romeo or some other character.\u201d</p><p>And then, suddenly eager to be far away from the shimmery golden gown and its well-kissed occupant, Dimitri released her arm and slipped into the edge of the crowd, already tasting the blood and alcohol to come, the energy bounding beneath his skin.</p><p>Maia watched the knave ease into the crowded ballroom, both relieved and disappointed by his flight. Her knees were shaking so badly she could hardly stand, and her lips felt as though they were twice their size.</p><p>They still tingled when she slipped the tip of her tongue over them, and she felt a shaft of tingling heat when she re-imagined the kiss.</p><p>How could I have been so foolish? What is wrong with me?</p><p>But she already knew the answer, and once again, Maia was blessedly grateful for the mask that obliterated most of her features, and the other aspects of her disguise. The drink, along with the heady knowledge that no one could know who she was, had turned her into the same sort of capricious young woman who\u2019d nearly gotten herself ruined three years ago.</p><p>Thank God that He, or Fate, or something, had intervened and brought Corvindale onto the scene before she\u2019d made a foolish mistake with Mr. William Virgil. Only, she wished even more fervently now that it had been anyone but her new guardian who\u2019d saved her. The details of that night were so very vague and foggy, but one thing she did recall with absolute clarity was the earl\u2019s furious, dark eyes.</p><p>But that was three years ago...what was wrong with her tonight?</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she learned her lesson? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yet, while she knew part of the reason for her capriciousness was due to perhaps too much champagne punch, there was the fact that she\u2019d been so rigid, so perfectly proper and in control for these past years that it was no wonder it had fizzled behind her cloak of anonymity tonight. If Angelica had any idea what really went on in her thoughts... She hoped that Angelica had had enough sense not to sample the fizzy punch, as well.</p><p>Wishing she could take off her mask to relieve the warmth, Maia strolled along the edge of the room in the opposite direction of the knave. She didn\u2019t want to dance again\u2014she wasn\u2019t certain she trusted herself\u2014and did her best to stay out of sight of anyone who might accost her for his partner.</p><p>The only person she should want to dance with right now was Alexander\u2014and he was far away. And he\u2019d been gone for so long. She ought to focus on his kisses, and where his warm hands had gone, slipping along the bodice of her gown during one of their late-afternoon rides.</p> <p>And so that was what she did. Centered her thoughts on that. She would not worry about whether he\u2019d forgotten her\u2014and their interludes in the closed carriage. Or whether he\u2019d changed his mind.</p><p>And she certainly would not remember the way the knave\u2019s simple kiss had made her whole body hot and alive. Weak and trembly.</p><p>The sight of Angelica with a man wearing a curious square-shaped hat was a welcome distraction, for her sisterly annoyance sprang back to the forefront. Unlike most every one else, the lower half of his face was masked and he looked like some sort of Far Eastern brigand, like one that might have attacked the Crusaders.</p><p>Angelica was waltzing, Maia noted, pressing her lips together and resisting the urge to stalk out there and drag her off the floor. That would just draw attention and recognition to both of them. Which, if Angelica was paying any attention to her elder sister\u2019s eagle eye, she would know\u2014and would use to her advantage.</p><p>Maia would have a word with her later. Just because Chas wasn\u2019t around to ride herd on them didn\u2019t mean her sister could be so careless. Wondering where Aunt Iliana was, Maia scanned the room and noticed an angel across the way.</p> <p>The angel looked as if she was having difficulty with her celestial wings, and a quick glance showed still no sign of their chaperone, so Maia tsked and started over to help Mirabella.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank goodness,\u201d the young girl said when she saw Maia. \u201cI\u2019ve lost one of my wings, and the back of my gown caught upon the staff of a shepherd I was dancing with, and I believe it\u2019s been torn.\u201d</p><p>Maia only needed a quick glance to see that repair was definitely needed. Delighted with an excuse to leave the ball, as well as yet another distraction from all of her other worries, she took Mirabella\u2019s arm and led her toward the sweeping staircase that led to the third floor of the Sterlinghouse residence. Up there, they would find a tiring room, or at least a private place to set Mirabella to rights.</p><p>As they reached the first landing of the stairs, Maia noticed a group of four men, dressed all in black, properly masked, entering through the front door. \u201cThe Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,\u201d announced the butler as the quartet moved into the foyer.</p><p>She paused for a moment, that uncomfortable prickle of intuition lifting the hair on her arms, and looked down at them. There was something about the four she didn\u2019t like. Something off.</p><p>They walked into the foyer as if they knew where they were going\u2014with purpose and speed, and without pausing to greet anyone. Suddenly nervous and not certain why\u2014but she never ignored her instincts\u2014she gripped Mirabella\u2019s arm, silently directing her to climb the stairs more quickly. They were already mostly out of sight from below due to a curve in the staircase, but for some reason, Maia felt compelled to get away before one of them chanced to look up.</p> <p>Once at the third floor, she felt marginally less unsettled and wondered at her odd reaction to the men. Perhaps it had simply been the fact that their costumes had seemed so men acing. Mirabella hadn\u2019t noticed her haste, and Maia wasn\u2019t about to mention it. Instead she peeked inside one of the rooms, knowing from her previous visits that the Sterlinghouses had several parlors and a library on this stretch of the corridor, and that the ladies\u2019 tiring room was near the end.</p><p>The room was empty and a full moon shone through French doors, casting silvery light over several chairs and a table with a decidedly masculine feel. Not one of the ladies\u2019 parlors, but it would do for a moment for her to see to Mirabella\u2019s gown.</p><p>Maia didn\u2019t expend much energy trying to find a lamp, for there was one on the desk, turned to a bare glow. She turned it up and was just kneeling behind the angel to see to the back of her gown when the door behind them burst open.</p><p>Muffling a shriek of surprise, she bolted to her feet, tangled in the frothy fabric of her gown, and went down in a heap.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, a dark figure in a white shirt loomed over her and for a moment she thought it was one of the eerie men who\u2019d caught her attention. But at the same time as she recognized her new guardian\u2019s features, Mirabella exclaimed, \u201cCorvindale!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Maia muttered as the earl literally yanked her to her feet, disregarding the fragility of her gown. \u201cWhat do you mean by\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she never finished, for the next thing she knew, strong arms swooped around her and he lifted her bodily from the ground.</p><p>Maia was so shocked and horrified that at first she couldn\u2019t speak. She struggled, trying to pull free, and heard Corvindale snap a command at his sister, \u201cOutside. Now, Bella.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPut me\u2014\u201d she started, but her own direction was cut off along with her breath when he did just that, fairly tossing her onto one of the chairs. She drew in a furious gasp to lash into him, but suddenly a heavy, dark cloth wafted down over her.</p><p>Confused, incensed and more than a little frightened at this sudden, un-earlish wildness, Maia kicked and struggled as he wrapped the covering closely around her. It had the effect of muffling her shouts and dulling her kicking and hitting, and when he tucked it tightly around her, tying it with something she could only imagine was a curtain cord, she began to lose her breath under the thick cloth.</p><p>He\u2019s mad! The Earl of Corvindale is mad!</p><p>He lifted her again and carried her somewhere...outside. She felt the subtle change in the air through the fabric, and remembered him ordering his sister outside. Through the French doors, onto the balcony, she guessed, based on the short distance. He deposited her none too gently onto some hard surface, and she heard more short, sharp commands to Mirabella.</p><p>\u201cKeep her quiet. Stay here behind this planter until Iliana or I come for you. Both of you.\u201d This last was loud enough for her to hear clearly, and she understood that it was intended that way.</p><p>She strained her ears, and although she couldn\u2019t hear footsteps, she did distinguish the soft click of what had to be the French doors, closing behind him.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Maia?\u201d</p><p>The soft voice was close, and she felt a little nudge as Mirabella knelt next to her. \u201cGet me out of here,\u201d she snarled, and then inhaled a bit of lint and began to cough inside what must be curtains. Providence knew when the fabric had last been beaten.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale said to stay here,\u201d Mirabella said. \u201cI think something\u2019s wrong in there, Maia.\u201d</p><p>Gritting her teeth to keep from coughing and launching into an obviously vain tirade, Maia closed her eyes. The chit was so cowed by her brother that not only did she not even call him by his Christian name, but she also blindly followed his every order. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d she managed to say, although it wasn\u2019t strictly true. Now that she wasn\u2019t struggling so much, she found that air did make its way through the fabric.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to loosen it,\u201d Mirabella said, and Maia felt her beginning to tug at the fabric. But then she stopped abruptly. \u201cOh!\u201d Her voice was a shocked whisper. \u201cSomeone\u2014no, two men\u2014just came into the\u2014 Oh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting. In the room. There are two of them attacking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d Maia demanded, stilling for a moment, straining to hear.</p><p>\u201cMy heavens.\u201d Mirabella made an odd sound. \u201cThey have burning eyes. Red eyes. And they\u2019re attacking the earl!\u201d</p><p>Red eyes?</p><p>A chill rushed over her. Red eyes? She\u2019d heard about people with red eyes. Demons, and the vampirs of legend. But of course such creatures didn\u2019t exist, despite how real the stories might seem. \u201cIt must be part of the masquerade,\u201d she whispered back, trying not to think about the four men in black. \u201cSomehow they have reflective pieces that make their eyes glow.\u201d</p><p>But even as she spoke, she remembered Granny Grapes spinning her tales of horror and suspense. She\u2019d made it sound as if vampirs actually existed, and even that she\u2019d encountered them. They were dark, powerful men who\u2019d sold their soul to the devil in exchange for immortality and other superhuman abilities.</p><p>They could be killed by a wooden stake to the heart. She remembered that part of the legend because Chas had been unaccountably fascinated, as boys tended to be, by the possibility of blood and violence. He had pressed Granny Grapes over and over for stories about the hunting of the humanlike immortals, counting among his heroes a vampir slayer named Andreas.</p><p>The vampirs were sensitive to sunlight, too, and drank blood to live. Human blood.</p><p>Maia shivered, but it wasn\u2019t from the cold. It was because she remembered the last vestiges of a dream she\u2019d had the night before. A dream that she\u2019d tried to submerge, because it had been dark and hot and red. And there\u2019d been a vampir in it, with his gleaming eyes that scored into her like fire...and his sleek fangs.</p><p>The dream had left her breathless and sweaty, her heart racing, and with a sort of expectant throbbing through her body. Even now, remembering the essence of it made her skin flush with heat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re attacking him!\u201d Mirabella said again, her voice still low. \u201cTwo of them. They\u2019re so...fast. Corvindale\u2019s thrown one across the room, but the other is on top of him\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo of them? Do they have guns or weapons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting with their hands and\u2014kicking, and throwing things. It\u2019s...amazing,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMy brother...he\u2019s so fast, they\u2019re all so fast...but he\u2019s... I can hardly see him move. And...he just lifted that big desk and threw it at one of them,\u201d she said. Her voice was half shocked, half terrified. \u201cOh! He punched one, and oh! Oh, dear! Oh. There. He\u2019s back up and slammed the other one into the wall, and then he flipped over a sofa and landed on his feet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Maia demanded again.</p> <p>\u201cThe earl. He\u2019s fighting them off. Both of them. He\u2019s\u2014but he\u2019s bleeding...and there goes a chair on the head and oh!\u201d</p><p>The next thing Maia knew, the girl was dragging, or pushing and pulling, her somewhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hide. Behind this...potted tree,\u201d she managed, breathless with effort. \u201cThey might see us!\u201d</p><p>But by then, Mirabella had ceased to pull and tug at her bound body, and Maia got the impression she was no longer near her. Where did she go? Surely she hadn\u2019t left her here alone, bound up like a loaf of bread?</p><p>And then...Angelica! Fear seized her, and with a flood of panic she remembered the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the malevolent aura about them. Now she began to struggle anew, but Corvindale had been much too efficient with the curtain cord. She couldn\u2019t loosen it, and Mirabella didn\u2019t seem to be inclined to do much to assist.</p><p>\u201cMirabella?\u201d she said, a bit more loudly now.</p> <p>A shifting in the air, and then the presence of someone next to her indicated the younger woman\u2019s return. Maia felt her bump against her in haste. \u201cIt\u2019s Corvindale! A third man came in, and then something happened\u2014he just stopped. Corvindale just...stopped. He\u2019s down on the ground, or dead, or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they shoot him?\u201d Maia demanded. \u201cDo you see a lot of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything, and surely I would have heard a gunshot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me out of here,\u201d Maia said, struggling harder. She had to see. She had to find a way to take care of this. The earl couldn\u2019t be dead. \u201cDo you see any blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking around the room\u2014there\u2019s only one man now,\u201d Mirabella hissed, her mouth close to the spot she must assume was Maia\u2019s head, but was really her shoulder. \u201cAnother one came in. He just kicked my brother...and he didn\u2019t move. Oh, dear God, I hope he isn\u2019t dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnwrap me!\u201d Maia said. Torn between disbelief that the implacable earl could actually be prone\u2014not to mention that he\u2019d allowed himself to be kicked\u2014and the terror of what could be happening to Angelica, she found herself flopping about like a netted fish. Were there really vampirs here?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d better not. Not until\u2014oh, the man left. He\u2019s gone. I\u2019m going to wait a minute to make sure he\u2019s gone for good. Then I\u2019ll sneak in and see to the earl.\u201d</p><p>Mirabella moved and Maia heard her shifting away, and then, after a long moment, the soft rattle of the French doors. And then a marginally louder rattle, and the gentle bump as Mirabella came back.</p><p>\u201cSomeone else came in! He nearly saw me. I don\u2019t know who he is, but I thought I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Corvindale? Did you see blood? Did you get in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not moving, but his eyes seem to be open. And his shirt is all torn, and there is a necklace of rubies across his neck that he wasn\u2019t wearing earlier. It\u2019s very peculiar. But I didn\u2019t get close enough because the door opened and I ran back outside.\u201d</p><p>Maia could hear the distress in her friend\u2019s voice, and she supposed she couldn\u2019t blame the girl for running after the door opened again. But how could she have left her brother there? Maia would never have\u2014</p><p>Mirabella gasped. \u201cThe man is taking the necklace of rubies! Is he a thief\u2014oh! Corvindale!\u201d</p><p>And then the sound of the French doors crashing open and heavy footsteps had Maia tensing.</p> <p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Mirabella was asking, and then suddenly Maia was being scooped up and untangled from her bindings. Unfortunately she recognized the strong, efficient handling of Corvindale as he toted her away once more.</p><p>By the time the fabric fell away from her face, and she saw that the earl was, apparently, no worse for wear, he\u2019d deposited her on the floor in the very same room she\u2019d been in some time earlier. It was in shambles.</p><p>\u201cAngelica!\u201d was the first thing that came out of her mouth, just as she noticed Lord Dewhurst leaving the chamber. He was carrying a necklace of rubies.</p><p>The curtains had fallen in a thick heap around her feet, tangling with her high shoes and the multitude of folds from her gown. She tried to kick it away, frantic to get to her sister, but Corvindale stopped her with a strong grip around her arm. \u201cTake your hands off me,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI have to find Angelica.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, Corvindale lifted her from the pile of fabric as the door closed behind Dewhurst, and she noticed that his shirt was indeed torn, sagging over his uncovered shoulder, leaving his muscular arms bare. \u201cDewhurst will see to her,\u201d the earl said.</p><p>\u201cDewhurst?\u201d Maia said, staring at the door. And wasn\u2019t the viscount supposed to be in Romania? \u201cWith my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him later,\u201d Corvindale said grimly, grasping her by the arm and towing her toward the door. \u201cIliana\u2019s waiting in the carriage. You\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d he said, and gestured sharply for Mirabella to follow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving without my sister,\u201d Maia said, digging in her heels.</p><p>The earl\u2019s response was simple, and it infuriated her further: he picked her up bodily and carried her out of the room and down the hall to the servants\u2019 stairs.</p><p>The next thing she knew, Maia was shoved into a carriage along with Mirabella and their chaperone. No fewer than three footmen were to accompany them, which gave her a modicum of security. The door closed and clicked locked before she could speak, and the coach started off with a violent lurch.</p><p>She could barely catch her breath, she was so incensed. But before she could gather her thoughts to speak, she looked over at her two companions. Mirabella\u2019s eyes were wide in her fair face, her fiery-red hair hanging in straggles around her cheekbones, her red lips parted.</p><p>But Aunt Iliana had a more composed, but intense, expression on her face. And for the first time, Maia noticed that the woman was holding a sharp wooden stake.</p><p>Maia had just finished opening the parlor drapes at Blackmont Hall again\u2014for someone kept closing them and keeping the rooms so dark and dreary\u2014when she heard the front entrance open. Her heart leaped, and she rushed to the parlor door to see if it was Angelica returning at last. But the low, sharp tones as the new arrival spoke to his butler indicated that it was the earl who had come home.</p><p>Determined to at least have some answers from him, she flew from the parlor and met him in the hall.</p><p>\u201cLord Corvindale,\u201d she said, positioning herself in the center of the passageway so that he couldn\u2019t walk to his study\u2014where it appeared he was headed\u2014without brushing past her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Miss Woodmore?\u201d he demanded. His voice was flat and hard, and belied the disheveled, weary man in front of her. He\u2019d either come home and changed into a new shirt (although she was certain he hadn\u2019t been in the house since she returned from the masquerade last night; for she\u2019d been waiting to accost him), or had somehow acquired a different one, for this shirt, though wrinkled and loose, seemed relatively pristine as compared to the one in shreds last night.</p><p>But his features were etched even more sharply than usual. His heavy dark brows lowered in a scowl, his mouth in a flat line, his thick, dark hair springing in erratic waves from his head and around his neck. He was well overdue for a shave, as well, she noted with a sniff. His coat was smudged with dirt and his hands were ungloved and one had a line of dried blood on the back of it.</p><p>Although Maia had filled her sleepless night by attempting to rest, then read, and then later when neither served to ease her mind, to bathe away the lingering bit of lint and dust from the curtains in which she\u2019d been wrapped, she felt very little sympathy for the man in front of her...despite the fact that he seemed exhausted. Tension emanated from him like heat radiating from a fire, but Maia didn\u2019t care. She needed answers, she needed to prepare, to take care of things and to address this situation\u2014and she\u2019d waited much too long for him. Aunt Iliana, who seemed to know much more than she let on, had merely assured her that they\u2019d received word that Angelica was safe and that Dewhurst would be returning her shortly.</p><p>But the big question was: safe from what?</p><p>From the vampirs?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly four o\u2019clock, Corvindale. I would like you to tell me precisely where Angelica is,\u201d she demanded of him in return. \u201cAnd when she is going to arrive here. But most of all, I require assurance that she is safe.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed darkly. \u201cYour sister will arrive here at Blackmont Hall when I am convinced it is safe for her to do so.\u201d He made a clear gesture of dismissal. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>She drew in her breath and gave him an icy glare. \u201cNo, it is not. In fact, I wished to speak with you in regard to your conduct last evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy conduct?\u201d Ice fairly formed in the air around his words.</p><p>Perhaps he assumed that the very tone of his livid, affronted voice would make her turn tail and run, but he was very wrong. \u201cNot only was it abhorrent and crude, but you didn\u2019t even take the moment to explain or apologize before shoving Mirabella and myself into a carriage and sending us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was simply no reason for you to put your hands on me\u2014\u201d to her mortification, her voice dipped a bit with fury \u201c\u2014and toss me out onto the balcony like some sort of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Corvindale fixed her with icy black eyes. \u201cIn fact, I had sufficient reason for doing so. The least of which was the fact that you would not have obeyed me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you had simply explained\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no time for explanations, even if I had believed you might have heeded them, Miss Woodmore. You would have ignored them just as you have everything else since arriving here, including keeping the windows in this house shrouded, my library in order and my preference not to be bothered.\u201d</p><p>Maia held her ground, despite the fact that his voice had risen enough that a nearby vase rattled on its glass tray. So he had noticed she\u2019d been looking through his library...and doing a bit of organizing. Had he seen that she\u2019d arranged his many copies of the Faustian legend by language and date?</p> <p>\u201cIf you had simply explained that we were in danger and there was no time for discussion, I would have heeded your warning.\u201d She drew in a breath and managed to count to three before continuing. \u201cIn addition to an apology, I believe it isn\u2019t asking overly much to request an explanation for what happened last evening. I understand now that Angelica and I were in danger, but I would like to know why and from whom or what. And how it happened that you arrived in time to prevent whatever the outcome might have been...regardless of the clumsy manner in which you executed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClumsy manner?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She pinned him with her eyes and made an impatient gesture. Why would he not give her a straight answer? \u201cYou pushed me out onto the balcony, wrapped up in curtains. Can you not give me the courtesy of telling me why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there were some very bad men who want to take you away and I needed to ensure that you didn\u2019t reveal yourself to them. That is why your blasted brother snared me into being your guardian. Because he knew there was no one else who could keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Very bad men? It was all she could do not to roll her eyes in frustration. \u201cPlease, my lord, you sound like a character in one of those Gothic novels by Mrs. Radcliffe, making all sorts of Byzantine comments and cryptic warnings. If you would cease these ambiguous statements and simply tell me what is happening\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat then? You would accept my explanations and my orders without question?\u201d</p><p>Was the man mad? \u201cCertainly not. But at least you wouldn\u2019t feel the necessity to wrap me up and throw me onto the balcony.\u201d</p><p>Corvindale crossed his arms over his sagging, stained waistcoat and glared down at her. \u201cThe truth is, Miss Woodmore, your brother has gotten himself into serious danger with a society of ruthless men. By disappearing with the sister of one of them, he has not only put himself in a most injurious position, but also you and your sisters\u2014for they would like nothing better than to use one or any of you to get to Chas.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Chas! Maia swallowed, trying to keep the panic away. \u201cThen they are after us as hostages? Ransom?\u201d So the men weren\u2019t vampirs. Or were they? She shook her head. She was mad to even consider the possibility that vampirs could actually exist.</p><p>She spoke aloud, working through her thoughts as if he weren\u2019t even there. \u201cBut then that must mean Chas is still alive and hidden somewhere if they are trying to abduct us. He must still be alive. And safe.\u201d Relief bounded through her.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is very cunning and able, and you are likely correct. I\u2019m confident he can take care of himself. But you and your sister must not leave this house or see anyone with out my permission. You are completely safe whilst in my custody, but Cezar Moldavi is not only ruthless but also reasonably intelligent. And your brother has betrayed him in a most egregious manner. He will not give up easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCezar Moldavi?\u201d Maia froze. She\u2019d heard that name. She was certain of it. But where? Perhaps Chas...</p><p>\u201cYou recognize that name, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m familiar with it but I have never met the man, like yourself. I mean to say, now that I\u2019ve met you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dimitri shifted, his impatience clear. \u201cYes, yes, Miss Wood more. Please refrain from stating the obvious. Now, I am expecting Mr. Cale any moment now. What other items must you drag forth and force me to ponder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have not tendered an apology,\u201d she said clearly, not about to be brushed off. Really. The man had some sort of nerve. \u201cI have never been handled so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Woodmore,\u201d the blasted man interrupted again, \u201cdo you mean to say that should a man push you from the path of an oncoming carriage he should bow and scrape at your feet in apology for mussing your skirts? Or should he ask permission first, before doing so?\u201d</p><p>It was all she could do to keep from stamping her foot. Was the man that obtuse? \u201cWell, I do believe\u2014\u201d She stopped herself this time. He was not worth the effort of getting riled up. One attracts more bees with honey than vinegar. Although she didn\u2019t think either would appease the dratted individual in front of her. He simply disliked everyone.</p><p>Nevertheless, taking a deep breath, she spoke again, keeping her tones dulcet with effort, speaking to him as if he were a young child. \u201cI did not realize we were in some sort of danger. You made no effort to impress that fact upon me\u2014a fact which you obviously well knew. Perhaps in the future, Lord Corvindale, you might be a bit more forthcoming. Particularly about things that apply to me and my sisters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Incensed by his insouciant remark, clearly meant only to shut her up, she stepped forward and was rewarded when he actually seemed to rear back a bit. Good. The wrath of a woman is not to be underestimated. \u201cThere is one more thing, my lord. I require your assurances that my sister\u2019s reputation will be intact when she is returned here to your custody\u2014or that you will take the appropriate steps to correct any problems thereof.\u201d The last thing any of them needed was a scandal attached to Angelica. That would ruin any chance she had of making a match with Harrington\u2014or any other well-respected gentleman.</p><p>\u201cYou have my assurances that I will do my utmost to protect your sister\u2019s reputation, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he replied stiffly. \u201cNo one\u2014other than perhaps yourself and Chas\u2014is more concerned about it than I am. But you haven\u2019t any reason to worry. She is safe from Moldavi and in unblemished company.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s eyes narrowed. He\u2019s not telling me something. She was certain of it. He was obfuscating, drat the man. But before she could press him further, there were footsteps and voices in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d said the butler as he appeared. \u201cMr. Giordan Cale has arrived.\u201d</p><p>Maia hardly glanced at Mr. Cale as he strode down the hall toward the earl. She had the impression of a well-dressed, handsome man with a haggard, taut expression.</p><p>\u201cDimitri,\u201d he said to the earl. And then he turned to Maia. \u201cMiss Woodmore.\u201d He gave a quick bow as she curtsied, getting a better look at him. He was very handsome, with strong features like a Roman god and tight, curling chestnut hair. He looked just like Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David, except, of course, that she couldn\u2019t accurately compare the statue to this man\u2019s physique.</p><p>Corvindale frowned. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us,\u201d he said dismissively to Maia. Then he looked at Cale and gestured down the corridor. \u201cMy study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no time to give the lengthy explanation she would have required\u2014let alone convince Miss Woodmore of its veracity. It was necessary to take matters into my own hands,\u201d Dimitri said moments later in his study.</p><p>He found himself more than a bit annoyed that he felt compelled to explain, even to the man he considered his closest friend. Not to mention the fact that he was beyond furious that Belial\u2019s men had caught him by surprise with the rubies. The other two had been no match for him, and Dimitri had been about to use the stake he had beneath his waistcoat when Belial himself burst into the chamber carrying that ruby necklace.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d known of his Asthenia for rubies. No one had known except Cale\u2014though he\u2019d die before revealing it. Meg had known, but she was long dead by a stake to the heart. Although Voss had tried valiantly to find out that night in Vienna, he hadn\u2019t succeeded until last night when he\u2019d discovered Dimitri with the necklace draped across his skin.</p><p>Dimitri\u2019s neck still burned where the gems had blazed into his skin, and although he was satisfied that he\u2019d moved quickly enough to hide Mirabella and his ward, things had very nearly gone wrong. A fact which the latter seemed unwilling or unable to comprehend. \u201cMiss Woodmore has been rather vocal in expressing her annoyance with my choice of tactics,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Cale wasn\u2019t completely successful in hiding the amusement in eyes that were nevertheless laced with tension. \u201cShe didn\u2019t sound terribly pleased with the event,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI heard quite a bit of your exchange.\u201d</p><p>Damnable vampire hearing. \u201cMiss Woodmore would argue with the devil if he claimed he were from hell,\u201d he said, pouring them each a healthy shot of his best brandy\u2014this time, without blood.</p><p>His head was a bit soft from last night\u2019s overindulgence of blood whiskey between the interlude with Hatshepsut and the attack by Cezar Moldavi\u2019s men. Naturally he\u2019d only interfered to keep Miss Woodmore from waltzing with that court jester because it had been his duty as her guardian, but it had led to an unnecessary detour in that shadowy alcove\u2014not to mention a distraction that had put him off guard. And just as naturally, Dimitri hadn\u2019t given their brief kiss more than a passing thought, but, still, that delay had caused him to be a bit too slow in realizing the vampires had arrived.</p><p>Which was another reason he was in no mood to placate Miss Woodmore.</p><p>He\u2019d rushed through the house, looking for his wards and his sister so as to get them to safety, and had barely done so when Belial\u2019s associates had attacked him. Fortunately their absence made it appear that Dimitri was searching for the girls as well, thereby misleading the vampires before Belial flung the ruby necklace at him.</p><p>\u201cThey gained admittance to the party?\u201d Cale asked.</p><p>\u201cThere were five of them, all makes, including Belial,\u201d Dimitri replied.</p><p>Makes were vampires who\u2019d been \u201cmade\u201d or sired by another Dracule. While enjoying the same characteristics as the original Draculia members\u2014ones like Dimitri, Cale and Voss, who were invited into the brotherhood by Lucifer himself\u2014these made vampires were less powerful and more susceptible to weakness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sired vampires could also make their own minions, but the further down the chain of evolution, so to speak, the less powerful and slower they were. Each of them acquired not only their own Asthenia upon awakening after being made, but they also inherited any weakness of their sire, and his or her sire, and so on.</p><p>\u201cMoldavi acted more quickly in sending his men here than I\u2019d anticipated, but it could have been worse if Iliana and I hadn\u2019t been at the masquerade. She managed to alert me to their arrival, and staked one who apparently attempted to attack Angelica in the garden. And Dewhurst\u2014er, Voss.</p><p>He\u2019s taken to using his title again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd now Voss has absconded with the younger one? Angelica?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri submerged the bubble of rage at the thought of Voss seducing his way beneath the skirts of Chas Woodmore\u2019s sister while she was on Dimitri\u2019s watch. Certainly Voss would have his own reasons for choosing her in particular, but knowing that it would infuriate Dimitri was justicing on the bastard\u2019s cake.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t get to Voss first, Woodmore would do it\u2014and shove a stake into his heart without hesitation. Good riddance, but Dimitri would rather have the honor himself if Angelica was ruined while he was responsible for her. Even though he didn\u2019t hold Voss directly liable for Lerina\u2019s death in Vienna, the tangled web of the other man\u2019s games and manipulations had certainly set that path in motion. Since that night, Dimitri had been more than receptive to a reason for ridding the earth of the man\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cVoss has sent word that he\u2019ll return her when he\u2019s certain I can assure him of her safety, but of course he has some other reason for abducting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does. It\u2019s Voss we\u2019re speaking of. The man can\u2019t keep his cock or his fangs put away,\u201d Cale replied. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t about to let Moldavi get to her any more than we are. So she\u2019s safe\u2014after a fashion.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately Cale was correct. Voss would keep Angelica for his own purposes, and then drop her as if she were a hot coal when he was finished. Dimitri doubted even the threat of Chas Woodmore and his ash stake would cow Voss. \u201cWhich is precisely the reason I\u2019ve told Miss Woodmore that all is under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree deaths last night at the hands\u2014or should I say fangs\u2014of Belial and his men?\u201d Cale asked. \u201cOr were there more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree in total. Iliana got one in the garden, and Voss witnessed two in the ballroom while I was attending to Miss Woodmore and Mirabella. He claims there would have been further carnage if he hadn\u2019t intervened.\u201d Dimitri was inclined to believe him, much as he hated to give the man credit for anything productive. \u201cAlthough, of course, he didn\u2019t lift a stake to any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t. They were after the Woodmore girls without a doubt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Now that Chas has run off with Narcise.\u201d As he spoke, Dimitri watched Cale without appearing to do so. He wasn\u2019t surprised when his friend\u2019s face tightened almost imperceptibly, confirming his suspicion that Giordan Cale still had that unhealthy attachment to Narcise Moldavi.</p><p>The question that Cale was likely asking, just as Dimitri was, was whether Chas had abducted Narcise against her will, or whether they had eloped. Either was possible, although the irony of a vampire hunter eloping with a vampire made the latter choice rather fascinating.</p> <p>\u201cNaturally I spent the rest of the night doing the usual to hide the evidence of their visit,\u201d Dimitri explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you some assistance today if you still need to close some holes,\u201d Giordan offered. Dimitri nodded in acceptance, for despite his initiatives since the tragedy, there was still more to do.</p><p>Last night\u2019s strategy had included a few stories told about masquerade skits gone awry, a selection of his own rumor mongering, and a bit of memory altering at White\u2019s, Bridge &amp; Stokes, and other mens\u2019 clubs afterward\u2014all so that no one would know exactly what had happened to leave three people dead.</p><p>Their deaths were tragic enough\u2014not to mention unnecessary\u2014that the actual cause would only make the event even more horrific. That would only lead to the same sort of public outcry and uprising against the Dracule that had occurred in Cologne in 1755. Even more people would die if that happened\u2014fools who thought they could actually hunt and kill the strong, fast immortals. There were few who could hope to take a vampire by surprise and best them in battle, and they had to be well-trained, thus Dimitri ensured that most members of his household staff were as well-equipped as mortals could be for an encounter with Dracule.</p><p>And in addition, Dimitri had long made it a practice to hire made vampires whose sires were dead for a variety of tasks, including acting as guardians and protectors of the Woodmore sisters. There were, despite the link to Lucifer, quite a number of Dracule who weren\u2019t blindly driven by the need for violence and power and sought only pleasure and immortal life.</p><p>Dimitri\u2019s scowl deepened and the familiar burn of disgust billowed in him. Vampires like Moldavi and Belial who routinely left a trail of violence and dead mortals in their paths repulsed him. Voss might be a creature concerned only with himself, but he didn\u2019t have the lack of respect for mortals that Moldavi and his ilk did\u2014leaving children bled dry and to die in the fields.</p><p>Moldavi particularly enjoyed the blood of young, virginal boys.</p><p>\u201cWoodmore is here in England,\u201d Cale said, surprising Dimitri. \u201cHe contacted me. The assumption is that he knows where Narcise is, but he didn\u2019t say that in the correspondence I received. He was careful. No one else would even know it was from him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMoldavi wants his sister back and he\u2019ll do whatever he must to retrieve her\u2014including coming out of his position licking the bollocks of Napoleon Bonaparte. Woodmore isn\u2019t about to take the chance of being found. He\u2019s too damn smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting at the inn in Reither\u2019s Closewell.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri looked at his friend sharply, but Cale\u2019s face was carefully blank. Too blank.</p><p>Chas Woodmore couldn\u2019t know the history between Narcise and Cale if he was turning to the latter for assistance. Satan\u2019s bloody bones. If Woodmore would have been a bit more patient and waited for Dimitri\u2019s assistance on the mission to kill Moldavi, none of this mess would have happened.</p><p>\u201cWhen you see him, tell Woodmore to get his arse back to London and see to his sisters. You can attend to Narcise,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cOver my damned dead soul,\u201d Cale replied. \u201cShe\u2019s Woodmore\u2019s problem now.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>AN INCIDENT IN VIENNA</p><p>Despite Dimitri\u2019s easy conversation with Giordan Cale, he was unable to dismiss the fact that somehow, someone knew of his Asthenia for rubies. That conundrum couldn\u2019t help but take him back to the night of the fire in Vienna, the night that had ultimately sent him back to England, and that had cemented his mistrust of Voss and the hatred between him and Cezar Moldavi.</p><p>He remembered the night as if it had happened yesterday, although it had been in 1690\u2014more than a hundred years ago. He\u2019d been celebrating the opening of the gentleman\u2019s club he\u2019d had built in the city of Vienna, which was going through a great architectural renewal now that the Turkish siege had ended.</p><p>\u201cIf Cezar Moldavi attempts to enter,\u201d Dimitri had directed his manager, \u201cinform me immediately.\u201d At that time, he held a glass of whiskey that he\u2019d hardly yet sipped. It was an exceptional vintage, of course, for he would offer nothing less to the patrons, especially on the opening night.</p><p>There were other forms of libation, of the fresh-blooded sort, too, of course. Dimitri did not stint on luxury, at least in his investments. The Puritan days of Oliver Cromwell were long gone.</p><p>But the one sort of vintage he didn\u2019t offer was that which Cezar Moldavi preferred: that of young children. Boys in particular, but either gender would do. Dimitri\u2019s mouth flattened with repugnance.</p><p>Only yesterday, word had filtered through Vienna of yet another child\u2019s body found in the woods. The girl\u2019s blood had been drained nearly away, and she\u2019d been left to die.</p><p>She\u2019d been eight.</p><p>The blame had been visited upon a group of Jews, as they were regularly accused of such a horror, but Dimitri knew better. Over the centuries, the Jews had been often accused of such blood libel\u2014of taking blood from Christian or even Muslim children and using it for their religious ceremonies. But, in fact, it was certain members of the Dracule who not only murdered the children, but also perpetuated that myth. Just one of those ways Lucifer created chaos among the mortals.</p><p>That was part of the reason Dimitri had dissolved his partnership with Cezar. There were many things about the life as a Dracule that were violent, unsavory and base, but child-bleeding was one thing he wouldn\u2019t look away from. Once he\u2019d learned of Moldavi\u2019s bloodthirsty propensity for children, he\u2019d released him as an investor in the gentleman\u2019s club.</p><p>\u201cWe are to disallow Moldavi entrance for any reason?\u201d replied Yfreto, the club\u2019s manager.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. He\u2019s not been invited,\u201d was Dimitri\u2019s reply, referring to tonight\u2019s festivities. \u201cNaturally that won\u2019t keep the dog-licker away, so \u2019tis best to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord. And, incidentally, we have more than half the private chests still available in the anteroom for the guests.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri nodded in approval. Everyone who entered must leave weapons\u2014stakes and swords in particular, along with all valuables, including jewelry and gemstones\u2014in a private chest. Each with its own key, which was then given to the patron. By placing such a wide moratorium on articles that entered the establishment, Dimitri would ensure that no rubies made it to his vicinity, while at the same time precluding any accidental stakings or other violence.</p><p>The Dracule were a particularly savage lot.</p><p>Aside of being savage, the Dracule were patrons of pleasure. Night after night, they drank and fed and fucked\u2014in as many different ways as they could, for there was none to stop them or to say them nay. That was, Dimitri had come to realize, the reason Lucifer had offered immortality to his earthly minions. When one had nothing to fear, when one had any and all sort of pleasure easily at hand, one became even more self-serving, greedy and base. Just the sort of person Lucifer would appreciate, and the sort who would do his bidding when and if he required it. Rather like an army\u2014or, perhaps more accurately, a society of agents\u2014in waiting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One could find such a superficial, hedonistic life unfulfilling, to be sure, so Dimitri had decided to combine business with pleasure. Thus, he\u2019d thrown some energy and funds into a private pleasure house designed specifically for the Dracule.</p><p>It was either that, or return to England.</p><p>He\u2019d been gone from that country more than twenty years. Ever since Meg\u2014for whom he\u2019d given everything\u2014had left him.</p> <p>During this, the opening night of his gentleman\u2019s club, nearly every chair was filled with Dracule and a select group of mortals who were allowed to associate with them. Men played draughts, backgammon or chess. Groups of candle stands clustered in corners and on tables, along with a few shallow bowls, covered and filled with glowing coals for lighting the opium pipes.</p><p>\u201cYou appear displeased, my lord. Is there something you lack?\u201d A slender hand smoothed over the back of Dimitri\u2019s shoulders and tickled the ends of his hair, bringing with it Lerina\u2019s familiar scent.</p><p>He looked up at her and lifted his whiskey glass. \u201cI have all I need right here.\u201d There might have been a flicker of affront in her eyes that she wasn\u2019t specifically included in his statement, but Dimitri wasn\u2019t certain. And he was sorry if it was the case. She was a beautiful woman, but she required more attention and care to maintain her happiness than he was able, or willing, to give.</p><p>Thanks to Meg.</p><p>The fresh bite marks on Lerina\u2019s shoulder were a testament to the attention and pleasure he\u2019d given her\u2014and, to be fair, she\u2019d given him\u2014earlier today. Lerina was one of those relatively rare mortals who craved the touch and bite of a vampire, particularly when such feeding was accompanied by coitus. And Dimitri was inclined to oblige since a man had to get his pleasure from somewhere.</p> <p>Yet...she hung on too much, touched him too much, talked too much, and when she did talk, it was of things he had no interest in: fashion and gossip and picnic outings. He never wore a wig, and had no interest in hearing about her trials and tribulations in finding a fashionable one. He didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever read a book. Like most women, her knowledge of history\u2014except for the most recent events here in Vienna with the Turkish siege\u2014was dismal. And once, early on, when he\u2019d actually thought she might help him forget Meg, he\u2019d expressed interest in obtaining a copy of Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s telescope to look at constellations, she\u2019d suggested that he invest in real diamonds instead of the ones in the sky.</p><p>Lerina\u2019s laughter, becoming more high-pitched, had begun to grate on his nerves. She simply wasn\u2019t interesting or stimulating, and nor was she silent and forgettable.</p><p>Aside of that, she had been trying to convince him that he should turn her Dracule\u2014so that they could live together forever.</p><p>Forever, Dimitri knew, was much too long to spend with any woman\u2014including Lerina. And when he thought about it in that way, he was almost relieved that Meg had left him. Almost.</p><p>And so, tomorrow, when the sun came up and the last of the patrons left, Dimitri intended to bid farewell to Lerina. He\u2019d send her off with a fat purse and three chests of fabrics, as well as the deed to a small house here in Vienna.</p><p>He looked up at that moment and saw Voss threading his way toward him. Voss had never been a particularly close associate of Dimitri\u2019s, for he was much more interested in seeing how many women he could feed on and bed, smoking opium, and generally drinking himself into a stupor, but they\u2019d played cards together more than a few times in London and Paris. He was charming enough, and didn\u2019t grate on Dimitri\u2019s nerves as much as unintelligent people did, but there was one problem with Voss. It was that, while Dimitri found him an amusing companion, he didn\u2019t trust him.</p> <p>\u201cCharming place, Dimitri,\u201d Voss said. He was holding a leather-wrapped parcel. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you a congratulatory gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you.\u201d He took the parcel and found a bottle of most excellent brandy wrapped up with a pewter goblet. The cup\u2019s craftsmanship was exquisite: detailed and yet masculine.</p><p>He would have set it aside, but Voss smiled. \u201cDo taste it tonight. I\u2019ve never had better. I thought perhaps you\u2019d be able to tell me from whence it comes.\u201d His eyes glinted with mischief.</p><p>Always agreeable to a challenge that exercised his mind, Dimitri agreed to the test. Holding his large, wide coat sleeve out of the way, Voss poured him a generous dollop in the pewter goblet, then, with a lifted brow for permission, poured himself a drink of the same in another glass.</p><p>Dimitri sipped from the brandy. It was excellent, indeed, and he fully enjoyed the warmth as it burned its way to his belly. Even Lerina\u2019s constant toying with the ends of his hair didn\u2019t detract from the pleasure of the excellent libation.</p><p>Voss had noticed, and had been admiring Lerina, of course, for a man would have to be blind not to notice her. But Dimitri saw that his admiration was merely objective, not possessive.</p><p>Aside of that, with Dimitri\u2019s marks, as well as his scent, on Lerina, no one would dare make an overture. It was a point of honor among the Dracule that no one fed upon\u2014let alone coupled or otherwise interacted with\u2014one who was marked. Whether it be mistress, servant, or other associate, a mark was a claim of possession not to be violated. Voss might be an arse, but he certainly wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>And the consideration that Voss might be interested in becoming Lerina\u2019s protector was rejected almost as instantly as Dimitri thought of it. The blond man wouldn\u2019t be interested in the obligation of maintaining one single woman. \u201cObligation\u201d and \u201cone\u201d being the detrimental modifiers.</p> <p>As Dimitri rolled a second sip of brandy around in his mouth, he realized with a start that it wasn\u2019t merely brandy. He swallowed, trying to place the additive. It wasn\u2019t blood, but it was nearly as pleasant.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided on the location of its vintage?\u201d Voss asked, watching him closely. \u201cSpain.\u201d But there is something else.</p><p>His companion\u2019s brows raised. \u201cIndeed. You do not disappoint me, Dimitri. But precisely where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to sample a bit more,\u201d he replied, moving now. Lerina\u2019s hands fell to his shoulder, but then she shifted onto the chair next to his and began to toy with the large, heavy buttons on his coat.</p><p>Dimitri was, thankfully, distracted for a moment by the approach of Yfreto, who needed his attention in the card room. By the time he returned to his seat after addressing the issue, Dimitri noticed that Voss had just returned, as well.</p><p>\u201cHave you had enough time to consider now?\u201d the latter asked, handing him the refilled goblet.</p><p>Dimitri sipped again, once again noting the additive. \u201cSalvi,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve added salvi.\u201d It was an herb m\u00e9lange that caused a heightened sense of pleasure and relaxation in a Dracule. For a mortal, however, it would put them to sleep in moments.</p><p>Voss inclined his head. \u201cIndeed. I thought a bit of additional enhancement might make it all that more difficult for you, expert as you are, to identify the genesis of the drink. But you\u2019ve yet to tell me\u2014where in Spain?\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted three more times during the course of their conversation, and the enjoyment of the very excellent brandy. Dimitri was feeling the effects of the salvi, and recognized the same in Voss\u2019s eyes. Just then, Dimitri\u2019s front steward approached, carrying an unfamiliar wooden chest. As he looked up to greet him, Dimitri noticed Voss suddenly go very still.</p><p>And as the chest came closer, he felt it.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d said the steward, opening the chest to reveal a set of pewter goblets, identical to the one Voss had given him, that Dimitri had drunk from and still held in his hand. \u201cI found these in the front alcove. Hidden behind the curtain.\u201d</p><p>With the coffer lying open, Dimitri was assaulted by the presence of a ruby. His chest became heavy, his breath thicker, his limbs slower. It took him only an instant to realize what Voss had intended. He\u2019d been swapping the cups, refilling each new one with brandy, all in an effort to see which cup caused him to display some weakness. Fury rose inside Dimitri as he turned his attention to Voss.</p><p>The other man lifted his glass in salute. \u201cA gift for my host. A collection of a dozen of the finest craftsmanship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Dimitri said. It took incredible effort for him to move and speak as if nothing was wrong, despite the fact that his companion was watching him closely. \u201cI wondered. And you expected to trick me thus?\u201d</p><p>It was just the sort of thing Voss did, purely for amusement.</p><p>Which was precisely why Dimitri had never fully trusted the man.</p><p>And why he would not, simply would not show any weakness. The ruby was far enough away, and obviously of an insignificant size, so that he wasn\u2019t completely paralyzed or weakened. Which implied, at least, that Voss meant him no real harm.</p><p>And then suddenly, Dimitri saw something else that drew his attention from the chagrined man in front of him.</p><p>Cezar Moldavi had just entered the chamber, surrounded by five of his companions.</p><p>Another problem to attend to, but one that much more delicate.</p><p>Silently Dimitri cursed Voss even more viciously. Not only was he impaired by a good portion of excellent brandy laced with salvi, but also by the presence of a ruby.</p><p>\u201cI would throttle you but I\u2019m afraid I have more imminent concerns to deal with. But you are no longer welcome here, Voss. See that he leaves,\u201d he added to the steward, forcing the words out as smoothly as he could.</p><p>Voss stood and gave a short little bow. But Dimitri no longer had any interest in him.</p><p>\u201cWho allowed that child-bleeder entrance?\u201d he growled, still in his seat. Even Lerina shifted away, seeing the warning in his face as he looked around for his manager. Where the bloody hell was Yfreto? \u201cI gave strict instructions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDimitri,\u201d said Moldavi, sweeping toward them boldly. \u201cYour place is quite accommodating.\u201d</p><p>The other man was slight of build, but neatly groomed. His unwigged and unpowdered dark hair was combed straight down over his forehead in the old style of a Crusader. He had a wide jaw and full lips, and he carried himself as if expecting to need to defend an attack at any moment. His shoulders hunched slightly, but his eyes never seemed to rest in one place for long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dimitri merely looked coolly at him. He made no move to rise, nor allowed any inflection into his voice. \u201cI hardly expected to see you here, Moldavi.\u201d Especially since Dimitri had dissolved their business partnership over a year ago, buying out his would-be partner while the building was still in the early stages of construction. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any children about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019s the pity,\u201d said Moldavi. His voice had a bit of a sibilant hiss due to an accident wherein his jaw hadn\u2019t healed properly. Rumor had it he\u2019d been beaten and left for dead by a band of his schoolmates. \u201cChildren have the sweetest, purest blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Dimitri replied, still concentrating on his breathing. The chest with the goblets was still on the floor nearby, but he would not give Voss\u2014who was taking his time leaving the chamber\u2014the satisfaction of confirming the man\u2019s trick. Revealing one\u2019s Asthenia was akin to acknowledging a flaccid cock or any other private weakness. Not to mention dangerous. \u201cI don\u2019t recall sending you an invitation, Cezar.\u201d</p> <p>The other man smiled unpleasantly, and a tiny gold fleck glinted in his left fang. \u201cI was certain it had been an oversight. You\u2019ve always been so inclusive of all of us. Which is why I brought a gift for you.\u201d He stepped aside and revealed a cloaked figure behind him.</p><p>Dimitri had never met Cezar\u2019s sister before, but there was no mistaking her, for her beauty was legendary among the Dracule. Narcise Moldavi was easily one of the most striking women living\u2014or immortal, as she happened to be. Her skin was smooth and ivory, and she had violet-blue eyes that were disconcertingly empty. Long, shiny black hair fell in lush waves over her shoulders. And her violet gown was made of some material that clung to her as if molded in the wind, revealing taut nipples, the jut of her hip bones, and even the swell of her mons venus. Other than a bracelet encircling her upper arm with a feather dangling from it, she wore no other adornment.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t because of Lerina\u2014or even Meg\u2014that Dimitri was unmoved, however. \u201cI have no interest in your leavings, Moldavi,\u201d he said. Despite the lure and lull of the salvi, there were a variety of reasons Narcise\u2019s presence had no impact on him, including the emptiness in her face. Although he\u2019d seen the brief flash of shame and anger in her eyes, Dimitri saw that it was clear she was under her brother\u2019s control. \u201cEspecially your sister. Although, she\u2019s not precisely your type, is she? You prefer to let others partake while you sniff out other amusements.\u201d Such as hard cocks and little children.</p><p>\u201cYou dare to insult my family?\u201d Moldavi\u2019s eyes burned with fury. His companions closed ranks, showing their fangs.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. The insult was directed to you alone,\u201d he replied. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d He made it a statement, not a question, and turned away from the repugnant man. Dimitri didn\u2019t trust himself to stand, but he had no fear of putting his back to Cezar Moldavi.</p> <p>At that moment, another of Dimitri\u2019s acquaintances, Lord Eddersley, approached, and took Voss\u2019s vacant seat.</p><p>\u201cIs all well?\u201d he asked Dimitri, eyeing Moldavi over his host\u2019s shoulder and then meeting his eyes.</p><p>Dimitri felt the shift in the air and the change in smell as Cezar Moldavi and his group moved on. He had no illusions that the man was actually going to leave the premises, but Dimitri wasn\u2019t inclined to make a scene. Not tonight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to prove anything, and Moldavi had obviously wished to make the point to his companions: that he could enter uninvited and disrupt Dimitri\u2019s evening. Engaging with the man would only fuel Moldavi\u2019s fire, and give him more attention than he deserved.</p><p>However, once Dimitri found out who\u2019d allowed the bastard in, there would be hell to pay. \u201cJust dealing with a nuisance,\u201d Dimitri replied to Eddersley as Lerina excused herself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s walked away, but he\u2019s not leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Dimitri nodded absently at Lerina as she turned to walk off, her hand sliding along his arm. \u201cAs I assumed.\u201d He picked up the bottle of brandy Voss had left, then set it back down. Perhaps it might be best if he stayed away from the salvi.</p><p>A short time later, Dimitri happened to look over just as two figures emerged from one of the shadowy alcoves that had been built to provide privacy.</p><p>His body went cold, then hot with anger, when he recognized them both. Cezar Moldavi and Lerina.</p><p>He was still watching when Moldavi looked over and met his eyes boldly, sending a message of smugness.</p><p>Dimitri tensed, his jaw setting. Now he understood.</p><p>And as the two strolled closer, he saw the marks on Lerina\u2019s left shoulder. The one that had been pristine and smooth earlier tonight. Confirmation of his suspicions.</p><p>Fury suffused him and his fingers curled around the arm of his chair. Such blatant disrespect couldn\u2019t go unchallenged\u2014for everyone in the place knew Lerina was marked by him. Dimitri rose to his feet.</p><p>The room swayed much more than he\u2019d expected, and he paused to bestow yet another curse on Voss for tampering with his mental faculties tonight. The chest with the ruby-studded goblet had been closed and taken away, but the salvi was quick, deep and strong...and, apparently, very long-lasting.</p> <p>His knees nearly buckled, but Dimitri allowed no weakness to show. With great effort, he kept himself upright and steady and focused his attention on Moldavi. In another moment, he\u2019d walk over to the man and confront him...</p><p>But as it turned out, that wasn\u2019t necessary. Moldavi certainly knew what he was doing, and he released Lerina as he drew near Dimitri. Sparing only a brief, cold glance at his mistress\u2014as of now, former mistress\u2014Dimitri focused on his past business partner. Now, he allowed his fangs to show and his eyes to burn.</p><p>Without either man saying a word, the room became hushed and tension stretched. Cards were laid on tables, drinks set down, chatter stopped. This was going to be a battle before witnesses.</p><p>\u201cFor one who arrived uninvited, you\u2019ve gone even beyond that disregard,\u201d Dimitri said, his voice calm and cold. His fist clenched and the room tilted a bit, but he was steadied by fury. \u201cYour insult is inexcusable.\u201d</p><p>Moldavi said nothing. He merely stepped closer, leaving his companions, including Narcise, to cluster behind him, watching. \u201cPerhaps if you had placed more value on the lovely lady, it wouldn\u2019t have come to this.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri flickered a glance at Lerina, and saw the combination of horror and shame on her face. What had likely begun as a petulant bid for his attention had turned into a grave mistake on her part, as well as that of Moldavi\u2019s.</p><p>He would deal with Lerina later.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d Dimitri said to him. \u201cOr I\u2019ll see that you do myself.\u201d</p><p>Moldavi flashed his gold-flecked fang. \u201cI should have been invited tonight. This was my investment as well, and your ridiculous sensibilities cost me a great amount of money. It\u2019s you who have made a grave insult. I merely repay you in kind, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not do business with a child-bleeder.\u201d Dimitri stepped toward him, and the next thing he knew, Moldavi was lunging.</p><p>With a stake in hand.</p><p>Dimitri dodged, still unsteady and fighting the spinning of the room, and then dove at his attacker. They bumped into a chair and table, sending them tumbling, as Dimitri smashed a fist into Moldavi\u2019s face.</p><p>The stake arced toward him, and he caught the glimpse of a countenance tight with fury and desperation as a powerful arm brought it down toward Dimitri\u2019s torso.</p><p>A shift aside, and the weapon slammed into his rib cage, the point burying deep. Pain shot through him, but at least he was feeling it and not dead\u2014which was what a stake to the heart would do to a Dracule. Instant death.</p><p>Enraged, Dimitri grabbed Moldavi\u2019s arm and yanked it, then whipped him across the room. The bone snapped as he released him and the other man tumbled into a heap.</p><p>Dimitri turned to see three of Moldavi\u2019s companions aligning themselves toward him, but before he needed to respond, Yfreto and four other footmen stepped in between them.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Dimitri ordered, taking a menacing step toward Moldavi.</p><p>Somehow, the room had righted itself...but he saw through burning eyes that everything was coated in red. The scents of fear and smoke filled his nose, and he turned just as someone screamed.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d</p><p>It was all over after that.</p><p>Even now, Dimitri remembered the sudden hot blaze, the smoke, the rage of the flames.</p><p>The fire had been started during the altercation with Cezar\u2014someone had knocked over candles or an opium bowl and the rich fabric had shot up in flames.</p><p>There was, of course, nothing that could be done except watch the place burn to the ground.</p><p>Dimitri and Eddersley discovered Lerina\u2019s body the next day. She was burned so badly it was only a remnant of her gown that identified her.</p><p>Shortly after that, Dimitri left Vienna and returned to England. Glad for an excuse to leave, sickened by the loss of life and property, disgusted by the actions of his fellow Dracule, and by his own foolish acceptance of Lucifer\u2019s bargain, he decided he was through with it all.</p><p>He wanted out.</p><p>He wanted his mortal life back.</p><p>5</p><p>IN WHICH OUR HERO MAKES A REVELATION</p><p>Maia awoke with a start.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d finally fallen asleep, worried as she was about Angelica and Chas, but she must have done, for the world had become dark and silvered blue with moonlight.</p><p>Her heart was racing, and her skin warm and damp. Sitting bolt upright, she reached to touch her shoulder, the side of her neck, her throat. Her pulse pounded furiously as she looked at her reflection in the mirror across the room.</p><p>Nothing. There was nothing there.</p><p>Her shoulder and neck reflected back at her, pale and almost ghostly, shadowed where her clavicle rose, but unblemished. The long braid of her hair hung over one side, making a darker stripe down over her pale pink night rail.</p><p>Maia\u2019s eyes looked like wide dark circles and her mouth a paler one.</p><p>It had seemed so real. The burn of his mouth, sliding over her lips, tasting and sucking on them...the heat had been intense, undulating through her so that the nightgown clung to her damp skin. His lips moved to her jaw, to her ear, down to the soft, hidden curve of her neck...and then the flash of pleasure-pain when his fangs penetrated her skin and released the blood pulsing in its channel. She remembered the dream, remembered arching, sighing, feeling the shimmering warmth draining from her veins as his hot mouth closed over her skin, and sipped. Licked. Nuzzled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She touched the side of her neck again, and pulled away, looking at her hand for the blood that wasn\u2019t there. Her fingers brushed over her lips in an echo of the kiss. Her heart still pounded and her chest felt flushed and full. And down low, an insistent throbbing, a hot reminder of the intensity of her dream.</p><p>It put her in mind of that shocking interlude with the Knave of Diamonds...so warm and liquid like. Intense.</p><p>Maia didn\u2019t need to throw back her covers; she must have kicked them off during the dream. She dropped her feet to the floor, relieved to feel the relative cool of polished wood beneath them. During the summer, she had no need of a rug to warm the floor. Her night rail fell in a light cloud to just over her feet, loosening and allowing a bit of air to relieve her heated skin.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t banish the dream; and in fact, Maia realized she clung to the memories that were now sliding into mere wisps. She\u2019d never seen his face, the shadowy man who came to her, whose weight she\u2019d sworn had been pressing her into the mattress only moments before. She still felt his imprint on her body. Heavy. Hot.</p><p>But she was clearly alone. Clearly the victim...or perhaps recipient was a better term...of a mere dream. A most realistic one, but a dream nevertheless.</p><p>And why she was dreaming about phantom vampires visiting in her chamber when she\u2019d received such happy news today, Maia couldn\u2019t understand. At last she\u2019d gotten word that Alexander was coming home and should arrive within a week. Perhaps sooner.</p><p>Before she opened the letter from him, she\u2019d been over come by apprehension. She\u2019d nearly put it aside to open later, at night, when, if the news was bad\u2014if he\u2019d changed his mind or wasn\u2019t coming back\u2014she\u2019d be able to stay in her chamber alone with it for a bit. The last thing she wanted was for Corvindale to see her humiliation or grief.</p><p>She\u2019d held it, looked at the crinkled envelope, folded and a bit dusty and stained from its long journey, and considered how she would react if it wasn\u2019t good news. What she would do to hide her pain. And then Maia had to wonder why she was so worried about it. Alexander had never given her any indication that he didn\u2019t hold her in high esteem. Certainly there\u2019d been the faintest whiff of scandal attached to her after the Incident with Mr. Virgil, but she\u2019d been so careful and had acted the epitome of propriety since. Alexander had come on the scene more than a year later and if he\u2019d heard whisperings about it, the incident hadn\u2019t seemed to bother him.</p> <p>But if he were to call off the engagement...Maia\u2019s stomach twisted. She\u2019d lost her parents, too, and although this would be nothing like the pain she\u2019d experienced then, it would be devastating. The announcement had already been made. It would be a scandal if her engagement was broken, for what ever reason. A terrible scandal.</p><p>When she opened the letter and read his brief note, her fears had ebbed. I shall be home within the week. At long last.</p><p>That made it sound as if he\u2019d missed her, didn\u2019t it?</p><p>Just then, she heard a new sound on the moonlit street below. It sounded like a carriage door opening, and Maia rushed to the open window when she heard voices. Had Angelica returned?</p><p>She looked down and saw a hooded and cloaked female figure climbing up the front steps as the carriage rumbled off. Please let her be Angelica!</p><p>Maia didn\u2019t hesitate. She slipped quietly out of her chamber, heedless of her bare feet and flowing nightgown, hurrying silently down the corridor to the stairs. But by the time she got halfway down the angular staircase, pausing on the landing at the second floor, she recognized the voices below.</p> <p>Not Angelica.</p><p>A door closed on the lower level, and she heard the businesslike tread of solid footsteps coming from the corridor where the earl\u2019s study was located. The last person she wanted to encounter was Corvindale, so Maia turned and started to climb back up. Worry and disappointment replaced the momentary surge of hope, but then she heard something that made her pause.</p><p>\u201c\u2014from Dewhurst,\u201d wafted up an unfamiliar feminine voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the message?\u201d Corvindale replied, his words rising clearly.</p><p>Maia crept back across the landing and started down the next flight, aware that her feet would be in view of whomever was in the foyer should they look up. Don\u2019t look up.</p><p>\u201cHe bids you come retrieve the girl,\u201d said the woman, who was obviously the messenger. \u201cFrom Black Maude\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Corvindale\u2019s curse was sharp and vulgar. \u201cShe\u2019s at Black Maude\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Maia saw the top of his head as he whirled and started off, presumably back down the corridor in preparation for leaving.</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d Maia said, surging faster down the steps.</p><p>He turned up his face and their eyes caught as she hurried down, and for a moment, Maia felt the breath knocked out of her. Him.</p><p>No, impossible. She forced herself to breathe, to pull her attention from his glittering dark eyes. He was dressed in a white shirt that sagged and a loose neckcloth, as usual.</p><p>\u201cMiss Woodmore,\u201d he said, but his voice wasn\u2019t nearly as cold as it usually was. \u201cI presume you heard the conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he began, but she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s my sister. She might need me. Who knows...\u201d</p><p>Her voice threatened to break, a combination of desperation and fear weakening it. \u201cWho knows what he\u2019s done to her.\u201d</p><p>Corvindale held her gaze for much too long and then snapped, \u201cYou have three minutes to dress yourself appropriately.\u201d He turned away and stalked off.</p><p>Maia looked down, having momentarily forgotten her state of dishabille, and realized that the moonlight streaming over her had highlighted the flimsy fabric of her summer gown and her bare feet.</p><p>Three minutes wasn\u2019t nearly enough time, but she would manage it. She had no doubt that Corvindale would leave without her.</p><p>Dimitri hadn\u2019t expected the ever-proper Miss Woodmore to meet his deadline, so he was surprised and annoyed when, precisely three minutes later, she came tearing down the stairs. That was the thing about her. She was constantly surprising him with her stubbornness, and, much as he hated to admit it, her wit. Even when he became his most earlish, she didn\u2019t back down.</p><p>A quick glance told him that she actually carried her shoes, and that some loose cloaklike garment was draped over a frock that he suspected wasn\u2019t completely done up, for Luce\u2019s sake, and he had a moment of serious regret.</p><p>If he\u2019d given her a bit more time, she might not have presented herself partially clothed. Although whatever she\u2019d donned would be an improvement over the transparent pink thing she\u2019d been wearing earlier.</p><p>Without a word, he gestured for her to precede him out the side door where his footman was waiting with the landau. He\u2019d chosen to be driven in the closed carriage rather than to drive himself for a variety of reasons\u2014the least of which was the benefit of having another set of male hands if assistance was needed to procure Angelica\u2014but now as he climbed into the very small, close space with Miss Woodmore and they started off, he regretted that decision. He should have had Iliana join them, for she was nearly as welcome a set of hands as a man. As well, she wielded a stake rather well for a mortal woman.</p><p>His companion, a very different sort of mortal woman than Iliana, but no less stubborn or intent, was busy putting her shoes on. The cloak had slipped from her shoulders confirming that, yes indeed, her dress sagged because it wasn\u2019t properly done up in the back. From what he knew of current fashion, it was unlikely that she\u2019d had the time or ability to even pull on a corset and that was not a comforting thought.</p><p>Dimitri settled into his seat across from her and focused his eyes anywhere but there.</p><p>The aversion of his gaze didn\u2019t help matters much, for in such an enclosed space the blasted woman\u2019s presence was not to be ignored. The essence of a spice like cardamom or perhaps something even more exotic mingled with some sweet floral like lily of the valley, along with female musk and the crisp clean cotton of her frock, creating that potency he found impossible to dismiss. How in the bloody hell could a woman smell like a damned spice cabinet and a garden and still be so enticing?</p><p>Either slumber or her hurried dressing had mussed up her hair so that flyaway strands sprung from the braid that hung over one shoulder.</p><p>One ivory-blue shoulder, bared and pristine.</p><p>Elegantly curved. Brushed with a swath of moon, and then shadow, and then streetlight with the motion of the carriage.</p><p>Dimitri jerked his gaze away. He swallowed hard, felt the throbbing of his gums as he tried to keep his fangs sheathed and the rest of him from stirring. Satan\u2019s black bones, he was as bad as a green boy with his first whore. Even with Meg he hadn\u2019t experienced such a lack of control.</p><p>Pressing himself back against the seat squab, he angled his left shoulder so that the hard edge of the cushion frame dug into the throbbing, painful Mark on his skin, adding to the constant agony with which he lived. The deep, sharp response was a welcome distraction.</p><p>Yet...his thoughts would not be suppressed so easily. It would be nothing to reach across and close his hands over smooth, fine skin. Lower his face to hers again, taste her lips again, fill his hands with soft, silky flesh. Heaven. His nostrils flared automatically as she moved, sending a renewed waft of her scent into him and her gown shifting tauntingly.</p><p>With great effort, he kept his eyes from burning red and hungry. His fangs were extended, but still hidden. It\u2019s been too long.</p><p>A hundred and thirteen years. Three months. Five days.</p><p>His Mark twinged sharp and hot.</p><p>It should have gotten easier. It shouldn\u2019t be this impossible to keep from needing something he hadn\u2019t had for so long\u2014especially since he no longer made the mistake of starving himself. But the saliva pooled in his mouth and his heart thudded in his chest. His skin prickled and his muscles leaped beneath, as if coiling up and ready to spring.</p><p>It was her proximity. The fact that they were so close and intimate in this small vehicle. The fact that only last night he\u2019d allowed her to taunt him into kissing those damned full, top-heavy lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His unease was also due to the fact that moments before Voss\u2019s messenger had arrived tonight, Dimitri had been dreaming. Slumped in a chair, in his study, dreaming that he was arching over a slender, ivory body, filling his hands with feminine curves, tasting the warmth of her mouth...sinking into a virginal white neck, drinking the rich lifeblood as she moaned and writhed, pressing herself against\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Miss Woodmore\u2019s question yanked Dimitri from the dark vortex of his thoughts. He swallowed hard, grateful for the redirection. Angelica. At Black Maude\u2019s. \u201cBillingsgate.\u201d</p> <p>Pulling the cloak back up to her shoulders, she commenced with some odd contortions that he realized were her attempts to do up her dress.</p><p>Dimitri made a sharp disgusted sound. \u201cTurn around, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he said. \u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to his, her eyes rising in a lowered face that made her look even more shocked. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be best if you didn\u2019t. Think,\u201d he added for clarification as much for himself as for her. Because when she huffed and turned around to present him with her back, his newly ungloved hands trembled.</p><p>Perhaps not the most intelligent decision he\u2019d ever made, but this entire farce had commenced with a foolish decision six years ago, when he agreed to act as guardian to Chas Woodmore\u2019s sisters. That had been before he\u2019d ever seen or met any of them.</p> <p>Not that he supposed he could have denied Chas\u2019s request anyway. Especially if he had seen them. For Dimitri always did what was right. He did what honor demanded, despite the searing reminder of the devil\u2019s Mark on his back.</p><p>Miss Woodmore\u2019s skin was warm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t exactly touch it, not directly, but he could feel it through the thin fabric. And perhaps a fingertip brushed over its smooth silkiness when he buttoned the first button at her nape. A finger might also have brushed the curve that swept down to her shoulder. Nothing like his own, roped with the rootlike Lucifer\u2019s Mark, scarred and dusted with erratic hair.</p><p>He was quick, his fingers nimble, his fangs thrust out so far his gums hurt, filling his mouth. Her scent, the light brush from the hair swept over the back of her neck, the heat from her skin and the confirmation that she wore no corset made his gaze tinge red.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to remind himself who she was: his ward, whom he was bound to protect. A mortal. A chit who infuriated him for any number of reasons. A young woman preparing for her wedding to a fine gentleman. The sister of one of his friends.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t who she was, or who she wasn\u2019t, for if Dimitri wanted her\u2014wanted anyone\u2014he\u2019d have her. He\u2019d lull her and coax her and ease her in. Simple as that, and damn whoever or whatever got in his way.</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t. Want. Anyone.</p><p>He\u2019d given it all up decades ago. He was an island.</p><p>And he\u2019d remain that way until he discovered a way to put himself back the way he was, or until he died.</p><p>As soon as Dimitri finished, he removed his hands and tucked himself into the deepest corner of his seat, cursing Voss anew for everything he could think of: for taking Angelica, for whatever he\u2019d done to her in the interim and for choosing a place to hide so far from Blackmont Hall that the ride was interminable.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s happening?\u201d Miss Woodmore demanded. Apparently, in her eyes, fully clothed was fully armed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Dimitri sounded bored even to himself, and was rewarded when his companion sat bolt upright in her seat and fairly quivered with indignation and fury. How her eyes snapped and snarled, and she wasn\u2019t even Dracule.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly do, my lord. You aren\u2019t a bit obtuse. Were those really vampirs at the masquerade ball last night?\u201d</p><p>Damn and blast and Lucifer\u2019s head on a pike. Had the staff been talking? Of course they knew all about their master and his lifestyle, but they were well-paid to keep their mouths shut\u2014particularly around Mirabella, who had no idea about her own history with the Dracule. She\u2019d been too young to remember anything when Dimitri took her in. Or could Iliana have slipped some information?</p> <p>Dimitri waved an impatient hand. \u201cIf you must know, yes.</p><p>I suppose I\u2019d best answer your question or you\u2019ll never leave me be.\u201d</p><p>Miss Woodmore\u2019s breath caught audibly and she sagged back against her seat. Apparently she hadn\u2019t expected such immediate confirmation. \u201cVampirs? They\u2019re real? They truly do exist? Why are we in danger from them?\u201d</p><p>He wavered for a moment, then chose the path of least resistance\u2014in this case, meaning the path of fewer questions. \u201cCezar Moldavi is a vampire and because he is angry with your brother, he\u2019s looking for you and your sisters.\u201d He used the English term for the Dracule despite the fact that Miss Woodmore was somehow aware of the Hungarian pronunciation of vampir.</p><p>\u201cSonia, too?\u201d Maia gasped, eyes growing wide. She looked as if she were about to erupt from her seat and charge off to Scotland.</p><p>\u201cBe still, Miss Woodmore. I\u2019ve already ascertained that your youngest sister is safe, and I\u2019ve made the necessary arrangements so that she will remain so. A convent school is an excellent sanctuary for one who wishes to hide from vampires. They can\u2019t cross such a holy threshold.\u201d He eyed her narrowly, forcing himself to ignore that increased pulsing on his shoulder. \u201cPerhaps you might consider joining her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed not!\u201d she replied, her shocked, fearful expression dissolving. \u201cI know you don\u2019t wish for Angelica and me to burden you any further\u2014and you are not alone in this opinion, for it\u2019s my fondest wish as well\u2014but I am not about to be shipped off to St. Bridie\u2019s. Alexander\u2014Mr. Bradington\u2014will be arriving within a week, for I just received a letter today and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the erstwhile groom is at last returning to our little island here.\u201d A flash of distaste soured his belly. The man was welcome to the termagant sitting across from him. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be bringing dressmakers in and speaking to flower-sellers and cake-makers, and there will be all sorts of activity disrupting my household, now that you\u2019ve continued to rearrange my library.\u201d He glared out the window, ignoring the way the moonlight seemed to turn her rich chestnut-bronze hair to silver.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but Dimitri dared not let her. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he said, shifting in his seat and turning his scowl on her. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay in the carriage, Miss Woodmore. Black Maude\u2019s is no place for a proper young lady.\u201d</p><p>Her pointed chin lifted as if pulled on a string, and her eyes narrowed. \u201cMy sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Woodmore,\u201d he said, allowing his voice to go low and silky, \u201cyou of all people know what can happen to a woman if she is seen where she should not be seen.\u201d He fixed her with his gaze. \u201cDo you not?\u201d</p><p>Even in the faulty light he could see the range of emotions that flashed across her face: shock, first\u2014the bald, blanching of widening eyes and parted lips. Then mortification and chagrin as she struggled to keep her chin up and her eyes from skittering away, and at last, fury.</p><p>\u201cSo you do remember,\u201d she said through a stiff jaw. Ah, the woman put on a good face, especially when she was backed into a corner. He had to give her credit for that.</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to remind me of my unfortunate near-mishap. What was it, three years past?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri spread his hands and fingers in a blas\u00e9 motion. \u201cI don\u2019t quite recall the details,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than the fact that you were dressed in boy breeches with your hair tucked up under a cap, and were attempting to enter a very disreputable area of Haymarket.\u201d</p><p>And that the man who\u2019d taken her there, the bollocks-sucking William Virgil, would have compromised her if they\u2019d been seen\u2014or worse if they hadn\u2019t. Much worse.</p><p>\u201cI was never certain whether you had recognized me or not,\u201d Miss Woodmore was saying in a surprisingly cowed voice. \u201cI had rather hoped that no one had.\u201d</p><p>But Dimitri had indeed recognized Miss Woodmore\u2014by her scent when he passed by, which, he supposed, was why it was burned into the insides of his nostrils so that he couldn\u2019t dismiss it, devil take it. Especially when they were in such close quarters as this blasted carriage.</p><p>Miss Woodmore didn\u2019t recall much of that evening; Dimitri had made certain of it afterward by utilizing his thrall. She couldn\u2019t remember that she\u2019d actually walked into an establishment not very different than Black Maude\u2019s. One that catered to the particular tastes of men who craved young, virginal women. Reluctant, young, virginal women.</p><p>The more reluctant, the better.</p><p>It was a residence that she would never have been able to leave if Dimitri hadn\u2019t intervened.</p><p>And Miss Woodmore certainly didn\u2019t remember how three men and the madam of the place had attempted to keep Dimitri from removing her from the premises. And how he\u2019d scooped up Miss Woodmore whilst baring his fangs and blazing his eyes and applying his brute force to pummel those repugnant people.</p><p>And how he\u2019d very nearly used his fangs, for the first time in a century. Not to feed, but to destroy. To tear them into shreds.</p><p>No, Miss Woodmore couldn\u2019t remember him carrying her breeches-clad body back safely with him, ignoring what would be a scandalous display of curves and a torn shirt if anyone were to see her. The only thing she would remember was him helping her into a hackney and escorting her back to Woodmore.</p><p>That journey was the first time he\u2019d been subjected to Miss Woodmore\u2019s tart, insistent tongue.</p><p>As a result of his forethought and expediency, the entirety of her scandal was that she\u2019d been seen in breeches and out at night without a chaperone, in the company of a disreputable male\u2014and that, only by the Earl of Corvindale. And, naturally, he didn\u2019t lower himself to spread gossip.</p><p>Dimitri considered it a favor to Chas that he\u2019d handled it thus, and a favor to Miss Woodmore that he\u2019d never divulged the details to her brother. It was too bad that she wasn\u2019t aware of all he\u2019d done, for perhaps she would be a bit more appreciative if she were, he thought as he examined her balefully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, on the other hand, he sincerely doubted that she would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wondered what possessed you to do such a foolish thing, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he said in the tone of a schoolmaster speaking to a student. \u201cYou, who are known for your extreme adherence to Society\u2019s standards, and who wouldn\u2019t even consider dancing two dances with the same partner on a night. Or who would never be seen without her gloves, even if they were spotted due to an unfortunate accident with an inkwell. And wasn\u2019t there an occasion when you refused\u2014albeit with extreme courtesy\u2014to speak to Mr. Gilbertson because you hadn\u2019t been properly introduced?\u201d</p><p>And then it all went to hell, because she looked at him suddenly. Sharply. Her eyelids at half-mast, and with an unpleasant gleam in them. \u201cMy goodness, Lord Corvindale. I had no idea how closely you followed my reputation.\u201d</p> <p>He was saved from having to respond as the carriage stopped in the filthy alley behind Black Maude\u2019s. Dimitri wasted no time in making his exit.</p><p>Maia took no trouble to muffle her annoyed footsteps as she approached Corvindale\u2019s bedchamber door. It would serve him right if he heard them pounding along the corridor.</p><p>It was well past noon the morning after they\u2019d retrieved Angelica from the horrible, dirty, scandalous place called Black Maude\u2019s, and Maia was tired of waiting for the earl to drag himself from slumber. She needed to talk to someone about her sister, about what had happened.</p><p>She could hardly fathom it. It was simply inconceivable that Angelica had not only been bitten by one of those vampirs...but that it was Lord Dewhurst. How could that be? How could a member of the ton be a vampir?</p><p>There were these creatures\u2014who, impossibly, actually existed\u2014and they were after her and her sister, no one would tell her anything of substance, and her brother was missing and Alexander was coming home, but his letter hadn\u2019t really said anything to make her feel certain that he still loved her...and she felt so lonely.</p> <p>So alone.</p><p>Maia swallowed as the prickle of a frustrated tear burned the corner of her eye. She didn\u2019t want to be in charge any more. She didn\u2019t want to have to handle this\u2014whatever this was\u2014on her own. She didn\u2019t know how. She didn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>And she was more than a bit frightened. Vampirs attacking and killing people at a masquerade, and one of them a member of the peerage. And then one of them abducting her sister! According to Angelica, Dewhurst\u2014or Voss, as she\u2019d called the viscount (which was a warning sign in itself)\u2014wasn\u2019t one of the angry, evil vampirs who\u2019d killed three people at the Sterlinghouses\u2019 ball. Through this, Maia realized that Angelica had come to care for the man, only to learn that he was not only a rake, but a vampir, as well.</p><p>Definitely not someone she ever wanted Angelica to encounter again.</p><p>Maia shook her head and swallowed again, blinking hard. She\u2019d had to deal with the death of their parents when she and her sisters were still in short skirts, and to help them get on without Mama and Papa. Chas was so absent that it all fell to her, all the time.</p><p>All the time. All of the problems. She\u2019d been in charge for as long as she could remember, and normally she liked it. Liked managing things, solving problems, taking care of people. It made her feel as if she had some sort of control over her life.</p> <p>But this...this was simply too confusing for her to handle alone. Too confusing, and too dangerous.</p><p>For the first time she could remember, Maia was frightened.</p><p>And there was no one else for her to turn to except Corvindale. Much as she hated the thought.</p><p>She was not going to show the earl weakness, but she was going to get some answers. Could he know that Dewhurst was a vampir? Was that why he\u2019d been so coldly furious about Angelica\u2019s disappearance with the viscount?</p><p>Incensed at the thought that he\u2019d kept that information from her, she held on to that emotion and drew in a deep breath. \u201cCorvindale!\u201d she called, knocking firmly on his chamber door.</p><p>She waited, and heard nothing from within. But she knew he was there\u2014Greevely, the earl\u2019s valet, had told her. But only after she\u2019d stared him down. That expression of determination and haughtiness was a learned one that she\u2019d had to adopt in order to handle their affairs while Chas was gone. It worked without fail.</p><p>Except, it seemed, with the earl.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale! I must speak with you!\u201d she said, knocking harder and more vehemently. She\u2019d been more than patient, waiting for him to drag his lazy bones from his chamber.</p> <p>\u201cCorvindale!\u201d Her sister\u2019s well-being was at stake, not to mention Maia\u2019s own concerns.</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d His bellow nearly shook the rafters, but Maia was not to be thwarted. She\u2019d sat up all night, holding her sister so that Angelica could sleep without fear. And twice, the poor thing had awakened from nightmares.</p><p>Maia drew in a deep breath and turned the doorknob, cracking the door. She wasn\u2019t quite brave enough to look inside, although she could see that the room was swathed in darkness. \u201cCorvindale, I must speak with you. It\u2019s nearly two o\u2019clock and I\u2019ve been waiting all morning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Miss Woodmore. If you must speak with me, you can wait until this evening.\u201d</p><p>Maia gritted her teeth. It wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t had to roust her brother once or twice or several times in the past.</p><p>It was one thing to sleep until noon after a late night at the theater or his club, but when he hadn\u2019t stirred by midafternoon, and there were pressing problems to be solved...</p><p>She opened the door a bit wider, and the bright spill of light from the day made a long, narrow wedge on the floor and over the foot of a heavy wooden bed. The chamber smelled a bit like tobacco, along with lemon or bergamot and something clean and spicy\u2014possibly from his soap or hair pomade, although she couldn\u2019t be certain if Corvindale even used pomade. His hair never seemed to be shiny or stiff from such an application and it certainly didn\u2019t stay in place for very long and instead seemed to curl up and around at the edges and his ears.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale! It\u2019s imperative that I speak with you. This is a matter that cannot wait, and if you do not come out then I will come in.\u201d</p><p>There. That ought to bring him forth. If Maia knew one thing about men, she knew that they didn\u2019t like to have their bedchambers invaded by the fairer sex.</p><p>Except for their wives and mistresses, she supposed. And for some reason, her face flushed hot. What if he had a woman in there with him? A mental image of tangled sheets and a bare-chested man next to an equally bare woman made her cheeks even hotter.</p><p>Did unmarried earls actually bring those sorts of women into their homes? Or did they visit them at outside establishments? Or did he have a regular mistress?</p><p>How could a woman even stand to spend any length of time with his rude, controlling self? She supposed that while they were engaging in such activities, perhaps he wasn\u2019t talking quite so much. Her cheeks burned hotter.</p><p>\u201cI am abed, Miss Woodmore, and have no intention of leaving it. If you insist upon speaking with me at this time, then don\u2019t let something as ridiculous as propriety keep you out.\u201d</p><p>Well, that made it sound as if he was alone. She drew in a deep breath and inched the door open farther, curling her fingers around the edge as much to keep it in position as to force herself to move forward. \u201cMy lord, I must speak with you regarding Angelica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to come in. I can\u2019t hear what you are saying.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened on the edge of the door. She could just picture the contrary smile on his arrogant face\u2014at least, she would if she could even fathom the man smiling. Which seemed an impossibility. He was playing with her, pushing her. Hoping to run her off.</p><p>Vile man. I\u2019ll show you who\u2019s not afraid of you and your bedchamber.</p><p>Still holding the edge of the door, she stepped fully onto the threshold, the door opening into a wide angle. She glanced at him once, then swiftly looked away, and her cheeks burst into flame. He was naked, and the image that she\u2019d seen for only the briefest moment was burned into her brain.</p><p>And it was much more fascinating\u2014no, no, intimidating\u2014than her previous, mental one.</p><p>Try as she might, closing her eyes, blinking, looking into the depths of the shadowy room, she couldn\u2019t banish the image of him sitting up, lounging against the head of the bed. The sheets were low, down to his waist, and a broad, very hairy chest and muscular arms showed dark against the white sheets. Maia tried to swallow, and her throat made an odd creaking sound because it was so dry. She felt all sorts of fluttering, hot feelings inside.</p><p>At last she found her voice. \u201cThis is exceedingly untoward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Miss Woodmore?\u201d He was taunting her. Definitely taunting her. \u201cSurely the sight of a man\u2019s torso isn\u2019t all that upsetting to a woman who is due to be married in short order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could cover yourself,\u201d she said from between unmoving jaws.</p><p>\u201cI see no reason to do so. Now what is it you must speak with me about?\u201d</p><p>He really is the vilest man. She refused to look at him. Absolutely refused to allow her peripheral vision to scan over the impossibly square angle of his shoulders, outlined so well by the pale bedcoverings.</p><p>Maia continued, turning her attention to the matter at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Angelica. She\u2019s been bitten by a...by one of those creatures that came to the masquerade ball. Vampirs. And she had horrible nightmares last night, my lord. I held her all night long, and she cried and thrashed.\u201d Her voice turned rough and she had to swallow hard to keep it steady. Despite her own dream of being bitten\u2014a dream, a memory, that hadn\u2019t fully left her and still wrapped itself slyly around her consciousness\u2014she knew that Angelica\u2019s experience had not been the hot, sensual one of her dream. \u201cShe won\u2019t tell me precisely what happened, but I fear that the worst has been done.\u201d If Dewhurst had ravished and ruined her sister, Maia would go after him herself, vampir or no. If Aunt Iliana could do it somehow, carrying a stake and presumably using it, so could Maia. \u201cNot to mention...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shuffled under the bedcoverings, and she heard the crisp shift of the starched sheets. \u201cI\u2019m aware of all that you\u2019ve told me, Miss Woodmore. And if you find it reassuring, your sister has assured me that...er...there is no reason to demand satisfaction or that Dewhurst come up to snuff. She is intact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to snuff? I should hope not!\u201d Maia exclaimed, forgetting herself and glancing at him. His face didn\u2019t seem to have the same arrogance she was used to. Was the man softening, or was it merely the result of being awakened? \u201cEven if he did\u2014well...I would never...Chas would never...allow him to come near her again.\u201d Angelica compromised and wed to a vampir? Never.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have forgotten that I am Angelica\u2019s guardian at this time,\u201d Corvindale said. The arrogance was back.</p> <p>And so was her fury with him. God rot Chas for sticking her and Angelica with this impossible man as a temporary guardian. \u201cAs I said, my lord, I would not allow it.\u201d</p><p>He shifted and the sheet slipped farther. Maia tore her gaze away, but not before she saw...oh, God, a hip? A flat, ridged belly...and the shadow of something lower? She\u2019d felt Alexander\u2019s chest before, of course, through his shirt...and, once, under it...but she hadn\u2019t really seen it. And even if she had, she didn\u2019t think it looked quite so...dark. And imposing. And\u2014</p><p>Maia swallowed hard, and focused on the heavy curtains obscuring his window. She needed some answers, and she was going to get them\u2014even if the man strode naked from his bed to come over and close the door himself. \u201cWhat is my brother doing? How long has he been involved with these creatures? And what is your involvement, my lord? Do you associate with them, as well? Did you know that Dewhurst was one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not concern yourself with me, or the other details, Miss Woodmore. All you need know is that you and your sisters are safe under my care, here at Blackmont Hall and at St. Bridie\u2019s, too. As for your brother...when he returns, I\u2019m certain that he will answer at least some of your questions. And I am hopeful that he will do so in short order. Now, is there anything else, Miss Woodmore? This conversation hardly seems worth interrupting my sleep and threatening your reputation. Or is your reputation no longer a concern for you, now that you are off the marriage mart?\u201d</p><p>She snapped upright and once again turned to look at him, meeting his eyes head-on. \u201cYou are beyond vile, Lord Corvindale,\u201d she whispered in a purely heartfelt tone.</p> <p>And the man actually had the nerve to grin at her. A cool, arrogant smirk.</p><p>Very well, then, my lord. You might be the gentleman, but I have my own ways of smirking right back at you.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale, I insisted on speaking with you because I felt you should know all of the information. I had hoped you\u2019d do the courtesy of telling me what is happening and why. But apparently you cannot be bothered to do even that.\u201d</p><p>She drew her shoulders back, and settled her hand on a hip, digging her fingers into her flesh in an effort to keep from curling them around his neck.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t going to give her the information she wanted, she was going to make his life as difficult as she could, including opening the curtains in every window in the house. And putting vases with flowers on every table. And reordering all of the books in his library. And... \u201cI also wanted to speak with you because it will be of the utmost importance that Angelica is seen out and in Society. This must happen as soon as possible so as to combat any rumors or on dits that might have begun since she disappeared after the masquerade. That is the only way to preserve her reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this concerns me, how?\u201d He sounded deeply bored.</p> <p>Maia gave him her own version of an arrogant smile. \u201cBecause you must be seen out and about with us. Quite a lot. In the next few days. In order to ensure that Angelica\u2019s reputation isn\u2019t besmirched, we will need the presence of an earl.\u201d Not that she was going to enjoy being in his company that much, but if she\u2019d learned one thing about the earl, it was that he hated being bothered by people.</p><p>Any people, for any reason.</p><p>Going out in Society for the next several nights, due to his duty\u2014which he\u2019d also demonstrated was something he would not shirk\u2014was going to be a most unpleasant experience for him.</p><p>Thus, she would enjoy every minute of it.</p><p>She turned to go, and then paused to look over her shoulder. \u201cI shall determine which invitations we will accept, my lord, and then advise your valet so that he can see you are properly dressed for the occasions.\u201d</p><p>And she would make certain that she would pick the most crowded, flamboyant events to attend. Just because she could.</p><p>With that, she walked out of his chamber and closed the door with finality.</p><p>6</p> <p>IN WHICH OUR HEROINE MAKES A CONFESSION</p><p>\u201cAngelica?\u201d Maia rushed out of her bedchamber, hair swinging loosely, nightgown bunching around her feet. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been in a half slumber, spiraling into that warm, red world of sensuality that seemed to lure her every night as of late. It was the first night since her return from Black Maude\u2019s that Angelica had slept in her own bed, and Maia had kept her ears attuned for any sounds of distress from her sister\u2019s chamber...until she slipped into her dreams.</p><p>There must have been something that woke her, for when she came out into the hall, she nearly collided with Angelica.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d her sister said, obviously surprised to see Maia.</p><p>\u201cI was coming to check on you,\u201d she said, looking at Angelica\u2019s wide eyes and pale face. Something had happened. Something more than a dream... Then she noticed something in her sister\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s that in your hand? A stick?\u201d</p><p>But even as she said it, she understood. It wasn\u2019t merely a stick in Angelica\u2019s hand, held close to the folds of her night gown, but a stake. Meant to stab a vampir. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. She looked at her sister and their eyes met. The poor darling! She\u2019d had such a horrible experience.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing awake?\u201d Angelica asked.</p><p>\u201cI came to check on you. What\u2019s happened?\u201d Maia asked, grabbing Angelica\u2019s hand and allowing her to lead the way back to Maia\u2019s chamber.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d Angelica replied. But Maia noticed that she glanced covertly back toward her chamber, as if expecting to see something. Or someone coming out of the door. \u201cThat Vo\u2014that Dewhurst came into my chamber at night.\u201d</p><p>Maia looked at her sharply, her attention captured. They settled on her bed and she closed the door most of the way behind them. She left it cracked in the event there was something to hear from the corridor without.</p><p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Maia said, closing her fingers around Angelica\u2019s. Her hands were chilled, so unusual for the warm summer\u2019s night. \u201cHow terrifying it must be. I didn\u2019t hear you cry out, although I heard something that sounded like you mumbling in your sleep. Or talking to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed so real,\u201d she whispered. Her eyes were far away. \u201cHe...\u201d</p><p>Maia couldn\u2019t help but think of her own dreams. Certainly they\u2019d awakened her...but never because she was frightened. Only because she wanted them to be real. She squeezed her sister\u2019s hands and struggled for the words to comfort her. \u201cSometimes dreams can be more frightening than reality,\u201d Maia said. \u201cAnd sometimes, they can be so much more...beautiful...than reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Maia felt her face warm as she realized the direction in which their conversation was going. She sat up and pulled a pillow onto her lap, clutching it over her torso. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t an appropriate conversation to have after all. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should tell you about it. After all, you\u2019re still unwed and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you,\u201d Angelica shot back. \u201cYou aren\u2019t married yet, dear sister, and so you haven\u2019t any more experience than I have.\u201d</p><p>Maia couldn\u2019t hold back the little smile that came along with the warm bubbling in her belly. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t true, dear younger sister. Alexander and I have\u2014\u201d She stopped and decided that there were some things Angelica didn\u2019t need to know. The very thought of Alexander and his imminent return made her middle fill with nervousness. She collected her thoughts, trying to figure out just how much to confess. \u201cWell, we are engaged, and Chas and the lady patrons haven\u2019t been as vigilant as they were before our engagement was announced.\u201d</p><p>Angelica\u2019s eyes bulged, and Maia read the bald shock there. Obviously she believed that her elder sister was just as prim and proper as did the rest of the world. Including Corvindale.</p><p>\u201cYou and Mr. Bradington have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Maia said. \u201cNot exactly. Not precisely. But... Angelica. It\u2019s quite nice. Erin and Beth are right. It\u2019s very pleasant. And I think it gets nicer.\u201d She could do nothing to diffuse the blush warming her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd what does this have to do with dreams being better than the reality? Or did you mean they were more frightening than reality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Maia hesitated. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t something she should confess to her sister. After all, it was very...personal. She looked away, adjusting the pillow in her lap. Perhaps it would be best if she changed the subject. But before she could, Angelica pressed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Maia glanced around the room, noticing the soft golden light cast by the lamp and the rumpled bedclothes. Somehow, in the dimness, in the middle of the night, it seemed almost permissible to talk about it\u2014just as she and Angelica had shared confidences when they were younger, deep under the covers when they were supposed to be sleeping. It had been a long time since she\u2019d wanted to share her deepest confidences...with anyone. But she needed to. Maia drew in a deep breath and spoke. \u201cAfter your experience with Dewhurst, I had a dream. About...it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dreamed about Dewhurst?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShh!\u201d Maia looked toward the ajar door. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake Mirabella! No, I didn\u2019t dream about Dewhurst.\u201d She looked at her sister, scrutinizing her closely. What would Angelica think of her if she knew she\u2019d liked the bite of a vampir?</p><p>But perhaps...perhaps it would make her sister feel a little better, knowing that there was a different perspective. After all, even in Granny Grapes\u2019s stories, there had been vampirs who didn\u2019t mean to hurt people. And there were people who\u2019d found the creatures fascinating. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound horrible to you, Angelica. You\u2019ll think me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more than I already do,\u201d Angelica replied with a small smile. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p> <p>Maia realized her fingers were plucking energetically at the lace on the pillow in her lap. \u201cI dreamed that a vampir visited me in my chamber. But it wasn\u2019t frightening. It was...like embracing Alexander, and kissing him...but it was different. Better. And when the vampire bit me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Angelica gasped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my dream, he bit me. Right...here. It didn\u2019t hurt, in my dream. In fact, it was...it made me...\u201d She clamped her lips shut, realizing her voice had become a little breathy. That was just too much information. The next thing she knew, Maia would be confessing the kiss she\u2019d shared with the Knave of Diamonds. Something real that had happened...and that she\u2019d forced herself to try and forget.</p><p>Perhaps that was why she\u2019d been focusing on the dreams so much\u2014they weren\u2019t real. They couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t feel guilty about them. Especially now that Alexander was coming back. \u201cYou liked it?\u201d Angelica exclaimed, causing Maia to glance toward the door for fear someone would hear them.</p> <p>Her whole body froze, her belly dropping low and her heart stopping when she met a pair of glittering dark eyes in the dark corridor. Corvindale. Maia felt ill and hot and faint all at once and she clutched the pillow to her chest. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>How long had he been standing there? What had he heard? Oh, heavens... What if he\u2019d heard her talking about her dream? Thank God she hadn\u2019t told Angelica about the Knave of Diamonds, too!</p><p>His face seemed stonier, even more tight and angry than usual and she had to swallow hard to keep her heart from surging up into her throat. She couldn\u2019t remember a time she\u2019d ever been so mortified.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies. I was just arriving home and heard voices,\u201d the earl said\u2014or something like that. Maia couldn\u2019t hear a thing over the rushing sound in her ears and the pounding of her heart.</p><p>Of all people to hear her confess such a thing...it had to be Corvindale.</p><p>She wanted to crawl under the bed and hide. But she didn\u2019t. She managed to speak calmly, she supposed; but she couldn\u2019t remember exactly what she said. And soon he was gone to investigate some noises he\u2019d heard below, leaving her and Angelica alone again.</p> <p>With the door closed tightly behind him.</p><p>Her sister didn\u2019t seem to realize what had happened, and for that Maia was grateful. But her cheeks were still hot and it took a long time for her heart to stop pounding so erratically.</p><p>Part of the reason was that, for a moment there, she\u2019d only seen part of the earl\u2019s face. The lower part, exposed by the wavering light from her lamp. And for a stunning, heart-stopping second, she\u2019d focused on his mouth.</p><p>And she recognized it.</p><p>The Knave of Diamonds.</p><p>It was a good thing she was curled up on her bed, for her knees turned to water and she was literally unable to breathe.</p><p>But by the time the earl had spoken, and then taken his leave, Maia had realized her error. There were a multitude of reasons that the knave couldn\u2019t have been Corvindale\u2014the most compelling of which was the fact that the masked man had not only conversed and flirted with her, but kissed her, as well. All without one insulting comment.</p><p>For Corvindale to have done something so out of character was an impossibility. Especially since it was clear that he despised Maia as much as she despised him.</p> <p>Although \u201cI do hope you aren\u2019t about to cast up your accounts on my waistcoat\u201d might qualify as an insult....</p><p>\u201cAngelica,\u201d Maia whispered, when she saw her sister with her ear pressed to the crack of the door. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d But it was obvious: she was listening to whatever Corvindale had gone to investigate.</p><p>Curious and willing to have a distraction, she joined her taller sibling, forced to half crouch next to her at the open door. They listened for a moment and heard nothing but the faint creaks and groans of the house.</p><p>\u201cDid you really like it, in your dream? When he bit you?\u201d</p><p>Angelica whispered.</p><p>Maia froze. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d she snapped softly. I wish I\u2019d kept my mouth closed. She heard a dull thud below, then silence.</p><p>\u201cI cannot imagine finding it anything but horrifying,\u201d</p><p>Angelica whispered back.</p><p>Maia had to close her eyes as a warm shiver of remembrance trickled through her. \u201cEven those stories Granny used to tell us, about the vampires...even then there were some people who didn\u2019t find it...horrible.\u201d Apparently she was one of them. Of course, perhaps if it happened in reality she might change her mind.... \u201cAnd it was just a dream, Angelica.\u201d</p><p>They both heard the footsteps ascending the stairs at the same time. They whipped around simultaneously, silently dashing back to the bed. They\u2019d just tumbled onto it in a heap of nightgowns and pillows when someone rapped on the bedchamber door.</p><p>\u201cAt least he knocked this time,\u201d Maia muttered as the door eased open.</p><p>But then she saw who it was, and she was right behind Angelica as she flew off the bed. \u201cChas!\u201d she and Angelica cried at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHush\u2014no one can know I\u2019m here,\u201d he said, embracing them both. \u201cCome down to the study with me so we can converse privately.\u201d</p><p>Relief and annoyance rushed through Maia. She had plenty of questions for her brother, as well as a demand: to get her away from the Earl of Corvindale.</p><p>She was more than delighted to pull on a robe and follow him down to the parlor.</p><p>So these are Chas\u2019s sisters.</p><p>Narcise Moldavi watched as the two young women entered the parlor at Blackmont Hall. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat and men\u2019s clothing, Narcise leaned against the fireplace and waited, knowing that they wouldn\u2019t realize she was a woman. The brim shaded her face, and the faint brush of soot she\u2019d applied beneath her cheekbones to give her not only the impression of gauntness, but a bit of stubble, made her look like a skinny old man.</p><p>The sisters were very different in appearance, as well as in demeanor. One of them was dark and gypsyish looking like Chas, with lush brown hair, dusky-rose skin and exotic eyes. She took a seat and scanned the room, clearly observing and taking it all in. She was taller than the other, lighter-haired one, who strode in and immediately began to make adjustments: the lamp wicks, the pillows on the sofa, even Dimitri\u2019s stacks of books.</p><p>That one must be Maia, and the dark one was Angelica.</p><p>Both women were striking, but the elder one was a classic English beauty with her fair complexion. Petite and delicate, unlike Narcise, Maia had hair that defied description: it was neither blond nor chestnut nor auburn, but a mixture of the three shades, and then some. She had a heart-shaped face and a rosebud mouth that seemed to be pursed with annoyance. Her sharp green-brown eyes shot daggers at Chas when he was standing next to Dimitri, talking in a low voice as they sipped whiskey.</p><p>Chas had best keep her from Cezar\u2019s sight. Narcise shivered, thinking of what her brother would do to such a beautiful young woman as Maia Woodmore. Considering what he\u2019d done to Narcise, his own sister...</p><p>Of course, the fact that she was Dracule and must live forever was added incentive for Cezar to do what he would. Or to have his friends do what they would, which was more to his taste anyway. Incest, at least, was not one of Cezar\u2019s many sins.</p><p>After all, no matter what sort of torment and pleasure they put her through, Narcise couldn\u2019t die without a wooden stake to the heart or ten minutes in the sun. Which was why Cezar had made certain all of the furnishings in her windowless chamber had been made of metal. He was taking no chances of losing his favorite bargaining chip.</p><p>At the thought, Narcise couldn\u2019t quite suppress the flutter of panic that swirled in her belly. Chas had helped her escape from that horror, but that didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d never return to it. Cezar wouldn\u2019t stop searching for her until he was dead.</p><p>Or until she was.</p><p>Narcise remembered her fantasies of finding feathers and wrapping herself in them, then falling out of a window to lie in the sun. Eventually she\u2019d have to die, weakened by the feathers and burned by the sun\u2019s rays. Some days, even now, she considered it. At least then Cezar couldn\u2019t get to her.</p><p>And Chas would be safe.</p><p>Her glance flickered to him as he greeted his sisters, who were both loose-haired and dressed in nightclothes, and they settled in their seats. At this moment, he looked more like an English gentleman\u2014albeit an exotic one, with his Romanian coloring\u2014than she was used to seeing him: in a white shirt done up to the throat, covered by a dark coat, along with pantaloons. He was holding a glass, his hair fairly tamed and pomaded smooth. Clean-shaven. All this in deference to his proper sisters, who, according to him, had no idea that he spent his days and nights hunting vampirs.</p><p>The irony that he was an enemy of her race only fueled Narcise\u2019s fascination with him. A Dracule involved with a vampire hunter. How absurd and dangerous.</p><p>And how surprising that she could actually find pleasure with a man, actually trust one, after all she\u2019d been through.</p><p>Chas glanced over at her and she met his black gaze coolly.</p><p>She\u2019d learned long ago not to show weakness or truth in her face or eyes. It could be used against her. And it had.</p><p>Oh, it had.</p><p>Chas\u2019s eyes crinkled slightly at the corners as the ends of his mouth tipped slightly, and she knew he was measuring her response to meeting two of his sisters. Narcise tucked down the little unfurling of warmth in her belly. She felt safe with him. Safe and comfortable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>Nevertheless, she didn\u2019t want to be here, but Chas had given her little choice. It was either come to London with him, or be foisted off on Giordan.</p><p>And that was not going to happen. The very thought of being in the same city, let alone the same room, as Giordan Cale made her ill. Knowing that Chas had met up with him at the inn in Reither\u2019s Closewell, where she and Chas had been staying, had been disturbing, to say the least. She\u2019d remained upstairs in their chamber, out of sight.</p> <p>Although, knowing Giordan, he\u2019d probably scented her.</p><p>On Chas.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Narcise Moldavi. The vampire.\u201d</p><p>The words came from Angelica, who\u2019d been looking closely at her. Maia hissed something at her sister, and then both of them focused their attention on Narcise. Neither appeared pleased, although while Angelica looked angry, Maia seemed merely surprised.</p><p>Annoyed at having her disguise expunged, Narcise directed her own gaze onto the little chit who\u2019d spoken in such distasteful tones, allowing the flare of heat to blaze there for a moment. You have no idea who you\u2019re dealing with, little mortal girl. \u201cI am.\u201d She drew off her hat and flung it onto Dimitri\u2019s desk. Her head and face immediately felt cooler as her hair sagged in its low knot.</p> <p>\u201cAre you here so that we can welcome you to the family?\u201d</p><p>Angelica responded just as coolly.</p><p>Narcise ignored Chas\u2019s slight movement, as if he were about to interfere. I can handle this, she said with a quick glare. \u201cI\u2019m here, in fact, endangering my person only because of you,\u201d she told the girl.</p><p>Narcise moved deliberately, away from the fireplace and over to help herself to a glass of Corvindale\u2019s whiskey. \u201cYour brother learned that Voss had abducted you and he insisted on coming to London, despite the danger to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well you didn\u2019t have to come to London with him,\u201d came a smooth voice from the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t blame your own cowardice on the girl, Narcise.\u201d</p><p>The glass slipped in her hand, but she held on to it. Just barely. Turning, she faced Giordan Cale for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>Their eyes met for a moment and she felt the twin spears of loathing: hers for him, and the same emotion shining in his own burning gaze. He was baiting her, referring to her imprudent choice to accompany Chas to London rather than stay with Giordan at Reither\u2019s Closewell.</p><p>Narcise didn\u2019t bother to respond other than to add a warning flash of fangs to a brief sneer. Sipping her whiskey\u2014trying not to gulp what she suddenly, desperately needed\u2014she walked over to stand next to Chas.</p><p>But Giordan was no longer paying attention to her. He\u2019d turned, presenting her mostly with his back as Dimitri grudgingly introduced him to the Woodmore girls. Narcise sipped from her glass again, focusing on the heat burning down to her belly and through her limbs and not the back of his head, or the way his coffee-colored coat stretched perfectly over broad shoulders. Giordan paid his tailor well.</p><p>He looked the same as he had the last time they\u2019d seen each other, although then his face had been bitter and hard, and worn from nights of depravity and hedonism. Tonight, his handsome features were relaxed and his eyes bland, except for that brief flash of emotion when she first saw him. Giordan still wore his hair unfashionably short, in close, rich-brown curls that left his Slavic forehead and temples exposed. She caught a glimpse of his hand, ungloved, curled into a fist against his thigh and realized he wasn\u2019t as unmoved as he appeared.</p><p>But whether it was anger or hate that tensed his fingers, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t care. She was hardly aware of the conversation going on around her until Dimitri made a joke that wasn\u2019t really a joke about Giordan taking over the responsibility of the Woodmore girls and their guardianship. It was quite clear to everyone in the room that he was deadly serious about it.</p><p>Giordan responded with easy humor, accepting a glass of whiskey that his friend had moved to pour for him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of depriving you, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why can\u2019t we go with you, Chas?\u201d asked Maia.</p> <p>Narcise looked at her, noting the firm yet desperate note in her voice. Someone was either very attached to her brother, or exceedingly unhappy at Blackmont Hall. Pleased to have something to distract her from the presence of the man she loathed most in the world\u2014or second most; that other honor belonged to Cezar\u2014Narcise watched the elder Woodmore sister.</p><p>Upon closer observation, Narcise had to adjust her first impression of the young woman. Despite Maia\u2019s self-assurance and need to be in control, there was an underlying sort of heat exuding from her that made her softer and more sensual than at first glance. Perhaps something only another woman would notice.</p><p>Narcise glanced at the young Maia and amended her thought\u2014perhaps only another woman who was very experienced in the ways of intimacy would notice the sense of unfulfilled sensuality smoldering beneath capable hands and brisk movements. It lingered in the eyes, Narcise decided.</p><p>In the green-brown and gold eyes, in that full pout of an upper lip, and most of all, in the female, musky scent that her Draculian nose recognized.</p><p>This was a woman who was not experienced with men, but who was on the cusp of being so...who\u2019d come to the edge and who hadn\u2019t gone over. Who was waiting.</p><p>Perhaps it was because Narcise herself recognized that feeling of unfulfilled expectancy. It had taken her decades to find it, to allow herself to truly feel on a plane deeper than the merely physical. To battle through the humiliation and pain at the hands of Cezar\u2019s friends and enemies alike, to finally make love with a man who truly awakened and aroused her. Whom she trusted and opened herself to.</p><p>Now she couldn\u2019t bear to look at him, even when they were in the same room.</p><p>Narcise turned her attention away from those dangerous thoughts and the man in question, and happened to glance at Dimitri. The man was a rock: hard, cold and emotionless.</p><p>Exactly the way Narcise wanted to be.</p><p>Dimitri noticed the contemplative way Narcise was looking at him, as if she meant to find some deep secret in his eyes. But she, intensely beautiful and deliciously scented as she was, was much easier to ignore than the daggerish looks Chas\u2019s sister continued to slip him.</p><p>He was trying not to think about the shock in Miss Woodmore\u2019s face when she\u2019d seen him standing there, in the doorway of her chamber. Naturally he\u2019d had a legitimate reason for being there, and it wasn\u2019t his fault that her voice carried so that he heard what she was saying regarding her dream about a vampire. The woman needed to learn restraint, blast it all.</p><p>But for a moment, his heart had stopped cold when he thought he saw recognition along with mortification in her eyes.</p><p>Then he talked himself out of it, for she simply couldn\u2019t have put the pieces together that he was the Knave of Diamonds. He\u2019d even taken care to remove his costume with its glass ruby and red-and-black waistcoat immediately after their...interlude.</p><p>Apparently that interlude hadn\u2019t made as much of an impression on her as some dark, erotic dreams, which was a damn good thing. Although the fact that she seemed to be having the same sorts of dreams that had been plaguing him was another problem entirely.</p><p>He sincerely hoped that her dreams weren\u2019t nearly as explicit and erotic as his own.</p><p>Dimitri was half listening as Chas tried to explain to his sisters that he was a vampire hunter. The fact that he\u2019d allied himself with a beautiful, if emotionally damaged Dracule woman caused even more confusion for the Misses Woodmore. It simply wasn\u2019t logical, of course, and they had questions.</p><p>And even Dimitri could appreciate the position of the sisters.</p><p>Which meant, blast it all, that he\u2019d be the recipient of more badgering by Miss Woodmore when her brother disappeared again with his paramour. For it had become abundantly clear that Chas and Narcise were not merely companions on an adventure, nor was she an unwilling partner in their journey. He could smell the intimacy between them.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only thing he could scent. Voss had been here, the bastard. Despite the fact that Angelica hadn\u2019t admitted it, Dimitri knew he\u2019d been in the house\u2014probably in the girl\u2019s chamber with her\u2014tonight. For all he knew, she could have let him in herself, enthralled and helpless under his influence.</p><p>Dimitri\u2019s teeth ground together. He and Woodmore were going to take care of Voss as soon as they found him. And then Chas would have one of his problems taken care of...leaving him with a more sensitive one.</p><p>He scanned Narcise with objective eyes. Definitely a beautiful woman. But certainly not one who had ever interested him\u2014even that night in Vienna when Moldavi had offered her to Dimitri as a bribe of sorts. When he had a woman, however occasional that event might be, he wanted her willing and without cold, dead eyes. Not that they were cold and dead now when she looked at Chas. Cool. But not dead.</p><p>Dimitri shifted impatiently and glowered at the trio of Woodmores, who had overrun his life, his home and now even his private office.</p><p>Would they never stop talking? He just bloody damn wished everyone would get out of his study so that he could get back to his work. His research and studies had been disrupted so much that he was certain what little he\u2019d managed in the last week was worthless.</p><p>The stack of books that Miss Woodmore had taken it upon herself to neaten as soon as she entered this little meeting reminded him that he hadn\u2019t been to the antiquarian bookstore yet. He flattened his lips. He would go tomorrow, or the next day at the very latest. He was through having his work completely disrupted.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale is your guardian for the foreseeable future,\u201d Chas was saying flatly, looking at Maia with an implacable expression, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t going to stand aside and let Voss compromise my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not compromised,\u201d Angelica said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Woodmore replied, glancing around the room. \u201cWe know he was here tonight, Angelica. Whether you invited him or welcomed him or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t invite him,\u201d Angelica shot back in outrage. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t invite a terrifying creature like him anywhere!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Chas continued. \u201cCorvindale and Cale are going to help me find him. And then I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>And then Dimitri would be able to get back to his studies, and forget about the upheaval brought by a houseful of mortal women.</p><p>And perhaps then he\u2019d stop dreaming about one in particular.</p> <p>7</p><p>WHEREIN A CHOICE OF ACCESSORIES PROVES DISASTROUS</p><p>The carriage rolled to a stop at the rear entrance of the establishment Dimitri sought. Tren, the footman, had aligned the vehicle near enough the back entrance that his master was able to step out from the open door\u2014which had been fitted with a fanlike cover that expanded as the door drew wide, blocking any sunshine\u2014directly into the little shop.</p><p>The smell of age and wisdom, littered with dust, worn leather and fabrics...and yet something fresh, curled into his sensitive nose. The door closed behind Dimitri and he found himself amid tall, close shelves lined with books. Walls of wide, shallow drawers like those found in the British Museum were interspersed with the bookshelves.</p><p>The soft glow of lamps came from strategic places on the walls, but Dimitri didn\u2019t need their illumination. He was well at home in dim light, and felt the familiar wave of peacefulness that always hovered in these surroundings. Merely stepping into the place eased his tension. Even the constant, screaming pain from his Mark seemed to ebb.</p> <p>\u201cAh, you\u2019ve returned.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to see the shop\u2019s proprietress emerging from between two stacks. A woman of indeterminate age, she blinked owlishly from behind square spectacles as if she\u2019d just been awakened\u2014or, more likely, pulled from whatever she had been reading. Yet her gray-blue eyes turned bright and she seemed pleased to see him. She wore a long bliaut that, along with the points of her wide sleeves, skimmed the ground. Around her waist hung a loose leather cord, to which a collection of keys to the many chests, cases and drawers was attached.</p><p>In one long-fingered hand was an open book that she appeared to have been perusing before his presence interrupted her. Her long pale hair was separated into two thick tails that fell behind her shoulders. A pair of finger-thick braids began at her temples and curved around to the back of her head. The fact that she neither showed the deference due an earl nor made use of the proper address he hardly noticed.</p><p>\u201cNo other customers again, I see,\u201d he commented, reaching idly for a dusty book. \u201cI find it a wonder that you remain in business, this little shop tucked away in the back mews of Haymarket.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, replying, \u201c\u2019Tis a happy thing, then, that I have the patronage of an earl to keep my interests afloat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave your direction to an acquaintance of mine some weeks past,\u201d Dimitri said, glancing down at the excellent French translation of The Iliad, \u201cbut he couldn\u2019t seem to find you. I told him you were next door to the old tannery, but he didn\u2019t see the shop.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t seem concerned about the loss of a potential customer. \u201cPerhaps that was a day the shop was closed. Have you given any more thought to breaking into the museum and examining the stele from Rosetta?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri didn\u2019t recall speaking such a fantasy aloud, let alone to this woman, but he was never able to summon his customary abrasiveness whilst here. Thus, he responded, \u201cI\u2019m certain I could arrange to see the stone privately if I thought it would be help in my quest. I am Corvindale, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is, I\u2019m certain, quite true. Are you in search of anything in particular today?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere are some new scrolls I\u2019ve received\u2014perhaps you might take a look at them.\u201d She gestured toward one of the corners of the dingy little shop.</p><p>\u201cNothing in particular. However, it\u2019s rare that I leave without finding something to add to my library.\u201d Dimitri had never told her of his quest. How could one explain to an ageless, absentminded woman about his desire to break a covenant with the devil?</p><p>She\u2019d think him mad and close up the shop to him, as well.</p><p>The proprietress merely nodded, then absently returned her attention to the book she held. \u201cIf there is aught I can do to help...\u201d And she wandered off.</p><p>Dimitri normally would have done the same, but today things prickled at him. Uncomfortable things. He didn\u2019t want to be alone with his thoughts. \u201cHave you,\u201d he began, following her. \u201cHave you any old, very old, perhaps original, chapbooks of the Faust legend?\u201d</p><p>She turned from where she\u2019d paused at a table and looked up from her book. Satisfaction gleamed in her eyes. \u201cFaust. And why would you be looking for a story you know so well?\u201d</p> <p>Dimitri couldn\u2019t keep the jolt of surprise from blasting through him at\u2014not so much her exact words, but the sharp, suddenly knowing look in her fathomless eyes. \u201cWhat precisely do you mean by that, madame?\u201d he asked, placing all of the chill and inflection of an earl\u2019s power behind it.</p><p>\u201cI think, Dimitri of Corvindale, that you know all of what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He glowered in all of his earlness, and thought even for a moment of allowing some of his vampire glow to burn in his eyes. Yet, he said nothing, simply waiting for her to explain.</p><p>The woman closed her book without marking the page. And it was a very thick tome. \u201cYou and Johann Faust have much in common, do you not? Your pacts with the devil are quite different, and yet the same. That is what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Instead of the thunderous rage that might have\u2014perhaps should have\u2014flooded him, Dimitri felt only a wave of shock. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p><p>She merely looked at him. \u201cIt matters not. However, might I remind you that your selections from here have ranged from Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis to Malleus Male-ficarum, as well as a wide variety of Bibles and kabbalistic literature. Even some from the Hindis. And you\u2019ve even asked about moksha. All of them have had aught to do with recognizing demons or calling to them, or of the word and teachings of our God. And so,\u201d she said, still holding him with her gaze, \u201cone draws conclusions.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri wasn\u2019t precisely clear on how she\u2019d drawn such a conclusion\u2014albeit a correct one\u2014based on his purchases, but earls didn\u2019t lower themselves to arguing with shopkeepers.</p><p>Instead, he said stiffly, \u201cThere is one large difference between myself and Herr Doktor Faust.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, as if she already knew and was waiting for him to speak it.</p><p>\u201cFaust called Lucifer to him. I did not.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cBut he came to you when you were at your most vulnerable. That is how he works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Dimitri demanded, suddenly flooded with the memory of that dark, hot night when Lucifer visited him in his dream. A night of fitful sleep, filled with smoke and ash and the heat of London\u2019s Great Fire.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Wayren. This is my shop.\u201d She spread an elegant hand around the space. Then she looked at him. \u201cWhat do you seek, Dimitri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching,\u201d he said in a subdued voice he hardly recognized as his own, \u201cfor a way out. A way to break his hold on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain there is a way?\u201d she asked, her eyes steady on him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Despair washed over him. \u201cI\u2019m certain there isn\u2019t. For if there were, I swear I\u2019d have found it by now.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for her response, he spun on his feet, confused and unaccountably furious, and left.</p><p>Dimitri snarled at his footman as he opened the door to the carriage waiting in the moonlight.</p><p>Nearly four days since the invasion of his study, and he, Woodmore and Cale had been unable to locate Voss in London. He\u2019d been there that night, the cocky bastard, in Angelica\u2019s chamber...but somehow, he\u2019d gotten away before Chas arrived. And since then, he seemed to have evaporated into darkness.</p><p>Probably with the blessing of Lucifer.</p><p>Dimitri would have suspected Voss had made his escape from London if he hadn\u2019t received a terse message from him today. Voss\u2019s message said that Belial was intending to attack the Woodmore sisters again tonight, and warned him to be on his guard.</p><p>As if Dimitri ever let his guard down. Voss knew better than that.</p><p>Chas was off tending to Narcise somewhere in London, keeping out of sight of anyone who might notice his presence while trying to find Voss. Dimitri didn\u2019t know where he was, nor did he have any safe way to get the word to Woodmore that his sisters were in particular danger, although he did leave a message at White\u2019s and Rubey\u2019s, as well as the Gray Stag and a few other locations Chas might visit. Using blood pigeons\u2014ones that the Dracule specially trained to fly by following a particular scent of blood to deliver the message\u2014wasn\u2019t secure enough, for Cezar had been known to intercept them.</p><p>Cale was spending the evening with the woman named Rubey. She was a mortal who operated an establishment catering to the pleasure needs of the Dracule, and she was also a friend of Voss, who could be contacting her\u2014which was Cale\u2019s official excuse for the visit.</p><p>But Dimitri was required to attend to the ladies tonight at some party for some lord or viscount or earl named Harrington, where, according to Iliana, who\u2019d heard it from Mirabella who\u2019d presumably heard it from the sisters, rumor had it that the guest of honor was going to make a proposal of marriage to Angelica Woodmore.</p><p>If Iliana hadn\u2019t come down with some sort of sniffle and headache, complete with red, dripping nose and hacking cough, she could have ridden in the carriage with the young ladies and left Dimitri to follow in his own vehicle or even on horseback to ensure their safety along the dark streets.</p><p>But he dared not chance leaving them unattended in the carriage, and so he climbed into the blasted thing.</p><p>Assaulted immediately by perfumes and powders and acres of skirts and wraps and trailing-off giggles, Dimitri settled onto his seat with nary a word and hardly a glance at his companions. Silence had fallen, in fact, as soon as the door opened and he ducked in, as if his mere presence put a cork in their conversation.</p><p>One thing to be grateful for.</p><p>But as he adjusted his coattails and the carriage lurched off, Dimitri was assaulted by something else entirely. Something heavy and dark and crushing, over his chest and onto his lungs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rubies.</p><p>He looked up and around, already feeling slow and weak, already hardly able to breathe, trying to maintain an empty expression even as he felt his strength draining away. Where in the dark hell are they?</p><p>Then he saw them, dangling from Angelica\u2019s ears. Ruby earbobs. Large ones, too. She was watching him, as if she noticed his sluggishness, and he pressed his lips together to hide the affliction. The gems were strong, but they weren\u2019t enough to kill him or even to burn him...unless they touched his flesh.</p> <p>But they made him feel as if he were deep in a pool of hot, red water...slow and murky, his limbs heavy. Before they came to Blackmont Hall, he\u2019d made certain none of the women had rubies; all of his staff understood that no gems were to enter his home without approval from him.</p><p>How had Angelica come by these, then?</p><p>Miss Woodmore shifted at that moment and Dimitri saw that she, too, was wearing them. Ruby earbobs.</p><p>And then he knew precisely how they\u2019d come about getting the stones, for his brain worked just fine even if his body was leeching into bonelessness.</p><p>Damn Voss to his dark hell.</p> <p>He\u2019d done it. Probably when he visited Angelica\u2019s chamber that night. It would be just like the man to leave them for the sisters, mainly as a jest to Dimitri\u2014to let him know that Voss had breached his residence and found a way inside.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have expected them to all be confined in a carriage together, where the proximity made the potency of the jewels even worse.</p><p>\u201cLord Corvindale!\u201d Angelica said, as Dimitri tried to fight back the fury at his realization, strangled and weak.</p><p>\u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>All three women suddenly fluttered about him as if he were an injured child, and everything became a flurry of pastel skirts and perfumes and wide eyes. Which of course made the whole situation worse, as the rubies swung closer, and Dimitri angrier, resulting in an even more heavy strangling and crushing of his torso.</p><p>\u201cA...way...\u201d he tried to say, trying to push the girls and the four robins\u2019-egg-size jewels away.</p> <p>Then all of a sudden, there was a huge thump and a crash and the landau lurched to a halt. They all tumbled every which way, dislodged by the great force. Dimitri, still pinned in the corner, struggled to pull to his feet, getting a bit of a reprieve as the girls with the ruby earrings jolted away from him.</p><p>But before he could gather up his immense strength and master control of his ribbony limbs, the carriage door whipped open and he saw the flash of glowing red eyes. The next thing he knew, screams and scuffling and flying skirts filled the air and in the midst of the melee, Angelica was gone.</p><p>Taking, thank the Fates, half the paralyzing rubies with her.</p><p>Miss Woodmore was shouting orders and thrashing about on the floor of the carriage, tangled with Mirabella and Dimitri\u2019s legs and shoes, and he barely managed to grab on to her ankle or she would have lunged out the ajar door after her sister.</p><p>He yanked her awkwardly back into the carriage in an effort to get away from her, the rubies and the mess inside, and to fumble his way out and after Belial. But by the time he managed to get free of the rubies\u2019 hold and into the night air, it was too late. They were out of sight, out of scent, and any sounds from their flight were mingled with every other sound of London at night.</p><p>Damnation.</p><p>Tren, Dimitri\u2019s groom, was lying on the ground, his face bloodied and his limbs unmoving. The horses had been cut free and were gone, leaving all of them stranded with the landau and no way to give chase. A small group of street urchins stood in the shadowy gap between two brick buildings, likely up to their ankles in the mucky waste that Dimitri smelled. They watched with wide white eyes. And behind him, standing in the doorway of the carriage, was Miss Woodmore, looking decidedly less fresh and smooth than she had moments earlier. And her mouth was moving.</p><p>Oh, was it moving.</p> <p>Cursing, furious, still trying to shake off the last of his weakness, Dimitri blocked out his ward\u2019s recriminations and questions and demands and checked on Tren\u2014who was alive and likely to remain so, as evidenced by his eyes opening and the curse words spilling from his lips\u2014and then looked over to the children watching in the dark.</p><p>None of them were able to give him a clear answer on where the vampires had gone, and despite the fact that Dimitri was relieved that Belial had only seen fit to take one of the carriage\u2019s occupants, he was incensed that he\u2019d been caught by surprise.</p><p>Yet another unfortunate event caused by Voss and his games and jests.</p><p>Frustrated by the fact that he couldn\u2019t leave the women and go off after Belial immediately, Dimitri sent Tren off to find a hackney or some horses so he could get them home. Then he could start combing the city for Angelica and Belial. While the groom limped off, Dimitri circled the area around the accident, sniffing, observing, listening intently in the distance for any clue that would lead him after the younger Woodmore sister.</p><p>We have time. His mind was clear and calm. Belial would keep Angelica safe and protected until he got her to Moldavi, and getting a young woman across the Channel during wartime would be some challenge, even for the Dracule\u2014but it could be done. If Dimitri could find them before they left London it would be best, but he knew exactly where Moldavi stayed in Paris and where they\u2019d be taking her. So if he had to go to Paris and face down the damned child-bleeder, he\u2019d do it.</p><p>With relish.</p><p>Cool and intent, his brain clicked through the steps to hunt down Belial and his victim, running through the possibilities\u2014would they leave tonight, would they keep her somewhere until a boat was arranged, would they leave from the docks here or go by land to Dover\u2014even as his eyes observed and he lifted his face to scent over and under the smells weaving in the world, searching for the one that belonged to Angelica.</p><p>When he realized she hadn\u2019t stopped talking, trying to get his attention, and her insistence was interrupting his concentration, Dimitri turned and snarled at Miss Woodmore. To his surprise, she actually closed her mouth for a moment, looking up at him with wide, shocked eyes.</p><p>He drew in a deep breath, fighting to keep his eyes from burning red and from his fangs being exposed. And, staying his distance from the lethal rubies, as he met her gaze, he felt something inside him soften. She looked terrified and rumpled and, impossibly, as if she were about to cry.</p><p>\u201cSurely you aren\u2019t about to cry, are you, Miss Woodmore?\u201d</p><p>His words had the desired effect, for she straightened her shoulders, which had begun to bow inside her silvery-blue gown, causing it to gap at the bodice. Her gaze flashed almost as hotly as Belial\u2019s, except that it glistened with tears.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d she said in affronted tones. One of the tears spilled over and ran down her cheek and she wiped it away angrily.</p><p>Dimitri clamped his mouth shut on the automatic response he\u2019d intended to make after her denial and looked at her again. And then realized he really shouldn\u2019t have done so.</p><p>That softening inside him started to twist and unfurl more quickly, like a sail gaining wind, and he couldn\u2019t help but notice how lovely she was in her dishevelment...particularly now that her mouth wasn\u2019t moving in demands and recriminations. The curve of her cheeks, soft and high, the point of her chin with its subtle dimple, and even in the faulty light, he could see dark lashes and brows enhancing the shape of her eyes.</p><p>And that mouth...his blood surged and he stopped himself cold from remembering the soft heat of it against his. And the cardamom-vanilla and sweet lily that wafted from her skin. Her hair looked silver-black in the moon, all of the nuances of color washed out and reduced to a simple chiaroscuro. Her coiffure was a bloody mess, but he found it much more interesting all tumbled about her temples and jaw and sagging along her neck around those earbobs than the way it had been forced into submission moments earlier.</p><p>\u201cI should think that I\u2019m entitled to a few tears,\u201d she said in a voice that seemed...less hard. More bumpy, unsteady in its cadence. Firm, still, but with feeling. \u201cI am a bit frightened and confused. After all, we\u2019ve just been in a carriage accident, attacked by horrible, bloodthirsty vampir, and my sister has been abducted by them.\u201d Now her voice began to rise. \u201cAnd our very fierce guardian could do nothing to stop them. What was Chas thinking?\u201d</p><p>The sail inside him lost its wind and Dimitri scowled. Damn her, she was bloody well right. Not that it was his fault that Voss had done something so foolish, presumably unaware of the potential consequences (which was always his excuse), but in all fairness, it had been Dimitri who allowed Angelica to be abducted.</p><p>And Dimitri wasn\u2019t used to being at fault.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something\u2014likely something snarly and rude that would send her huffing off into the closed carriage, which was exactly what he wanted: her away from him\u2014but he realized he had a mouthful of fangs, thrusting long and sharp and in no mood to be sheathed. It just didn\u2019t seem to be the right moment for her to learn that he was one of those\u2014what had she called them? Horrible, bloodthirsty vampirs.</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t said \u201cmurderous.\u201d Although in the case of Belial and Moldavi, that would be more accurate.</p><p>Just then, Mirabella, who also looked as if she\u2019d been tumbled down a hill and then dragged herself to her feet at the bottom, spoke. \u201cMaia, where did you get those rubies?\u201d She didn\u2019t spare Dimitri a glance, but hurried over to Miss Woodmore. Tension oozed from her. \u201cCorvindale despises rubies,\u201d she said to her companion, under her breath presumably so that Dimitri couldn\u2019t hear\u2014but of course he could hear everything, including Miss Woodmore\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cRubies? The earl despises rubies? Why in the world should I care? He doesn\u2019t have to wear them.\u201d Her furious whisper broke at the end. \u201cI want to find Angelica. We have to find my brother\u2014at least he\u2019ll be able to save her. He can kill those vampirs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Mirabella was saying, still in a low hiss, glancing covertly at Dimitri from over her shoulder. \u201cThe very sight of them make him furious. You must get rid of the earbobs, for he hates them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Miss Woodmore\u2019s voice rose incredulously, matching Dimitri\u2019s own surprise that Mirabella should know so much about his affliction. He\u2019d taken great care to hide it from her, along with the fact that she wasn\u2019t truly his sister but a mere foundling he\u2019d brought into his home years ago. \u201cGet rid of my rubies?\u201d</p><p>Naturally the staff knew, but they were also exceedingly well-paid to keep their master\u2019s secrets from everyone. Aside of that, none of them wished to risk the wrath of a Dracule, and, unlike Cezar Moldavi, Dimitri didn\u2019t make it a point of turning every one of his servants Dracule anyway. Iliana didn\u2019t have a loose tongue, either. She had her own reasons for keeping the secret.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201d his ward was saying, fingering her earbobs. She cast a sidelong glance at Dimitri, then leaned closer to Mirabella. \u201cWhy should mere jewels make him so angry? Was that why he seemed so odd in the carriage?\u201d</p> <p>By that time, Dimitri had turned away, annoyance and fury prickling over his shoulders. He refocused his attention on the scene of the kidnapping instead of wondering just exactly how much Mirabella knew about him, and where she had learned it. And the fact that Miss Woodmore seemed to have latched onto the concept of his dislike for rubies with her characteristic tenacity.</p><p>Just then, praise the Fates, Tren arrived with a hackney.</p><p>Dimitri wanted nothing more than to send the women back to Blackmont Hall and to get on his way, but he dared not relieve himself of their presence until he knew they were safe. So while they climbed into the hack, rubies and all, he settled onto the back of the conveyance, where the footman might perch, and allowed Tren to ride with the driver.</p><p>The ride to Blackmont Hall was without incident, and Dimitri went inside to ascertain whether he\u2019d received any responding messages from Chas or Giordan Cale in regards to Voss\u2019s warning\u2014which had, in fact, been pertinent. He found word that they were waiting at White\u2019s for news from him, causing renewed annoyance that the message had arrived too late to prevent Angelica\u2019s abduction, not to mention the fact that the presence of the rubies in his household\u2014let alone in the confines of a carriage\u2014had endangered the safety of both Woodmore sisters. Voss\u2019s irresponsibility was inexcusable. Dimitri armed himself with an ash stake and his thick walking stick. The bottom half of said cane was actually a saber that could come in handy if he encountered Belial.</p><p>Or Voss.</p> <p>And then he shoved a pistol into his pocket and slipped out of the house before Miss Woodmore could accost him again. The intense relief that he\u2019d managed to do so was beyond annoying.</p><p>Moments later, he arrived at White\u2019s, the well-known gentleman\u2019s club where the Dracule had private, subterranean apartments hidden in the back. Ironically the club, which catered to the most powerful and rich members of the ton, had been influenced by Dimitri\u2019s own establishment in Vienna; however, the Dracule who frequented it rarely visited the main chambers\u2014except to enter a bet in the books.</p><p>Famously there\u2019d been an incident when Beau Brummel and Lord Eddersley\u2014a mortal and a Dracule, respectively\u2014had sat in the front, bowed window of the club and bet three thousand pounds on which of two raindrops would reach the bottom of the glass first.</p><p>Since Dimitri\u2019s similar property in Vienna had gone up (or down, depending upon how one looked at it) in flames, he had lost his taste for such investments, although he had helped fund moving White\u2019s from Chesterfield to St. James. Dimitri found it morbidly amusing that the de facto headquarters for the Whig Party was being financed by a Dracule, who had absolutely no regard for political parties, politics, or even patriotism.</p><p>His world was unaffected, for the most part, by the government or legal systems of his mortal counterparts. And, as one who\u2019d lived through the Cromwell years and the return of Charles II to the throne before he even became Dracule, Dimitri had no qualms about his apathetic attitude. Government machinations meant nothing to him.</p><p>When Dimitri arrived, he found Chas and Giordan Cale in the private apartments at White\u2019s. Other than the three of them and the two attending footmen, the chambers were empty. There weren\u2019t many other Dracule in London at the time\u2014not that there ever were, for Lucifer was selective in his choices for soul induction. Dimitri thought sourly that he wished the devil had been even more selective, and passed him by almost a hundred and forty years ago. He certainly wasn\u2019t the sort of man Lucifer tended to gravitate toward.</p> <p>At least, he hadn\u2019t been before becoming Dracule. He\u2019d been a quiet, studious young man who grew up in a Puritan household where books and God were revered and clothing was black, brown, gray or dun.</p><p>He\u2019d been perfectly content with his studies, for, as the youngest son of five and thus unlikely to inherit the Corvindale title, he was attempting a professorship in physics at Cambridge. And even after Cromwell died and Charles II was restored to the throne, Dimitri continued in his simple life of studies. Until he met Meg.</p><p>\u201cAt last,\u201d Chas said, looking up from the table. Tension had settled in his face.</p><p>\u201cA drink, Corvindale?\u201d Giordan asked as Dimitri strolled across the chamber. His neckcloth had been loosened and he was in his shirtsleeves. It appeared that he and Chas had been in the midst of a chess game.</p><p>Interesting, and hardly comprehensible, particularly since surely by now Chas was aware of the history between Giordan and Narcise. But then, if nothing else, Giordan was a gentleman, and well in control of himself.</p><p>Dimitri glanced at the board to see who seemed to be winning. It took him only a glance to confirm what he would have suspected: Chas was for the bold, brazen moves and Giordan more subtle and covert. Well-matched, but two different styles.</p><p>Interestingly enough, the queens had both been captured already.</p><p>Even more interesting than that was the absence of Narcise herself. The presumption was that Chas had settled her safely somewhere while he saw to the situation at hand. Perhaps with Rubey.</p> <p>\u201cAngelica has been abducted,\u201d Dimitri said without preamble. Accepting the drink, he sat at the table with them.</p><p>\u201cVoss?\u201d Chas spat, rising to his feet. If he were a Dracule, his eyes would be blazing red and orange. \u201cIf he caused it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dimitri said, taking a healthy swallow of whiskey, and then tersely explained what had happened. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to search the city and then to Dover if we don\u2019t catch them.\u201d</p><p>Chas settled back into his chair and nodded. His eyes were fierce and his jaw moved slightly as if being clenched. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to split up.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d just finished determining the most likely places Belial would have taken Angelica, and the best routes, dividing up the locations, when the door opened.</p><p>Voss stood there on the threshold, gripping the arm of a cloaked and hooded figure.</p><p>Dimitri started up, reaching for the stake in his inside pocket just as Chas whirled in his seat to look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Voss said sharply, flipping open his coat to expose a large ruby in the center of his neckcloth. \u201cDid you think I would be so foolish as to come unprepared?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri remained standing, settling his hand onto the table in a pool of spilled whiskey as he fixed Voss with a dark glare. The ruby was far enough away that its potency was weak, but certainly he couldn\u2019t get much closer. Bastard. A smart, sneaky bastard.</p><p>Reluctantly he glanced at the figure next to Voss. It was obviously a woman, and Dimitri had a sudden, ugly feeling he knew who it was.</p><p>Impossible. Even she wouldn\u2019t be so foolish.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t talk himself out of the certainty, and when she yanked off her hood and he saw Miss Woodmore\u2019s accusing eyes and mussed golden-chestnut hair, he couldn\u2019t hold back his exclamation of annoyance. \u201cYou.\u201d He turned his glare onto her.</p><p>\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t come unprotected, knowing just how you feel about me,\u201d Voss was saying to Chas, who had withdrawn his stake and had it ready in his hand. \u201cKeep your distance, and no one will get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d Chas said, \u201care you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than worried to illness for the safety of my sister, while the rest of you sit about and play games at your club?</p><p>Yes, I am fine. If it weren\u2019t for Lord Dewhurst, I would still be standing at the door, arguing with the butler. It was he who helped me gain entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient,\u201d Dimitri replied from between his teeth. He sank back into his seat, but he couldn\u2019t control the blaze in his eyes as he returned his gaze to Voss. Meddling arse.</p><p>And then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Miss Wood more stiffen. She was looking right at him and he saw sudden shock and recognition in her eyes when she noticed the glow in his gaze.</p><p>She\u2019d figured it out. At least he wouldn\u2019t have to hide his fangs from her any longer, but that was small comfort. Naturally she\u2019d rush off to tell Mirabella at the first opportunity.</p><p>He snarled under his breath. Damnation. He\u2019d have to enthrall her and clear her mind of the knowledge if he was to have any peace.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe your incompetence, Dimitri. I sent you the warning,\u201d Voss said flatly, drawing Dimitri\u2019s attention from his misery. \u201cAnd you, Woodmore. Another disappearing and then reappearing act? Are you here to take care of your sisters or not?\u201d</p><p>Fury propelled Dimitri to his feet again, his eyes fairly burning with the heat of anger. \u201cOh, aye, I got your message\u2014along with the pair of bloody ruby earbobs, you sneaky bastard.\u201d He would have lunged across the room if Chas hadn\u2019t thrust an arm out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Woodmore said under his breath, holding his stake at a lethal angle. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Voss flashed his fangs, holding Dimitri\u2019s glare. \u201cIt was a jest, nothing more. I warned her not to wear them in your presence.\u201d</p><p>Like hell you did, you bastard.</p><p>\u201cDamn your soul to Lucifer, it\u2019s your bloody fault Angelica\u2019s been taken,\u201d Chas interrupted. Dimitri could feel the man gathering up next to him like a spring, even though his expression didn\u2019t change and nary a muscle moved. \u201cYou and your cursed jests and games, Voss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Voss could respond, Chas leaped, tossing a chair out of his way and bounding up and over a table to slam the man into the wall. He was fast, but Dimitri was faster, fairly flying across the room to grab Miss Woodmore, snatching her out of the way just as the two men tumbled to the floor.</p><p>She weighed no more than a pin, just as she had three years ago and of course a few nights ago, as well. And, unlike the other night at the masquerade, she didn\u2019t have yards of skirts and fabric bunching up and around them as he scooped her up out of the way, slamming her quickly against his torso to avoid being smashed by a flying chair.</p><p>It was probably best if she didn\u2019t see what was about to happen to Voss Dewhurst.</p> <p>\u201cRelease me, you idiot man!\u201d She slammed an elbow that was as sharp as her tongue into his gut and Dimitri grunted, shifting her so that she didn\u2019t have another chance at him. But she tried to kick at him and to yank away, even as chairs flew and tables upended. Chess pieces scattered. The bottle of whiskey crashed to the floor.</p><p>Addled woman. Do you want to get yourself killed? He whipped her out of the way just in time to keep from being crashed into by Chas and Voss, who were putting on a damned good show. If Dimitri weren\u2019t so furious with the latter, he\u2019d be watching the fight with interest. For being mortal, and not as strong or fast as a Dracule, Chas Woodmore was brilliant. One would never know that he was overmatched.</p><p>And perhaps he wasn\u2019t overmatched with the vampires. Perhaps he was made that way\u2014to hunt them. After all, God would have some sort of defense against the malignance of Lucifer\u2019s makes.</p><p>Chas whipped Voss into the wall, following him with his stake raised. They crashed against the brick, and Dimitri stuck out his foot and sent Voss staggering away. Chas leaped, the stake in hand, ready to deliver the death blow as Miss Woodmore screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t! Chas!\u201d she shrieked, burying her face in Dimitri\u2019s shirt.</p><p>Naturally Woodmore ignored her as he plunged the stake toward Voss\u2019s heart. The powerful blow fell, and Dimitri watched as the stake fairly bounced off Voss\u2019s torso. What in the bloody hell...?</p> <p>Some sort of armor, blast him.</p><p>Everything fell silent for a moment, except for the sounds of labored breathing from the two fighting men. And then, with a muttered curse, Chas pulled up and away from where he\u2019d landed on his target, a splintered stake in his hand.</p><p>As the action waned, Dimitri was no longer able to ignore the bundle of femininity clutching his shirt with two fists, and her warm breath burning through the linen to his skin. Not to mention the very evident press of breasts against his belly. A rush of heat swarmed through him and he made the mistake of drawing in a breath, getting a good sniff of her hair. Lemon and jasmine, and an undernote of cardamom-vanilla. Flowers and spice.</p><p>He forced himself to release her slender arms and made his own fall to his sides. \u201cI do hope you aren\u2019t wiping your nose on my shirt, Miss Woodmore.\u201d He had to work hard to make certain his tones were laden with disdain.</p><p>Miss Woodmore jerked back as if she\u2019d been stung, and he saw very pink cheeks just before she spun away.</p><p>\u201cArmor?\u201d Chas was saying to Voss as he brushed off his shirt. He looked bloody annoyed.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a fashion. I warned you I\u2019d come prepared\u2014for all of you.\u201d He glanced pointedly at Dimitri and Giordan, as well. \u201cNow, if you would cease attacking me, I would appreciate the opportunity to assist you in retrieving Angelica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour assistance is neither wanted nor needed,\u201d Chas told him. \u201cAside of that, I want you in no vicinity to any of my sisters. A different country would be preferable. Just because you were prepared this time doesn\u2019t always mean that you\u2019ll escape my stake.\u201d</p><p>Voss\u2019s laugh was short and sharp. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe you were that foolish, Woodmore. In fact, I\u2019m the only one who can assist you in saving Angelica.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri smothered a snort of disbelief and walked over to pour a new glass of whiskey. \u201cNot bloody likely.\u201d</p><p>Voss shrugged, and glanced at Miss Woodmore. \u201cVery well, then,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cBest of luck to all of you.\u201d He turned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Miss Woodmore stomped her foot.</p><p>Dimitri resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Always the dramatics.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to allow him to leave?\u201d She glared at her brother. \u201cWithout hearing what he has to say? Angelica\u2019s in danger and all you care about is...is whatever insults you\u2019ve given to each other in the past. I vow, the three of you are like little boys fighting over a ball.\u201d</p> <p>Dimitri opened his mouth to tell her precisely how addled she was when Woodmore beat him to it. \u201cI don\u2019t need his help.\u201d His tones dripped with brotherly disdain.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the lady is right.\u201d Giordan had remained out of the fray due to the fact, Dimitri presumed, that somewhere on Voss\u2019s person was some essence of Giordan\u2019s Asthenia since he didn\u2019t appear to be in possession of an actual cat. And since Giordan obviously didn\u2019t feel compelled to manage the annoying Miss Woodmore, he\u2019d been in the enviable position of observer. \u201cAt least hear what the bastard\u2014pardon me, Miss Woodmore\u2014has to say. Then turn him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of me that you even knew they were to attack this evening,\u201d Voss said, with a flinty look at Dimitri. Then he turned to Maia. \u201cI was fortunate enough to cross paths with Belial, who is the vampir Moldavi sent to find your brother\u2014or one of his sisters\u2014who could be used as a hostage.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri watched him as he explained to Maia how he came to overhear Belial\u2019s plans. The man seemed truly overset, especially for Voss. Was it possible that he was sincerely concerned for Angelica? That it wasn\u2019t just another bid for attention, or a jest? He narrowed his eyes and watched, even as disdain crawled into his belly.</p><p>Voss didn\u2019t truly care for women.</p><p>He simply used them. Coaxed them and took what he could. While he meant no real harm to anyone, neither did Voss care about anyone else aside of himself and his pleasure.</p><p>Angelica Woodmore, a young mortal woman, would hardly be any different from the hundreds or thousands of others over the years. Willing and otherwise.</p><p>\u201cWhen I arrived here to find her arguing with the butler,\u201d Voss was explaining about Maia coolly, \u201crather than leaving her on the doorstep where she might have been otherwise noticed, I thought it best to bring her within.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had ample opportunity to abduct her, as well as Mirabella, this evening,\u201d Dimitri reminded him between clenched teeth. He was still enraged over the debacle. \u201cThey chose not to. It was Angelica they were after.\u201d Moldavi could find any number of uses for the younger Woodmore sister\u2019s Sight.</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019d already identified her. I\u2019m certain, for by now, Moldavi has heard of her unusual ability. Angelica wasn\u2019t very secretive about it, at least among her friends. Not only does Moldavi want to use her to bring Chas into submission, but also to put her to work. He can force her to tell him what she knows about the person who owns any item he brings to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting our time,\u201d Woodmore said. \u201cWe\u2019ve finished our plan to search the city and now you\u2019ve set us back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where exactly were you going to search in the city?\u201d Voss asked, lifting an arrogant brow. He removed a handkerchief and wiped his hands of a streak of blood as he glanced up at Dimitri. \u201cBecause she\u2019s no longer in the city. They\u2019re taking her to Paris. They\u2019re already well ahead of you on a boat going down the Thames.\u201d</p><p>Satan\u2019s bloody stones.</p><p>Chas and Dimitri exchanged glances. They hadn\u2019t expected them to use a riverboat to get out of Town. A ship or a stage, but not one of the small river vehicles.</p><p>Giordan nodded thoughtfully, and Voss continued, for he had their attention now.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think Cezar would risk himself to come here, did you? Belial is bringing Angelica to him. The good news is that she\u2019ll arrive unharmed\u2014for Belial won\u2019t dare allow anything to happen to her. She\u2019s going to be very valuable to Cezar. The bad news is...not one of you could expect to gain entrance to Moldavi\u2019s residence in Paris, to get to Angelica. Except for me.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri didn\u2019t bother to correct him. Moldavi would see him, if only for the chance to slam a stake into his heart. In fact, he\u2019d relish it just as much as Dimitri would to do the same.</p><p>\u201cYou forget about me. Moldavi will see me,\u201d Giordan said. His voice was flat and his eyes empty. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Giordan,\u201d Dimitri snapped, looking at his friend in concern. Cale didn\u2019t need to put himself through that again. There were other ways.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Voss said firmly. \u201cMoldavi will see me. I\u2019ve acquired some information he wants about Bonaparte. And I\u2019ll be able to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to get to Paris? We\u2019re at war!\u201d Miss Woodmore interjected. \u201cMrs. Siddington-Graves has been trapped there for a year!\u201d</p><p>Dimitri didn\u2019t know who Mrs. Siddington-Graves was, and he certainly didn\u2019t care, but he forbore to say anything. Let Woodmore take care of his sister while he was present, blast him.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d Woodmore was saying.</p><p>\u201cI returned her once before, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Voss pointed out.</p><p>\u201cComplete with nightmares, frightening memories, not to mention marks on her skin. Not quite unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri saw a flash of emotion in Voss\u2019s expression that he would have described as chagrin, or even guilt, if he hadn\u2019t suspected that those feelings were as foreign to Voss as sunlight. \u201cAs you well know, I\u2019ve spent my life collecting information and learning the weaknesses of my associates and enemies alike. I know how to influence Moldavi,\u201d he said steadily.</p><p>Glancing over at Miss Woodmore, Dimitri saw that she was following the conversation with interest. Hope and terror warred in her expression, and he thought it must have to do with worry for her brother. For, after all, if Chas never came back, she\u2019d be under Dimitri\u2019s wardship forever\u2014or at least until she wed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The very thought struck terror in Dimitri\u2019s own heart and he focused in on the conversation, willing to offer up Voss first in the effort to retrieve Angelica. The man\u2019s arguments, much as he hated to admit it, were logical.</p><p>Chas seemed to come to the same conclusion. \u201cVery well, then. I\u2019ll accompany you to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Chas! What if Moldavi captures you, too?\u201d Miss Woodmore interjected in an unnecessarily shrill tone, confirming Dimitri\u2019s suspicions. He winced, his ears ringing.</p> <p>Her brother gave her an affronted look. \u201cI am quite able to take care of myself, Maia. I\u2019ve already evaded him once, and now I know exactly what I\u2019d be walking into.\u201d He glanced at Dimitri, then Giordan. \u201cNarcise will have to stay here, of course.\u201d</p><p>Damnation. Dimitri was not going to be responsible for another woman. Especially a Dracule who\u2019d destroyed his best friend, and by all accounts seemed to be working on doing the same to his closest associate. Both of them were fools of the highest order.</p><p>Meg had nearly done the same to him.</p><p>\u201cBut, Chas...I still don\u2019t understand. Why are you working with vampirs if you kill them?\u201d Miss Woodmore asked, glancing briefly at Dimitri. She looked exhausted and confused, and he felt an unwilling softening in his belly again.</p><p>He ruthlessly hardened his thoughts and lifted his chin so he could look down at her from an even higher level. If she\u2019d stayed home like any reasonable woman, instead of bartering her way into the most private apartments of an exclusive gentleman\u2019s club, she\u2019d be sleeping restfully by now.</p> <p>And dreaming.</p><p>Dimitri yanked his thoughts away from that avenue and drilled his attention steadfastly onto Chas Woodmore, who was trying to explain to his sister why he worked for Dimitri when he was bound to kill those of his race.</p><p>It really wasn\u2019t all that complicated, when one thought about it logically. Just as there were good and moral men, there were also members of the Dracule who were less inclined to live uneventfully alongside their mortal counterparts. People like Moldavi, who fed from children and left them to die. Or, when they wanted something, they\u2019d burn a house down and watch people perish.</p><p>Or they\u2019d feed on injured soldiers on a field, prolonging their agony just for pleasure.</p><p>Just as there were mortals who hunted game, killed it neatly and quickly and used it for nourishment, and there were others who tortured the animals just to watch them twist and cry and squeal...there were also Dracule, who fed expediently and took just what they needed from mortals, and quite often from willing ones, and there were Dracule who fed until the mortal was bled nearly dry. And left for dead.</p><p>As there were mortal men who hungered for power until it became all consuming, there were Dracule who did the same.</p> <p>There were Dracule who merely lived lavish lives, filled with luxuries and pleasure, but who were content to simply enjoy the sensuality of it, without desiring to control everyone around them.</p><p>And then there was Dimitri, who no longer did any of those things. Whose Mark blazed with constant pain for precisely that reason: because he denied the pleasure, the very covenant that Lucifer had given him.</p><p>And searched for a way to renounce it.</p><p>Thus, instead, he lived in solitude and darkness, seeking an escape from an eternity of hell.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate,\u201d Chas was saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to Paris with Voss and we\u2019ll bring back Angelica. That\u2019s all you need to know at this time, Maia.\u201d</p><p>Voss interrupted, shaking his head sharply. \u201cIf you want to jeopardize my chances, then you may come. Otherwise...follow if you will, but some days behind me. There can be no hint to Moldavi that we\u2019re working together.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri snorted in agreement. \u201cEven if he saw the two of you shaking hands, he wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Voss shot him a look of pure dislike. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p> <p>8</p><p>OF FEROCIOUS DOGS, HISSING KITTENS AND PROPER SYNTAX</p><p>Maia had so many questions she could hardly quiet her mind to select one for consideration.</p><p>But when she climbed into Corvindale\u2019s landau\u2014for he\u2019d absolutely forbidden her to hire a hack to take her home from White\u2019s, and she was simply too tired to argue about propriety\u2014and settled into her seat across from him, suddenly her wild musings and whirling thoughts scattered, leaving her mind blank and focused on one thing: him.</p><p>The door closed, and as had happened little more than a week ago, they were alone in the vehicle. Corvindale seemed to take up the entire expanse of his seat, sprawling his long legs to one side and the flaps of his sable coat open wide like a bird fluffing its feathers to make it appear larger. Settled across the top of the squabs behind him were his arms, hands dangling casually. His dark hair, always a bit out of sorts, flipped up and around his ears and temples.</p><p>He looked none too pleased with the current situation; but that was nothing new. He\u2019d never looked pleased with anything, ever since Maia had met him. But there was also something else about him that struck her. Something different.</p><p>A sort of wariness, like a large, ferocious dog who\u2019d been cornered by a kitten.</p><p>Maia considered herself the kitten in this situation, and even through her weariness and confusion, she decided she rather liked the metaphor. And because she was the kitten, Maia thought she\u2019d bare her claws\u2014as small and insignificant as they might be.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you are a vampir,\u201d she said, primly arranging her skirt so that not even the tops of her slippers showed. She would not think right now about what sort of mess her hem and shoes were in. Or what her hair looked like. She was hissing and spitting in her own quiet way, all the while trying not to be completely overset by the fact that her brother had put her into the wardship of a vampir.</p><p>\u201cThe proper term is Dracule. Or, if you insist upon using the archaic word vampir, I would appreciate if you would use the Anglican pronunciation\u2014\u2018vampire\u2019\u2014rather than attempting to speak Hungarian. Your accent isn\u2019t quite spot-on.\u201d He sounded supremely bored, and looked as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world but her diction and whatever was so fascinating out the half-curtained window of the carriage.</p><p>But despite his interest out on the streets, he was watching her. Particularly when she wasn\u2019t looking directly at him. She felt the weight of his regard as if it were a thick blanket, shuttling down over her shoulders. Warm and heavy. And not altogether unwelcome.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she replied, clearly enunciating her words so that there would be no mistake. \u201cYou are a vampire, then, Lord Corvindale, and I have a variety of questions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a variety? I was expecting a plethora of them. Or perhaps a score?\u201d</p><p>It was all Maia could do to keep back the little gust of a chuckle at this unexpected, wholly uncharacteristic show of levity. Or, perhaps he wasn\u2019t jesting and was being quite serious. She eyed him from the corner of her eyes and noticed his ungloved hand with its exposed wrist resting on the top of his seat. It vibrated and jounced a bit with the rumbling movement of the carriage.</p><p>As it happened, the moon or a streetlamp chose that moment to shine directly on it, and Maia found her attention attracted to the shape of that wide, dark appendage. Long, sturdy fingers, the ridges of slightly flexed tendons, the curve of a broad thumb and neat fingernails. It wasn\u2019t often she\u2019d seen a man\u2019s hand uncovered\u2014certainly Chas\u2019s, and her father\u2019s when she was young, and of course Alexander\u2019s\u2014but Lord Corvindale\u2019s hand seemed particularly wide and well-shaped. Even there, settled, fingers bowed gently, a latent power seemed to emanate from it.</p><p>They reminded her...Maia caught her breath, her belly suddenly fluttering, and her mouth dry...they reminded her of the smooth, dark hands from her dreams. She could imagine them, sliding over her pale skin, large and strong\u2014</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s eyes bolted back to Corvindale and she swallowed, frantically trying to catch up to the conversation. Then she remembered. She had a variety of questions for him.</p><p>But she would start with the most pressing one. \u201cDo you truly think that Lord Dewhurst will be able to save Angelica?\u201d She wasn\u2019t fully able to keep the pitch of concern from rising in her voice.</p><p>He seemed to relax a bit, his fingers shifting into a looser curve. \u201cVoss\u2014er, Dewhurst\u2014isn\u2019t one of my favorite people,\u201d he said, clearly understating the facts, \u201cbut his arguments were sound and I believe that he\u2019ll succeed, if only because the man is very manipulative and sneaky. And, one must confess it, intelligent and resourceful, too. If not burdened with a lack of responsibility. Aside of that, Moldavi has no reason to suspect Dewhurst of any threat, so if he doesn\u2019t find them before they get to Paris, he certainly has the best chance of gaining access to Moldavi. And further, your brother is close on Dewhurst\u2019s heels. In the event he fails, Chas wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do whatever it takes to retrieve Angelica.\u201d</p><p>Maia blinked. She could hardly believe it, but not only had he given her information that she\u2019d actually requested, he\u2019d spoken in normal tones. \u201cYour opinion means a good deal to me,\u201d she managed to say.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond except to lift his brows and look down his straight nose at her.</p><p>So she continued. \u201cChas seems to think that Angelica isn\u2019t in any danger of being hurt, at least until that vampire delivers her to Moldavi. Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Maia couldn\u2019t hold back a smile, partly borne of relief. \u201cI can scarcely believe we are having a normal conversation, my lord.\u201d She realized that her own gloveless hands had ceased adjusting the folds of the cloak and gown in her lap.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, shifting in his seat, moving his long legs so that they brushed briefly against her skirt, \u201cis because you are asking reasonable questions. In a reasonable tone. Although, I might point out that if you had stayed home like any reasonable woman would have done, we wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation. Civil or not.\u201d</p><p>She bristled a bit, then recalled that she wanted more information from him\u2014and now that she was as assured as she could be that Angelica would soon be safe, she thought it prudent not to annoy him. Although whatever she\u2019d done to annoy him in the past, she couldn\u2019t know, and therefore how could she keep from irritating him now? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd so you are a vampire, and my brother is a vampire hunter? And you are friends? He works for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rather irregular circumstance indeed, but true, nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can that be? Aren\u2019t you\u2014well, mortal enemies?\u201d</p> <p>The corners of his eyes crinkled a bit, which Maia took to mean that he\u2019d had a flash of humor. Astounding. Twice in one night; in less than one hour?</p><p>\u201cNow who is sounding sensational, like one of Mrs. Radcliffe\u2019s Gothic novels, Miss Woodmore?\u201d he asked, almost lazily.</p><p>Something fluttered inside her, for his voice had dropped low. She could barely hear it, mixing as it did with the constant rumble of carriage wheels. There were no other sounds outside, and she realized with a jolt that it must be very late. Near dawn.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prodded tartly. And then realized that, for all of her irritation with the situation, he was still an earl, a peer of the realm. And a vampiric\u2014was that even a word? She dared not ask him, but he would certainly have an opinion\u2014one at that. And her manner had become quite familiar with him.</p><p>He shifted, adjusting his coat lapels and running a hand briefly through his hair in a surprisingly endearing gesture. \u201cI shall make a very complicated situation as simple as I can, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, you need not condescend to me, Lord Corvindale.\u201d The kitten had unsheathed her little claws again. \u201cI\u2019m quite capable of comprehending any situation you might describe. It was I who had to tutor Chas in geometry and Greek.\u201d And what a task that had been, especially since Greek was just as difficult for her. But she would never have admitted that to Chas.</p><p>\u201cIndeed? Very well, then,\u201d the earl said. And his eyes crinkled a bit more, and perhaps even the corners of his lips shifted. \u201cI have a variety of business interests throughout the Continent, the Far East and even some limited ones in the New World. As the wealthy and powerful often do, I have more than my share of enemies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can scarcely imagine that,\u201d Maia murmured.</p><p>\u201c\u2014who would take any chance to see my investments fail, or to damage them, or any variety of things,\u201d he continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. But his eyes had sharpened a bit and she knew he\u2019d heard her. \u201cMany of those are members of the Draculia, and there are some who are mortals, as well. Your brother acts as my agent and, if necessary, will\u2014er\u2014remove any problematic individuals from\u2014er\u2014causing any further disruptions. He also assists me in managing some of my other associates, who are also of the Draculian race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you mean to say is that my brother is your paid assassin?\u201d Maia said, her eyes wide. \u201cHe kills people?\u201d She thought she might faint. Her heart was pounding in her chest in an ugly beat, thrumming through her stomach, which had suddenly become queasy.</p><p>Mama and Father...what would you think if you knew? Oh, Chas, what are you doing?</p> <p>\u201cNot people, Miss Woodmore. Your brother has never, to my knowledge, ended the life of a mortal person. But he has removed or otherwise dissuaded more than a few vampires\u2014and he was doing so for quite some time before I met him. Which, by the way, was when he attempted to do the same to me.\u201d Corvindale fixed her with his eyes, and Maia felt a little wavering tug deep inside her. \u201cYou see, Miss Woodmore, the simple way to look at it is that there are good vampires, and there are bad vampires. Your brother kills the bad vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd presumably you don\u2019t count yourself among the \u2018bad\u2019 vampires?\u201d</p><p>Maia didn\u2019t know how or why she had the courage to say such a thing\u2014for once again, it dawned on her that not only was she in a carriage with an earl, one of the most powerful men of the ton and in England, but that he was a vampire. A bloodthirsty vampire.</p><p>And, ward or not, she was alone with him.</p><p>He made a deep sound that at first she didn\u2019t recognize as laughter, but when the light fell on his face, outlining harsh cheekbones and the straight line of his nose, she saw that his lips were curved. His laughter was brief and as sharp as he was, and then it subsided. \u201cAs I highly doubt that Attila the Hun or Judas Iscariot or even Oliver Cromwell considered themselves \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018evil,\u2019 I suggest that your question is moot.\u201d</p><p>But then he fixed her with his eyes again. \u201cNaturally, you could pose the question to your brother if you aren\u2019t certain which side of the battle lines I\u2019m on, Miss Woodmore. But I suspect you already know what his answer would be.\u201d</p><p>Maia kept her lips compressed together. Indeed. Chas loved her and Angelica and Sonia, and he would never expose them to any danger if he could help it. And he was a good and moral man himself. \u201cIndeed,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd so I am to assume that Cezar Moldavi is on the other side of the good-versus-bad-vampire battle lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour logic is astonishing.\u201d His words were bored, but she swore she saw a bit of light in his eyes.</p> <p>It occurred to her at that moment that perhaps he enjoyed the verbal sparring as much as she\u2014well, she didn\u2019t really like the exchanges of insults and banter between them, for Maia found it outside of infuriating. But perhaps he found it difficult being both vampire and an earl. After all, earls were intimidating all on their own, but to add the fact that he was a vampire into the composite...perhaps no one was willing to stand up to him.</p><p>Perhaps they were afraid he\u2019d bite them\u2014or worse\u2014if they did.</p><p>Perhaps\u2014now here was a fanciful thought\u2014he didn\u2019t mind being treated like a normal person. Occasionally.</p><p>\u201cDo you truly drink blood?\u201d she blurted out. \u201cFrom people?\u201d</p><p>He became very still. Even his eyes didn\u2019t shift, nor his fingers. And the carriage all at once seemed to shrink, becoming very close and dark, and her heart began to pound again in that ugly way. She wished fiercely that she could take the question back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the common means of survival and obtaining sustenance,\u201d he replied after a moment. \u201cBut I do not.\u201d</p><p>Maia opened her mouth to ask more, but something stopped her. She sensed that their tenuous connection might be strained, or even broken, if she did. Instead she said, \u201cIs it true that vampires cannot go about in the sunlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirect rays from the sun cause excruciating pain, so one must take care if one ventures out during the day. Surely you haven\u2019t heard this information from your brother,\u201d he said. \u201cI was under the impression you and your sisters were blissfully ignorant of his...occupation. But you seem to have some...reasonable...knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe grew up listening to stories from our Granny Grapes, who was part-Gypsy. She had many tales about the vampires in Romania. Of course, at the time, I had no idea that not only were they true, but that I would actually meet some of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranny Grapes?\u201d</p><p>Maia felt her face soften into a fond smile. \u201cShe was our grandmother, and for some reason when I was very young, I got it all mixed up and thought she was our great-grandmother. So I got it into my head that her name was Grape-Grandmother. And so the name remained fixed.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled between them then, causing Maia to silently muse that she couldn\u2019t ever recall being alone with the earl and not fumbling or grasping for something to say. Or being skewered by his wit.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an uncomfortable quiet. In fact, with the rhythmic rumbling of the carriage wheels on the cobblestones and bricks, the moment was rather pleasant.</p><p>Without being obvious, she glanced at him sidewise. He was staring out the window, and it occurred to her with a start that he might be watching for another attack.</p><p>But, she reminded herself, that was unlikely, as the attack had already occurred. And so perhaps he was simply fascinated by a world that was beginning to brighten with dawn. A world that he must never experience fully illuminated, and warm.</p><p>What a terrible thing, never to bask in the sun or to walk through the rows of flowers when they were in full bloom. Not that she actually pictured the rigid earl walking through flower gardens, brushing his strong fingers lightly over rose blossoms...</p><p>He turned and the broad light of a streetlamp played over his mouth and jaw.</p><p>Maia looked at him, her gaze suddenly fully fastened on the lower half of his face. On his mouth. Her breath stopped.</p><p>A mouth utterly, horribly, impossibly recognizable to her. A mouth that she\u2019d remarked on, a mouth that she\u2019d scrutinized and thought about the fact that she was doing so because the upper half of his face had been masked. A chill washed over her, followed by a rush of heat. No. It was impossible.</p><p>She\u2019d almost made the same mistake before.</p><p>But the image was eerily familiar: his eyes in shadow, his mouth and jaw exposed.</p><p>Maia must have gasped or otherwise indicated her shock, for he turned to look directly at her. Their eyes met, suddenly clashing and holding, and she could no longer deny it.</p><p>\u201cIs something amiss, Miss Woodmore?\u201d he asked coolly.</p><p>It was he. There was no question.</p><p>I do hope you aren\u2019t about to cast up your accounts on my waistcoat, your majesty, the Knave of Diamonds had said that night.</p><p>While on this night, Lord Corvindale had said, I do hope you aren\u2019t wiping your nose on my shirt, Miss Woodmore.</p><p>She\u2019d been kissed by the Earl of Corvindale? She\u2019d waltzed with him? Flirted with him?</p><p>Maia felt faint. And queasy.</p><p>And...warm. Suddenly very, very warm. She needed to swallow, to lick her dry lips. That kiss had been...well, she\u2019d tried not to think about it. Because of Alexander.</p><p>Because if she was going to marry a man, she shouldn\u2019t be thinking about the kisses of another one\u2014especially a bad-tempered, vampiric earl. She shouldn\u2019t even have been having kisses from another man.</p><p>Something awful churned inside her. Guilt and shame, and yet...the tug of memory, of need, overrode it.</p><p>She raised her eyes and looked at Corvindale directly. He must know it had been she, even if he hadn\u2019t at the time\u2014for after their interlude, when he\u2019d accosted her and thrown her onto the balcony, he would have recognized her from her costume. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Never one to shirk responsibility, nor to ignore the elephant in the room, Maia said, \u201cDid you know it was me, my lord knave of diamonds?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened just a bit, then quickly shuttered. There was a beat of silence, then, \u201cI meant to prevent you from doing damage to your reputation by dancing twice with a man not your fianc\u00e9. I am, after all, your guardian.\u201d Even though his words were flat, she sensed an underlying defensiveness there. She looked at him more closely.</p><p>Good heavens. Maia realized, suddenly, that she\u2019d kissed a vampire.</p> <p>Her lips parted in renewed shock, but at the same time, a rush of heat billowed up inside her, fluttering in her belly and disrupting her breath.</p><p>He turned his face away, suddenly and sharply, and she was reminded of him doing precisely the same thing as he ended their masked kiss that night.</p><p>Oh, yes. Every detail of that interlude had been burned upon her memory.</p><p>Corvindale\u2019s fingers curled tightly now, and his wrists no longer rested loosely on the top of the seat. He\u2019d pulled them closer to his body, as if to arm himself.</p><p>She became aware of the sound of roughened breathing, and noticed the way his lips had pressed flat and hard. And deep inside Maia, her heart pounded madly. Her hands were clammy. Something was churning inside her.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she said. She needed his attention, she needed him to look at her. But he didn\u2019t move. \u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said more sharply.</p><p>At last he turned. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected\u2014burning red eyes, bared fangs, hissing and furious\u2014but he appeared the same as he always did. Ah, except for the eyes.</p><p>There was, still, a faint glow there, as if he hadn\u2019t quite been able to subdue it.</p><p>And as their eyes met, she felt a little shimmy of warmth wriggling through, expanding and filling her.</p><p>\u201cI have been thinking about the kiss,\u201d she said, once again addressing the elephant in the room.</p><p>\u201cThe kiss?\u201d Corvindale replied. \u201cAn interesting choice of article.\u201d His voice had changed; the timbre was richer.</p> <p>Deeper. And there was something in his eyes. Something...different.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder,\u201d she continued, \u201cif it was so memorable simply because of the environment. The mysteriousness of anonymity.\u201d Maia heard her voice, but her attention was focused on the man across from her. The tug, the connection between them was as real as if a string\u2014no, a rope\u2014bound them together. \u201cA bit of freedom allowed due to the masks. One can only assume you felt the same way, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could assume,\u201d he replied mildly. But his eyes burned a bit brighter. He\u2019d become so very still. This, even as his regard remained steady and strong.</p><p>\u201cI suspect there is a way to find out.\u201d She swallowed hard, and felt even warmer and more filled with expectancy.</p><p>Something twisting and fluttering moved in her. Her heart banged in her chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that you wish to be kissed?\u201d His voice was emotionless.</p><p>Maia licked her lips, suddenly nervous. Yet, determined.</p><p>Surely the experience had been overblown in her mind and would turn out to be little more than an awkward experience. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn order to determine whether the previous kiss was...memorable? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it won\u2019t matter on the morrow anyway,\u201d he murmured, his eyes still on her. \u201cAnd at least it will stop you from talking, Miss Woodmore.\u201d</p><p>One moment she was sitting, hardly daring to breathe, on her side of the carriage...and the next, those strong hands that she\u2019d admired closed over her arms. He loomed over her, his eyes glinting white and normal in the low light, his body settling on the seat next to her. Warm and solid against her side.</p><p>Maia turned toward him, lifting her face, her heart beating so strongly she thought she might faint. When their mouths met, it was as if a blaze of fire exploded in her, suddenly released from some pent-up place.</p><p>She heard a deep sigh that shifted the solid torso beneath her hands, a low groan vibrating from him as his fingers tightened on her arms. But Maia was hardly aware of the pressure, for his mouth was hot and hard and demanded her full attention.</p><p>His lips molded to hers, soft and warm, yet insistent, opening against hers as he moved to cup the back of her head. He held her as his tongue slipped along her parted lips, sleek and warm, then thrust inside in a sudden, strong sweep.</p><p>Maia closed her eyes, overwhelmed by the rush of pleasure bursting inside her. Their tongues tangled and slipped together, lips sucked and nibbled, his mouth crushing down on hers as if he couldn\u2019t get enough. She bit back, slipped her tongue deeply into the warmth of his mouth and he gave a little shudder against her.</p><p>Her body had blossomed awake, now swollen and ready, hot and loose, and she found herself pressing wantonly against him, needing to feel all of his strength and heat. One of her knees somehow nudged against his leg, and the entire side of his torso and hip pressed into her curves. Beneath the smooth linen of his shirt, she felt the rise and fall of his chest. Its image, already burned in her memory, rose in her mind to match the swell of muscle that she felt beneath each palm. She wanted to feel the skin, the hair, the solid slabs of muscle she already knew were there.</p><p>Corvindale shifted away, and she opened her eyes to catch a glimpse of his face before he slid his arms around her, pulling her up against a solid chest. His wicked lips closed over the soft lobe of her ear, where hours earlier a ruby had hung, and Maia gasped at the shivery sensation of heat and slick, his breath warm against her skin, burning into her ear. She arched and shuddered, unable to keep a soft moan quiet as tickly pleasure rushed down to her belly, and lower.</p><p>When his hands moved, one to cup the side of her jaw as he buried his face into her neck, kissing, nuzzling, and the other to curl behind her hips and pull her close, Maia felt herself slide into a puddle of bonelessness. Pleasure made her weak and hot and she sagged to the side, leaning into the corner of the bench seat, dragging him with her.</p><p>Finding her lips again, he made her gasp into his breath when he roughed her mouth open with a demanding kiss. She took him, hot and long, sweeping deep and meeting him with her own nibbling teeth and molding lips. The heat of his body, the smell of him, close and male, she couldn\u2019t remember how to breathe...</p><p>His body eased her down along the length of the seat, their legs mixed in with skirts, her head jammed against the side of the carriage and shoulder against the back of the seat. He lifted away just enough for her to see a faint red glow in his eyes, and the flash of too-long teeth\u2014fangs\u2014and to yank off his coat and thrust it sharply across the vehicle.</p><p>And then he was back, and she pulled him close, down on top of her, one of his legs sliding between hers, hooking into her skirts. When his thigh came up between hers, pressing into her, Maia found herself agonizingly aware of the heat and swelling there at that juncture. She felt as if she were going to explode, that she couldn\u2019t catch her breath, and she shifted, moving closer, trying to find a way to ease the pressure there.</p><p>\u201cMy...oh...\u201d she breathed, and then nearly arched up off the seat when he closed his hand over her breast, strong and sure. Through the layers of silk and her corset and shift, he located the sharp rise of nipple, giving a little sigh of discovery as he stroked over it with his thumb. The fabric shifted and sensitized her flesh, and Maia\u2019s whole focus went to that place where all of the pleasure gathered and spread, radiating down and through her, hot and sharp.</p><p>He pulled at the neckline of her bodice, drawing it down to expose the top of her breast. The fabric cut into her flesh at the back as the swell was revealed, and Maia saw her skin shuddering and heaving from her uncontrolled breaths, her breast a lovely ivory dome highlighted in the moonlight just before he lowered his dark head.</p><p>She nearly shrieked when his lips molded over her up-thrust nipple. It was so hard and tight that the barest touch set her to gasping and trembling, but he gave no mercy. His mouth was hot and wet, and his tongue strong as it swirled around the peak of her breast. He drew her deeply into his mouth, sucking and licking in a hard, fast rhythm, then slowing and teasing as if he wanted to explore every little wrinkle. Maia\u2019s world became dark and red and liquid, and she clutched at him, her hands curling into his hair and wide shoulders, pressing herself against his thigh.</p><p>The sharp rise of pleasure pulsed through her body, centering there between her legs, filling and throbbing as she tried to find the top, the end. Something.</p><p>His skin was so hot, his hair brushing her chin, his hands grasping her shoulders as if holding on for dear life. She felt a sharp edge, something on her skin, and then the flush of release roared through her. Maia lost control of her thoughts as she trembled and exploded inside, and then slid into the warm pleasure of after.</p><p>He lifted his face, and when their eyes met, Maia felt her whole world still. It was too dark to read his expression, but the heat there, and the dark need, made her mouth go dry. The tips of his fangs showed just beneath his upper lip, changing the shape of his mouth, making it full and soft and she wanted to kiss it. Again.</p><p>She became aware, as the pleasure sifted away and reality sneaked back in, that he hadn\u2019t moved. That his hands gripped her with a death grip, and then he turned away, his eyes closing. His breathing was harsh and deep, as if he\u2019d been running or struggling.</p><p>Maia reached up to touch his face, something she\u2019d never thought to do before now. Touch the Earl of Corvindale?</p><p>Still harsh and dark and taut as stone, nevertheless his skin was warm and rough with stubble. He flinched when she brushed against him, her fingers light on his cheekbone.</p><p>His eyes opened and now they blazed fiery red, suddenly and openly, and the fangs seemed to show even longer. Maia swallowed, a zing of fear shooting through her, but she didn\u2019t remove her hand right away. She let it slide into his hair and brushed it over an ear. Soft, warm, thick.</p><p>He looked down, his nostrils widening, his breathing changing and she felt his muscles stiffen suddenly. She realized he saw her bare breast, and suddenly aware of her dishabille, looked down to see what he did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a dark streak, a slender line across the mound of white flesh. As if she\u2019d been scraped. Blood.</p><p>Maia\u2019s gaze jerked back up to him, and she saw the struggle in his face. His eyes, blank and focused somewhere distant, his mouth flat and compressed, his jaw so tight that his cheeks were hollow.</p><p>Blood.</p> <p>She scarcely dared breathe, waiting. Would he bite her?</p><p>Would it be just as it was in her dreams...or would it be terrifying, as Angelica described?</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she frightened?</p><p>His face was a mask of darkness, of concentration and control. All at once, he shoved her away\u2014or perhaps himself\u2014and the next thing Maia knew, the heavy weight and heat of him was gone, and there she lay, sprawled in the carriage, one breast bare and her body still vibrating from...whatever had happened.</p><p>And she realized, too, that the rumbling of the carriage wheels below them had ceased.</p> <p>The space was quiet and still, but for the distant sounds of voices calling and the low rasp of his breathing.</p><p>Maia jerked herself upright, shoving her breast back into place, tugging up her bodice, wondering precisely what this all meant, and why he\u2019d pulled away and was looking at her as if...as if he loathed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, my lord?\u201d she asked, hiding her trembling fingers in the vast wrinkles of her skirt. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, everything is wrong.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d he gave a short, bitter laugh. \u201cAlways the proper miss. Or at least, nearly always.\u201d The inflection in his tones made it sound like an insult.</p><p>She looked at him sharply. \u201cCertainly you can\u2019t blame me for this,\u201d she said, gesturing to encompass the carriage and all that had occurred there that evening.</p> <p>Instead of responding, he merely looked at her. Watched her. His eyes glowed faintly still, but there was no sign of the tips of his fangs. His mouth seemed more full than usual, lush and soft.</p><p>\u201cBlast it,\u201d he muttered, still looking at her. \u201cMiss Woodmore.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back up at his gaze and felt a little tug of connection between them, his eyes luring and compelling her. And then suddenly, she gasped, realized what was happening.</p><p>\u201cAm I enthralled?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHave you enthralled me with your vampire gaze?\u201d</p><p>A rush of anger followed by confusion came over her, and then ebbed, leaving her to realize that if that was the case then she\u2019d had no control over anything that had occurred. It wasn\u2019t her fault for kissing another man, and allowing him to...well, whatever. She closed her eyes and felt the memory tingle through her. Her lips curved softly as a little flutter of pleasure tickled the inside of her belly. It wasn\u2019t so bad after all.</p><p>It was even better than her dreams.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, he was still staring at her. But now his mouth was flatter and his eyes darker and the tension emanated from him in heavy waves.</p><p>Maia looked away, surprised that the earl had nothing to say, and noticed again that the carriage had stopped. They were returned to Blackmont Hall, and the dawn had come.</p> <p>She rose, tired of waiting, awash with confusion and attempting to appear as if nothing was amiss when everything was, in fact, a frightening vortex of problems. \u201cGood morning, Lord Corvindale,\u201d she said when he made no move to assist.</p><p>Instead he sat there, his flat gaze fixed on her, no longer burning, but now black with loathing. The white of his shirt blazed bright against the dark velvet seat and below the swarthy skin of his neck and jaw. His eyes like black jet beads.</p><p>She flung open the carriage door with no little finesse, her knees shaking, her own mouth compressed in a worried line and her face hot and flaming, and she helped herself down from the vehicle and stalked into the house.</p><p>9</p><p>IN WHICH MISS WOODMORE GOES SHOPPING AND DEMANDS AN APOLOGY</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t truly going,\u201d Narcise said, eyeing Chas from across the room. She stood near the table, trying to appear nonchalant by plucking the petals from a bouquet of daisies he\u2019d brought for her.</p><p>He looked at her, his powerful, swarthy hands filled with stakes and a clean shirt. Normally the sight of a wooden pike in his capable grip sent a shiver of excitement mingled with fear rushing through her. But she was too upset right now to feel anything but anger and apprehension.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m going,\u201d he replied sharply, shoving the items into a leather satchel. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister, Narcise. Do you think I would leave her safety up to chance? Especially with Voss?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, trying to make the movement nonchalant, while at the same time, her insides turned unsettled and her body numb. \u201cVoss is smart enough, and Cezar likes him because he always has information he wants. He won\u2019t be suspicious of him, so Voss will have no problem getting in. And with those smoke-bomb packets you gave him, he\u2019ll have an easy way to escape.\u201d</p><p>Chas stopped and fixed her with a steady look. \u201cI don\u2019t want him anywhere near my sister. Not only do I not trust him, not only have I heard legend upon legend of him ruining women, but he is also a Dracule.\u201d</p><p>Narcise was surprised at the pang of hurt his words produced. She\u2019d thought she was well beyond such sensitivities. Damn it...after all she\u2019d been through, she should be stronger than that. \u201cAnd so you can commingle with we Dracule, we damned and damaged demons...but not your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlast it, no, Narcise.\u201d He jammed a hand into his shiny dark hair. His muscles shifted beneath the rolled-up sleeves of his untied shirt and she noted the sleek movement with a warm shiver of appreciation. \u201cIt\u2019s different for her than for me. I understand what I\u2014I understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Chas, I suggest you begin to help her understand. Because from the way she was acting that night in Dimitri\u2019s study, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Angelica was in love with Voss. And she doesn\u2019t know what to do about it. She probably doesn\u2019t even realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd even if she fancies herself in love with him, I won\u2019t permit it. I\u2019ll kill him first.\u201d Chas had shoved his weapons and shirt, along with a pouch of coins and bills, into the satchel, and now he slung it over his shoulder. He was leaving her here. Alone.</p><p>A moment of panic chilled her and she dropped the daisy she\u2019d been torturing. Cezar could find her. Or worse, Giordan. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you, Chas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d he said, his tone softening. \u201cYou can\u2019t allow yourself anywhere near Cezar. Paris might be a big city, but you know as well as I do that he has spies and makes everywhere. I won\u2019t risk you, Narcise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was almost impossible for us to leave Paris safely last time. He still has makes and mortal soldiers watching for you everywhere...you know it. You\u2019ll never get out of the city again, with or without Angelica. Let alone into Cezar\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better than that. Last time you were with me and he was searching for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t know I was with you\u2014at least at first.</p><p>Chas...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She knew she was being awful and selfish\u2014wasn\u2019t that part of her Dracule nature?\u2014but if she lost Chas, she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do. He was the only one she trusted to keep her safe.</p><p>The only one, she told herself firmly when her resolve wavered.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cezar would see me. You know that for certain.</p><p>He\u2019d be delighted to welcome me back into his lair.\u201d</p><p>Dark fear seized her. He was right. Chas would have no problem getting in to see her brother. It was the getting out that would be impossible. \u201cChas, please.\u201d She hated that she begged; she\u2019d given that up long ago.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me by implying your brother is more than a match for me,\u201d he said, his voice a little flat. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m capable of. And if we knew what his Asthenia was, I\u2019d have brought it to him long ago.\u201d</p><p>Narcise tried to believe Chas. She wanted to believe him; and much of what he said rang true. After all, it had been her fault Cezar captured Chas before they made their escape.</p><p>But as was the case for anyone who had been at the mercy of or tortured by another, it was hard to dismiss the sense of omnipotence that the captor inflicted upon the victim. And Cezar had done a good job of it over the course of decades.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here, Narcise,\u201d Chas said, gesturing to the stone walls. \u201cHe won\u2019t find you, and then when I get back we\u2019ll go to Wales.\u201d</p><p>They were in the cellar beneath the ruins of a former monastery in London, accessible through an old wall in a cemetery. All of the religious articles except around the building\u2019s perimeter had been taken away, and those that remained were partly covered by moss and lichen. That made it uncomfortable and more than a little painful for her to come into the space, and Chas had to nearly carry her in, but that was only until she crossed the threshold and closed the lead-filled door behind her. Then the pain was gone and she could be comfortable.</p><p>In fact, the chamber was rather luxurious, with a large bed, trunks, a table and chairs, and even a row of small venting windows to allow fresh air and filtered light into the space. Boxwood grew up and around the windows, which were at ground level, keeping the dangerous sun from streaming through directly. A thick rug covered the concrete floor, and a tapestry hung on one wall.</p><p>Chas had discovered the place as a haven for a group of made vampires when he was hunting some years ago, and chased them all away. Those who escaped the point of his stake didn\u2019t dare return, for he was fast and fierce. Aside of the physical attributes, he somehow had the innate ability to sense the presence of a Dracule. Even those of the Draculia couldn\u2019t recognize the mere presence of another, and they certainly couldn\u2019t identify the arrival of a vampire hunter like Chas. In combination with his speed and strength, which was nearly a match for any vampire, this ability made Chas Woodmore both feared and respected among the Dracule.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said, knowing she sounded a bit petulant. It was just that she\u2019d hoped and planned and attempted to escape from her brother for more than a hundred years, and now that she\u2019d finally done so, with Chas\u2019s assistance, she was terrified that her freedom would be taken away from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That Cezar would somehow find them. Or her. Or Chas.</p><p>Damned or no, she would never allow herself back with Cezar. She\u2019d wrap herself in those painful brown sparrow feathers and jump from a tower into the sunshine before allowing him to touch her again.</p><p>Or his friends.</p> <p>Freedom was glorious.</p><p>Chas looked at her from across the chamber, hesitated, as if trying to make up his mind, and then strode over to her. The next thing Narcise knew, she was flattened up against the cool stone wall, his hands on her face, his mouth crashing onto hers.</p><p>She closed her eyes and kissed him back, their mouths molding and smashing together, tongues fighting and sliding. Her hands curled around his skull, fingers digging up into his thick, black hair as he pressed her into the wall as if to leave the imprint of his body on hers.</p><p>\u201cBe safe,\u201d she managed to say as he pulled away to catch a breath. \u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Narcise,\u201d he said, looking down at her with glittering green-brown eyes. He bent to brush a softer, farewell kiss against her throbbing mouth. \u201cMake no mistake...I\u2019ll return. But,\u201d he said, stepping away, his face settling into something firm and serious. \u201cWhile I\u2019m gone, you have other things to attend to.\u201d</p> <p>Narcise blinked, trying to pull herself out of the gentle, warm haze he\u2019d caused to rise in her, to focus on him.</p><p>\u201cDo what you must do,\u201d he said steadily, \u201cto get beyond the past. Otherwise...\u201d He shook his head, his mouth hard. \u201cI love you, but I won\u2019t wait for you to come to love me.\u201d</p><p>But I do love you. The words didn\u2019t come, though she wanted them to. She knew they would be a lie. Dracule didn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014love anyone but themselves. She\u2019d made that mistake once before. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you, Chas.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d turned and swept from the room.</p><p>\u201cMr. Alexander Bradington has sent a message for you.\u201d</p><p>Maia froze, her hand holding the teacup halfway to her mouth. Her insides dropped, her face warmed, and she felt a rush of nausea replace the confusion that had been churning through her since returning early this morning. In the carriage with Corvindale.</p> <p>She looked over to see the earl\u2019s butler in the entrance to the breakfast room, holding a small tray with a card on it.</p><p>Maia forced herself to wait until he brought it over to her, calmly replacing the teacup in its saucer. Then, as no one else was present at the table or in the room, she broke the seal and unfolded the card.</p><p>Darling Maia (if I may), it read, I returned last night from my travels. I should like to call on you at two o\u2019clock this afternoon. Please advise if you will receive me then. Alexander.</p><p>Relief exploded in her belly. Surely he wouldn\u2019t call her darling\u201d if he were going to break the engagement or had otherwise changed his mind. Would he?</p><p>Maia read the note again, concentrating on the words written therein and trying to glean any other sense or emotion from them. The phrasing was correct and polite, which was nothing more or different than she\u2019d expect from him.</p><p>Alexander was the consummate gentleman. It was the proper thing to do\u2014to ensure that she was dressed and at home and prepared to see him. Even after his eighteen-month absence, he was so very considerate. Instead of rushing to see her at the earliest opportunity and interrupting her breakfast, he gave her notice of his intention. A proper gentleman.</p><p>Her hands felt clammy and her stomach unsettled.</p><p>She would not think about what she had been doing last night when Alexander was arriving home. She would not ever think about that again, now that her fianc\u00e9 had returned.</p> <p>\u201cWill there be a reply, Miss Woodmore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll return in one moment.\u201d She rose from her chair and hurried out of the breakfast room and up to her chamber, where she kept her personal writing implements and stationery.</p><p>Except that she wasn\u2019t able to find a good ink pen in her drawer, and so she had to resort to rummaging through Angelica\u2019s desk drawer for one. While she was doing so, she pulled out a sealed letter that had been tucked away beneath a box of note cards. Obviously something Angelica had meant to keep, but for some reason, hadn\u2019t opened.</p><p>Was there bad news in it? Something she didn\u2019t want to know?</p><p>Maia considered for a moment, looking at the strong masculine writing on the outside. It said merely Angelica. Sensitivity prickled over her arm. All at once, she knew: this was important.</p><p>She had to read it, she reasoned. Angelica was gone. There was the chance she might not return...only for a time; for Maia wouldn\u2019t allow herself to consider the worst, and Corvindale\u2019s relative ease with the situation had given her confidence that Angelica would soon be safe.</p><p>She smoothed her fingers over the envelope, wishing she had more than her intuition to direct her.</p><p>Without further thought, she took the letter to a candle used for melting the wax for the seals and lit it. Holding the message just-so above the flame, she waited for it to soften just enough to be pried away, but without damaging or distorting the seal. Moments later, her steady hand rewarded her by lifting the black blob of wax so that she could read the note.</p><p>Angelica,</p><p>I am very grateful for the information you provided me, and because of that, I plan to fulfill my end of the bargain and leave London. I bid you farewell, then, and offer you a warning: do not wear the rubies in the presence of Corvindale, or even at all while you are under his care. I intended the earbobs to be a jest that only he would comprehend, but in retrospect, I\u2019ve reconsidered. Wearing them could only cause you hurt and, whether or not you believe it, that is the last thing I should ever wish upon you.</p><p>Your servant, Voss.</p><p>Dewhurst. She\u2019d known it. Maia stared down at the message. A variety of emotions rushed through her, ranging from anger to shock to confusion.</p><p>Where did one begin to make sense of this?</p><p>Not to mention all of the other things she had to make sense of.</p><p>What to do with the letter?</p><p>Corvindale.</p><p>The very thought of facing him after last night made her knees weak and her belly flutter. No. She absolutely could not. Her cheeks flamed.</p><p>But he should see the letter. At the very least, he should read the reference to the earbobs\u2014which had to be the rubies that had suddenly appeared in Angelica\u2019s chamber.</p><p>She\u2019d told Maia a ridiculous story that they\u2019d been part of Granny Grapes\u2019s collection, but Maia was no fool.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t believed that story any more than she believed Angelica when she denied wearing Maia\u2019s crocheted pink gloves on a picnic. They\u2019d been stained with blueberry juice and had never come clean.</p><p>According to the letter, Dewhurst\u2014Voss\u2014had intended to leave London. Apparently he\u2019d changed his mind; perhaps because he learned that the vampire Belial meant to attack Angelica.</p><p>Maia shook her head, bit her lower lip and drew in a deep breath. It had to be done.</p><p>Blast it.</p><p>Slowly Maia replaced the writing implements in her sister\u2019s drawer and then her gaze fell on the note from Alexander. She\u2019d forgotten about it, and that someone was waiting below for her response.</p><p>Dashing off a quick reply that she would of course be pleased to see him anytime he wished to call, she started out of Angelica\u2019s room. But then she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the mirror and paused.</p><p>Her eyes went immediately to the simple lace edging of her bodice...and the thin red scratch peeking up from behind it. Such a tiny wound; no worse than if she\u2019d scraped herself with the edge of her fingernail. The bleeding had stopped last night and it was hardly noticeable, except when one was looking for it.</p><p>Maia bit her lip again and tried to pull up the neckline to further hide it. It wasn\u2019t so much that it was ugly, but what it represented.</p><p>Ignoring the fluttering in her stomach, she looked away and took in the rest of her image.</p><p>Her brown hair was smooth, pulled back in a simple twist for morning. Neat, if unexceptional. The hollows under her hazel eyes were darker than usual. Her cheeks were still pink from the mortifying thoughts of moments ago. And her mouth, with its fuller upper lip. She tried to press it flatter, so that both lips seemed to match...but she couldn\u2019t keep the top one from appearing swollen and off balance. Messy.</p><p>With a snort of disgust\u2014for usually it was Angelica who spent time fawning in front of the mirror\u2014Maia stalked out of the chamber. She was neat and well-groomed this morning, if a little plain in her simple coiffure and muslin day-dress. She didn\u2019t look any different than she did any other day\u2014which was to say, well. Rather pretty, in fact.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter one whit how she looked. She simply didn\u2019t want to appear that she was overset by what had happened last night...or, alternatively, that she was trying to\u2014what was the word?\u2014appeal to him.</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>Corvindale was no more than an arrogant, rude, stormy earl who thought he controlled everyone. Glowering at her from across the seat in the carriage, he\u2019d looked at her as if it were her fault that they were in there together. But then...he\u2019d moved.</p><p>Maia\u2019s throat went dry as she remembered him, looming over her, gathering her up and crushing her to him. His hands, his mouth, the strength of his body against hers. Her knees felt weak, and she actually had to grip the railing of the staircase.</p><p>It was his enthralling of me. His hypnotism.</p><p>He made me want to touch him.</p><p>Maia couldn\u2019t banish the stark image of his head bent over her bared bodice, the dark splay of his fingers against the pale color of her gown and lighter skin. And with it, even now, came the jolts of hot pleasure, panging in her belly and lower. Definitely lower.</p><p>Biting her lip, Maia shook her head in an attempt to clear her mind and to dislodge the memories. She felt no guilt.</p><p>Why should she?</p><p>She remembered when he looked at her so intently, catching her eyes and holding her gaze. He\u2019d lured her in, just like Galtier the vampir had done to countless women in Granny Grapes\u2019s stories. Although...Maia frowned. In the stories, the women never realized what had happened to them. They didn\u2019t remember. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then another thought struck her. Had he done it previously, at the masquerade ball? Was that why she\u2019d been so bold?</p><p>The last vestige of guilt that might have lingered fled, leaving her much relieved. Certainly one little kiss after a few champagne drinks when her fianc\u00e9 had been gone for eighteen months wasn\u2019t the worst sin in the world, but Maia had had no little pang of remorse for it.</p><p>Especially since she hadn\u2019t been able to completely forget it. But now it had all become clear to her. She wasn\u2019t complicit in anything. It hadn\u2019t really been her fault.</p> <p>Lifting her head high, she squared her shoulders and continued down the stairs to the foyer. The butler, Crewston, was still waiting patiently and she handed him the note for Alexander.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the earl?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn his study, of course, miss,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Relief flooded her. At least he wasn\u2019t in his bedchamber. Her face heated again at the thought...which was now accompanied by a tactile memory from when her hands had settled against his linen-covered chest last night...and she shoved the accompanying images away.</p><p>Thus, her knock on the door to his study was bold and loud. If she had a squiggle of nervousness, Maia quickly squashed it and drew in a deep breath.</p> <p>When he bade her enter, in the same annoyed voice as he always had, she opened the door with confidence and strode inside. Immediately she smelled the age and must of old paper and worn leather, and a hint of pine mingling with woodsmoke and cedar. Masculine smells that reminded her of her father\u2019s library...and yet, not precisely.</p><p>As always, the curtains were drawn nearly completely together over each of the three windows that studded the exterior wall. And as before, she felt compelled to walk to the other end of the long chamber to open them. But this time she resisted the urge, understanding now why he blocked the sun. Nevertheless, the room was well-lit with lamps and candles so that it was as bright as day. And there was the barest crack of sunlight triangling through one set of drapes at the far end.</p><p>Books lined the walls, many of the shelves appearing to be two and three rows deep. Piles of other tomes, messy and awkward, littered the floor, his desk, the table, even the cupboard where he kept whiskey and brandy. Papers joined them, scrolls, sheafs of parchment bound together, along with pens and ink. Maia had noticed on previous occasions that the majority of the works he studied weren\u2019t written in English, but in a variety of languages\u2014from Greek to Latin to Aramaic to others she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>He was writing when she came in, and even from her stance, she could see the splotches of ink on the paper. His penmanship was dark and bold, and rushed. He wrote with his left hand, and when he lifted it to dip the pen to refill its ink, she caught a glimpse of the smudge along the side of his palm. One of the perils of being left-handed, which was why she used blotting paper.</p><p>She doubted he would take kindly to the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d He looked up from beneath ferocious black brows. \u201cMiss Woodmore.\u201d He sounded exceedingly displeased.</p> <p>She tried not to look at him, but it was difficult not to notice the strong, bare forearms resting on the desk. The color of well-tanned leather, they were covered with dark hair and surprisingly muscular. His wrists were solid and his square hands capable and ink-stained, dusted with more hair on the backs of them. His coat was nowhere to be seen; nor was a waistcoat or neckcloth. Although, perhaps that rumpled pile in the corner chair was the coat. The white shirt he wore fit over broad shoulders and the string that tied it at the neck was loose, and it sagged, showing the hollow of his throat. And\u2014Maia\u2019s knees went weak again\u2014a little bit of dark hair springing up from beneath.</p><p>\u201cI have something I believe you should see,\u201d she said, ignoring the squirming in her gut and the flush rising once again in her cheeks. Stepping closer, she offered him the letter from Dewhurst.</p><p>Corvindale hesitated, then, muttering something under his breath, fairly snatched the missive from her hand. He barely glanced at her, and Maia found that no small relief. He seemed even more ill-tempered than usual.</p><p>Unable to stand still while he read the note, she walked to the far window and pulled the curtains open. Wide. With a good, hard, sweep of the heavy fabric.</p><p>Corvindale flinched, but she wasn\u2019t certain if it was from the letter or from her bold disregard for his preferences.</p><p>It occurred to her, then, that she should be furious with the man for luring her into such improper situations. Why wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>Why, instead of being angry, or feeling violated\u2014which she should feel\u2014was she merely overwhelmed by the sensations...the eroticism...of the interludes? Recalling them with the same sort of wonder as she did those hot, red dreams?</p><p>Why\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d he said, breaking the silence.</p><p>Maia turned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s obviously to Angelica from Lord Dewhurst. She hadn\u2019t read it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the letter, his lips twisting, then back up at her. \u201cSo you count lifting seals as another of your talents, Miss Woodmore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother of my talents?\u201d</p><p>The lips she\u2019d kissed last night flattened into a mere line. \u201cThere are too many to enumerate, but I would count your aptitude for arguing excessively about the most minor of details and your uncanny sense for disrupting the most pleasant of days as two of your most well-honed abilities.\u201d</p><p>Maia lifted her chin and walked over to the middle window, which sat at the halfway point of the chamber. Casting him an arch glance, she grasped each curtain panel, one of which overlapped the other, and yanked them apart with a flourish. A blast of sunlight cascaded into the room, bringing a soft, yellow glow to the piles of books and papers...and just brushing the edge of his desk. Still, the part of the room where his desk and the doorway were located was still swathed in shadow.</p><p>\u201cDo go on, my lord,\u201d she said. \u201cYou flatter me so.\u201d</p><p>His scowl grew darker. \u201cMiss Woodmore, you are impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore flattery, Lord Corvindale? Incidentally,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe most important part of lifting a seal is not the lifting itself, but how one replaces it. It\u2019s important to ensure that the edges of the wax line up perfectly to its original outline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Woodmore. I shall sleep much better this afternoon, knowing that trick.\u201d Was it her imagination, or did his lips move slightly up at the corners?</p><p>No. Absurd.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you will expect Mrs. Hunburgh to prepare something special for your tea with Mr. Bradington today,\u201d Corvindale said, looking back down at his curling paper as he dipped his pen into the inkwell.</p><p>Maia opened her mouth to ask the obvious, then closed it. Of course Corvindale would know everything that occurred in his house. \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m certain that Alexander and I won\u2019t confine our visit to the parlor. A walk in the garden would be most lovely, don\u2019t you agree, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would certainly be my preference.\u201d He looked back down at his work, and Maia was struck by how heartfelt his response was. She felt momentarily ashamed for her sly comment. But then he continued, thus absolving her from any guilt. \u201cThat way I won\u2019t be obligated to listen to your giggles and his waxing poetic over your beauty, and whatever other inane conversation you must be compelled to have.\u201d</p><p>Maia gritted her teeth but didn\u2019t reply. She supposed she had rather asked for it, at least this time. She considered whether she wanted to raise his ire further by opening the last set of curtains, and, unaccountably annoyed by the businesslike scratch of his pen over paper, she was nearly ready to do so when he looked up.</p><p>\u201cStill here, Miss Woodmore?\u201d</p><p>It was, she realized later, the studiously blank, emotionless expression on his face that did it. There was not a hint of shame, nor sympathy, nor consideration therein. Only boredom showed there, and barely that at all. The man was less emotional than a brick walkway.</p><p>And that was what set her off.</p><p>\u201cYes, Lord Corvindale, I am still here, although heaven knows why I remain in the presence of such a vile beast of a man. You took advantage of me\u2014of our situation last night\u2014and I demand an apology. You might be a vampire, but that doesn\u2019t give you the freedom to enthrall women to\u2014to get them to...\u201d Here she couldn\u2019t help but trail off, because the last thing Maia wanted to do was to put into words what had actually happened. And if she did that, she\u2019d be forced to recall all of the details.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t a prudent thing.</p><p>\u201cI might have been ruined, Lord Corvindale,\u201d she finished.</p><p>His brows drove together and his mouth became a hard line. \u201cMiss Woodmore, you overstep. I\u2019ve allowed you to flaunt your regard for my hospitality and my wishes by leaving your vases of flowers in every corner of my house\u2014including this room\u2014and the curtains wide in the parlors, your gloves and wraps and shoes on tables, and listening to you and your sister and my sister giggling at all hours of the day. I\u2019ve even disregarded your invasion of my private chambers and this study. But you will receive no apology from me for the events of early this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother has always spoken so well of you, my lord,\u201d Maia said, trying to keep her voice from shaking. \u201cHe made me believe you were a man of honor and that was why he entrusted us to you. And I\u2019ve been willing to overlook your rudeness and arrogance, and, now, even the fact that you are a vampire. But your violation of my trust last night is in no way acceptable.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was short and sharp and bitter. \u201cOn the contrary, Miss Woodmore. It is with deep regret that I inform you that, despite my endeavors to remove your knowledge of my Draculian afflication from your mind, all effort on my part to do so failed. In short, Miss Woodmore, you appear to somehow have become immune to Draculian thrall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Maia froze, staring at him. \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cIn fact, I wish it were, Miss Woodmore. Indeed, despite three attempts last evening, as I have done hundreds of times to others in the past, I could not hypnotize you. You were never enthralled. Which means that you were fully aware of and participatory in everything that occurred in the carriage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>10</p><p>OF WEDDINGS AND KISSES</p><p>Narcise heard a noise.</p> <p>Her first reaction was relief: Had Chas forgotten something and returned?</p><p>He\u2019d only been gone a few hours\u2014perhaps he\u2019d been in London, still putting things in order and making preparations, and had come back. Or realized that he didn\u2019t need to go after all. Perhaps they\u2019d already rescued Angelica.</p><p>But that was a brief, initial reaction that soon fled.</p><p>She listened intently, the hair prickling at the base of her neck. Likely it had been a mouse or squirrel, knocking a little bit of rubble across the concrete floor. Or maybe it was the guard that Chas had arranged, or even Dimitri bringing her\u2014</p><p>The slight scuff of a foot, so faint a mortal would never hear it, had Narcise slipping off the bed and reaching for her sabre. That was one good thing Cezar had done: taught her to fight with a blade. He\u2019d allowed her to learn, likely as much for his own entertainment purposes\u2014watching her duel with men who wanted to fuck her\u2014as to give her a false sense of hope that it might be a useful skill in gaining her freedom someday.</p> <p>In the end, it hadn\u2019t. It had been Chas who\u2019d freed her, not her own abilities\u2014a fact which made her alternately furious and grateful.</p><p>Slipping the sword from its leather sheath, she turned on light feet and moved into the shadows.</p><p>The slender but lethal blade comforting in her hand, Narcise stood in a corner behind the doorway and wondered if she would be better served waiting for whoever it was to come in, or if she should rush through the door and meet them on her own terms. But she didn\u2019t have the chance to make such a decision.</p><p>Just as the door opened, she scented him and whipped out from behind it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, shoving the point of her blade up against Giordan\u2019s chest. Just below the hollow of his throat.</p><p>\u201cI have no bloody idea,\u201d he replied. Eyes flashing, he grabbed the blade with his bare hand, yanking it away from his skin. It sliced along the inside of his palm and fingers, and immediately, his bloodscent permeated the air.</p> <p>Narcise stepped back, allowing the sword to fall away, her heart pounding. Rich and warm and familiar, the essence of him filled her nose. Despite the loathing that settled like a stone in her belly, she couldn\u2019t dismiss her body\u2019s instant reaction: the blood in her own veins surged, her gums swelled, threatening to eject her incisors, and her mouth watered. Awareness prickled her. She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cYou did that purposely,\u201d Narcise snapped, backing away.</p><p>Giordan\u2019s expression was no less hostile. \u201cAs did you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She used a cloth to wipe his blood from her blade and shoved it back into its sheath. \u201cI ask yet again\u2014what are you doing here?\u201d Then she shook her head. \u201cForget that. Just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing would please me more,\u201d he replied. His eyes raked over her, making Narcise feel, for the first time in a long time, as if she were dirty and used. \u201cBut Woodmore sent me. He indicated there was something I was to retrieve. Now that I\u2019ve arrived, I can only presume he meant you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m to stay here\u2014perfectly safe\u2014until his return with Angelica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t return?\u201d Giordan asked mildly. He\u2019d walked over and picked up one of the blankets to wipe the cut on his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to Dimitri. He\u2019ll protect me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never thought of you as one who needs protection, Narcise. You take very good care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept when I\u2019m locked away by my brother.\u201d</p><p>Giordan looked at her. \u201cEven then, you were formidable. In your own way.\u201d</p><p>She turned away, dwelling on how much she hated him and not the waves of memory, familiarity and emotion that threatened to soften her. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Chas sent you here, but I\u2019m not leaving. Especially with you. Just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know why he sent me here?\u201d He gave a sharp laugh. \u201cI certainly do. Here, where I could smell him all over you. Where I could scent both of you on the bed and against the wall and everywhere else. The entire place reeks of you two, together. That, my dear, is why he sent me here.\u201d</p><p>Narcise turned back, all casualness. \u201cThen why prolong the agony, Giordan? There\u2019s no reason for you to stay and stew in your jealousy.\u201d Her heart thumped hard and her knees felt weak.</p><p>His eyes flared red and the next thing she knew, he was there in front of her. His bloodied hand curved around her throat, bringing the scent of temptation much too close. \u201cJealousy? You believe that\u2019s what I feel? You\u2019re a fool, Narcise.\u201d He shifted his fingers to cup her jaw no less gently. \u201cIf I still wanted you, a bloody damned vampire hunter wouldn\u2019t keep me away.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were strong, and she couldn\u2019t keep from inhaling him: the fresh blood, the masculine scent of him, the heat emanating from his body.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve always known what you really wanted,\u201d she managed to say, managed to keep the bitterness from roiling in her. Blocked the horrible images still burned into her memory. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t me, was it, Giordan? My brother is a much bigger prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you haven\u2019t told Woodmore that. Or he wouldn\u2019t have bothered to send me here.\u201d Giordan moved closer, his legs brushing against hers. Though he was broader, they were nearly the same height, and his eyes bored into hers.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She stepped back, twisting her face away, and his grip loosened. Her heart was in her throat now and another move closer could make her knees buckle. She wanted to shove him back but she didn\u2019t dare touch him. Instead she wiped his blood from her chin and onto her trousers. \u201cWhy do you think he sent me here?\u201d Giordan insisted. Moving closer again. His fangs gleamed now, showing just a bit beneath his lips. \u201cWhy, Narcise?\u201d</p><p>She could see the pulse pounding in his throat, the vulnerable golden skin in the V of his loosened shirt. Now his hand whipped out, curling into the front of her man\u2019s shirt. He shoved her back, into the wall.</p><p>Her sword...damn, she\u2019d left it in its sheath. In the corner. But she was strong, as strong as he was. He didn\u2019t frighten her.</p><p>\u201cJust can\u2019t keep from touching me, can you, Giordan?\u201d she taunted, though her mouth was dry. Her heart choked her, pounding hard in her chest. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why he sent you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed, steady and yet somehow cold, and his fingers tightened around the linen of her shirt. He yanked her toward him, her body slamming into his as he released her shirt. His arms whipped around her, one at the back of her neck, pinning her thick hair in place, and the other grabbing her hip and pulling her up against his body.</p><p>He\u2019d knocked the breath out of her, and for a moment Narcise could only look up into his eyes, ringed with the glow of red fire. Her knees trembled. Her insides swirled.</p><p>His bloodscent filled her nose, still oozing from his cut, still printed on her fingers, tempting and rich.</p><p>She hated him, hated how he\u2019d humiliated her and used her...but her body knew his too well. Craved it still.</p><p>Giordan tightened his grip at the back of her skull to border on pain, holding her head from moving, wrapping her hair around his wrist. His face came closer, his mouth full and ready, his fangs teasing beneath his upper lip, and Narcise closed her eyes. Her own lips softened, her heart raced. She braced herself, feeling the shudder of pleasure already building inside her.</p><p>He brushed his lips over hers. So lightly, it was like a breeze. A lush, familiar breeze. She held back a sigh. Then he came back, his parted mouth fitting over hers, a little tease of his hot, sleek tongue swirling around her lips. Warmth shuttled through her in a forceful blast and she followed him, tasting, wanting more.</p><p>He released her. Shoved her away so that she bumped against the wall, her eyes flying open.</p><p>The smug satisfaction on his face had her leaping for her sword.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she said, somersaulting over the bed to get to her sheath. She whipped out the blade and faced him. \u201cGet out, Giordan. Or I will use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d he repeated, his eyes cold again, his fangs retracted, \u201cif I wanted you, no one would keep me away. Not even you.\u201d</p><p>Furious, she lunged, blade out and swiping lethally through the air. He jumped nimbly aside, his eyes filled with arrogant humor. She came at him again, slicing and swirling, but he avoided her much too easily, infuriating her even further.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too overset, my dear. You\u2019re acting out in haste and\u2014\u201d he twisted and vaulted gracefully over the bed anger. You\u2019re sloppy.\u201d</p><p>The chamber was red in her vision, colored red and hot with her fury, and Narcise drew in a deep breath as she spun around. Away from him. He was right, Luce damn him.</p><p>She had to gather her control. Breathing heavily, she paused, then turned, holding the saber at the ready.</p><p>He stood there, across the room, his breathing a bit heavier but by no means was he out of breath, the bastard. He wasn\u2019t even in a readied fighting position. His short, rich brown curls clustered over his head like that of a Greek god and she knew that the rest of him was as golden and muscular as one, as well. Blood streaked his shirt and stained his hand, where it had slowed to an ooze, and on his trousers.</p><p>Narcise met his eyes and lifted her chin. Holding his gaze, she took the point of her sword and opened the palm of her other hand to it. She saw the flare in his eyes, the widening of his nostrils, and she waited.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d he said, his voice taut.</p><p>She raised her brow. \u201cWhat is it, Giordan? Don\u2019t trust yourself to stay in control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t fed. In two weeks.\u201d</p><p>A little shiver raced over her. That was a long time. Particularly for him.</p><p>\u201cIf you cut yourself, you know exactly what will happen.\u201d</p><p>She did indeed, and the very thought had her trembling inside. Hot and trembly and frightened. And needy. She swallowed hard. \u201cGet out,\u201d she said, stepping back so that he could get to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll not say it again, Giordan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cast her one last inscrutable look, then strode past her to the door. His fingers on the handle, he yanked it open and turned back. \u201cI never figured you for a coward, Narcise.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the door behind him, wishing for a lock.</p><p>It was a long time before she stopped trembling. And even longer until she managed to dry her tears.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t get her scent off his hands. It was as if he\u2019d dipped his fingers into the inkwell of Miss Maia Woodmore, and now they were stained for good.</p><p>Dimitri closed his eyes. He had, in fact, dipped his fingers, his mouth, himself into her inkwell\u2014so to speak. He couldn\u2019t slip any more deeply into that inky abyss where he would lose himself, lose control, lose the great walls he\u2019d constructed. Where he\u2019d feel.</p><p>His disgusted snort was loud enough to pull himself out of the mental miasma. Satan\u2019s bloody bones, the woman\u2019s got me thinking in metaphors.</p><p>He focused his attention on the scenery of London passing by the window of his carriage. The same carriage in which the incident with Miss Woodmore had occurred early this morning, and the reason he didn\u2019t seem able to dismiss it from his mind. Aside from the fact that her very self permeated the cushions.</p><p>Braving the sun and getting out of Blackmont Hall early this afternoon\u2014after a fitful attempt to gain a few hours\u2019 sleep\u2014had been the lesser of two evils. He hadn\u2019t been jesting when he enthusiastically agreed with Miss Woodmore\u2019s suggestion that she and Bradington spend their time walking in the garden. But Dimitri hadn\u2019t thought any further than the benefit of getting them out of the parlor, which was too near his study for vampiric ears, and hadn\u2019t considered the fact that the garden was, in fact, just outside the windows of his study.</p> <p>He simply wouldn\u2019t be able to endure listening to the slushy, sloppy romantic prattle of the reunited lovers.</p><p>And it was only partly because, to his great mortification, he had once endowed his own sloppy, romantic prattle upon the lovely, if not improper, Meg. Many, many decades ago.</p><p>When he was young and foolish and in love.</p><p>He\u2019d been so in love, in fact, that he\u2019d traded his soul in order to live with her forever.</p><p>Or so he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Bitterness twisted inside him, and Dimitri settled on that unpleasant emotion. It was much better than thinking on feminine inkwells, which had the infuriating result of his belly softening and his veins swelling.</p> <p>He glanced out the window of the carriage and saw that they\u2019d turned onto Bond and were making their way along a street filled with shops and ladies patronizing them. Their maids and footmen followed along, carrying packages and navigating around dogs, street vendors, dirty-faced urchins and well-dressed gentlemen.</p><p>When he\u2019d climbed into his vehicle, Dimitri had no particular destination in mind. He\u2019d simply needed to leave. And Tren, smart man that he was, knew better than to ask if he wasn\u2019t given a direction...and also better than to allow his master to sit in the drive, waiting for the journey to commence. So he\u2019d clucked to the horses and started off.</p><p>Dimitri had considered visiting Rubey\u2019s, which was, to put it bluntly, a brothel that catered specifically to the needs of the Dracule. Its eponymously named proprietress, one in a long line of women who\u2019d taken on the name of the original madam, was a particular friend of Giordan Cale\u2014and Voss, as well. She was also exceedingly astute for a mortal woman, as well as attractive, sensual and maternal\u2014all at once.</p><p>However, Dimitri had no use for one of Rubey\u2019s women. Certainly there\u2019d been times\u2014rare times\u2014over the last century when he had taken his pleasure, and usually given some in return...but that was always after he\u2019d fed, when the blood thirst wasn\u2019t on him...though there\u2019d been the one incident when his body had gotten ahead of him. He still had the scars on his arm where he\u2019d ended up driving his fangs, instead of into the heaving, writhing woman beneath him.</p><p>Dimitri closed his eyes momentarily. The last thing he needed to think about was a heaving, writhing woman beneath him, since he\u2019d had just that this morning. Only with clothing between them, thank the Fates.</p><p>He lifted his hand to pinch the bridge of his nose in frustration, and Maia\u2019s scent came with it. This after he\u2019d washed his hands thrice.</p><p>Was he now branded with her?</p><p>And he simply must not think of her as anything other than Miss Woodmore.</p> <p>When he next looked out the window again, he noted that Tren had taken the opportunity to drive along Fleet and east toward Ludgate. The dome of the new St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral rose over the tightly packed houses clustering around it, visible even through London\u2019s constant filter of fog. At least, to Dimitri the church was new. To everyone else in London, it was the same cathedral that had always been there since its completion a hundred years ago.</p><p>But Dimitri clearly recalled the previous structure, whose spire had been destroyed by lightning in 1561, and then almost exactly a hundred years later, the rest of the cathedral had gone up in flames with eighty-eight other churches and thirteen thousand houses in London. The Great Fire of 1666 had melted St. Paul\u2019s lead roof, sending the molten metal pouring onto the streets, making rivers of glowing red heat.</p><p>He would never forget the sounds of houses collapsing and towers falling, combined with the shrieks of women and men shouting. The streets were so hot that neither man nor horse could bear to walk on them. He and Meg had earlier taken a room at one of the public houses on Cheapside and were awakened in the dead of night by the shouts and bells clanging. By then the fire already turned the sky golden-red, and smoke filled the air, enveloping the citizens in soot and choking them with smoke.</p><p>They stumbled out of the public house as the fire danced on the rooftop next to it, flames leaping like curling devils. Dimitri heard a cry behind him and saw a woman screaming at the small, flaming house, and realized her husband was trapped inside. He didn\u2019t hesitate but dashed around, trying to find an opening in the lashing tongues of fire. Only the front was burning, and Dimitri tore the door from the rear of the building and ducked into a dark, smoky hell.</p><p>It was his good fortune that the man was collapsed near the door, and Dimitri was able to pull him free. But by the time he reemerged, Meg had gone missing.</p><p>Even now, Dimitri remembered the terror of losing her. The paralysis, empty and cold amid all the hot chaos.</p><p>She\u2019d become everything to him, to the man of thirty who\u2019d spent most of his life buried with books and studies and had had little time or experience with the feminine gender. His Romanian mother, in adopting her new homeland of England, had embraced the Puritan tenet that affection toward children led them away from godliness. Thus she\u2019d been remote and cool throughout all of his youth.</p><p>His father the earl, a Royalist who\u2019d remained in England during the Cromwell years, took care to stay below the notice of the new government and taught his five sons to do the same by also seeming to adopt the simple, rigid Cromwellian ways. They had little social engagement and spent much of the time during the Lord Protector\u2019s reign away from London.</p><p>Thus, the sensual, earthy Meg\u2014who was several years older than he\u2014had changed Dimitri\u2019s world, bringing in a breath of life to an otherwise staid and bland one. She told him about her exciting, dangerous life as an actress in Southwark\u2019s stealth theaters during the time when the public stages were shuttered under Cromwell. Filled with enthusiasm and smiles, she was a bold woman who exuded sensual promise.</p><p>Meg had become his life. She lured him, the proper and staid fifth son of an earl, into her bed, and in doing so, wholly snared his heart and mind.</p><p>In retrospect, Dimitri had come to realize that she wasn\u2019t nearly as in love with him as he had been with her. Meg was enamoured by the thought of him being a peer and of a wealthy family, and what that might mean if they were attached, but she was not of his class, nor, more importantly, of his moral makeup. She lived for the moment and was scandalously loose while the genteel Dimitri lived only for the future.</p><p>Yet, that hot, red night when he emerged from saving the man from a house afire and found Meg missing, Dimitri\u2019s life stopped. He simply couldn\u2019t imagine his world without the sloe-eyed, coy-smiling, curvy redhead and he stood in the burning street, frantic.</p><p>Then, somehow, above all of the chaos around them, he heard her voice.</p><p>There, up in the window of the room they\u2019d let at the small inn, next to the flaming house. He saw her leaning out the window, screaming for him. She\u2019d gone back inside? Why? Then he saw the ruby necklace dangling from her fingers.</p><p>She\u2019d gone back in to retrieve the most recent gift he\u2019d given her.</p><p>His mind blank and terrified, Dimitri thought of nothing but saving her. He bolted through the door of the inn, which had just begun to catch fire. Inside it was already filled with choking ash and the heat radiated from the buildings around it.</p><p>But he could save her. There was time.</p><p>He ran up the stairs, already narrow and steep, but now darker and clogged with hot smoke. Stumbling, staggering, he went two flights until he found the room they\u2019d used, blind and hot, barely able to breathe. The roar of fire filled his ears, the sounds of timber shuddering and heaving as it crackled into debris, the walls warm and rough beneath his fingers.</p><p>Somehow, he found her, his hands filled with the soft, familiar warmth of Meg, who\u2019d collapsed on the floor near the door. He gathered her up and fell more than ran down the stairs, his eyes stinging with smoke, gritty and blind. The roof above was now ablaze, and falling pieces from the rafters scattered in front of him, tumbling down the steps and catching against his legs and trousers.</p><p>Down, down, down he went, staggering against the walls, at last reaching the bottom. Just then, a loud rumble filled his ears, followed by a horrible crash.</p><p>The next thing he knew, there was pain and heat bearing him to the ground, and everything was light...tinged with red and orange leaping everywhere. He coughed, tasted smoke, choking out her name and tried to crawl toward what he thought was the door.</p><p>Dimitri dragged them to the opening, his body weak and burning, his lover boneless and unmoving, the ruby still clutched in her hand, the chain wound around her wrist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Save her. I\u2019ll do anything. Save her. Save us. Anything to live.</p><p>The thoughts ran over and over in his mind as he crawled with superhuman strength, over rubble and coals, burying his face in the ground to keep from breathing the smoke.</p><p>It was a miracle that he made it from the smoking, blazing building, and even more of a miracle that he was able to pick Meg up and carry her down the burning streets, staggering west and away from the rage of fire.</p> <p>At last, he collapsed, coughing, his eyes gritty, his hair and back singed and his body screaming with pain. He couldn\u2019t catch his breath. All he could smell was smoke. Her body was warm and comforting next to him.</p><p>And Dimitri collapsed there, curling with his lover under a bridge as the fire raged in the distance. The sun had begun to rise in the distance, but the sky was already an arc of red over London.</p><p>He closed his eyes, feeling the strength sap from him. Meg hadn\u2019t moved, even when he shook her, tried to listen to her breathing. But his ears were deafened from the great noise, and he couldn\u2019t tell if her chest moved with breath.</p><p>Anything. Save us. Let us live.</p><p>He fell into sleep, or a faint, or something...and that was when the dark, fallen angel Lucifer visited him. Offered him precisely what he wanted.</p> <p>I can give you what you want, Dimitri. I can save her for you. Both of you. Live forever. With the woman you love. Will you agree to it? Both of you. Forever. Will you save her?</p><p>Even now, Dimitri felt the rush of cold over him when he remembered that moment. The clear blue eyes and the handsome face of the visage in his dreams.</p><p>What must I do?</p><p>Lucifer smiled. You need do nothing but live. Forever. Enjoy life. You\u2019ll save hers by doing so, and ensure your long life with her.</p><p>Dimitri remembered the vague feeling of evil, the cold skittering deep inside him. He opened his mouth\u2014or perhaps only the mouth in his dream\u2014to say no, to ask more, to question, perhaps even to pray...but Luce continued: Do you not love her enough, then? Not enough to save her?</p><p>Meg shuddered at that moment, and Dimitri felt her body as it gasped for breath. She was dying. He was losing her. No. He looked at his nocturnal visitor. We\u2019ll live forever? Together. You\u2019ll live forever. Lucifer\u2019s hand reached out in the dream, settling on Dimitri\u2019s left shoulder. Do you love her enough? Do you truly? Will you agree?</p> <p>Yes. I\u2019ll save her.</p><p>The devil\u2019s hand rested on his skin and a blaze of pain seared through him, from beneath his hair, radiating over his left shoulder and scapula. And so it will be.</p><p>When Dimitri opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was the ruby, dangling around Meg\u2019s neck. She was sitting up, her eyes bright and happy, her hair tumbling down over her shoulders. Not a hint of ash or soot marred her lovely face, nor were her clothes torn or singed.</p><p>Dimitri sat up and realized he, too, was intact. Except for a soft throb over his shoulder, right where the devil had touched him.</p><p>The city blazed behind them, a few miles away. They smelled the smoke, which choked out the sun and cast a pall over them even here. But they were alive. Uninjured. And together.</p><p>London burned savagely for three days.</p><p>Meg remained with Dimitri for three months. And then, fully realizing her power as an immortal, she left for greener pastures: younger men, an immortal career onstage and exotic travels.</p><p>It took years for the city to rebuild itself, disdaining lumber and using only brick and mortar.</p> <p>Just as Dimitri rebuilt his own walls, stronger and more solid than they had ever been. Brick by brick.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely, Miss Woodmore. Maia,\u201d Alexander said, smiling.</p><p>She had her fingers curled lightly around his arm and they were, as planned, strolling through the gardens at Blackmont Hall. The roses still bloomed, but the spring flowers that cast such heady scents\u2014lilac, lily of the valley, tulip\u2014were all gone.</p><p>Pink coneflower and Russian sage marked the paths, along with thick green moss and neatly clipped boxwood. Lovely gardens. It was too bad that their owner couldn\u2019t enjoy them...at least, in full sunlight.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Bradington,\u201d she replied.</p><p>They were alone. Her heart should be light. It was light. It was, and she was happy and calm, and\u2014dare she think it?\u2014relieved.</p><p>\u201cI do believe you should use my Christian name as you have done in the past,\u201d he said, looking over at her. \u201cAfter all, we are to be wed. Sooner, rather than later, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Maia smiled back and ignored the odd sinking feeling in her middle. \u201cI hope so, as well, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>I could not hypnotize you.</p><p>You were never enthralled.</p><p>Maia blocked the words from her mind, along with the horrible feeling of mortification. It couldn\u2019t be true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve returned,\u201d she told Alexander.</p><p>She spied an ivy-covered pergola and changed direction so that they walked toward it. Maia wasn\u2019t certain what she had in mind, but the fact that it was shaded and out of sight from the back windows of the house could be a benefit.</p><p>\u201cWhen shall we?\u201d</p><p>Angelica. She couldn\u2019t even think of a wedding until Angelica was safely home. And Chas had to walk her down the aisle. And Sonia must come from Scotland. \u201cAs soon as you can file for the license,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t told Alexander about her sister\u2019s abduction, and certainly not about Chas\u2019s occupation. How could she explain something like that? If she could stall for a bit until they got word about Angelica, at least...</p><p>\u201cWill it be enough time for you? I can obtain the license easily within a fortnight. Will you be ready in two weeks? I know there is a dress to be made, but also flowers and invitations and announcements, and the food...and where would you like to have the ceremony?\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s insides warred between delight and misery. Here was a man who cared what she thought, who listened to her, who understood what she had to do. But she certainly could do nothing until her family was back in place. And safe.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t tell him. At least, not yet.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the pergola. The shade from the clematis-entwined ivy covered a small area on the footpath, and, as if reading her mind, Alexander paused there, turning her to face him.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d she said, knowing that she would delay it if she had to. But perhaps something else to focus on now would be good. There were so many other things she didn\u2019t want to be thinking about. \u201cAnd I was hoping we could wed at St. Dunstan\u2019s. It\u2019s such a lovely little church.\u201d Her heart was ramming in her chest as she looked up at her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>He was watching her with his gray-blue eyes. They always seemed so warm and affectionate, unlike those dark, flashing ones belonging to...other people. And he wasn\u2019t quite so tall, nor as stiff and forbidding. He never spoke rudely. He never seemed as if her mere conversation was keeping him from something more important.</p><p>\u201cSt. Dunstan\u2019s would be the perfect place. I shall make a generous donation and speak with the rector tomorrow. If that is what you wish, Maia.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, noticing the way his eyes changed. His hands closed around her arms and he drew her closer. Her heart was in her throat now, pounding. Her knees were shaky and her insides fluttered nervously. He was going to kiss her.</p><p>She was afraid of what it would tell her.</p><p>11</p><p>IN WHICH OUR HERO FACES IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS</p><p>Two weeks later, Dimitri stared at the door of his study, rancid bitterness burning through him. His fingers curled into two fists that he ground into the desk in front of him\u2014it was either that, or put them through the wall. Or window.</p><p>Or somewhere equally painful.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Voss had just left, and was about to walk out of Blackmont Hall. Into the blazing sunshine with no protection.</p><p>It was impossible.</p><p>Voss had broken the covenant with Lucifer.</p><p>Voss.</p><p>The most self-centered, selfish, manipulative person Dimitri had ever known aside of Cezar Moldavi had somehow released himself from the unholy contract with the devil. A man who\u2019d lived a life of debauchery and hedonism with out a hint of remorse, without a care for anyone other than himself\u2014even before he\u2019d been turned Dracule.</p><p>While Dimitri still bore Lucifer\u2019s Mark. And it burned and writhed and seared him daily as he denied himself, studied and contemplated...and nothing. Nothing.</p><p>He glared at the stack of books, the curling, browned manuscripts and crinkling scrolls. His notes. His drawings. His hopes.</p><p>From somewhere deep in the house he heard the sounds of feminine squeals. Giggles, and a soft shriek. He knew what it was, and the sound infuriated him even more. He snatched up his heaviest cloak and stalked out of his den, calling for a groom and his carriage.</p><p>Damn the sunshine, he must get away from them.</p><p>Angelica had returned safely two weeks ago. Voss had rescued her from Moldavi as planned. But Chas, refusing to allow a demonic vampire\u2014particularly such a rapacious one\u2014near his sister, had intercepted them in Paris and brought Angelica back to London, where wedding plans for her elder sister had commenced with great alacrity.</p><p>Now, as of his meeting with Voss, Dimitri knew he would be subjected to twice the excitement, for Voss had announced his intention to wed the younger Woodmore sister. Now that he was no longer bound to Lucifer, there was no real reason Chas could deny such a marriage. The viscount was wealthy and a peer. And he was a mortal.</p><p>Voss had actually removed his shirt whilst in Dimitri\u2019s study in order to show him that the Mark was gone from the back of his shoulder.</p><p>When asked how he\u2019d done it\u2014how he\u2019d shorn himself of the devil\u2019s Mark\u2014Voss had said simply that he\u2019d changed.</p><p>Changed.</p><p>Dimitri climbed quickly into the carriage, taking little care to protect himself from the sun\u2019s rays despite the cloak he carried. The flash of a burn skimmed his face and ungloved hand and wrist, and he fairly welcomed the pain.</p><p>The antiquarian bookshop seemed even less noticeable than usual, with the alcove entrance of Lenning\u2019s Tannery next door fairly dwarfing the small, dark entryway.</p><p>Once inside, Dimitri paused and waited for the strains of serenity to slide over him. When he\u2019d drawn in a steadying breath of old books and worn leather, he stepped into the dark shadows of the rows of shelves and waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t take long for Wayren to appear. This time, she wasn\u2019t holding a book, although she had her spectacles on.</p><p>\u201cDimitri of Corvindale. I was suspecting you might return.\u201d She looked at him closely, and all at once, he wondered what madness had brought him here. She knew nothing that could help him.</p><p>He found himself momentarily at a loss for words, anger and confusion churning like sludge in his gut.</p> <p>Wayren cocked her head, watching him like an interested sparrow. \u201cI\u2019ve acquired something I think you might find interesting, and I\u2019ve been saving it for you.\u201d She turned toward a shelf next to her and plucked out a bound pamphlet from between two other much thicker books and handed it to him.</p><p>Dimitri took the slender packet, which could be no more than a hundred pages, and didn\u2019t attempt to hide his distaste. \u201cLa Belle et la B\u00eate? What is this\u2014a fairy tale?\u201d</p><p>She smiled benevolently. \u201cIndeed. Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve is quite an entertaining writer.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t see how a fairy tale will be of assistance to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you study Faustian legend?\u201d she said delicately. \u201cYou must see something of yourself in Doktor Faust\u2019s character. Perhaps you will find something different to relate to in Madame de Villeneuve\u2019s tale about the beauty and her beast.\u201d</p> <p>Dimitri took the pamphlet and tucked it in his inside coat pocket, unwilling to offend the woman. \u201cVery well. Bill my account for whatever it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>From behind her spectacles, she watched him with a considering gaze. \u201cIs there aught else I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>She waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cThere is a way,\u201d he said at last, a hint of desperation making its way into his voice, \u201cto break the covenant.\u201d</p><p>Why was he telling this colorless, quiet woman? What did he think she could do for him? Did he truly think she had some writ that would spell it out neatly and clearly; one that she\u2019d kept from him during his previous visits?</p><p>\u201cYou must find a way yourself, Dimitri,\u201d she said, in an echo of his unspoken question. \u201cJust as Voss did.\u201d</p> <p>Dully he realized he wasn\u2019t surprised that she knew of Voss, and what had happened to him. That was what had drawn Dimitri here. Some deep-seated reason had brought him to this librarian of sorts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he did it,\u201d he said, his voice thick. \u201cHe\u2019s neither pious nor has he ever denied himself anything. How could...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he have done it when you\u2019ve spent so much of your life denying yourself everything in an effort to do the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he exploded. But his voice didn\u2019t shake the rafters. It merely settled there, a pained affirmation that hardly stirred the dust. \u201cI always do what is right. I always have.\u201d He remembered those years of study, of Puritan starkness, of maintaining his honor even in the face of difficulty, when Royalists were hated during Cromwell\u2019s reign. Of rushing into a burning house to save the man.</p><p>Anger rushed through him. I did. Perhaps not so well now, but I did then. Before.</p><p>\u201cBut that is why he chose you, Dimitri. Do you not understand that? To have turned such a man to him\u2014a man who sees in black-and-white, and who lived in the light and the right\u2014was the greatest of successes for the Fiend. It\u2019s much easier to tempt and lure one who exists in the gray. Someone, perhaps, like Voss. Like Giordan. But you...you were different. You tried to live in the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the one time someone meant something to me...\u201d His voice trailed off, for he simply couldn\u2019t put the disconcerting thought into words. Meg.</p><p>\u201cAye. The one time you allowed yourself to open and love, when you were desperate, he used that very power against you. You were very vulnerable and that was how he convinced you.\u201d She was nodding, her eyes serene pools of fog-laced blue. \u201cHe found your soft underbelly. That is the way he works.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI accepted it. And he branded me for eternity,\u201d Dimitri said bitterly. So bitterly. He pinched the upper part of his nose, just above his eye sockets, as hard as he could. He wanted to make it go away.</p><p>Wayren was nodding. \u201cBecause of that, he\u2019ll not release you easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s possible?\u201d For the first time, he felt a real glimmer of hope.</p><p>\u201cAnything is indeed possible. But it\u2019s not without trial and tribulation. You, too, have to change.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri looked at her, frustration simmering. \u201cChange? I don\u2019t know what you mean. Change how? I\u2019m honest. I give to those in need. I don\u2019t take, I don\u2019t feed. I\u2019ve taken in Mirabella when she had no one. I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. You\u2019ve done that...but have you given anything of yourself, Dimitri? Any care, any affection or love or even any time? Or has your generosity been only that of material things? Those things which remain behind in this world?\u201d</p><p>Terror seized him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His response came out in a heartfelt groan. \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p><p>Wayren looked at him for a long moment, sadness lingering in her eyes. \u201cThen you still aren\u2019t ready, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>What precisely did one do?</p><p>\u201cTurn, please, miss.\u201d</p><p>Maia turned obediently, feeling the tug of her skirt as the seamstress\u2019s assistant folded it just-so and pinned it. Behind her, another assistant adjusted her bodice, carefully inserting another pin along the seam in the back.</p><p>What did one do when one\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s kiss had lost its attraction?</p><p>When one would rather be removing a splinter than meeting his lips?</p><p>Maia opened her eyes and found herself staring at the image of a lovely bride. Golden-coppery-brown hair shone in a shaft of light from the window, and the beam filtered over the pale pink silk of her gown. Over it lay an icy-lemon layer of lace, which gave the frock a shiny, pearlescent appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, miss. He will be unable to take his eyes off you,\u201d said the seamstress. Satisfaction colored her voice, and she stepped forward to adjust the short puff of a sleeve. It was made from twisted swatches of pale pink, lemon and blue silk, loosely braided and sewn stuffed with padding to hold their shapes.</p><p>Maia scanned herself. She did indeed look beautiful\u2014mostly due to the dress, she conceded. Though the bodice was low, and in a new neckline called a sweetheart shape, the little scratch on the top of her breast was no longer visible. It had healed weeks ago.</p><p>Since Angelica\u2019s escape from Cezar Moldavi and her return from Paris, both Chas and Corvindale had agreed that the danger from Moldavi had eased. The villain was now aware of Corvindale\u2019s far-reaching protection of the Woodmore sisters, and in light of his recent failure to use Angelica to bring her brother to heel, it was deemed unlikely that Moldavi would make another attempt so soon after.</p><p>Thus, the earl had eased his restrictions on the Woodmore sisters, although Chas assured Maia that they were still being protected, even if they weren\u2019t aware of it. Maia had, of course, noticed the extra footmen that always accompanied or followed their carriage, and the unusual number of shadows hulking about on the street from sundown to sunrise. She assumed that most of them were what Corvindale would term \u201cgood vampires,\u201d since they were obviously in his employ.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chas, to Maia\u2019s immense frustration and concern, had disappeared shortly after Angelica\u2019s return, leaving them once again in Corvindale\u2019s care.</p><p>Yet...since she\u2019d fled Corvindale\u2019s study the morning after the incident in the carriage, his mocking words ringing in her ears\u2014you were never enthralled\u2014she hadn\u2019t seen more than the flutter of his coat hem around a corner. It had been more than a month and they\u2019d managed to avoid each other.</p><p>Or at least, she\u2019d avoided him. Whether he was doing the same, Maia wasn\u2019t certain. And since Angelica had returned with nary a scratch, and had announced her intention to wed Viscount Dewhurst, Corvindale hadn\u2019t been seen at all.</p><p>She\u2019d heard the deep rumble of his voice, and noticed the closed door to his study. And, fortunately, she\u2019d had no reason to disturb the earl.</p><p>But Alexander had been to Blackmont Hall often.</p><p>And he always seemed to want to walk in the garden, and to stop in that shady pergola.</p><p>But kissing him had become as interesting as kissing her own hand. Maia knew\u2014for she\u2019d tried it.</p><p>And what had once been a tingling anticipation for his arrival was now a heavy leaden ball in her middle.</p><p>She didn\u2019t love him.</p><p>One doesn\u2019t marry for love. One marries for money or prestige or position. Or even for good family, as long as it is a good match.</p><p>She\u2019d often given such a lecture to Angelica, who, for a time, had thought herself in love with the very untenable Mr. Ferring-Dulles. Love doesn\u2019t factor into it. It might come later if one is compatible with one\u2019s husband. Or if one is very lucky, it might also be there from the beginning.</p><p>But one doesn\u2019t expect or seek love in marriage.</p><p>Maia knew better, for there was a time when she thought she\u2019d loved Mr. Virgil. She\u2019d thought they were eloping to marry on that night when she dressed in men\u2019s breeches and sneaked out of the house.</p><p>But instead, the night had turned out to be a horror, the details of which she\u2019d long forgotten. Or otherwise suppressed. She shivered now, as a wisp of memory flitted through her mind. Corvindale. In the carriage. She in her breeches, hair tucked beneath a sagging cap.</p><p>Why could she not remember?</p><p>She sighed. No, love definitely could not and should not factor into one\u2019s choice of husband.</p><p>And that was why, in three days, Maia would be marrying Alexander Bradington. In the very lovely dress she was now wearing.</p><p>Dimitri looked down at the note, glad for the distraction.</p><p>The house was filled with energy and activity. Miss Woodmore was to wed Bradington in three days, and for some reason unbeknownst to him, everyone related to the nuptials seemed to be coming and going from Blackmont Hall today. It was as if the walls were swollen to bursting.</p><p>Angelica Woodmore\u2019s wedding plans were also progressing, if one were to judge by the number of appointments with flower-keepers and seamstresses and other entities, not to mention the swatches of material, scraps of notes and drawings, that had littered the parlor table yesterday. Couldn\u2019t the blasted chits wait until their brother was back to attend to these things? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Naturally that could take weeks. Or months. Or longer. He knew that Woodmore meant to find a way to kill Cezar Moldavi, for until he did so, Narcise would never be safe. But his continued absence was making things even more inconvenient for Dimitri. And the sisters seemed to have confidence that their brother would be in attendance for their weddings, regardless of whatever else he was attending to.</p><p>Dimitri hadn\u2019t had a good day\u2019s sleep in weeks, so there was no sense in attempting it today. Perhaps he would respond to the message.</p><p>Lord Corvindale,</p> <p>I should like to invite you to examine a new collection of works that I have recently procured. I am hopeful that one of them might contain the information you seek. Please advise soonest, for I have other interested clients.</p><p>G. Reginald.</p><p>Gellis Reginald was another antiquarian bookseller that Dimitri had patronized, although not for months since he\u2019d found Wayren\u2019s shop. Perhaps the man had heard that his most influential customer had gone elsewhere and wished to lure him back, or perhaps he truly did have something of interest.</p><p>Regardless, it was an opportunity to leave the house.</p><p>Dimitri put aside his other papers\u2014contracts and balance sheets, bank drafts and bills that he\u2019d taken a moment to peruse and sign merely in order to get Beckett, his man of business, to stop nagging him\u2014and rang for the carriage.</p> <p>The day was a normal gloomy one, with thick rolling fog and gray everywhere. Nevertheless, Dimitri needed his cloak. An abnormal wave of bitterness flooded him as he scooped it up and stalked out, leaving a house filled with squeals and giggles behind him.</p><p>When they arrived at Reginald\u2019s dingy shop front, Dimitri climbed out and bade Tren to return for him at the public house on the end of the block.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect to be long,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo hours at the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Woodmore asked that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dimitri flapped an impatient hand and walked into the shop, letting the door slam behind him. Immediately he was accosted by the smells of age and mold, as well as dust and even mouse dung.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hear a thing about Miss Woodmore.</p> <p>Likely she\u2019d asked Mrs. Hunburgh to have one of the servants pick up some package or other for her, and Tren had been given the task. He didn\u2019t care. Soon she would be out of his house, and out of his thoughts.</p><p>And, pray God, out of his dreams.</p><p>\u201cReginald,\u201d he called in his peremptory voice when he saw that the shop was empty. \u201cIt\u2019s Corvindale.\u201d</p><p>Blast it. Why wasn\u2019t the man waiting for him? He\u2019d sent the message, after all.</p><p>Dimitri had no interest in examining the old watches and ratty-cornered Bibles and poetry books that the shopkeeper attempted to foist off as valuable antiquities. That was part of the reason he had ceased patronizing the man after a while\u2014his offerings were nigh worthless when one sought words from the ancients, and in their own languages. Too many things were lost in the translation of others, so Dimitri had learned to do his own.</p><p>\u201cReginald!\u201d he called again in a voice that made the glass cases shudder. He sniffed the air, suddenly realizing the faint strain of blood that he\u2019d just noticed was too strong to be something as innocent as a nosebleed.</p><p>Dimitri was behind the counter in a moment, pushing through the sagging door that led to the back room of the shop. Once through there, the smell of blood was stronger and richer, causing him to hesitate for a moment to determine the direction of its origin. The room was cluttered in what could have been its normal state, or the scene of an altercation. A single door in the back wall presumably led to the alley behind, and the one window was, thankfully, covered in grime, making the chamber dim and shadowy. On the floor was a half-dried pool of blood.</p><p>As he turned, another smell reached his nose. A familiar one that made him frown in shock and confusion.</p> <p>And then all at once, the back door burst open and three figures vaulted through, into the room.</p><p>Dimitri reacted automatically as they lunged toward him, grabbing one by the arm and slinging him into the wall, then turning to meet the others. He ducked and easily sent a second one flying, then swung around to slam a fist into the gut of another. The dull flare of fire in their eyes identified them as makes, relatively weak ones by his estimation.</p><p>He reached for a wooden stool, breaking off one of the legs into a jagged stake as he heard a noise behind him. The scent came with it, the familiar one, and it had him whirling just in time to see her stepping from the door at the front of the shop.</p><p>Impossible. She was dead.</p><p>Something red glittered on her hand and as Dimitri stumbled, his chest tightening and slowing, he saw that she wore ropes of them. Rubies. Dangling from her ears and around her throat and two robin\u2019s-egg-size gems on her fingers. Tiny ones glittered in her dark hair. So many... His body lumbered, limbs clumsy and heavy.</p><p>His attackers came behind him, pushing him forward when he would have spun away, shoving him toward her, and just before something black and heavy wafted down over his face and shoulders, he managed to gasp, \u201cLerina. How?\u201d</p><p>Her laughter curled around his ears and into his consciousness as he fought to breathe. He saw the flash of red in her eyes and the gleam of fangs. Weakness deadened his limbs and the heavy cloth tightened around him. The rubies came closer; he could feel them through the fabric. Binding, burning.</p><p>And then everything went dark.</p><p>12</p><p>HELL HATH NO FURY</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am, my lady,\u201d said the groom as he opened the door for Maia.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d she asked, pausing when she noticed the stricken look on his face. He was more than thirty minutes late picking her up from her fitting at the seamstress\u2019s shop, and Tren had always been on time in the past.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019a been so late but my lordship...well, I but waited for him and he ain\u2019t never come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am certain he\u2019ll find his own way back to Blackmont Hall,\u201d Maia replied, settling in her seat. After all, as he was fond of reminding her, he was Corvindale. \u201cOr perhaps we should make one more stop at where you were to meet him, in the event he was detained?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady, if you would permit the delay, I would do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, thinking mostly of the tongue-lashing poor Tren would get from his master if he weren\u2019t there when Corvindale expected him to be. Even if the earl was late, the fault would lie with his servant.</p><p>Maia frowned as Tren closed the door and retracted the unpleasant thought. Despite his impatience with her, Maia had never witnessed the earl being unaccountably rude to his servants. Firm and directive, certainly, but never overbearingly rude.</p><p>And then her thoughts wandered to the next logical step: that if they did succeed in meeting up with Corvindale, she would be forced to ride alone in the carriage with him again. Aunt Iliana and Angelica had gone on home earlier, for the latter had had an appointment with a flower-seller and Maia\u2019s fitting had gone on too long, for one of the seams had to be redone.</p><p>Maia\u2019s heart stuttered as she imagined him sitting across from her on the seat, filling the space and making it smaller.</p><p>Perhaps she ought to have Tren take her back to Blackmont Hall first.</p><p>No. Maia wasn\u2019t a coward. She\u2019d face him if she had to.</p><p>Nevertheless, her throat was dry as a bone and her belly swirled with nerves as Tren drove them along Picadilly and past Bond. The calls of flower-sellers and metal-workers clashed with the constant rattle of wagons and open carriages over the cobblestones. Dogs barked, children shouted, messengers dashed nimbly along the edge of the streets, weaving in and around shoppers and shopkeepers alike. Nothing ever seemed to slow or to quiet in London, she reflected, trying to keep her mind on something other than the possibility of riding home with the earl. Even the storefronts and houses seemed loud and overbearing, packed together as they were, built up against each other like uneven, brick teeth.</p><p>At last, the carriage came to a halt. Maia waited as Tren climbed down and went into a little pub called the Fiery Grate. As she sat there, she noticed the sign for G. Reginald, Antiquarian Books and Curiosities.</p><p>It was only a block from the public house, and she wondered...would Corvindale have gone in there? It seemed a place that would interest him.</p><p>That little prickling of instinct bothered her along her forearms, and when Tren returned moments later, she opened the carriage door and made the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, my lady, that is the place I took him first,\u201d the groom told her. \u201cBut he gave orders to meet at the Fiery Grate and he isn\u2019t there. No\u2019ne has seen him.\u201d</p><p>Maia gathered up her skirts. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s in the shop and has lost track of time. If you like, I\u2019ll go in and look.\u201d</p><p>The poor groom\u2019s face was so relieved Maia smiled. She could imagine his reluctance to enter a shop dressed as plainly as he was, and in an unfamiliar place. Aside of that, she thought there might be items of interest in Mr. Reginald\u2019s place.</p><p>Inside she found the place strangely quiet and deserted. It wasn\u2019t all that uncommon to enter a shop and need to wait for the proprietor to come from the back, but the place was so silent that Maia sensed immediately that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cHello? Mr. Reginald?\u201d she called, leaning on the counter to see if she could peer into the back room. The door was ajar and she smelled something that wafted over the commonplace aromas of dust and age that often accompanied antiques.</p><p>Something was amiss. The smell on the air...it boded no well.</p><p>Maia started toward the back of the shop, then hesitated. She should ask Tren to come with her. What kind of fool would she be, walking into somewhere alone?</p><p>Yet, he\u2019d have to find a place to tie the horses....</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she called again, skirting carefully around the counter, looking for something that she might use as a weapon. Settling on a long, heavy cane in one of the display cases, she pulled it out and tiptoed toward the ajar door. Heart pounding in her throat, she raised the cane up in front of her shoulder, and stepped into the back room.</p><p>The first thing she noticed was the dark pool on the floor, and immediately attributed the strange scent she\u2019d smelled to it. Blood. Lots of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the space was silent, and she stepped in farther, lifting her skirt out of the way. The place was a mess, and appeared as if some sort of battle had accompanied the puddle of blood. Something gleamed on the floor and Maia glanced around nervously before stooping to pick it up.</p><p>Her heart gave an odd little kick when she recognized it. Corvindale\u2019s button; unmistakeable because it was stamped with the earl\u2019s crest.</p><p>So he had been here. That odd feeling settled into something less pleasant and Maia glanced toward the window, which was dark with dirt. If she had more light, she could see...</p> <p>\u201cMiss?\u201d came a voice from the front.</p><p>Tren. Maia turned and hurried back to the half-open door. \u201cCall the constable,\u201d she said. \u201cI think something\u2019s gone wrong.\u201d She came back, snatching up a lamp, and crouched on the floor, searching for something else that might prove that the earl had been there.</p><p>When she saw the hairpin, Maia\u2019s heart kicked up again as she reached for it. This was no ordinary hairpin, but one studded with tiny...rubies.</p><p>Rubies.</p><p>Corvindale hated rubies. They infuriated him.</p> <p>Maia shook her head. No. Something was wrong. She remembered how he\u2019d been so odd in the carriage when Angelica had been abducted, when they both had been wearing ruby earbobs. It wasn\u2019t that he simply hated them...it was that they had some sort of ill effect on him.</p><p>The prickling of certainty, her instinct, lifted the fine hairs on her arms.</p><p>With a flash, she recalled the night of the masquerade, and Mirabella\u2019s description of the fight. There was a necklace of rubies on him.</p><p>A hairpin with rubies on it. Corvindale\u2019s button. Blood, and signs of struggle.</p><p>Maia went cold. It was no coincidence. Something had happened to the earl.</p><p>She looked down at the hairpin, recognition tickling the back of her mind. She\u2019d seen this accessory somewhere before. Someone had been wearing it, or something like it. She frowned, concentrating, trying to pull up a picture of her in her mind.</p> <p>Someone she\u2019d seen recently.</p><p>Someone she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>But someone she was going to find.</p><p>Dimitri smelled, listened, felt...then opened his eyes.</p><p>He was in a chair, a large, upholstered one, sprawled as if dumped therein.</p><p>His body was still heavy\u2014his arms, legs, nothing moved properly\u2014yet he wasn\u2019t restrained. So to speak.</p><p>She was standing over him, wearing rubies, looking down with satisfaction. She appeared exactly the same as she had that night in Vienna. Tall and slender, thick dark hair, lush red lips and cheekbones that cut like right angles. Still lovely, but now there was a flash of permanent anger in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLerina,\u201d he managed to say, looking around the chamber. It appeared to be some sort of parlor. Not particularly well-kept; it was dusty and some of the furnishings were covered with sheets. The windows were draped and the light was dim. Her scent filled his nostrils, along with other ones: blood, old fabric, dust, worn leather, water. Saltwater. Fish.</p> <p>They were near the Thames, possibly the wharf.</p><p>\u201cHave you missed me, darling?\u201d she asked, lunging closer to pat him on the cheek. The rubies swung and shifted toward him. \u201cWe have so much to catch up on.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as a wave of pain swept him, then ebbed slightly as she pulled back. \u201cMoldavi, I presume?\u201d</p><p>Lerina smiled, showing her fangs. \u201cYou are a smart one, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose body did I find? Wearing...your gown?\u201d he asked, trying to control his unsteady breathing. Now he knew how the secret of his Asthenia had become known.</p><p>Being his mistress, Lerina must somehow have figured it out; for he certainly had never told her. Or she and Moldavi together had done so.</p><p>She shrugged and the rubies danced. \u201cI haven\u2019t any idea.</p><p>Cezar took care of that. Some mortal, most likely. The whole point was to make you believe I\u2019d died in the fire.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri pulled himself upright in the chair. Every movement felt as if he were weighted down with leaden pipes while slogging upriver through a heavy current. The pain from his Mark had melded with that from the rubies, stealing his breath and burning his skin. Yet, when he could lift himself above the physical discomfort, his mind worked like an oiled machine. And it was working now.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask me what I want?\u201d Lerina said, leaning close again.</p><p>Her scent filled his nose, along with a renewed rush of pain from the rubies. Dimitri didn\u2019t flinch or blink, holding her gaze steady with his own. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me. Although I\u2019m also...quite certain I already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lerina grinned and ran her tongue over the points of her incisors. \u201cI\u2019ve waited more than a century for this, Dimitri, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn entire century,\u201d he managed to say. \u201cDid you have nothing better to do?\u201d</p><p>Her hand whipped out and caught the side of his face, one of her ruby rings slicing his skin. The blow left his ears ringing, but he didn\u2019t move. Warm blood trickled down his cheek.</p><p>Her nostrils flared as she drew in the scent, her attention focused on his cut. Then she seemed to refocus, shaking her head a bit and stepping back with an odd smile.</p><p>He was certain he was in no imminent danger of anything more than Lerina\u2019s nonstop chatter and further displays of temper. Moldavi had to be behind this, and Dimitri presumed the man would want to have a moment of glory in front of his victim before otherwise dispatching him\u2014or whatever his plan was.</p><p>\u201cSince you won\u2019t ask me, I\u2019ll tell you all,\u201d Lerina announced.</p><p>\u201cJust the basics, please. No need to...embroider the details.\u201d He was finding it more difficult to remain easy and keep his voice strong.</p><p>Annoyance flared in her eyes, a bright glow ringing blue irises. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said, mercifully stepping back. Her hand fluttered as she posed for what promised to be a dramatic soliloquy.</p><p>\u201cCezar ensured that I was made Dracule,\u201d she said, as if it were some great pronouncement. When he gave no discernable reaction\u2014he would have rolled his eyes if he\u2019d had the energy\u2014her mouth tightened and then she continued, \u201cI wanted you to sire me, Dimitri. We would have lived very happily together for eternity. But you refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the Fates,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Her face darkened again. \u201cYou always were a testy, cutting person,\u201d she said. \u201cAttractive as you are in...other ways. It\u2019s no wonder Meg left you after she got what she wanted. But I would have stayed. All you needed was to make me immortal, and I would have loved you forever.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri ignored the stab of surprise and pain at her easy mention of Meg. More than a hundred thirty years and the memory of his foolish love could still twist his belly. Because of the foolishness, not so much the love.</p><p>\u201cCezar heard it from Meg, and then he told me the entire story. About how you pulled her out of the fire and as you both were lying there, dying, you asked for help. You\u2019d give anything for you both to survive. Such a romantic sentiment, Dimitri, darling.\u201d</p><p>He resisted the urge to close his eyes against the image.</p><p>But the memory, though vague, hadn\u2019t fully left him. What he\u2019d believed to be his deepest desire had been answered that night, in the midst of pain-filled, swirling half dreams, by a visit from Lucifer. He\u2019d hardly known what he\u2019d agreed to. He hadn\u2019t realized until later that the miracle was not a miracle at all.</p><p>\u201cDid you try to pull me out of the fire in Vienna, Dimitri?\u201d she asked with exaggerated coyness. \u201cOr did you not love me enough?\u201d</p><p>He declined to answer, allowing a blaze in his eyes to give her his response. As if he would have stood by watching anyone perish. Especially since fire was merely uncomfortable to a Dracule, and not at all life-threatening.</p><p>\u201cYou probably would have...and then dropped me like a hot potato, no?\u201d She was wandering in front of him, pacing back and forth. \u201cDid you think I hadn\u2019t seen the signs? Why do you think I went with Cezar that night? I knew it would either make you realize how much you loved me\u2014pah!\u2014or I would have found a new protector. And we both know how that ended.\u201d</p><p>Again, he remained silent.</p><p>\u201cSo you saved Meg\u2019s life, helped her to become a Dracule...and then she left you. Once she realized the power of her immortality and the liaison with Lucifer, she left you.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri concentrated very hard and managed a negligent shrug. \u201cAnd you wonder why...I wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake...twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poor broken heart. Has she ruined you for every other woman? It would seem so.\u201d She smoothed her hands over the generous bodice of her gown as if to remind him of what she offered. He grimaced.</p><p>\u201cMeg\u2019s dead, Dimitri. Did you know that?\u201d Lerina leaned toward him again, bringing those shimmering, lethal rubies along with a scent of bitterness. \u201cCezar killed her himself.\u201d</p><p>The rumor he\u2019d long believed was true, then. A rush of relief surged through him, overshadowing a surprising dearth of pain, and was followed by a flicker of sorrow. He supposed he had loved her, in a youthful, clumsy way, even if she hadn\u2019t loved him. Or at least, loved him enough. Now, she was with Luce in hell. Never to leave.</p><p>Thanks, in part, to him. He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cPoor darling,\u201d Lerina said, her voice bringing him back.</p><p>Her eyes shifted, focusing on the wound on his face. Before he could brace himself, she bent forward, rubies and all, and, grabbing his shoulders, pressed her lips to the oozing cut. The necklaces swung against him and Dimitri jolted as they slammed into his chest and throat, burning through his shirt like a dozen white-hot pokers. He gasped in spite of himself, in spite of the hot, wet mouth covering his cheek.</p><p>She sucked and licked the blood from his skin, her tongue making sensual circles over his flesh as he tried to keep his breath even. Then Lerina slid her blood-soaked lips to his, covering his mouth with her own, breathing his own bloodscent into him.</p><p>He used every effort to wade through the pain and tear his face away from her, but Lerina\u2019s hands held him tightly, and the rubies were potent. Her fingers dug into the back of his skull, pulling his hair, her incisors sharp and sleek as she mauled his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she pulled back, her red lips glistened with blood and saliva and her eyes glowed like coals. He met her eyes defiantly, cold and filled with disgust, and when she saw his loathing, she drew back sharply. And then she slapped him again, on the other cheek this time.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wonder why I wouldn\u2019t sire you,\u201d he managed to growl.</p><p>\u201cThat was your chance,\u201d she said, stepping back and taking the evil, glittering rubies with her. \u201cI was willing to give you an opportunity to see your error. Foolish, Dimitri.</p> <p>You\u2019ve learned nothing about women in the last hundred years.\u201d</p><p>She walked away, and he was able to draw a relatively easy breath for a moment. Then she turned, contemplating him. Her eyes burned with loathing...and something else.</p><p>His skin prickled.</p><p>\u201cMoldavi is in Paris?\u201d he asked in an effort to distract her and to confirm his suspicions.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s waiting for word from me that you\u2019ve become cooperative.\u201d She fondled one of the strands of rubies. There were perhaps a dozen of them, each the size of his thumbnail, set in a gold chain. She wore three necklaces like that, each of different length, and each finished off with a large pendant ruby. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much from him. So much about how to get what I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me to Paris,\u201d Dimitri said, sniffing and again smelling the river. \u201cTo Moldavi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She shook her head, smiling. \u201cNo, you aren\u2019t of interest to him. Not any longer anyway. Not since we agreed that you belonged to me, and that I would take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She was close to him again, leaning forward, roped in gemstones. That hungry look was back in her eyes and as she caught his gaze, Lerina lifted one of the ropes of rubies from her neck.</p><p>Dimitri\u2019s breathing shifted and he struggled to move...but they were too close, too many of them. Too powerful. He could do nothing as she wrapped the chain around one of his arms, binding it to the arm of the chair. Rolling pain undulated along his arm to his shoulder, battling with that of Lucifer\u2019s Mark.</p><p>The room was turning red, his vision colored with struggle. She came closer and he was dimly aware of her busy fingers tugging at the ties of his shirt, warm and quick. He marshaled all his waning strength and gave a sudden heave. He managed to jolt her, but Lerina was quick and she whipped off a second necklace and bound his other arm. Her knee wedged onto the chair next to his thigh as he struggled against this new onslaught of pain. Sweat, warm and thick, trickled from his temple to mingle with the blood on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Moldavi is more interested in getting his sister back. And destroying Chas Woodmore for taking her,\u201d Lerina continued. Her voice was almost singsong, but her eyes blazed hot and furious. She was very close now, nearly sitting on his lap. \u201cOnce you were out of the way, and otherwise occupied, he could obtain the prize he truly wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Dimitri was vaguely aware of his shirt opening, the cooler air brushing his hot skin. Her hands, once familiar, now spread over his shoulders like spidery fingers, pulling the shirt wide. She grasped the opening and yanked. The sound of the linen tearing was like thunder in his waterlogged ears.</p><p>\u201cPrize?\u201d he managed to gasp, despite the fact that he had a sudden horrible feeling he knew what. No, who. No.</p><p>Lerina smiled. Her fangs were fully extended. Her breath smelled like his blood. Her fingers curled up into the hair that clung to his damp neck, lifting it so she could blow on his hot skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of this moment,\u201d she said. Her voice penetrated the black and red clouds filling his vision and clogging his nostrils. \u201cSince the first time you fed on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrize?\u201d he demanded with his last bit of breath.</p><p>\u201cThe girls, of course,\u201d she whispered near his ear. \u201cThe sisters. The only way to get to Chas.\u201d</p><p>Maia.</p><p>He gathered all of his strength and tugged, groaning deep in his throat with the effort. But the paralysis was complete.</p> <p>She slammed her fangs into his shoulder. He gasped, his body shuddering even as it remained horribly immobile. The release of the pressure in his veins, the surge of blood flowing into her warm mouth had him trembling. His fingers couldn\u2019t grasp the arm of the chair and he could no longer keep his eyes open.</p><p>The little tugs of pleasure as she sucked were lost in the vortex of pain. He didn\u2019t have even the energy to pull at his bindings, to kick or twist away. Maia.</p><p>And so he closed his eyes and screamed inside his mind: Help me. Wayren, damn it, I\u2019m ready.</p><p>13</p><p>IN WHICH OUR HEROINE PROVES HERSELF WORTHY OF THE APPELLATION</p><p>Maia stared at the ruby-studded hairpin all the way back to Blackmont Hall, trying to recall where she\u2019d seen it.</p><p>The design was distinctive: elegant curlicues of metal twining along the pin, decorated with five small rubies. Of course, identifying the owner didn\u2019t necessarily mean she, or\u2014one couldn\u2019t eliminate any possibilities at this time\u2014he, was involved in Corvindale\u2019s disappearance. But the fact that it was rubies, combined with Maia\u2019s very acute sense that something wrong had happened in the back room at that shop, certainly led to the logical conclusion that if she found the owner, she\u2019d find information about Corvindale.</p><p>The constable had listened to her concerns, and seemed willing to do something since a peer of the realm was missing. But at the same time, he\u2019d looked at her sidewise as if to question why she was involved. And even, why an earl must need to answer to the likes of her in regards to his actions.</p><p>And on top of all of this, Maia realized she had no way to contact Chas to let him know what had happened. But Angelica would tell Dewhurst, and perhaps the other vampire, Mr. Cale, could be notified, and then they would start the search.</p><p>Maia shook her head. By that time, impossible as it seemed, Corvindale could be dead.</p><p>The thought was like a cold hand seizing her heart and she swallowed, looking at the hairpin with even more determination. She couldn\u2019t do much herself but try to find the owner. That was one thing Dewhurst and Mr. Cale couldn\u2019t assist with. But it was something that Maia could put her attention to. It obviously belonged to a woman, and there were two ways to go about identifying her.</p><p>Once back at Blackmont Hall, Maia sent Tren to notify Crewston and Mrs. Hunburgh about the apparent disappearance of the earl. Someone had to take charge, and Maia was so used to doing it that she didn\u2019t consider letting anyone else do so\u2014including Aunt Iliana.</p><p>Then she sent for Angelica and Mirabella, only to find out that Dewhurst had taken them for a drive in the park. So she set Tren after them to bring them back.</p><p>Next, she called for the ladies\u2019 maid she and Angelica shared. Showing Betty the hairpin, she told her nothing other than that she wanted to return it to its owner, and that she was certain she\u2019d met her at one of the recent events. Knowing how tightly knit the below-stairs community was, how servants gossiped from one house in the ton to another, and that of all people, the ladies\u2019 maidservants would be the ones to know of the person who wore such a hairpin, Maia felt this avenue was her best chance to identify the woman. Thus, she sent Betty off to the market and to do some shopping, where she was most likely to encounter other loose-tongued servants.</p><p>After that, she sent for Aunt Iliana and while she waited, began to peruse through the stack of calling cards and invitations that had arrived for her and Angelica, as well as for Corvindale himself. Normally he ignored such things, leaving it to his man of business to respond if necessary, or to Crewston to handle callers.</p><p>She thought that by reviewing these items, her memory might be jolted as to where and when she\u2019d seen the woman with the hairpin. Maia knew it wasn\u2019t someone she\u2019d known from the ton. It was either a newcomer\u2014someone who\u2019d married into the peerage from another country or area\u2014or someone who hadn\u2019t been out in Society for some years, or some distant relative. Or even, she thought suddenly, someone of the demimonde. Those women who were neither fully accepted into Society, but who nevertheless interacted with the men as their mistresses. Perhaps she\u2019d seen such a lady wearing this sort of decoration while shopping or at the theater.</p><p>\u201cMaia, whatever is wrong?\u201d Aunt Iliana appeared in the doorway of the parlor. A handsome woman of perhaps forty or forty-five, she was built nearly as tall and sturdily as a man, although she was by no means masculine in appearance. Her skin was nearly as dark as the earl\u2019s, and her eyes the color of strong tea.</p><p>Maia was more than a bit shocked to see her dressed in loose trousers and a manlike shirt, along with soft slippers. The older woman\u2019s dark hair was pulled straight back into a braid and her cheeks were damp and flushed. She looked as if she\u2019d just been doing something with great exertion.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my appearance,\u201d Iliana said ruefully. \u201cBut Hunburgh said it was urgent, that it had to do with D\u2014the earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s disappeared,\u201d Maia said, and explained. She ended by showing her the hairpin.</p><p>Iliana took one look and said a very unladylike thing under her breath. \u201cRubies. Someone knows about his Asthenia.\u201d Then she looked at Maia as if she\u2019d been caught with her hand in the biscuit box.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about rubies?\u201d Maia asked. \u201cDo they affect all the Dracule that way?\u201d</p><p>Iliana seemed to measure her for a moment. Then, obviously finding her not wanting, said, \u201cIt\u2019s called an Asthenia. Each Dracule has his own specific weakness. The effects are like paralysis, and when whatever it is is touched directly to them, it can cause great, excruciating pain. Your instinct is correct. Someone used the gems to weaken him enough to take him away. Dimitri would never have been caught otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Maia had known that without being told. Although she\u2019d never had cause to see him in jeopardy or otherwise in a physical altercation, his presence suggested a man very much in control at all times. A flash of memory, of that bare, chiseled chest, broad shoulders and the long, sleek curve of his muscular arms had her insides fluttering again. No, indeed. He would not have been caught unless taken unawares. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She explained to Iliana the steps she\u2019d taken to identify the hairpin\u2019s owner, and the other woman nodded in satisfaction. \u201cVery good. When Angelica and Voss arrive, we can send word to Giordan and Chas.\u201d</p><p>Maia wondered about this woman, and certainly not for the first time. She spoke of the vampires and their world with such familiarity. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Maia asked. \u201cYou aren\u2019t really Corvindale\u2019s aunt, are you?\u201d</p><p>Iliana laughed. \u201cNo, of course not. That would make me more than a hundred twenty years old, and a crone\u2014or a Dracule\u2014at that. No, indeed. I\u2019m merely one who understands the threats of his world, and an old friend of Dimitri\u2019s. I helped to raise Mirabella after he found her. She needed protection from the earl\u2019s enemies, and I needed a place to live away from\u2014well, that\u2019s another story for a time when we have time. Suffice to say,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve learned to protect myself to some extent from the beastly ones. Even your brother admitted that I\u2019m quite capable.\u201d</p> <p>Maia looked at her. \u201cCould you teach me something?\u201d</p><p>The older woman opened her mouth, likely to decline, but Maia pushed on. \u201cIf I\u2019m to live in this world where my sister is to wed a former vampire, my brother hunts them and my so-named guardian is one, I think it only proper that I know something about protecting myself. Especially since there are vampires who are coming after us. My father taught me how to shoot a pistol when I was twelve,\u201d she added when Iliana began to shake her head.</p><p>\u201cYour brother would never allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to know,\u201d Maia said firmly. \u201cNo one has to know.\u201d</p><p>Iliana frowned and then threw up her hands. \u201cVery well. But don\u2019t tell the earl.\u201d</p> <p>Maia awoke with a start, sitting bolt upright.</p><p>Her heart was pounding and her body slick with perspiration.</p><p>That had not been a pleasant dream. The darkness still lingered, wrapping the frightening images through her mind. Not of a warm, red world with sensual lips and tongue, the easy and welcome slide of fangs, but one of tearing flesh and screaming pain. Violence and violation.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t catch her breath, and Maia threw back the covers of her bed, trying to jolt the last vestiges away with sharp movement. It didn\u2019t work instantly, but slowly the ugly feelings eased.</p><p>Moonlight shimmered over her empty bed and the table next to it. Maia\u2019s attention fell on the two new additions to her bedside table: the ruby hairpin and a slender wooden stake.</p><p>True to her word, Iliana had taken Maia to an empty chamber in the servants\u2019 wing of Blackmont Hall. The room had no furnishings to speak of, and was windowless. There, she\u2019d shown Maia how to hold a stake the proper way and where to aim when stabbing at a vampire.</p> <p>\u201cIn the heart,\u201d she said, \u201cand they die instantly.\u201d</p><p>A little shudder ran through Maia when she recalled how Chas had launched himself across the room at White\u2019s and thrust his stake into Dewhurst\u2019s torso. If he hadn\u2019t been wearing armor, he would have been dead.</p><p>Maia and Iliana had practiced awhile, with Maia surprised by the other woman\u2019s speed and agility, and learned that she did quite a bit of training for this skill. Maia realized that her own days spent with merely a bit of walking, some riding and much sitting, had left her much less fluent in body movement. And although she was uncomfortably warm and damp after her session with Iliana, Maia also realized she felt energized. And now, however, her own body was a little sore.</p><p>She decided then that she would practice every day, with Iliana if possible. But now, Maia was unsettled and felt the need to get out of her bedchamber.</p><p>She left the stake on her table and padded down the hall to the stairs. Perhaps a book. Or a cup of milk or even a slice of cheese and an apple might help to distract her mind.</p><p>As she reached the bottom of the stairs, she heard voices. Her heart leaped and she hurried down and along the hall, her nightgown flowing around her ankles. A light poured from beneath the door of Corvindale\u2019s study, so, without much thought in regards to her attire and the mortification of the last time she\u2019d seen him, Maia flung the door open.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, freezing in the entrance. Not Corvindale.</p><p>It was Dewhurst...and Angelica. They were standing in the middle of the chamber, in an embrace whose image immediately replaced the last bit of horror from Maia\u2019s dream.</p> <p>\u201cMaia,\u201d said Angelica, pulling away from what looked like a very passionate kiss...among other things. Her lips were swollen and her cheeks a lovely dusky rose. Dewhurst didn\u2019t release her, and she didn\u2019t seem to be interested in putting space between them, either. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Maia swallowed, trying to ignore the heat that had rushed to her face and surely made it bright red. \u201cI heard voices and thought perhaps the earl had returned, or been found.\u201d</p><p>Dewhurst shook his head, and Maia couldn\u2019t tear her eyes from the way his elegant hand curled comfortably around her sister\u2019s neck, a finger sliding up into the loose braid at her nape. It was such a simple gesture, yet very intimate. So casual, bespeaking of a deep and comfortable connection.</p><p>A rush of envy shuttled through her and she was instantly ashamed. Alexander was a good man and he cared for her.</p><p>He might not make her insides billow and burn when he kissed her, but he was financially comfortable and unfailingly polite and rather boring. She stopped any further thoughts right there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Cale, and have sent word to Chas\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dewhurst was saying.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that? Do you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>He looked uncomfortable. \u201cThere are ways we do it with blood pigeons and private messengers and other techniques.</p><p>But that\u2019s beside the point. I just came here to...er...\u201d He looked at Angelica and the heat that passed between them with a mere glance was enough to make Maia\u2019s knees weak.</p><p>\u201cHe came to report that there isn\u2019t any news about Corvindale,\u201d Angelica said. At last she stepped away from her fianc\u00e9, and for the first time, Maia noticed that her sister was garbed in no more than a night rail, as well. \u201cAnd to let me know that he was safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to find him. When Woodmore returns, I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll have other ideas about where to look and how to track him. One would expect Moldavi to be involved somehow, and since Dim\u2014Corvindale isn\u2019t one to...uh...spend time around women, whoever was there and dropped the hairpin is likely in Moldavi\u2019s employ. And now that I can move about in the day, it gives me more freedom.\u201d</p><p>Angelica looked at him. \u201cBut you are no longer Dracule. Which makes you more vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Dewhurst waved this off in the way men did when a woman raised an issue they preferred to ignore. \u201cBut I\u2019m smart and fast and I no longer have an Asthenia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Asthenia now is a bullet,\u201d Angelica reminded him flatly. \u201cAs well as a sword, a stake and many other implements. Not to mention fire, and...\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cPlease take care.\u201d These last words were little more than a heartfelt sigh, leaving Maia to feel like more of an intruder than ever.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, as well,\u201d he said, looking at both of them. \u201cThat\u2019s the other reason I\u2019ve come. Cale and I have arranged for more guards to keep watch over you now that Corvindale is missing. Both day and night. I suspect Moldavi has had him removed so he can more easily get to one of you. So don\u2019t go anywhere without an escort\u2014particularly at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut vampires cannot move about during the day,\u201d Angelica argued. \u201cWe\u2019re safe enough shopping and visiting the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorvindale was taken during the day,\u201d Dewhurst reminded her flatly. \u201cDo as I say, Ange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should return to my bed,\u201d Maia said, turning toward the door. Why she felt so bereft was one thing, but the other thought that followed her as she climbed the stairs was the realization that she, the very proper Miss Woodmore, had just left her sister and a man alone in the study with hardly a second thought. At night.</p><p>What had changed her?</p><p>Maia slept fitfully for the rest of the night, and in the morning the first thing she did was send a message to Alexander that the wedding would need to be postponed until her guardian returned.</p><p>And then she sat down at the breakfast table. Alone.</p><p>Maia couldn\u2019t remember ever feeling so...alone. Angelica was clearly deeply in love with her viscount and didn\u2019t have time for sisterly talks\u2014although it appeared that they might have much to talk about, if the position of Dewhurst\u2019s hands on her last night was any indication.</p><p>Even the thought of where they\u2019d been made Maia blush.</p><p>She sat down with another batch of invitations and calling cards, determined to remind herself where she\u2019d seen the hairpin. Only partway through her first piece of toast and cup of tea, the dining room door opened to reveal Betty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some news for you, miss,\u201d she said. Betty was a plump, cheery woman old enough to be Maia\u2019s mother\u2014or at least a much older sister. Her eyes were glinting with pleasure as she approached. \u201cTracy Mayes, who works for the Gallingways\u2014easy way to remember with a bit of rhyme\u2014says that Rosie over to the Yarmouths\u2019 knows she\u2019s seen that same type of hairpin before. It didn\u2019t have no rubies, but sapphires, though.\u201d</p><p>Maia felt a spark of excitement. \u201cIt was the same, just different gems? It must be made by the same jeweler. Who had the hairpin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too, miss. I could send over to one of the servants at her house. It was a Mrs. Rina Throckmullins, and Rosie said as she met her and her maid at the milliner\u2019s last week. She remembered it because it was such a rainy day, and they shared an umbrella when they left the shop, so she had a good look at the pins in her hair, huddled as they were under it. Mrs. Throckmullins is a...well, miss, I\u2019m not one to speak out of line. But she\u2019s a single woman who ain\u2019t looking for a husband, if you know what I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which meant she was a woman who interacted with men outside of wedlock. Likely of the demimonde, or perhaps even a widow who didn\u2019t move about in the ton. Which would have made it fairly impossible for Maia to have met her at a Society function. So she must have caught a glimpse of it somewhere else, as she\u2019d previously surmised.</p><p>Giving a mental shrug, Maia finished her toast, contemplating this new information. Perhaps Mrs. Throckmullins wasn\u2019t the owner of the ruby hairpin, but at least knew the designer. It was the best lead she had so far, and Maia decided it was worth investigating. She\u2019d have to wait until the afternoon when social calls were made.</p><p>Thus, later in the day after a brief practice session in the special, empty room (this time without Iliana) and a bit of lunch, Maia called for Tren and the carriage. Angelica was otherwise engaged with a dress fitting for her wedding, and Mirabella wanted to look for some new lace and so they declined to go with her.</p> <p>Mindful of Dewhurst\u2019s warning not to go anywhere by herself, she advised Crewston, who arranged for two other footmen to accompany them. Her plan was to call on Mrs. Throckmullins under the guise of returning the hairpin, which would allow her to find out whether it belonged to the woman or whether she merely had one similar. If the latter were true, then she could find out where it had come from and follow on that lead.</p><p>And she\u2019d be home in time to get ready for tonight\u2019s dinner party at the Werthingtons\u2019.</p><p>Maia opened her eyes.</p><p>Where am I?</p><p>Confusion and a dark, unfamiliar room made her mind groggy. She tried to sit up and realized her limbs wouldn\u2019t move. An ominous clink indicated the reason why.</p> <p>What in the world?</p><p>Panic trammeled through her and she drew in a deep breath, closing her eyes, ordering herself into calmness. What had happened?</p><p>She flipped back in her mind...she remembered riding in the carriage to Mrs. Throckmullins\u2019s home, a room she\u2019d let in a boardinghouse in a respectable area of the City, not far from Bond.</p><p>Mrs. Throckmullins was pleased to meet her in the parlor of the house, and Maia introduced herself and explained the purpose of her visit. She remembered giving her the hairpin, and Mrs. Throckmullins pressing her to stay for tea so they could talk about the jewelry. The next thing she knew, the room was wavering and spinning...</p><p>And now she was here.</p><p>Wherever \u201chere\u201d was.</p> <p>Maia tried again to move and realized that her wrists were bound to some object and that she was lying on a bed or sofa.</p><p>It was difficult to tell, for the room was dim. Whatever was beneath her was soft, however, and the object to which she was tied moved beneath her when she pulled on it. Curtains covered the windows, and a faint gray outline told her that it was late in the evening, but not yet dark. So she\u2019d been here for several hours.</p><p>The panic that could have spiraled out of control settled again. If she\u2019d been missing for that long, someone would be looking for her. Angelica and Dewhurst and perhaps even her wayward brother.</p><p>Tren and the other footmen would have returned to Blackmont Hall when she didn\u2019t come out of Mrs. Throckmullins\u2019s boardinghouse...if they hadn\u2019t besieged it in the first place, looking for her. And if not, they knew where to search for her.</p><p>But Maia became aware of the pungent scent of fish filtering through the air; something she hadn\u2019t noticed in the parlor. So either Mrs. Throckmullins\u2014who was clearly the villain or at least in cahoots with the villain, as Mrs. Radcliffe would describe it\u2014had moved her to a new location, or someone else had.</p><p>Either way, that would make it even more difficult for the others to find her.</p><p>But on the bright side, perhaps Corvindale was here, as well.</p><p>Maia lay there, waiting for her vision to become used to the dim light, listening to every sound around her that might give her more information. She\u2019d read enough Gothic novels to know what a heroine who was in a dangerous situation shouldn\u2019t do, and she was determined to be intelligent about her predicament.</p> <p>After listening for quite some time\u2014she heard a clock tolling the quarter hour in the distance, and then a second toll\u2014Maia concluded that she was either alone in the house, or whoever was there was either sleeping or very quiet. She also took stock of the room she was in, half pulling herself up on her side with her elbows. Sheets covered chairs and tables, making the chamber appear ghostly.</p><p>Her wrists were bound with a chain of large links that were looped around the leg of the chaise on which she reclined. Her bonds were loose and shifted up and down her arm, and Maia tried for some time to slip them over her hands. But her thumbs were in the way, and try as she might, she couldn\u2019t curl them flat enough into her palm to slide free.</p><p>Her next effort was to carefully climb off the chaise, taking care to make as little noise as possible in case she was wrong and the building wasn\u2019t deserted, to see if there was a way to unhook the chain.</p><p>Excitement bolted through her when she saw that it might be possible. The way the chains were looped and if she could lift the chaise and pull them free...</p><p>It took countless efforts, most of them aborted when the chains slid the wrong way as she struggled to lift the chaise with bound wrists and a short length with which to work...but finally, she worked it loose and at last pulled away from the chaise.</p><p>Her wrists were still bound, but she was free.</p><p>Moments later, she had figured out how to unravel herself and left the chains in a heap on the floor. Maia\u2019s first instinct was to start out of the chamber, but she forced herself to wait and listen for another quarter of an hour.</p><p>Her patience was rewarded when the house remained quiet and the gray outline around the windows had disappeared into black. The last thing she did before leaving the chamber was to take up the poker from the fireplace, and also to search for something that could be used as a wooden stake. The only possible article was an umbrella in a corner stand, and she used her foot to break its handle.</p><p>Thus armed, she tiptoed to the door and eased it open.</p><p>Through the glaze of pain, Dimitri saw the door in front of him ease open.</p><p>He closed his eyes, his head tilting back against the chair. Again? So bloody soon?</p><p>She\u2019d visited him more than three times in however many hours and days he\u2019d been here. His only measurement had been the light filtering through the curtains, and even that was inaccurate as he went in and out of consciousness. Lerina had opened one of the sets of drapes so that a slice of sun cut over the headrest of his chair close enough to sizzle his hair.</p><p>And as a parting gift, she\u2019d taken off her last ruby necklace and hung it around his neck so that it settled against his bare torso.</p><p>The pain...</p><p>It had finally dulled to something merely excruciating.</p><p>How long had he been like this?</p><p>He dared not move during the day for fear the sun would fry his skin, keeping his head at an impossible angle, hardly able to breathe in the wake of pain and paralysis. All the while, he was left with only his thoughts, his fears. Dark and ugly, swirling over and over in his mind.</p><p>It was because of that mad vortex of fear and anger that he didn\u2019t just allow the sun to burn him. He remained intact, fueled by the desperate knowledge that he must, somehow, escape. He must get to Maia before Moldavi did.</p><p>A figure that was not Lerina had moved through the door way and into the chamber. Dimitri\u2019s labored breath caught. This was new. This was\u2014</p><p>Maia.</p><p>Was he dreaming it? Hallucinating now, his brain turned to mush? He was too weak to even discern her scent.</p><p>But no, the glance of moonlight over that amazing bronze-gold hair and elegant nose confirmed his worst fears.</p><p>No, no, no! What are you doing here, foolish blasted woman?</p><p>He struggled violently, but nothing moved but for the intent, deep inside.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him at first; the room was dim and he was too weak to make a sound. But then she did, for she cried out and rushed to his side, dropping whatever she\u2019d had in her hands.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she whispered, suddenly there in front of him, close enough that he could smell her at last.</p><p>Such a clean, welcoming perfume after hours of his own blood and sweat mingled with the desperate essence of Lerina. His eyes hooded as he drank in the pure, fresh pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWhat has she\u2014 Oh, God.\u201d Her hands were everywhere, peeling away the blood-soaked shirt that hung from his shoulders, tugging at the rubies that bound him to the chair. When she lifted the necklace that had settled against him he was at last able to draw in a complete breath.</p><p>Even once he was loosened from the ruby manacles, Dimitri found he couldn\u2019t move. He sagged in the chair, at once infuriated by his weakness and focusing on gathering up strength again. Trying to lift even a finger was impossible.</p><p>She\u2019d taken much blood from him. Much. Too much, and the hours encapsulated in his Asthenia had drained him to little more than a loose pile of skin and bones.</p><p>Dimitri tried to speak, and managed only to say, \u201cA...way.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to tell her to take the rubies that she\u2019d tossed to the floor away, far away, but Maia misunderstood. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, you idiot man. Look at you.\u201d There were tears in her voice, and fear, as well. \u201cYou need water. Something.\u201d</p><p>Water was not what he needed.</p><p>No indeed.</p><p>Dimitri closed his eyes. Now that the incessant pain had ebbed a bit, his body was reawakening in a different way. Warmth stirred deep inside him, flowering into need. Soon, once he recovered his strength, it would be uncontrollable. No. Not now.</p><p>Maia\u2014there was no use forcing himself to think of her as Miss Woodmore any longer; that shield was gone\u2014had moved into the shadows and he dimly heard a dull clink. The next thing he knew, she was back, holding a pitcher.</p><p>It was a wonder there was any water left in it, after Lerina had dumped it on his head or splashed it in his face numerous times in an effort to awaken him. Perhaps she\u2019d replenished it. Regardless, the cool water had been the highlight of his experience here, and now Maia applied it in a much gentler fashion that made his skin heat and leap.</p><p>She\u2019d torn off a piece of sheet that covered a chair and used the wet cloth to mop up the grime and blood from his face. Dimitri closed his eyes, allowing the cool rivulets to trickle down his jaw and neck, concentrating on gathering what little energy he still possessed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room wavered and tilted, still tinged a dull red, due to his great loss of blood as well as the proximity of the rubies. He attempted to lift his head, but his best effort ended with him merely rolling from one side to the other.</p><p>How the hell am I going to get her out of here?</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Maia said again when she got to the top of his shoulder, where Lerina had bit. And then her breathing changed into another unsteady rhythm when she saw the other shoulder, the bite at its corner, and then down to his left biceps. Also wounded and oozing blood from Lerina\u2019s pleasure.</p> <p>He tried to snatch the rag from her hands, to clean himself up, but Maia was too quick and strong and she batted his hands away as if they were gnats. And so he was reluctantly complicit, so aware of every brush from her fingers, every waft of flower and spice from her sagging hair...the warmth of her body as she bent toward him, the dark shadow down between her breasts. The sensual arch of her neck.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said suddenly, sharply, and he opened his eyes, realizing he\u2019d started to tumble back into the depths of darkness...but this time, the depths had been warm heat, filled with her scent and silky skin. \u201cWhat do you need? What can I do?\u201d she asked, tugging uselessly at him, obviously trying to get him up out of the chair.</p><p>He looked at her, his veins surging with hope and heat, his fangs swelling inside his gums. His breathing was ragged and he could hardly focus the words. \u201cRu...bies...away,\u201d he managed to say.</p><p>She stumbled back, chagrin on her face. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, anger in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize...\u201d Her voice faded and he heard the soft sounds of the gems being gathered up. She hesitated, looking around the room as if uncertain what to do with them, but before he could gather up the strength to tell her, she rushed toward the door and went through it.</p><p>When she came back, her hands were empty and by then, Dimitri was actually breathing. His fingers had moved and the pain had centered back on his Mark, where he was used to it.</p> <p>\u201cIs that better?\u201d she asked, coming closer to him. Too close.</p><p>His nose twitched as he inhaled her and a shudder rumbled through him. He wasn\u2019t strong enough to push himself out of the chair, to stand...he needed blood. He needed sustenance.</p><p>Dimitri managed to nod and tried to tell her to stay back, but she kept moving closer.</p><p>\u201cLet me look at you,\u201d she said, right in front of him. She was examining the cuts on his cheeks. Her skirt brushed against the arm of the chair, where his ineffectual hand rested. \u201cAnd I see that you can\u2019t even stand.\u201d</p><p>He tried to growl a warning and an argument, nothing but a dull groan escaped. She touched his face where the ruby had sliced his cheek. Dimitri closed his eyes, breathing deeply. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had touched him with such gentleness.</p><p>Never, never had a woman affected him so.</p> <p>A little shudder raced through his limbs, turning into something hot and powerful and needy. When he opened his eyes, she was very close. Her cheek, smooth and white, a breath away. That intriguing scent filled his space and a lock of hair hung just in front of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he whispered, turning his face away. \u201cGet...away.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>IN WHICH INTRODUCTIONS PROVE UNNECESSARY</p><p>Maia heard the note in his voice when he said her name, and the tone made her insides plummet. It was a horrible combination of loathing and desperation. His eyes were hooded and shadowed, and she could see little but the dark shapes of them and the wounds on his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d she said, trying to keep her own voice steady. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you here.\u201d</p><p>She could hardly fathom that a man who was as large and dark and powerful as the earl had become little more than a rag doll, sagging in the chair. At the same time, she wanted to touch him again, but without the protection of the damp cloth. She knew he was injured, practically dead as much as a vampire could die, but she couldn\u2019t stop looking at him.</p><p>The curtains on one window were open enough that light from outside\u2014moon, stars, streetlamps\u2014gave the chamber layers of gray color, and she could see the details of the man in front of her.</p> <p>The wide breadth of his shoulders, marred as they were by small dark circles from what were clearly vampire bites, had felt so solid and warm beneath her hands. She\u2019d seen his darkly haired chest from the door of his chamber, but now she\u2019d touched the square curve of his shoulders and the sleek bulge of biceps, the skin smooth and firm. He had a strong, corded neck, the ragged edges of his dark hair plastered there and to his temples and cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGet away...from me,\u201d he said again, this time more fiercely. His muscular hand moved as if to shove her away, but it flopped loosely onto his lap, barely brushing her arm. \u201cGet Cale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. I\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d she said. \u201cI went through a lot of trouble to find you and I\u2019m not going without you. Aside of that, it could take me hours or days to find Mr. Cale. And I don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes again. \u201cJust...go. Please. Maia.\u201d</p><p>This was the second time he\u2019d called her by her name, and the sound of it, so low and rough, made her knees weak. She couldn\u2019t leave him. She didn\u2019t know where she was or how long it would take to get a hack\u2014and it was nighttime, as well. She didn\u2019t know when Mrs. Throckmullins was going to return\u2014or whoever she was working with, and she certainly couldn\u2019t manage to drag the earl from the room. He\u2019d crush her if he put even half his weight on her.</p><p>Maia\u2019s heart started pounding hard as she realized what she had to do. She licked her lips, trying to subdue a flash of nerves and titillation. It wasn\u2019t just the rubies. He had four or perhaps five wounds, bites, plus the cuts on his face. He\u2019d lost blood. Lots of it.</p><p>\u201cYou need to...drink. You need blood,\u201d she said.</p><p>He jolted in the chair and growled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>But she saw the sudden catch of his breath, then the rough rise and fall of his chest. The pulse pounded in his throat and his eyes fastened on her, dark in emotion, fiery in hue.</p><p>Her mouth dried and her stomach fluttered as she remembered her dreams. Even the room tipped a little at the flash of temptation that rushed through her.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale, you must.\u201d She settled herself on the arm of his chair.</p><p>He\u2019d turned away again and his jaw, dark with shadow, shifted. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath and thrust her arm in front of his face. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t.\u201d He was so close to her, her arm brushing against his bare one, his male scent and the warmth radiating from his skin filling her being.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, please,\u201d she begged, somehow generating a ripple of angst from him. \u201cI can\u2019t get you away from here if you\u2019re so weak. And I\u2019m absolutely not leaving without you. If she comes back...\u201d She let the threat hang there, for, if she knew one thing about the earl, it was that he took his responsibilities gravely.</p><p>Surely he wouldn\u2019t want his ward to be here if Mrs. Throckmullins came back.</p><p>He remained mute and stoic, and Maia realized she was going to have to force the stubborn fool into it. She remembered the night in the carriage when he\u2019d scratched her with his fang; the arrested look on his face when he\u2019d noticed the blood.</p><p>She was just about to get up to search for something to cut herself with\u2014for she simply couldn\u2019t stomach using her own fingernails\u2014when he made a low sound. Deep, like a struggle, rumbling from his throat.</p><p>Maia turned toward him just as he moved, curling his fingers around her arm. She looked down and met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet...rubies,\u201d he said. \u201cQuickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Have you gone mad? Isn\u2019t that how you got\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet...rubies,\u201d he said between tight jaws. \u201cArgue. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorvindale...\u201d But she saw the fury in his eyes and she decided that he was probably right\u2014this wasn\u2019t the time to argue. She\u2019d known the man was mad since the night he bundled her up in the curtains and tossed her on the patio.</p><p>But he\u2019d saved her then, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>She rushed out of the room to get one of the necklaces from where she\u2019d tossed them in a pile far down the corridor. When she returned to the chamber, she saw that he\u2019d shifted in the chair and was sitting more upright than he\u2019d been.</p><p>His eyes fell on the dangling chain of red gems, then lifted to hers as she approached slowly. Whatever expression might have been there was unfathomable in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do with them?\u201d she asked, already noticing the change in his breathing and the stiffening in his limbs. From the mere presence of the jewels. She found it fascinating and frightening at the same time.</p><p>He glanced to the side, made a very faint gesture to the table next to his chair. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>Maia thought she was beginning to understand. He wanted them nearby so that...he\u2019d remain weak? Her heart lunged into her throat and suddenly the prickle of anticipation turned into prickles in her belly. What was he afraid he\u2019d do?</p><p>She laid the necklace on the far edge of the small piecrust table and then faced him, looking down at his dark hair and stony face. His eyes were closed again, brows furrowed, his hands clenched into fists down at his sides. The rise and fall of his chest matched her own. The bright white of his tattered shirt shone next to his dark skin and trousers.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said, and then, holding her breath, sat down on the arm of his chair again.</p><p>\u201cUse them,\u201d he said, and she knew he meant the rubies.</p><p>\u201cIf you...need.\u201d</p><p>Heart in her throat, she swallowed hard and offered him her wrist.</p><p>At first, she thought he would refuse again, but then he grasped her with surprisingly strong fingers. A bolt of fear shot through her and then, as he lifted her wrist to his mouth, she saw his fangs clearly for the first time.</p><p>She closed her eyes as she felt his breath on her flesh, and then, to her shock and surprise...not the bite of pain, but the brush of lips. Soft, moist, followed by the gentle touch of his tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maia shuddered as warmth blossomed through her, her skin prickling at the sensation. Her heartbeat seemed to have changed, and it thrummed in her ears, reverberating through her entire being. She hardly realized what she was doing as her free hand moved around to the back of the chair, propping herself up just next to his hair. He slid his lips gently along the inside of her wrist and then paused, suddenly looking up at her.</p><p>His eyes were clearly illuminated and the expression there was so dark and hungry, yet filled with loathing, that she jolted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...want to...do this,\u201d he breathed over her dampskin, and then suddenly he went rigid and the points of his teeth were there.</p> <p>The slide of his fangs into the tender part of her wrist brought a surge of pleasure and pain. He made a low keening sound like a wild animal being freed\u2014or tortured\u2014and Maia felt the burst of blood as it flooded from her veins. He vibrated against her as if something suddenly released from deep inside him.</p><p>His mouth was warm, covering her, and his fingers tight on her wrist as if to keep it in place. The heat flowed out of her, leaving her light-headed and aware of every movement of his mouth and tongue as he sucked, licked, sucked...drawing from her in a base, undulating rhythm.</p><p>She looked down, watching in fascination as his dark head bent over her white arm. She smelled the blood, heard the soft whistling as he fed, the quiet gulps as he drank. And as life drained from her, it was replaced by rolling heat, building and surging as if her veins sang.</p><p>Maia\u2019s fingers filtered into his dark hair, finding it warm and soft, damp from the water, and she sagged against him. Her breasts felt tight and sensitive and she realized she was breathing in little gasps with her lips parted. There was something more...she needed something more.</p><p>He shifted on the chair, suddenly releasing his fangs from her arm and then slipping his warm tongue over the wounds in sensual little circles. She sighed and arched, a painful little tingle of pleasure starting deep inside her belly and moving down.</p> <p>His hand slid up behind her neck and grasped her skull as he pulled her down onto his lap. She closed her eyes, her hands planted on the solid planes of his bare shoulders and then she jolted when he bit into the soft part of her shoulder.</p><p>Maia cried out in surprise and pain, then arched toward him as hot blood surged from that delicate skin into his mouth. His tongue slid, flat and sleek, over her shoulder, then retreated as he drew rhythmically from her. Strong hands held her immobile, close, and she felt his body tight and hard against hers, lurching a little with the effort.</p><p>His big hands cupped her, his mouth took, the heat from his body burned into her hands and through her clothing.</p><p>Maia\u2019s world spiraled into a red blaze that was nothing like her dreams, but just as sensual and compelling. Blood coursed through her veins and she felt it swelling and surging, pouring forth. She couldn\u2019t catch her breath. Everything became him.</p><p>She wanted him.</p><p>Then all at once, he froze. Some guttural curse erupted from his throat as he whipped his face from her shoulder, his fingers tight as he shoved her back, his movements violent and sharp, his breathing loud and labored in the room.</p> <p>\u201cYou blasted fool,\u201d he snapped, pushing her from his lap as if she were an unwanted cat. His eyes blazed like coals and his lips were full and slick, the very tip of a fang caught against one.</p><p>Maia, startled from the lull, stumbled as she tried to catch her balance. A hand whipped out and grabbed her arm just in time, but with the force of it, she knocked into the table and tipped it over. Her knees buckled and she sagged in his grip, weak and confused, her eyes rolling back into her head.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he said, urgent now, furious. \u201cLook at me, blast it.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes with great effort and tried to focus on the dark figure looming over her.</p><p>\u201cDamned bones of Satan, I told you to use the damned rubies.\u201d He was fairly shouting, yet his hands were gentle as he eased her into the chair he had just vacated. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you use the rubies?\u201d</p><p>She noted vaguely that he seemed to have fully recovered, although when he bumped gracelessly against her chair and nearly fell on top of her, she was forced to revise that conclusion.</p><p>Other than that, she could hardly capture her whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. The fluttering heat still swirled in her belly and she felt the slow ooze of blood from her shoulder. Warm. The wound on her wrist seemed to have stopped; all that was left were four dainty red marks.</p><p>She forced herself to focus now, and she let her head tilt against the back of the chair, looking up at him. He leaned over her, bracing himself with a hand on each side, his muscular arms bracketing her in.</p> <p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he said, a bit more gently now\u2014which was to say, at a lower volume, though no less tense\u2014and there was an odd note in his tone. \u201cYou...\u201d His voice trailed off and their eyes locked.</p><p>Everything stopped. Maia could hardly draw a breath.</p><p>Inside, everything exploded into hot fluttering. \u201cAre you going to kiss me now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His lips formed a silent \u201cCan\u2019t. No.\u201d</p><p>But then he did.</p><p>She met his mouth as it crashed down on hers, hungry and warm with the residual of her own rich blood. His lips were hard and demanding, forcing her mouth open as he thrust his tongue deep. A powerful thigh wedged into the seat next to her and Maia found that she couldn\u2019t move; she was pinned down into the chair by his hands and mouth, his dark, powerful body rising over her.</p><p>Grasping at the tails of his shirt, she pulled, tugging him closer, her hands sliding over the planes of his chest. His muscles shifted and trembled beneath her palms, the hair soft and prickly, skin hot and smooth.</p><p>At last, at last...was all she could think.</p><p>He had her face cupped in his big hands, fingers curling behind, thumbs pressing into her jaw as he drank from her mouth now, then pulled away with a soft, deep groan to cover the wound on her shoulder again.</p><p>This time, he didn\u2019t penetrate, but instead, slicked his tongue over the curve of her shoulder, down into the little soft hollow of skin. Maia shivered and tried to shrug him away, for the sensation was intense, but he delved deeper, his tongue dipping and sliding, sipping from the last bit of her blood, his lashes tickling her neck. She felt her pulse coursing against his mouth, pounding against his lips, her heartbeat matching his as her hands found it through his chest.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, not quite certain what she needed, rolling her head against the back of the chair as she tried to find it, shifting her hips. She was hot and damp every where, tight and tingling and she wanted his hands and mouth in places they had no business going.</p><p>All at once, he went still and then pulled away. Before she could even gasp in surprise or disappointment, he clapped a hand over her mouth. His chest moved rapidly as he cocked his head and sniffed the air.</p><p>\u201cSatan\u2019s bones,\u201d he muttered and vaulted off the chair, half stumbling yet silent. He yanked her up with him, his hand still over her mouth, his eyes suddenly blazing darkly into hers. \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound. Don\u2019t say a word. Don\u2019t argue,\u201d he hissed into her face.</p><p>Maia managed a brief nod of acknowledgment, her brain still foggy from the sudden change of sensual assault to this frightening intensity.</p><p>And then she heard them: voices. The sounds of people below.</p><p>Corvindale said something vile under his breath, looking around the room. The rubies had fallen to the floor when she knocked over the table, still contributing to his sluggish movements. Their proximity was likely the only reason she was able to pull out of his grip, but she did, darting toward the pile of bloodred stones glittering amid gold.</p><p>Without a word or even a glance at him, she scooped them up and dashed to the window, then flung a thousand pounds of jewelry out into the night. When she turned, she saw a flash of approval on his face, and then he gestured sharply toward the door.</p><p>But Maia knew that there were more gems just beyond, a larger cache, and if they met up with whoever was downstairs when he was in the proximity, they could be in trouble.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d she hissed in the same way he\u2019d done. \u201cDon\u2019t argue. Don\u2019t say a word. Trust me.\u201d Despite her weak knees, she made it to the door before he did and slipped out as he lunged for her.</p><p>In the dark corridor, she heard voices below and recognized that of Mrs. Throckmullins and two masculine ones. They were moving through what Maia had realized was an abandoned or closed-up house, and one would assume that they would soon be coming to check on their prisoners.</p><p>The rubies that she\u2019d dumped there earlier still rested in a little pile, and Maia picked them up, started back toward the room she\u2019d just vacated and saw Corvindale coming out after her, his face ablaze with fury. So much for listening.</p><p>She hesitated, then spun and went light-footed down the hall to the room in which she\u2019d been imprisoned, the rubies dangling from her hand. She couldn\u2019t stomach throwing them out the window, as well, but at least she could hide them far from the earl.</p><p>By the time she found a place deep in a drawer, far from the door, after stubbing her toe in the dim light, the voices were rising in volume. Corvindale had whipped the chamber door open silently. His face was black with fury, but Maia ignored it and dashed over to him. \u201cOut of here,\u201d she mouthed, pointing toward the chest where she\u2019d put the jewels.</p><p>They went out into the hall just as the tops of several heads appeared, coming up the shadowy stairs. Corvindale shoved her behind him and backed her roughly into a different chamber from the one in which he\u2019d been imprisoned. But by that time, Mrs. Throckmullins had appeared at the top of the stairs and her furious shrieks filled the air.</p><p>Inside this new chamber, Corvindale grabbed Maia and pushed her behind him, then reached for a chair. It splintered on the floor just as the door slammed open to show a red-eyed, fanged Mrs. Throckmullins.</p><p>Oh. Maia realized she should already have figured out the woman was a vampire, but then, there\u2019d been other things on her mind. Then all of her thoughts evaporated as she realized Corvindale had a broken chair leg in his hand and he was facing their abductor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBack so soon, Lerina?\u201d Corvindale said. His voice was calm and cold, but Maia, who was held in place behind him, felt the tension rippling through his muscles.</p><p>The broken chair next to their feet reminded her of the stake that she\u2019d dropped when she found Corvindale, along with the metal poker, which, of course, would be of little use now. She needed a weapon of her own, but knew better than to dodge down and snatch one up, distracting the man in front of her.</p><p>Mrs. Throckmullins\u2014or Lerina, for, apparently, they knew each other\u2014was speechless with fury. But Maia noticed that she wore several ruby rings, and that more hairpins glinted like blood in her dark hair. She felt the shimmering in Corvindale\u2019s body as their effect slowed him. And she was not certain how much feeding from her had restored him.</p> <p>And then behind Lerina emerged another figure with burning red eyes and fangs, pushing past her into the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite ready for you to leave yet, Dimitri darling,\u201d Lerina said. \u201cEspecially until you properly introduce me to your companion.\u201d</p><p>The tone in her voice, the way her eyes settled on Corvindale with a mixture of heat and fury, told Maia all she needed to know about their relationship. And who had put the marks on the earl\u2019s shoulders and arm.</p><p>Maia eased away from Corvindale, despite his blind attempt to keep her in place while watching the two at the door. She kept a hand on his back so that he knew where she was, and, using him as a shield to block her movements from sight, crouched slowly to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI believe you two have already met,\u201d he replied to Lerina.</p> <p>As Maia picked up a piece of wood, the second vampire edged into the room and started to move along the perimeter. Corvindale tensed and shifted his body so that he could watch both Lerina and the man as they separated. Maia stood, and he immediately curved his hand around to hold her behind him, giving her a hard, angry squeeze that clearly said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>A noise behind them had Maia spinning to see a third vampire, climbing through the window.</p><p>He was holding a glittering red necklace.</p><p>Maia felt Corvindale\u2019s involuntary shudder and she thought if there was ever a time for a lady to curse, this would be it.</p><p>In lieu of that, she realized whatever she did now would have to be careful and smart. The earl didn\u2019t think she was capable of thinking for herself, obviously, but she hadn\u2019t escaped from her chains and saved him by being a dunderhead.</p><p>Any further thoughts were interrupted by Lerina, as she made a sudden, furious sound that was almost like a shout.</p> <p>She was staring at Maia, her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, and at first Maia thought she\u2019d suddenly and unaccountably recognized her. But that was ridiculous\u2014of course she\u2019d recognized her\u2014and that thought was dismissed as Lerina continued, now speaking to Corvindale in a voice that sounded both happy and taunting at the same time. \u201cI see that you\u2019ve been busy, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned back to focus on Maia, and they were evil. Their very weight seemed to make the blood course in her veins, and her bites throb as if responding to some siren\u2019s call. Maia gripped the wooden stick, trying to keep it hidden within the folds of her skirt, trying to keep her mind clear in the face of such animosity, and realized that the vampire was attempting to enthrall her. And if the shimmer in her vision was any indication, Lerina was succeeding.</p><p>As if realizing this, Corvindale moved abruptly, shifting so that he blocked their connection and severed the thrall. Maia touched him briefly in gratitude and realized she mustn\u2019t make eye contact with any of the Dracule. At least, the ones who meant her harm.</p><p>The third vampire with the rubies had moved some distance from the window while the second one had continued to edge farther from Lerina. It was clear Lerina meant to distract her opponent while setting up her mode of attack.</p><p>Now, the three vampires were spread out at the edge of the room, leaving Maia and Corvindale in the middle.</p><p>The earl continued to scan back and forth between the three, and Maia felt him easing her back as if trying to get to the wall where at least one side would be protected. He made no bones about hiding his stake, and despite the presence of the rubies, his muscles bunched and his breathing seemed relatively steady.</p><p>\u201cYou left me no choice, Lerina,\u201d he replied coolly.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d she asked, but her hands fluttered, belying her innocence. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, the last time you deigned to feed on a mortal, it was me. I hate to think that I\u2019d ruined you for a century, darling.\u201d</p><p>Corvindale gave a disgusted snort. \u201cAs you wish. But, I confess, in a hundred years, I\u2019ve met no one like you.\u201d</p><p>The other woman seemed oblivious to the sarcasm in his voice; or perhaps she was just used to it. \u201cWe could share, Dimitri, and then we wouldn\u2019t have to go through all of this mess. She does seem rather lovely. She\u2019s light and I\u2019m dark...wouldn\u2019t we make a pretty picture? Together? We don\u2019t have to send her on to Cezar. I\u2019ll just tell him she...didn\u2019t make it and he can find another way to get to Chas Woodmore.\u201d</p><p>Lerina smiled and her fangs showed, long and wicked. She looked over at the vampire with the necklace. He\u2019d moved farther from the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Corvindale replied, his stake arm relaxing. He sounded almost inviting.</p><p>Suddenly the vampire who\u2019d been at the window raised his arm and slung the necklace through the air toward Lerina. Corvindale reacted instantly, and, with a groan of exertion in a great moment of pain, raised his stake to intercept the jewels midair. They caught on the wooden spike and in a sharp movement, he whipped them to the ground.</p><p>Maia didn\u2019t hesitate. She dropped to the floor and snatched them up, staggering a bit with the unexpected activity. Better that they were in her hands than their enemies\u2019. But then, before anyone could react, she ran a few steps toward the window and winged the necklace toward the opening.</p><p>The vampire near it leaped but missed, and the lethal gems sparkled as they tumbled into the moonlit night.</p><p>Lerina gave a muffled shriek of anger just as the nearest vampire lunged for Maia. She tried to spin away, still gripping her stake, but he was fast as a breath and he caught her by the arm. His yank was hard enough that she fairly flew through the air, slamming up against him. She flailed out with her stake, stabbing as Iliana had taught her to do; but she was no match for the vampire and couldn\u2019t get him in the right place.</p><p>He laughed and shifted, twisting her around roughly, grabbing up a handful of her hair and baring her neck. He spoke for the first time. \u201cDid you say something about sharing, mistress?\u201d</p><p>Maia swallowed and risked a glance at Corvindale, expecting to see him apprehensive\u2014or at least furious\u2014but he wasn\u2019t even looking at her. He was watching Lerina, whose eyes had turned red and whose fangs were showing once again.</p><p>\u201cLovely thought,\u201d Lerina said.</p><p>Maia\u2019s heart was pounding and she couldn\u2019t get a good angle with her stake, which had been immobilized by the vampire holding her anyway. Then, everything happened at once...but it was as if the world slowed, underwater, and the events unfolded like a bolt of cloth.</p><p>As Corvindale turned, he made a sharp movement. Something spun madly through the air and slammed into the torso of Maia\u2019s captor. A stake. The vampire cried out and released her, tumbling to the floor, but by that time, Corvindale was there, slinging Maia up around the waist. She lost her breath and before she caught it again, he\u2019d lunged toward the window. He caught the edge with his hand and pivoted them through the opening.</p><p>She heard someone scream as they went out, weightless, into the night, nothing but air around them.</p><p>15</p><p>AN INTERMINABLE CARRIAGE RIDE AND A PREEMPTIVE APOLOGY</p><p>\u201cDo stop screaming,\u201d Dimitri said, his ears ringing, his feet flat on the ground. He hadn\u2019t even staggered when he landed. He adjusted his hold on the squirming woman in his arms, for now that they were on the ground safely, she was bound and determined to get free.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d she was gasping. \u201cMad!\u201d</p><p>This was no time to talk; Lerina and her make would be out and after them in a moment\u2014either through the window or down the stairs. And though Dimitri had man aged a perfectly executed escape, he was still more than a bit wobbly in the knees and trembly in the muscles. Yet, the rush of energy from real, fresh, human blood had restored him more quickly than he\u2019d thought possible.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to think about the consequences of that now.</p><p>Definitely not now. Much, much later.</p><p>Perhaps even never.</p><p>Ignoring Maia\u2019s contortions, Dimitri ducked into shadows and dodged around the close-knit warehouses. They were, as he\u2019d surmised, near the wharf, and even at this time of night, sailors were unloading and loading cargo, drinking, gaming and whoring. An easy environment in which to get lost.</p><p>If someone would keep her mouth closed.</p><p>\u201cHush, blasted woman,\u201d he ordered. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear you.\u201d The last thing he wanted was to attract attention from anyone at the wharf and have to deal with that delay, as well.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he flagged down a hack and she disappeared within, disdaining his assistance, that Dimitri was able to take a deep breath. And suddenly everything halted.</p><p>The driver waited for him to climb in, his hand on the door, an impatient look on his face. Certainly Dimitri knew he looked beyond disreputable, with blood streaking him every where, and what had been left of his shirt lost somewhere along the way.</p><p>But he was Corvindale, and he wasn\u2019t about to be rushed into anything, particularly by the likes of a hackney driver. He glanced into the shadows of the carriage, easily able to make out Maia\u2019s figure even in the dark. The prickling over the back of his shoulders and the upheaval in his gut bordered on unpleasant.</p><p>If he climbed into that carriage with her, he knew what was going to happen.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d the hack driver said, allowing the barest hint of impatience in his voice as he looked around. \u201cShall I\u2014er\u2014transport the lady, and return for you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dimitri said at last, stepping onto the stair. Then he paused and looked at the driver and, making a quick, probably foolish, decision, gave him Rubey\u2019s direction.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take Maia home looking as she was, and himself the same. If anyone saw them in their respective conditions, let alone together, Maia would be ruined. At least they could get a change of clothing and washed up at Rubey\u2019s, and perhaps something that would even hide the mauling marks he\u2019d left on her skin. Damn it all. Damn me.</p><p>He snatched the morbid thoughts away and continued on logically. Aside of getting cleaned up, going to Rubey\u2019s would be the easiest way to get word to Giordan and Voss that he and Maia were safe. Despite Voss\u2019s change back to mortality, the establishment remained a central location through which those familiar with the Dracule communicated and socialized. They knew Rubey could be counted on for confidentiality and secrecy even if she and her ladies weren\u2019t providing services.</p> <p>It was the most expedient, prudent thing to do. Just like intercepting her before she waltzed at the masquerade ball.</p><p>With uncustomary care, he climbed into what he now perceived as his own personal hell and settled onto the bench seat across from his own personal tormentor. As the door closed behind him, its latch clicking into place with finality, Dimitri looked across at Maia.</p><p>She was not, as one might expect after such a harrowing experience, huddled in the corner, wide-eyed and meek. Not Maia.</p><p>He steered his thoughts around. Perhaps it would be best if he went back to thinking of her as Miss Woodmore.</p><p>\u201cYou could have killed me,\u201d were her first words. Not shouted at the pitch or volume that set his ears to ringing, but in a low, hushed tone.</p> <p>That was the first sign that something was truly wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhich time?\u201d he replied, hiding behind a bored tone. Not thinking about how right she was. How close he\u2019d come to doing just that.</p><p>He could, of course, see quite clearly in the dark. Everything was tinged bottle-green, and all shades of that hue and black, but he could easily discern the enticing curves of her collarbones, the sagging bodice of the simple dress she was wearing, the fact that her hair hung in a messy knot at the left side of the back of her neck, and that her mouth was a hard, flat line. He was not looking at the tiny marks on her shoulder. Definitely not remembering the taste of her...skin, lifeblood, scent, mouth\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good question,\u201d Miss Woodmore replied, shifting a bit in her seat. Her very movement sent a shimmer of her essence toward him and he had to turn away, trying not to allow the scent to reach him. \u201cBoth times, in fact. The time when you threw a stake at me and hit the vampire and the time you jumped out of a window and dragged me with you.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri opened his mouth to correct her\u2014after all, he\u2019d thrown the stake at the vampire, not at her\u2014but thought better of it. Perhaps if he simply didn\u2019t talk, he could get through this carriage ride with nothing more than having to listen to her reprimand him.</p><p>And that was much preferable to other things that could happen herein.</p> <p>Things that he simply was not going to allow himself to think about. Or remember.</p><p>Like the moment when he really had nearly killed her, when he was so filled with her essence...her lifeblood flooding his mouth, coppery and sweet, her skin beneath his hands as he forgot where he was...who she was...what he was doing. He took, and took, molding her with his hands, tasting, sipping, drawing on her, from her...</p><p>He closed his eyes, his fingers trembling, and tried not to smell her. He rested his head against the side of the carriage and pushed it all away.</p><p>Had he lost the chance to free himself from Lucifer? Black despair started to build inside him and he squeezed his eyes closed. And yet, he would do it again.</p><p>Oh, he would do it again.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it now.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d She broke the silence with a voice that was soft, perhaps a bit husky with...worry.</p><p>Dimitri opened his eyes. No, that would not be a good direction for the conversation to go. It would be better to fight with her, keep her hackles up and therefore her at a distance.</p> <p>The cold, hard ball in his gut had begun to grow and swell, despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t going to allow himself to think about what he\u2019d done. What, after decades of control, of sacrifice, he\u2019d given in to. And how good it made him feel. About how she moaned and writhed against him, pleading for something she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Lucifer\u2019s dark soul, he\u2019d nearly killed her.</p><p>It was only a miracle that had brought him out of the maelstrom of need and pleasure. A miracle.</p><p>He examined her in the green-gray light. Even now, he could see how drawn her skin was. The ghostly pallor, evident to his sharp eyes.</p><p>He should ask her how she was feeling. But he couldn\u2019t speak for fear of what might come out. And so he pulled his cloak of cold, hard emotion around him and looked over at her with deliberately steady eyes. \u201cOther than a rather nasty experience, I couldn\u2019t be better,\u201d he said, deliberately leaving the \u201cexperience\u201d unspecified.</p><p>She bit her lower lip and lifted her chin in a gesture that he\u2019d come to recognize as one of stubbornness.</p><p>Just then, the carriage stopped and it was all Dimitri could do to keep from leaping out with alacrity.</p><p>Instead he lifted one eyebrow and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at Rubey\u2019s. It\u2019s not a place frequented by ladies of your esteem, and I\u2019ll preempt your complaints and criticism by offering my apologies now. I suspect we\u2019ll find not only Dewhurst but Cale here, as well, and perhaps even your brother. As well, Rubey will allow you to put yourself to rights before returning to Blackmont Hall.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but, right on cue, the carriage door opened. Dimitri fairly lunged out, drawing in the refuse and smoke-scented air of London.</p><p>It was infinitely better than the essence inside the carriage.</p><p>Rubey, Maia learned, was the proprietress, or more accurately, the brothel owner. The moment it became clear to Maia that Corvindale had brought her to a brothel, she turned to glare at him and found him watching her with that condescending look as if to remind her that he\u2019d already apologized.</p><p>She looked away and instead allowed herself to be brought into a luxuriously decorated residence that smelled faintly of floral and tobacco. Although she had no idea what a house of ill repute looked like, it certainly wasn\u2019t this tastefully and elegantly appointed place.</p><p>The woman named Rubey, who looked comfortably like her name\u2014for she had strawberry-blond hair and intelligent blue eyes, and spoke with a bit of an Irish lilt\u2014took one look at Maia, then at the bare-chested earl, and immediately clamped her lips closed.</p><p>Corvindale, of course, was lavish with commands and directions, and Rubey was efficient and yet less than obeisant in her response. But her eyes were wide and shocked, if not speculative, and she said nothing as she rang for a maid. Apparently, despite Corvindale\u2019s certainty, neither Dewhurst nor Mr. Cale were currently present.</p><p>Not long after, Maia found herself in the deepest, warmest, most fragrant bath she could ever recall having. Tears gathered at the corners of her eyes as she rested back against its edge, as pleasure washed over her, followed by confusion and anger and a variety of other emotions.</p><p>She\u2019d sent the maid away as soon as she slid into the bath, telling her to return only when she rang for her. Maia needed time alone.</p><p>She could scarcely account for everything that had happened since yesterday afternoon\u2014for the sun was just rising and it was a new day. Come to think of it, she could scarcely comprehend everything that had happened, and that she\u2019d experienced, since Corvindale became her reluctant guardian. Everything from the existence of vampires, to being attacked, fed upon and kidnapped by them...along with her sister becoming engaged to one of them, who had become mortal once again.</p><p>In her exhausted and confused state, she could no longer ignore the loneliness that she often forced herself to disregard, that sense of having no one with whom she could truly talk and share the things that worried her. She let it all pour out in tears, silent and furious recriminations punctuated by violent splashes, and even a rash of prayerful words directed to Above.</p><p>Maia was grateful for the steamy water, for she used it to wash away the tears of frustration and anger and confusion, and when she was finished, she rang for the maid.</p><p>Determined to be as strong and resilient as she always was\u2014for if she weren\u2019t, no one else would be\u2014Maia allowed the maid to wash her hair and to thoroughly bathe her before helping her out of the tub.</p><p>Her dress, shift and corset were replaced by ones from Rubey, and despite Maia\u2019s suspicion that they\u2019d be scandalous, she was pleased to find the garments tasteful and stylish.</p><p>Shortly after, her damp hair pinned in a loose braid over one side of her neck, strategically placed to hide the marks there, Maia found herself in a parlorlike chamber, waiting for she wasn\u2019t certain what.</p><p>Rubey came in, looking fresh and elegant in a light green dress of muslin. She was carrying a tray and that was when Maia realized how hungry she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met your sister,\u201d Rubey said, offering Maia a short glass filled with amber liquid. \u201cHere, a bit of the Irish gold for you, as my papa called it,\u201d she explained when Maia hesitated. \u201cAfter what you\u2019ve been through, you should have twice as much.\u201d</p><p>Maia took it and sipped the burning liquid as her hostess arranged cheese and bread on a small plate and offered it to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Angelica?\u201d Maia asked, sipping more of what she presumed was whiskey. Rubey was right, it made her feel better. Warmer and a bit looser.</p><p>\u201cShe was here some time ago with Voss,\u201d Rubey explained as Maia nibbled on the cheese. \u201cThe night of the masquerade ball where the vampires attacked. By the by, Dimitri has sent word to her that you\u2019re found and safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate knowing that. Thank you. You seem more than a bit familiar with the Dracule,\u201d Maia said, and noticed for the first time that Rubey had bite marks on her neck, just below the ear. The sight reminded her of her own experience, and her stomach did a little flutter. \u201cAre you one of them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStars, no, and I wouldn\u2019t if they asked me. In fact, they have,\u201d Rubey added with a wave of her hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been offered more than once to turn Dracule, and I\u2019ve declined every time. Why would I want to live forever, and then be damned at the end of time?\u201d</p><p>Maia flinched at the woman\u2019s use of the blunt word, but found herself fascinated nevertheless. Here was someone who might actually answer her questions without prevarication. \u201cIs that truly how it is?\u201d</p><p>Rubey nodded gravely. \u201cIt\u2019s unnatural, is what I say to Giordan. He\u2019s kind enough to me, and visits frequently when he\u2019s in London, but I\u2019m merely a replacement for\u2014someone else. And who\u2019d want to live forever anyway? The same, day after day after day? Everyone you know and love, dying without you, while you\u2019re staying the same? Everything dies, everything has a season and a cycle\u2014that\u2019s the way God made it. I don\u2019t mind a few gray hairs, either. But the sagging I can do without.\u201d She flashed a bit of a smile as she made a subtle gesture to her bosom.</p> <p>Maia nearly blushed, but the woman was perhaps a decade or more older than she, and perhaps sagging was a concern. \u201cDo you mean to say that Corvindale has made a pact with the devil? And that\u2019s how he\u2019s become a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all have, for one reason or another, made such an agreement. But Dimitri has been trying to break the covenant for over a hundred years. That\u2019s why he studies so much, and why he refuses to drink or feed from mortals. Although\u2014\u201d her eyes glinted \u201c\u2014that appears to have changed.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s cheeks warmed. \u201cHe certainly didn\u2019t want to, but it was the only way I could think to get him out of there. He was too weak to stand.\u201d</p><p>Rubey\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDo you mean to say, you saved Dimitri? Oh, how he must have loved that!\u201d</p><p>Maia blushed more. \u201cI can\u2019t say that\u2019s the whole of it, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She stopped as the parlor door opened.</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d Rubey said slyly, garnering her a sharp, annoyed glance from Corvindale.</p><p>He strode in as if he owned the place and helped himself to a glass of the same whiskey Maia had tasted. His serving was much more generous than hers. After a brief survey of the chamber\u2014which was furnished with a sofa, where Maia sat facing two armchairs, one of which was occupied by their hostess, he disdained all of the seating possibilities and remained standing near a tall, narrow table to her left.</p><p>The expression on his face was haughty and removed, as always. But Maia found herself unable to keep anticipation from fluttering in her middle as she looked at him. His very presence changed the energy in the room, shrinking it, making it warmer. More interesting.</p><p>He\u2019d obviously bathed, as well, for his hair was damp and spiked in sharp points around the collar of his pristine white shirt. He stood holding his drink, sleeves rolled up to his elbows to display darkly haired skin the color of suntanned leather. Elegant wrists connected strong, wide hands to muscular forearms, and Maia knew fully well the shape and girth of his upper arms and shoulders. She swallowed and averted her gaze from the loose ties at the throat of his shirt where just a hint of dark hair showed.</p><p>\u201cEnlightening your guest with the darkest secrets of my race, are you, Rubey?\u201d His words might have been light if it weren\u2019t for the way his eyes bored into the titian-haired woman.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cShe was just telling me how it all happened. Quite a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain she was,\u201d he replied without glancing at Maia. \u201cBut it was beyond foolish of her to become involved in the matter. Things would have worked out much better if she\u2019d simply stayed home.\u201d</p><p>Maia went rigid. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, Lord Corvindale,\u201d she said in her iciest voice, \u201cno one would have known about the ruby hairpin. Which is what led me to investigate Mrs. Throckmullins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s where you went wrong, Miss Woodmore. You should never have been investigating anyone. Dewhurst and Cale had things well in hand. They would have found me soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Maia could not hold back an improper snort. \u201cI merely went for an afternoon call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor should you have gone alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go alone, you dratted man. Do you think I have feathers for brains? I had three footmen with me. How was I to know that Mrs. Throckmullins was your former mistress, and that she would have invited me into tea and then poisoned me? I certainly couldn\u2019t have brought three footmen into her parlor, now, could I?\u201d</p><p>He raised the whiskey. \u201cVery well. I stand corrected. You could have done nothing to prevent Lerina from drugging and abducting you.\u201d</p> <p>Maia drew herself up even more, ignoring the avid interest on Rubey\u2019s face. \u201cJust as you could have done nothing to prevent her from abducting you. Because of course, being the Earl of Corvindale, you know all and see all and could clearly foresee every possible circumstance. Which is precisely why you ended up in the condition in which I found you.\u201d</p><p>Rubey drew in a sharp intake of breath that sounded suspiciously like a stifled laugh.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Maia continued, unable to stop herself, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t managed not only to free myself from being chained to a chaise lounge and then gone in search of you, you would probably be dead by now from loss of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDracule don\u2019t die from loss of blood,\u201d he sneered.</p><p>\u201cEven when tied up by ruby necklaces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were tied up by rubies, Dimitri?\u201d Their hostess looked much too intrigued by such a concept, her eyes narrowing contemplatively. \u201cNow there\u2019s a fascinating idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my carriage here yet?\u201d Corvindale snarled at her. \u201cPerhaps you ought to go check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I find this conversation very stimulating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He didn\u2019t roar, but the room vibrated as if he had. Rubey rose reluctantly and started toward the door, not at all cowed.</p><p>But Maia wasn\u2019t finished; no indeed. She had so much to say to the arrogant, impossible, infuriating man in front of her, she didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be done in a week. \u201cAnd then you throw a stake at me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw it at the vampire who was holding you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have stabbed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t have, you addled woman. Do you think I\u2019m completely incompetent? I knew precisely what I was doing, as is evident by the fact that you are here, intact, and so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you jump through a second-story window,\u201d Maia continued, her mind blazing with fury, the words tumbling out, \u201cand take me with you! We could have been killed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDracule don\u2019t die from a fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut people like me do!\u201d she shrieked, leaping to her feet. Maia drew in a deep breath and realized she\u2019d truly gone mad. Perhaps he was right. Perhaps she was addled. She reached down for her glass, taking the last swallow of her whiskey while managing not to cough or choke. She heard the faint click of the door closing behind Rubey.</p><p>Corvindale didn\u2019t seem to notice; for he was watching Maia from over the rim of his own glass, his eyes dark and steady. Wary. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d he said in his chilly voice, \u201cthat you were perfectly safe once the rubies were out of my proximity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how,\u201d she said sweetly, but with a steely edge, \u201cdid it happen that those blasted rubies got out of your proximity?\u201d Her hands planted on her hips, she glowered up at him.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of rubies,\u201d he said, setting his glass on the table with a definite clunk, \u201cwhy in the goddamned bloody hell did you not use them?\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth, for she truly had no idea what he meant. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have killed you, Maia,\u201d he said, his face terrible. Darker and more frightening than she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI nearly killed you.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head, anger dissolving into confusion. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me, Corvindale,\u201d she said, at last understanding. \u201cYou needed to feed. It was the only way.\u201d</p><p>He made a disgusted sound and reached for her. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he said, yanking her arm out to display the bite marks there. \u201cAnd here,\u201d he said, shoving her braid away from her shoulder. \u201cYou would have let me go on and on until there was nothing left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it before,\u201d he said, his voice dropping into an awful pitch. It made her nauseated, the loathing and malevolence therein. His dark eyes glittered, holding hers like magnets. \u201cI\u2019ve torn a woman to shreds, left nothing but mutilated flesh behind. I could have done that to you.\u201d His voice had dropped to an agonized whisper.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t. You stopped. I didn\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave a bitter laugh, still holding on to her wrist. \u201cOnly by the grace of\u2014something, some miracle\u2014did I stop. It had been one hundred thirteen years, Maia.\u201d He drew in an unsteady breath, his thumb sliding over her skin. \u201cAnd even now...\u201d</p><p>He dropped her arm abruptly and turned away. \u201cWhere the bloody hell is my carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said, her voice quiet. She stepped toward him, reaching for his arm. It was in her nature to comfort, to set all right, to take care of things, and for the first time, she sensed the deep pain rolling off him like fog from the sea. It had been hidden beneath that brittle, dark exterior all this time.</p><p>When she touched him, he froze, the muscles of his forearm tightening like bowstrings. \u201cMiss Woodmore,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cYou are out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me and say that,\u201d she said, noting that he didn\u2019t pull away from her grip. He needed something. Something perhaps he didn\u2019t even understand.</p><p>He turned. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. Release me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, finding no humor in that ludicrous command, and silently, fearlessly, she met his eyes. Her heart pounded in her throat, echoing through her entire body as she lifted her other hand and placed it on the warm expanse of his chest. Flat, there over one of the solid planes of muscle covered by crisp white linen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Time stopped. The room shrunk, and she was caught up in a moment of...something. Something potent.</p><p>When he moved, it wasn\u2019t to spin away, but to pull her toward him. Hard and quick, with strong arms enfolding her, he brought her up against his tall frame as he bent his head. Maia met his lips with hers, hungry for what they had begun so many times earlier.</p><p>Their mouths clashed and fought, his tongue strong and sleek, battling with hers in an erotic melee. She had him under her hands, her fingers against the warm skin of his neck, the damp fringe of his hair, pulling at the strings of his shirt.</p> <p>Corvindale lifted her onto the table next to him, clinking glasses, raising her to a height that brought her eye level with him. His hands pulled at her hair, loosening it from its braid, his fingers sliding down her neck and along her shoulders, drawing the edges of her dress\u2019s neckline with them. The fresh air felt cool on her warm skin, and the rough pads of his fingers made gentle texture on her.</p><p>When he pulled out of the kiss, she made a sound of negation and frustration, but he was merely moving to the side of her jaw, in front of her ear. She shivered a little when he got there and she felt his warm breath deep inside her ear, then his hot mouth covered the wounds on her bare shoulder. Maia sighed and tipped her head to the side, opening her neck and throat, pressing up against his mouth, but he didn\u2019t bite. Instead she felt the little shudder of his torso where it pressed against hers and his tongue sliding over and around the marks, his lips sucking gently on the rise of her shoulder, his hands strong and busy over the rest of her, cupping her breasts, sliding down over the swell of her hips.</p><p>The ties at the back of her dress loosened, and the bodice gapped before she knew it, his hands drawing the neckline down over her shoulders, completely baring them and the top of her shift. When he realized she couldn\u2019t recline any farther on the narrow table, Corvindale made a sound of frustration and scooped her up.</p><p>Maia clung to his shoulders, dazed and already aroused, as he pivoted around and deposited her on the sofa, easing down next to her. She caught a glimpse of his face, dark and intense, his eyes hooded, and the very image of that desirous countenance sent deep waves of pleasure in her belly.</p><p>His weight pressed her gently into the upholstery, leaving her breathless but not frightened or overwhelmed. She started to say something\u2014she didn\u2019t even know what; perhaps to order him to remove his dratted shirt\u2014when he gave a sharp yank and pulled the top of her corset away. He\u2019d already loosened it, and her breast slipped free, round and ivory with a swollen pink tip.</p> <p>He made a little sound, then ducked his head and flicked out his tongue just over the tip of her nipple. Maia watched, jolting at the light sensation that spiraled through her, and when he covered her with his mouth, the undulating waves of heat trammeled through her, down past her belly and to her core. His tongue sleek and warm, swirling around as he drew her hard and fast in his mouth, made her lose her breath. The pang of pleasure stabbed her belly again, and she felt herself opening, flowering and swelling down at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>Pulling away, he looked up at her. Their eyes caught and Maia could hardly catch her breath at the dark heat there. She could see the tips of his upper fangs just below his upper lip, and she wanted them...inside her.</p><p>Instead of asking that, she whispered, \u201cYour shirt, Corvindale. Make it go away.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and he eased back, whipping the linen up and over his head with a sharp snap. She had to touch his broad shoulders and the ridges of his belly, the slabs of his chest, slide her fingers through the thick patch of hair and over flat, oval nipples. She moved her hands up to cover the marks on his arm and raised her face to touch them with her mouth, wondering if she might taste more of him there, too.</p><p>He was solid and smooth, his skin damp and hot, and she felt something deep beneath leaping and trembling as she scored him gently with her teeth. His head tipped to the side, leaning against the sofa, his eyes closed, his beautiful lips\u2014the mouth she\u2019d so admired at the masquerade ball\u2014parted as he drew in steadying breaths. Maia shifted, and his heavy arm came around as if to keep her from slipping away, but she had no intention of doing so.</p><p>She planted her hands flat on the warm slabs of his chest and curled her fingers around his shoulders to pull herself up. She had to taste that strong, corded neck, and it was warm and soft and she felt him groaning deep in his throat as she nibbled along the tendons there. When she closed her teeth over him, giving a sharp nip, he shuddered, his arm tightening around her.</p> <p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTake care.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in the warmth of his neck, smelling his particular smell, now fresh with bergamot. \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh, and she shifted, realizing she was now pressed against him all the full length of their torsos and legs. She could feel the outline of his powerful thighs, fairly twice as thick as her own, her skirt and shift tangled in with them and the hard rise from behind the buttons of his trousers. The very feel of it made her belly ache and her center tingle with sharp pleasure.</p><p>Before she could slide her hand down over the gentle ripples of his stomach, he moved, easing all along the length of her until his knees were on the floor. Before she could sit up, he had his hands up and under her skirt, sliding the layers up and baring her legs. When he bent to kiss the inside of her thigh, Maia felt uncontrollable shivers starting up along her.</p><p>What if he bit her...there?</p><p>His tongue moved sleek and strong along the sensitive skin inside her leg, and Maia watched his dark head moving against her ivory thigh. She caught a glimpse of his teeth, white and sharp, against her flesh, her breathing coming faster and harder as he moved higher up. A flash of a fang had her veins surging and pounding, and when he spread her legs, burying his face down in the heat of her there, Maia nearly arched off the sofa.</p><p>His fingers were clever and gentle, baring that most sensitive, most private part of her, and somewhere in the back of her mind, Maia realized she shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Not her, not Miss Woodmore, not the woman who was going to marry someone...else....</p><p>But she didn\u2019t care. This was it, this was him, this was what she wanted...and his mouth was hot and fervent, and she quivered, swollen and wet, and when his tongue slid over her quim, she knew she couldn\u2019t stop this. She didn\u2019t want to, especially when he did something that made her insides gather up and explode into deep trembling waves.</p> <p>Nothing...she\u2019d never felt anything like that before.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d she whispered, her hand closing over his head, still settled between her legs, her fingers buried in his warm hair. But she knew there was more, and she wanted it.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she murmured as she\u2019d done before, not knowing precisely what she wanted or needed, but knowing that he\u2014only he\u2014could give it to her.</p><p>He shook his head against her, down by her knee, giving her a quick slip of tongue in the curve there.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His breath and lips were hot against her. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool.\u201d He slipped his tongue down around in the heat of her and she gave a little squeak of pleasure, a shot of fire rippling through her. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cYes...please. I want...all of it.\u201d</p><p>And when, suddenly, he pulled away, his face hot and eyes burning, she almost wailed in distress. She throbbed, ready again for more. For the rest of it.</p><p>But then he was tearing at the buttons on the fall of his trousers, and she was helping him, and he gave a short, sharp shake of his head as he muttered, \u201cAlways interfering, Miss Woodmore,\u201d and then he was there, against her again, this time his bare chest warm, printing on her skin.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him, that hard bulge she\u2019d felt earlier, and for a moment, she was bereft, feeling lost...but then his fingers moved between them, and found the very hard, tight core of her being, and before she knew it, they\u2019d slipped and slid around so that she was even more full and hot and throbbing, and then he paused.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he breathed, withdrawing his hand. She knew it was a question. \u201cThis is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shifting against him, in distress. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He made a soft, strangled sound, and the next thing she knew, he shifted and fitted himself to her. Maia sighed: this was it. Yes.</p><p>Then he moved and she felt a snap of pain deep inside. Maia froze for a moment, her eyes opening, the pleasure filtering away...but before she could think, he began to move. And her mouth gaped, her body heated, and everything in her world became focused on the sleek slide, in and out. It was long and beautiful, this feeling of right, the tingle of desire centering there between them.</p><p>He muttered something deep and low near her ear, but she couldn\u2019t understand. She didn\u2019t care. There was the heat and the rhythm and the growing blossoming, and she cried out when he sank his teeth into her shoulder, her body seeming to explode deep inside.</p><p>Pleasure undulated through her in little echoing ripples as he groaned into her skin, his body hot and damp against her. And then he moved one last time, hard and deep, with a soft cry of exertion. He pulled his face away, burying his forehead into her neck, the scent of blood in her nose as he shuddered against her.</p><p>16</p><p>OF APOLOGIES AND RECOMPENSE AND INFLATED DOWRIES</p><p>No sooner did the blaze of pleasure and fulfillment begin to fade than a cold, hard stone settled in Dimitri\u2019s middle.</p><p>By Fate, what have I done?</p><p>A chill washed over him and he drew in a deep breath, his mind shooting off in many different directions.</p><p>He halted it with cold control. No. There\u2019d be time for recriminations and regrets later. Now he must keep his thoughts clear and extricate himself\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014from...this.</p><p>This...moment of quiet fulfillment, of delight, of something that had shaken him deep in his core. Something that made his insides move, like a heated flower opening and sending its warmth through him. But that quickly turned bleak.</p><p>He forced himself to open his eyes, pulling up gently from her shoulder. He\u2019d already retracted his fangs, but the essence of blood still lingered on his tongue, filtering into his nostrils. Beautiful. Her eyes were closed, her face slack with satiation. He\u2019d never seen anything that made his heart ache like this. Though he must, he couldn\u2019t look away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips, full and moist, rosy and inviting, were half-parted. The damp braid that had confined all of the strands of blond, bronze, copper, auburn and walnut was a distant memory, and her long, thick hair clung in places to her skin, and his, as well. Bare throat and shoulders, with an uncovered breast that couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. The mere sight of it, the memory of its smooth, sweet texture, the hard, sensitive nipple beneath his tongue and lips, made his body begin to tighten all over again.</p><p>What have I done to you? To me?</p><p>Even as he pulled away, Dimitri struggled with how to undo what could not be undone. He pulled down the cold wall behind which he could be safe, and watched as Maia\u2014 Miss Woodmore, she must be Miss Woodmore again\u2014opened her eyes with a flutter.</p> <p>So wrong.</p><p>He wanted to poke at her, to cut with his words and send her reeling away. If he did that, then she could continue to loathe the Earl of Corvindale. She could wed Bradington with perhaps a twinge of conscience, but at least she would still wed him.</p><p>Instead of demanding that Dimitri come up to snuff. Tempting him.</p><p>That would...could...never happen.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale.\u201d</p> <p>Even the way she said his name, still used his title in all formality, sounded husky and intimate.</p><p>He\u2019d sat up and was putting himself to rights, rebuttoning his trousers and then locating his shirt in a crumpled wad on the floor. Your shirt, Corvindale. Make it go away.</p><p>You won\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>Please.</p><p>He closed his eyes. Lucifer\u2019s bloody hell.</p><p>She was sitting up now, and he dared not look at her and see those wide, questioning eyes. Hurt. Or perhaps they would be filled with anger and recrimination\u2014as they rightly should be.</p> <p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said again, more firmly. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then did as she asked. Thank the Fates she\u2019d pulled up her bodice and righted the rest of her clothing. The only sign of their activities was the new bite on her shoulder. He slid his gaze up to her face. What he saw there was not question nor confusion, neither was it anger or recrimination. There was a hint of softness, the heavy-liddedness of pleasure, and something else. Acceptance?</p><p>\u201cI suppose this wasn\u2019t what Chas had in mind when he named you guardian,\u201d she said, pulling all of that thick bundle of hair forward over one shoulder. She began to plait it in a fat braid.</p><p>He swallowed a derisive sound. \u201cYou do realize, Miss Woodmore, that, while I cannot begin to make things right in regards to this, nothing will change.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow, her green-brown eyes fastened on him with a bland expression. She was silent for a moment before replying, \u201cWhat precisely do you mean that nothing will change?\u201d</p><p>He noticed that her busy fingers were either very quick, or they were trembling a bit. Sorrow pitted his insides. \u201cI mean that we need never speak of or acknowledge this...er...event to anyone. No one need ever know, and you will go on to wed Bradington without even a whiff of scandal.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2014blast it, Miss Woodmore\u2014continued to watch him steadily. She\u2019d finished with the braid and now her fingers settled in her lap, within the folds of her gown so that he couldn\u2019t tell if they were shaking.</p><p>\u201cThe way you put it, it\u2019s really rather simple then, isn\u2019t it, my lord? We both go on as if nothing has happened. But in fact, Corvindale, you clearly realize that a great deal has happened.\u201d Her voice became more strident, rising a bit at the end. She wasn\u2019t shouting, or even furious. But simply strong. Knowing.</p> <p>\u201cI realize that you can never\u2014nor should you\u2014forgive me for my behavior today. It was beyond inexcusable. I shall settle an additional dowry on you for a wedding gift as an apology and a clumsy attempt to comfort you. I\u2019m quite certain, as well, that your brother will remove you from my guardianship immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d she said from between unmoving lips, \u201cyou just said no one need ever know. I presumed Chas was included in that statement. Or,\u201d she continued, a new flash of fire in her eyes, \u201cwas this all a great ruse to entice him to remove me and my sisters from your custody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI had no intention of ever coming near you, Miss Woodmore. Let alone\u2014this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat is what I thought. I\u2019m relieved to know that my impressions were correct.\u201d Standing, she continued, \u201cSo I am to understand that, firstly, you are apologetic for today\u2019s events. Secondly, you wish for no one to know what has transpired. And third, that you intend to bestow a great deal of money upon my nuptial union in order to assuage yourself from any lingering guilt you might have. Do I have that right?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri managed to nod. This was so...odd.</p><p>\u201cA great deal of money,\u201d she repeated, spearing him with her eyes. \u201cCorrect?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your behavior.\u201d</p><p>He nodded a bit more slowly this time. Was this some sort of snare?</p><p>\u201cThen I have one further question for you, Corvindale.\u201d Again, those syllables took on a bit of a note of intimacy merely because they came from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d He glanced toward the door of the parlor, for he\u2019d heard the sounds of someone approaching. Or, more likely, Rubey listening at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of recompense do you expect me to offer for my behavior?\u201d</p><p>He stilled, staring at her. \u201cEr...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d she continued even as the parlor door rattled, \u201cI was a fully participatory member in what occurred here. In fact,\u201d she added, spearing him with her eyes, \u201cI do believe I was rather instrumental in them. I did say please, did I not?\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Rubey stood there. \u201cDimitri, your carriage has arrived.\u201d</p><p>What the hell had taken so long?</p><p>Dimitri didn\u2019t join Miss Woodmore in the carriage. He wasn\u2019t that much of a fool.</p><p>Instead he sent her back to Blackmont Hall with a relieved Tren handling the reins. Then he glared at the far-too-fascinated Rubey and induced her to loan him her vehicle.</p><p>He had a particular visit to make.</p><p>The fact that it was yet another gray, foggy day in London only added to the ease with which he alighted from the carriage in front of Lenning\u2019s Tannery and ducked under the wooden awning that stretched in front of the antiquarian bookstore.</p><p>For a moment he hesitated, peering through the window, aware of the sun\u2019s rays filtering through the fog and teasing the back of his neck between hat and collar. The shop seemed dark and empty, and he was suddenly terrified that Wayren had gone.</p><p>But when he pushed on the door, it opened and he stepped in.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath of peaceful, musty air, Dimitri closed the door behind him. The place was silent and the only illumination came from a distant corner of the shop. It was a soft, orange-yellow glow that displayed the dust motes he\u2019d just stirred with his entrance.</p><p>For some reason, he felt odd about disturbing the silence and calling for the shopkeeper. Or perhaps he feared that she wasn\u2019t there, and that he would have to continue to face his confusion and frustration on his own.</p><p>When he heard the soft scuff of a foot on the floor, followed by the whisper of fabric over the ground, Dimitri\u2019s heart leaped and he turned.</p><p>Wayren appeared from around a corner. Interestingly enough, she didn\u2019t emerge from the area with the light, but from one of the more shadowy ones. Today, she was empty-handed and without her spectacles.</p><p>\u201cAnd so here you are,\u201d she said, eyeing him steadily.</p><p>Dimitri nodded. His mouth didn\u2019t seem able to move, nor his brain to form the words he needed to speak. He didn\u2019t know what to say\u2014how to ask.</p><p>She waited. Peace and serenity emanated from her, along with the indefinable scent of something warm and comforting.</p><p>\u201cYou were there,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou...stopped me.\u201d</p><p>She continued to watch him with those peaceful eyes. \u201cYou stopped yourself, Dimitri of Corvindale.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, the black bubble of uncertainty spreading like tar inside him. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t appeared in my mind...I would have killed her. I would have taken and taken, I would have drained her to death.\u201d It had been the flash of a vision, clear as if she\u2019d been standing in front of him, that had erupted in his mind as he fed on Maia. That peaceful face with the serene blue-gray eyes had broken through the red-tinged world of need and pleasure, easing the desperation. Giving him a reprieve.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, you stopped yourself. I did nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did show yourself to me.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows with a noncommittal expression, and he realized that he would get no confirmation from her. She seemed to know whereof he spoke, but that was the most she would give. I can do nothing for you, she\u2019d said once.</p><p>She had done something.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t been enough. Where had she been when he was first faced with the choice from Lucifer? Why hadn\u2019t she stopped him then?</p><p>Wayren was looking at him, almost as if she could read what was in his mind. \u201cYou had the choice then, Dimitri. You made the decision of your own free will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was weak. He took advantage of my weakness,\u201d Dimitri replied. But even to him, the words sounded hollow. Even then, he\u2019d known there was something wrong. Something evil. He\u2019d hesitated, yes, but then he\u2019d allowed himself to be tricked, manipulated in a moment of desperation. For all he knew, Meg might have lived anyway. For all he knew, Luce had known it then, as well.</p><p>\u201cAye, Dimitri. He did. That is what the Fiend does.\u201d Despite her words, Wayren watched him with a calm, peaceful expression. \u201cHe makes it easy to see his way. He takes advantage.\u201d</p><p>Just as I did.</p><p>The image of Maia\u2019s face, slack with pleasure, filled with her own sort of peace, slid into Dimitri\u2019s mind. He shoved it away.</p><p>It was too late. He\u2019d lied when he told Maia nothing had changed.</p><p>Everything had changed.</p><p>\u201cAnd so now all of my years of self-denial are for naught,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked at him searchingly. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s so,\u201d he replied, more angrily than he\u2019d ever spoken to her. \u201cHow can I expect to break the covenant, to distance myself from the devil, if I act like the demon he turned me into? If I take from people, feed on them, pull their very life from them, how can I ever become human again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve fed on a mortal, for the first time in decades, and you believe that action has destroyed your chance to be released from the Fiend? Oh, yes, I can see that a century of self-denial has already gotten you so very close to your desire.\u201d</p> <p>He glared at her mutely. She was looking at him with a sort of arch expression that he\u2019d never seen before. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cI fed from a person. I drank her blood. I...\u201d His voice trailed off as saliva filled his mouth. Even now, he could hardly control the physical reaction of his long-denied body. He could still taste it. Feel the energy, the life flowing through him. \u201cIt\u2019s a violation. A sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut has denying yourself done anything but make you a cold, hard, empty shell? Hardly a person at all.\u201d</p><p>To his shock and eternal mortification, Dimitri felt a stinging in his eyes. He pinched the bridge of his nose fiercely before any tears could form. \u201cMy...dislike of social engagement has nothing to do with the problem at hand.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been...particularly social.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you read the story I gave you?\u201d Wayren asked.</p> <p>Dimitri frowned, blinking hard. \u201cThe fairy tale about the beast? A bit of it. I found nothing of relevance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>Impatience flooded him, and he made a sharp, frustrated gesture with his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you.</p><p>I thought...\u201d He shook his head sharply, pressing his lips together.</p><p>\u201cDimitri of Corvindale,\u201d Wayren said. Her voice had gentled. \u201cIf you want to become truly human again\u2014no longer bound to the Fiend\u2014first you must allow yourself to live again. To feel again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel,\u201d he snarled.</p> <p>\u201cDo you? Or do you snarl and growl\u2014as you\u2019ve done here, today\u2014and then run in the opposite direction when ever something begins to soften your heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarls don\u2019t run,\u201d he snapped, but something shifted deep inside him.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cNo, not this one. Instead you lock yourself away within a barricade of stone walls so that none can touch you, so that you can keep yourself from feeling anything.\u201d</p><p>It was safer that way. Easier. Less complicated. \u201cI lock myself away so I can study,\u201d he said. But even to him, the words sounded false. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be bothered.\u201d</p><p>Wayren gave him a sad, soft smile. \u201cBut that\u2019s why men are here. To be bothered. To feel. To live. To love. And...to be loved. That is what makes you different from every other creature. And that is what makes man ultimately more powerful than the Fiend. Do you not see? He\u2019s taken your soul, and with it, he\u2019s taken your very humanity. The very part that could save you.\u201d</p><p>His belly twisted tightly and his head throbbed. Maia\u2019s face filtered into his memory, then was supplanted by Meg. And Lerina. He shook his head, but at the same time, something small and warm moved in his chest. Something he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time.</p><p>Wayren was watching him. \u201cVery well, then. Dimitri of Corvindale, I wish you all of the best.\u201d</p><p>During the ride back to Corvindale\u2019s residence from that of the sharp-eyed Rubey, Maia tried to keep her mind blank. She had so much to think about, so many emotions to sift through and to determine which ones to focus on, that she dared not begin it until she was in the privacy of her own chamber.</p> <p>Preferably during another bath, where she might wash away the remnants of the interlude in Rubey\u2019s parlor.</p><p>She shivered, a little flutter of heat streaking through her. That episode alone was enough to send her thoughts spiraling into confusion. But she dared not let herself think about it now. About: Nothing need change. We need tell no one.</p><p>Her lips tightened. Corvindale was addled if he thought nothing had changed.</p><p>When the carriage pulled up in front of Blackmont Hall, the first thing Maia noticed was another familiar vehicle parked there. Her stomach became a mass of fluttering bird wings.</p><p>Alexander.</p><p>As if she didn\u2019t have enough to contend with. Biting her lip, she opened the little door behind the driver and asked him to take her around to the servants\u2019 entrance.</p><p>It simply wasn\u2019t done, of course, for a lady of the peerage to come through the rear entrance. But that would be preferable to trying to explain to Alexander why her hair was a mess and why there were four delicate marks on her neck. And shoulder. And on her gloveless wrist.</p><p>Thus, she slipped into the rear entrance and through the warm kitchen, down into the hallways that weren\u2019t quite as gloomy as they had been when she and Angelica had arrived here. At least some of the windows were unsheathed from drapes now, so many weeks after their arrival.</p><p>Maia sent a message down to Alexander that she\u2019d arrived and was safe, asking him to come back later in the afternoon, for she needed time to rest.</p><p>No sooner had she sent off her maid with that task, and to order a bath, than the door to her chamber was assaulted by an insistent knock. Before Maia had the chance to bolt the door\u2014for she well knew her sister\u2014said sister burst into the room.</p><p>\u201cMaia! Oh, thank heavens you\u2019re back!\u201d She threw herself into Maia\u2019s arms, and nearly bowled her over onto the bed, for not only was she enthusiastic, but Angelica was also a bit taller and heavier than her elder sister. \u201cAre you hurt? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt at all,\u201d Maia replied, \u201cexcept for the fact that you are squeezing the life out of me.\u201d</p><p>Her sister released her and stepped back. \u201cIs that better?\u201d she asked. And then her face froze with shock. \u201cIs that what I think it is? On your neck?\u201d</p><p>Maia touched the bite marks, which were what had caught her sister\u2019s eye. \u201cIf you think they are vampire bites,\u201d she said in a much lower volume than Angelica, \u201cyou would be correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Moldavi\u2019s vampires?\u201d Angelica asked, sitting next to her on the bed. \u201cWere you terrified? Did they kidnap you? All I heard from Corvindale\u2019s message was that you\u2019d been found safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m safe, and uninjured. Have you heard anything from Chas?\u201d she asked in an effort to avoid Angelica\u2019s question about the bites.</p><p>\u201cChas has not been in contact, but we\u2019ve sent a message. He\u2019ll be here soon. Alexander is below.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but I sent word that I would see him this afternoon. I need...to freshen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s refused to leave. He says he\u2019ll wait here until you\u2019re ready to come down.\u201d</p><p>Maia closed her eyes. Noble. So noble. \u201cIt will be some time before I come down. Perhaps you can tell him for me, that I am well, but I must freshen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall do my best, but he\u2019s as stubborn as you.\u201d Angelica looked at her sharply. \u201cWhat happened to you, Maia? Where did you get the bites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to discuss it,\u201d she replied firmly. \u201cBut I do wish for a bath.\u201d</p><p>Despite Angelica\u2019s protests and questions, Maia managed to send her from the room with direction to talk to Alexander. Then she indulged in her second bath of the day, along with her second bout of confused tears.</p><p>Whatever was she going to do about Alexander? How could she marry him after what had happened with Corvindale? How could she marry him when she was in love with another man?</p><p>In love with another man.</p><p>Those words jumped up out of her mental whirlwind of thoughts, freezing in her mind. Maia paused, water and tears mingling and dripping from her face.</p><p>In love with another man who happened to be a vampire.</p><p>How could she be in love with him? The thought was absurd. He was rude and arrogant and he raised his voice to her and he argued about everything. He condescended. He insulted.</p><p>He kissed her. Oh, how he kissed her.</p><p>He argued with her, but for all that, he didn\u2019t ignore her. For all his annoyed comments, he nevertheless seemed to listen to her. He was honorable. Intelligent.</p><p>He could never picnic with her, under the sun. He could never ride or accompany her anywhere during the day.</p><p>But the way he looked at her...with something in his eyes. Something...needy. Something lost. Something lurked there.</p><p>She let her hands fall into the warm, vanilla-and-lily-scented water, causing it to splash over the rim.</p><p>What a fanciful notion. That she was in love with a vampire. With the earl. With a man who could hardly stand her presence.</p><p>And if she were in love with him\u2014truly in love, although how could she be, truly?\u2014what difference did it make? He certainly couldn\u2019t love her. And...</p><p>She was to wed Alexander. A good man. Who possibly loved her, and who at least held her in high regard. Even if his kisses were boring and his conversation not nearly as interesting, if not as explosive, as Corvindale\u2019s.</p><p>The wedding was to have been...dear heaven...tomorrow!</p><p>In the blur of Corvindale\u2019s disappearance and Maia\u2019s own abduction and return...she\u2019d lost track of time. She was supposed to have wed Alexander tomorrow. No wonder he wouldn\u2019t leave.</p><p>Maia bit her lip again, noticing that it was tender from all of the worried gnawing she\u2019d done on it...and perhaps from the rough kisses of earlier today. She closed her eyes, a flush of memory warming her. Pleasure stabbed her belly.</p><p>What was she going to do? She\u2019d already postponed the wedding when Corvindale disappeared, but now that he was back and so was she...they must decide on another date.</p><p>What am I going to do?</p><p>Cold truth settled over her. She had to marry Alexander.</p><p>She was ruined now, thanks to the earl. She could even be carrying his child.</p><p>That thought turned her alternately hot and then cold again. It was followed by rage that Corvindale meant to pay her off by settling a dowry on her for her wedding, after he\u2019d ruined her. To pay for the child, if there was one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A child that would be passed off as Alexander\u2019s.</p><p>Nothing need change.</p><p>How dare he say such a thing? Perhaps for him nothing had changed, but for her? Everything. Everything had changed.</p> <p>She\u2019d done something outside of foolish, but...she\u2019d do it again. There\u2019d been no way she could have stopped, pulled back. She wanted him, needed him in that way.</p><p>What they\u2019d shared had been... She shivered, heat unfurling in her again. It had been like her dreams. But better.</p><p>Real.</p><p>Maia\u2019s thoughts sharpened, settled, stopped. Her heart paused, her breathing stilled. Her dreams. Of making love to a vampire.</p><p>It had been him. Corvindale.</p> <p>In her dreams, all along, it had been Corvindale.</p><p>She\u2019d been dreaming about him, ever since she moved into his house. And that last dream, the one that had frightened her, that had been filled with darkness and pain and red...that had been while he\u2019d been captured by Lerina.</p><p>Was she somehow connected to him? Through their dreams? Had she dreamed what he experienced? Or what he...dreamed?</p><p>She shook her head, shivering. The Sight works in mysterious ways.</p><p>Maia wished suddenly that Granny Grapes was still here, so she could ask her about dreams and connections. She closed her eyes and pursed her lips. There were other problems at hand.</p><p>Like what she\u2019d done today, with Corvindale, was foolish. She could ruin herself, ruin her family. Hurt Alexander.</p> <p>But...despite the way he\u2019d handled it, the abhorrent, cold, earlish way...she would have done it again. She would do it again. It had been right despite the fact that everything about it seemed wrong.</p><p>The water had turned cold, and her hands and feet wrinkled like a silk gown left on the ground. And still Maia didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Logic, propriety, everything she\u2019d ever learned told her she must marry Alexander. There was truly no good reason not to, and every reason to do so.</p><p>A broken engagement would cause a great scandal, particularly so close to the wedding. One of them must take the blame for it, and it would either be Maia\u2014who would be ruined\u2014or Alexander, who would be made a fool. She didn\u2019t wish either consequence, but certainly she didn\u2019t wish to make Alexander a cuckold nor a scapegoat, for that would be the result if she broke the engagement.</p><p>And if he made the announcement, which would be his right in this instance, Maia would be branded a loose woman. Her reputation would be ruined and she would never marry, and quite likely never be admitted into polite society again.</p><p>If she were with child, it would be even worse.</p><p>Nausea flooded her. How could something that had been so beautiful, that had felt so deeply right have such dreadful consequences?</p><p>She shook her head. Marrying Alexander wouldn\u2019t be so bad.</p> <p>It would be good, in fact. It would be nice and it would be the right thing to do.</p><p>She rose from the tub. It was time to go down and see him.</p><p>Dimitri opened his eyes to find the point of a stake resting upon his chest.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he said, looking up into the dark, furious face of Chas Woodmore. He closed his eyes against the dimly lit, spinning room and waited. Hoped. Put me out of this misery.</p><p>The pressure moved away from his torso. \u201cOpen your bloody eyes, Dimitri. I want to hear it from you.\u201d</p><p>He forced his eyes open again, and the room tilted violently. He closed them, tasting the blood whiskey still clinging to his lips and tongue, smelling it on his hands and from the empty bottle on the desk in front of him. A bleary glance told him dawn threatened, but that the world was still silent with night. He was in his study, which was good, because that was the last thing he remembered. Settling into place with two\u2014perhaps three\u2014bottles of the stuff. Just as the sun went down. Tuning out the sounds, the scents, the memories, the darkness.</p><p>It was two days after the Incident at Rubey\u2019s.</p><p>Two days after everything had changed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to my sister?\u201d Chas said. His voice was slick with anger and dark with loathing. He stood across the desk from Dimitri, a mere arm\u2019s length away. \u201cI trusted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no explanation for what occurred. You have every right to finish things now.\u201d Dimitri pulled his waistcoat helpfully away from his shirt. \u201cI won\u2019t fight you, Chas. I won\u2019t even ask you to make it quick. Just bloody well do it. It\u2019s a long time coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevil take it, have you had the whole bottle tonight?\u201d There was a clink as Woodmore picked it up as if to check its contents.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dimitri drawled. \u201cTwo.\u201d His eyes sank closed. Oblivion was lovely.</p><p>More clinking and the rustle of books and papers. \u201cWhat in the devil are you doing, Corvindale?\u201d Chas demanded.</p><p>\u201cWaiting. What the damned hell is taking you so long? You\u2019re never this slow.\u201d His eyes remained closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to Maia?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri purposely picked the most vulgar of words. \u201cI fucked her. I violated her. I bloody fed on her.\u201d He tried to focus. \u201cBut she\u2019s going to marry Bradington. No one will know. And you\u2019re going to stake me. Anytime now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she\u2019s with child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pray she is not. It\u2019s highly unlikely.\u201d But, oh, the Fates, it was possible.</p><p>\u201cBut if she is...then Lucifer could claim him.\u201d</p><p>A wave of nausea surged and Dimitri swallowed hard. As if the thought hadn\u2019t been swirling around and around in his whiskey-fogged brain, sloshing along in his upset belly. Threatening him for days, threading through his dreams. Silence.</p><p>Dimitri opened his eyes and found Chas looking at him. Pity seemed to have replaced pure loathing, although the hard, dark fury was still there. What the hell was he waiting for? Dimitri wouldn\u2019t have waited. He\u2019d have driven the stake home long before now. \u201cIt was Rubey who told me,\u201d Woodmore said, answering a question Dimitri hadn\u2019t cared to ask. \u201cNot Maia. She\u2019s said nothing. To anyone.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri adjusted his position in the chair and blinked. Apparently they were going to have a civil conversation before the man killed him. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a damned thing I can do to change it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s done. I\u2019ve settled a dowry on her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need a bloody damned dowry from you,\u201d</p><p>Chas said. \u201cAnd there certainly isn\u2019t anything you can do.</p><p>If you were a mortal, I\u2019d have you at the altar tomorrow because I know at least you\u2019d never hurt her. At any rate, I don\u2019t want you to touch her again.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri gave a bitter laugh. \u201cThere is no chance of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. The sad thing is, I believe you, Dimitri.\u201d Chas shoved the stake back into his inside pocket. \u201cI came for another reason, besides to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t killed me,\u201d Dimitri said flatly. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t think I will. It\u2019s clear killing\u2019s too easy a way out for you, Corvindale. Aside of that, I might be in need of you in the future. You\u2019ll owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to visit Sonia, in Scotland. I\u2019m going to see if she\u2019ll use her Sight to tell me about Moldavi so we can stop him for good. Narcise won\u2019t be free until he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri felt a stirring of interest. \u201cSonia has a different skill than Angelica. She might do it. She might be of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she won\u2019t use it,\u201d Chas said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to convince her that it\u2019s worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri sat up, gave his head a little shake to rid himself of the fogginess. \u201cNarcise is going with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Woodmore looked at him, seemed ready to say something, then stopped. \u201cWe leave in the morning. I might not be back for Maia\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s wedding. He\u2019d been afraid, initially, that something would have happened to cancel it altogether, but Dimitri knew it had been rescheduled for two weeks from now. Not soon enough. But at least it was going forward. At least soon she would be out of his hands. Out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s part of what you owe me, Corvindale. You can deliver the news...and take my place, walking her down the aisle. Giving her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to blasted Scotland, you stay here,\u201d Dimitri suggested.</p><p>Chas\u2019s response was a laugh as bitter as Dimitri\u2019s. \u201cNo, you\u2019ll stay here and make certain my sister is wed without a bloody damned hint of scandal. If you have to force Bradington down the aisle, if you have to enthrall all of the ton, you make certain it happens. That it\u2019s the happiest day of her life, damn you. You owe me, Corvindale. You broke my trust, you put your damned vampire hands on my sister when she was under your care. And your fangs. You\u2019re worse than Voss. You damned well owe me. If we didn\u2019t have a history, if I didn\u2019t owe you, you would be dead by now.\u201d</p><p>No one had ever spoken to Dimitri in that way and lived to tell about it. But this time, he allowed it. Because Chas had the right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it. Gladly,\u201d he added. He couldn\u2019t wait to wash his hands of Maia Woodmore.</p><p>17</p><p>THE LION IS BEARDED IN HIS DEN</p><p>Maia sat up, suddenly wide-awake.</p><p>She\u2019d been dreaming. Or perhaps she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>The world was dark, for there was a new moon tonight and the stars were cloaked in clouds and fog. She could barely discern the shapes of her dressing table and the chair in the corner.</p><p>Lingering in her mind was a memory...a dream or reality, she wasn\u2019t certain... She was in a chamber furnished with great luxury. There were men there, and a woman who was tall and broad and sported a bit of a mustache. Although the place was richly appointed, Maia felt wrong. It was wrong.</p><p>Horrible and evil.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to clear her mind, trying to focus. Hands grabbing at her, lascivious smiles, the clink of glasses as drinks were poured...Mr. Virgil was there. Smiling. Laughing heartily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart stopped. Mr. Virgil.</p><p>Maia got out of bed as if to escape the images, her heart pounding. She didn\u2019t like this. She didn\u2019t like this at all, the feelings crawling over her. The ugliness, dark memories that began to pour into her mind.</p><p>And then something changed in the memory...there was a burst of energy, something dark and fast. Glowing red eyes. Lashing out, violence, and suddenly she was caught up in it...</p><p>And then she was safe. Away from it. In a carriage.</p> <p>With Corvindale.</p><p>Maia stood there in her dark chamber, breathing hard. Her stomach hurt, her hair plastered to her neck and throat. Her face was stark, and as white as her night rail, reflecting back from the mirror in the dim light.</p><p>She needed answers.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, there is an individual without who wishes to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri looked up from the bloody damned book Wayren had foisted upon him. Anything for an excuse to leave off reading about the beauty and her beastly host in a conveniently Gothic castle.</p> <p>The fact that it was past midnight and someone had come calling bothered him not one bit, nor would it be a surprise to his butler Crewston. There was just as much activity at Blackmont Hall once the sun set as there was during the daylight hours.</p><p>Such was the lifestyle of a Dracule.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d he asked, rising from his desk.</p><p>\u201cIt is a female individual,\u201d Crewston explained. \u201cShe waits in a carriage. She asked that I give you this.\u201d He offered a handkerchief.</p><p>But Dimitri didn\u2019t need to take the scrap of fabric; he could scent her the moment his butler waved it. Lerina.</p><p>His flash of rage was instantly banked. She wouldn\u2019t trick him again, and he had no desire to waste any thought or energy on her. Yet, he was curious as to why she would chance encountering him again.</p> <p>Instead of responding to Crewston, he pulled on his coat and slipped a slender wooden stake into the pocket. He suspected she was here on a peacemaking visit, but naturally there was no trusting the woman.</p><p>Outside in the late-summer heat, Dimitri sniffed the air as he walked down the three steps. Her carriage had been drawn up in the half-circle drive, only a few paces from the stairs. The air was humid and heavy with the perfume of mature roses and lilies, underscored by London\u2019s constant tinge of waste and garbage. The vehicle\u2019s door opened as he stepped down to the ground, but he went no farther.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe, my dear Dimitri,\u201d she said, peering out from the opening. \u201cNot a ruby in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me if I don\u2019t trust your word on that,\u201d Dimitri replied. \u201cI cannot imagine what you think you might have to talk to me about, but you must come out if you wish to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a misunderstanding, Dimitri darling,\u201d Lerina said as she emerged gracefully from the carriage, her hair and skirts tumbling prettily about her.</p><p>He paused, waiting to see if he sensed the proximity of a ruby or two. Or a dozen. He didn\u2019t, and he hadn\u2019t expected to. Nor did he scent anyone else in the area, other than her driver.</p><p>Lerina might not be the brightest of people, but she apparently had a great sense of self-preservation. And she knew him well\u2014that, unless provoked, he wouldn\u2019t harm her.</p><p>\u201cIf that episode was a misunderstanding, I cannot imagine what you think the incident in Vienna was. A picnic? Let\u2019s not play games, Lerina. You tried to abduct me, you failed and now you are here...for what reason, precisely? You must know you won\u2019t have the advantage of tricking me again.\u201d</p> <p>She pouted. \u201cBut I\u2019m still in love with you, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a unique way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a fool. I always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow gratifying to know that nothing has changed.\u201d</p><p>Her face tightened, losing that flirtatious expression for the first time since she\u2019d arrived. \u201cI had to take the chance to see you alone. The others who were with me are Cezar\u2019s makes. If they realized I was here...\u201d</p><p>Dimitri was shaking his head. \u201cNo. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re a bit late on that, too.</p><p>Now what do you wa\u2014\u201d</p><p>A noise behind him had him turning. Bloody damned Lucifer\u2019s soul.</p><p>\u201cMiss Woodmore,\u201d he said, with what he deemed great control. Great, immense, precise control.</p><p>She ducked her head and shoulders back inside the open window, where she quite probably had been eavesdropping, and seconds later the front door opened. There she stood, the proper Miss Woodmore, wearing nothing but a flimsy night rail. Her thick hair poured over her shoulders in dark waves, glinting gold in the weak circle of illumination from the streetlamp.</p><p>Dimitri paused for a moment to thank the Fates there was no moonlight tonight to shine through the fabric as he struggled to keep his expression blank. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d stepped onto the top step and he noticed a slender implement in her hand, half hidden behind her and by the folds of her skirt. A stake? Did she mean to protect him? A wave of annoyance and fury battled with some other emotion that he dared not define. Addled woman.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Throckmullins,\u201d Miss Woodmore said as easily as if she\u2019d just arrived for tea. \u201cI should not have expected a social call from you, after our last meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back into the house, Miss Woodmore,\u201d Dimitri told her, glancing at Lerina. To his dismay, her face was rapt with attention.</p><p>\u201cI was just leaving,\u201d Lerina said to the new arrival. Her eyes narrowed and her smile seemed forced. It was a cunning expression that didn\u2019t bode well, along with a spark of something dark. \u201cI have everything that I came for.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri turned back toward Miss Woodmore, turning his furious glare on her. She ignored him and he stepped onto the lower stair in an effort to draw her attention to him, and away from Lerina. If the chit would see how angry he was, she\u2019d listen and go back inside. \u201cMiss Woodmore, you will catch your death of cold out here. Dressed in that,\u201d he added flatly, studiously ignoring the way one side of her bodice had slipped, revealing the curve of a delicious collarbone.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not the least bit of a chill out here,\u201d she replied. The fact that her nipples were outlined by the light fabric put her statement into question.</p><p>\u201cMiss Woodmore,\u201d he said in a low voice, his teeth clenched. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing with that, but your interference is unnecessary. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>He heard rustling behind him, then a faint creak. When he turned, it was to see Lerina\u2019s carriage door closing behind her. The vehicle lurched into motion and he watched it drive away, an unpleasant prickle running down his spine mingling with the throb from his Mark.</p><p>\u201cIn the house,\u201d he said, brushing past Miss Woodmore to open the door, wondering where in the damned bloody hell Crewston was, and what he was thinking, allowing her to come out dressed as she was.</p><p>He was only slightly mollified when his ward stepped into the house without further argument. Just then Iliana came rushing around the corner, long braid flying, stake in hand. Her bare feet slapped to a halt and she looked at Dimitri.</p><p>At once he realized what had happened and it was all he could do to keep from shouting at Miss Woodmore that he didn\u2019t need to be bloody damn protected. Lucifer\u2019s black soul, what had possessed her to think so?</p><p>Iliana took one look at his face and pivoted away, prudently heading back from whence she\u2019d come.</p><p>This left Dimitri alone with his ward, for apparently, Crewston had other things to do. Or, more likely, he was lurking somewhere, had seen the fury on his master\u2019s face and decided to remain out of eyesight.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with you, Corvindale,\u201d Miss Woodmore said coolly. She was still holding the stake.</p><p>Here, inside the house, he wasn\u2019t quite as fortunate. For the lamps lighting the front hall and the small sconce on the corridor provided a spill of soft, warm illumination around, and through, her night rail.</p><p>Before he could respond, she turned and flounced down the corridor to his sanctuary. His study. Dimitri looked away, grinding his teeth as he followed her\u2014he followed her\u2014into his den. He had a few things he should say to her, as well.</p><p>But when he came into the chamber and closed the door behind him, Dimitri had a sudden attack of wariness. His palms actually began to dampen. For the bloody Fates, he hadn\u2019t had sweaty palms since he was standing for his first Latin exam at Cambridge.</p><p>What was it about this woman who needled him to no end?</p><p>\u201cIncidentally, you were wrong, Corvindale,\u201d she was saying. She\u2019d positioned herself at the far end of the room, where two chairs faced the center with a small table between them. The window whose curtains she had the temerity to open every bloody time she came in was next to one of the seats. The chamber was suffused with her scent, that of slumber and spice and fresh cotton and whatever she used to clean her hair.</p><p>He forced himself to wander casually to the cabinet where he kept his French brandy and Scotch whiskey. Since the night last week when he\u2019d downed two full bottles of blood whiskey, he hadn\u2019t indulged. But tonight he thought he might be able to justify at least a finger or two of the best vintage, especially since he\u2019d made certain he hadn\u2019t been face-to-face with her since the events at Rubey\u2019s. He hadn\u2019t seen more than the flutter of her hem around a corner since he\u2019d tucked her into the carriage for the ride home.</p><p>\u201cI? Wrong?\u201d He sipped the golden liquid and realized his heart was slamming in his chest. His insides were tight. What in the bloody damned hell was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cYou said she\u2019d tried to abduct you and failed. That isn\u2019t precisely true, is it? Mrs. Throckmullins\u2014Lerina\u2014did succeed in abducting you. And if I hadn\u2019t shown up, who knows what would have happened?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened over the glass. What did she want, honors and an audience at court in appreciation? \u201cAs I understand it, you didn\u2019t exactly show up. You were abducted, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is quite true,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I managed to free myself. Although I do understand there were extenuating circumstances on your part.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dimitri struggled to keep his voice steady. \u201cIndeed. I sup pose I have been remiss in expressing my gratitude for your...assistance.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, forcing those words out didn\u2019t have the debilitating affect he\u2019d expected for himself. Instead, when he saw the flash of surprise and the hint of rose flushing her cheeks, he felt rather...pleased. He took another generous taste of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her voice soft and without that edge so often there. \u201cWe were...we worked together.\u201d</p> <p>He looked aside, trying to regain the annoyance and frustration that had begun to slip away. \u201cWhat did you think you were doing tonight, Miss Woodmore? Did you really believe you and that little stake would have had a chance against Lerina if she had been a threat?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d begun to straighten a pile of books on one of the tables. \u201cIn my mind,\u201d she said, pulling out a French translation of The Iliad and placing it atop its counterpart, The Odyssey, \u201cit never hurts to be prepared. One never knows when one might be caught unawares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly.</p><p>She looked up at him and their eyes met. And held. Something hurt, in his chest, something sharp and hot as if he\u2019d been stabbed. Or staked. Yet, while unexpected, it wasn\u2019t wholly unpleasant.</p><p>Her lips twitched, that full, luscious upper one curving into a hint of a smile. \u201cIs it possible you\u2019re learning, Corvindale? That you aren\u2019t always right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want, Maia?\u201d He forced steel into his voice, forced his expression into stone. His heart rammed hard inside.</p><p>Her face changed, the affection fleeing. \u201cThat night with Mr. Virgil,\u201d she said, \u201cthe Incident...I had a dream about it tonight. About things I don\u2019t remember happening. The whole night, almost, is blank in my mind.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri raised a brow. \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual for a traumatic situation, Miss Woodmore. People often forget what happened to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and sometimes with a bit of help from a vampire and his thrall. Is that what happened? Did you alter my memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m capable of such a thing?\u201d he prevaricated. His glass was empty and he put it on the cabinet. He had a feeling he was going to need all of his faculties. \u201cAnd if so, why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. You know you are. You\u2019ve attempted it.</p> <p>You said I\u2019ve become immune to your thrall. Did you manage to do it that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was best that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>What didn\u2019t happen? Dimitri drew in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYour Mr. Virgil wasn\u2019t taking you to Gretna Green for your elopement. He was taking you to an establishment in Haymarket that...well, Miss Woodmore, if you found your self offended by Rubey\u2019s place, you would have been beyond frightened at this place. A marketplace of sorts for young, virginal women. You wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave.\u201d</p><p>He watched the disbelief and then horror filter over her delicate features. She\u2019d stopped rearranging his books and now stood as if frozen. \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed you when I recognized you. Of course, your brother had pointed you and your sister out to me in the past.\u201d And the impression she\u2019d made on Dimitri had been strong and unforgettable, even then. Even from a distance.</p><p>Especially when he passed by and breathed in the perfume that was her. \u201cI was able to extricate you from the woman who owned the...establishment...with little fanfare. Then I saw that you were taken safely home in a hack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she have a mustache?\u201d she whispered, and he nodded in response. \u201cI dreamed of her.\u201d</p><p>The hypnotism was weakening; which was no surprise, as he\u2019d been unable to inflict it upon her recently. Something had happened since that night in Haymarket that made her immune to his thrall. His thrall. He felt a little uncomfortable niggle in the back of his mind when he recalled Voss telling him that he couldn\u2019t enthrall Angelica, either. Was it something about the Woodmore sisters that made them indifferent to a Draculian thrall?</p><p>But no, for Lerina had managed to ensnare Maia when they were trapped. He didn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>Maia was talking slowly, pulling things out of her memory. \u201cI have a recollection...in the hack. We...you were there. You had a cut on your cheek, and one on your hand\u2014I remember now. You weren\u2019t wearing gloves.\u201d</p><p>He held back a snort. \u201cEven in the midst of such a harrowing experience, whilst you were clothed in boy breeches and a cap, you commented on my lack of gloves with your nose in the air. And a little sniff of disdain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d She gave that same little sniff, lifting her pert nose.</p><p>He found himself hardly able to keep a smile in check and raised his brow instead.</p><p>\u201cI...we were discussing herbal poultices for your cuts,\u201d she said slowly, as if unraveling the memory like a thread. \u201cYou were promoting the benefits of dried woad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were under the impression that Dioscorides\u2019s recipe for slippery elm and comfrey was the best treatment. I confess, I was amazed to learn that you were not only familiar with his writings, but that you\u2019d read them in their native Greek. And so I commenced with a discussion to see if it was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, the corners of her mouth tipping up a bit again, \u201cwere singing the praises of John Gerard, simply because he was a native Englishman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside of the fact that he was a friend of my father\u2019s, the benefit of having a medicinal written only about plants native to the local soil, my dear Miss Woodmore, is much more efficacious than one written by an ancient. There is always the problem of translation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if one does the translation oneself,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAs I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was precisely what you said that evening.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met and he saw the clarity back in hers. She remembered it all now.</p><p>He\u2019d never forgotten it.</p><p>He\u2019d almost kissed her that night. Secure in the fact that he could mottle her mind and twist her memory, he\u2019d nearly given in to the sudden, inexplicable urge. And now he was thankful, so very thankful, that he hadn\u2019t done so.</p><p>Because he would never be able to explain that.</p><p>All at once, a rush of desire flooded him. He stood halfway across the long chamber from her, and all he could think about was what was beneath that loose, flimsy night rail.</p><p>Dimitri turned away, his fingers trembling, his gums suddenly tight and swelling. There was an odd ache in his middle.</p><p>\u201cHas it occurred to you,\u201d she said suddenly, \u201cthat I might be with child?\u201d</p><p>Had it occurred to him? Oh, yes, oh, yes, indeed. By the Fates, by God, by Luce\u2019s black heart, it had occurred to him.</p><p>\u201cI pray you are not,\u201d he managed to say. He\u2019d been so careful over the years, for any child he sired could also be bound to Lucifer because of the agreement Vlad Tepes had made with the devil. It was inconceivable that he would visit such a burden on his child. It was a good thing he\u2019d never had a great sexual appetite.</p><p>He looked away from Maia. Until now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Relief rushed over him so strongly he nearly sighed aloud.</p><p>Thank God, thank God. \u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t marry Alexander until I knew for certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain he\u2019ll appreciate that.\u201d The words came from between stiff lips. \u201cAre you finished, Miss Woodmore? I have things to attend to.\u201d He gestured vaguely to his desk.</p><p>She straightened, pulling her shoulders back and outlining her breasts even more readily. Dimitri studied his hand. His fingers weren\u2019t quite steady.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you for your time,\u201d she said. There was more than a bit of sarcasm in her tone, but he ignored it.</p><p>He must ignore her as she walked past him toward the door, taking with her that thick, sweet-smelling hair, those delicate feet and slender wrists, those full, erotic lips.</p><p>\u201cLa Belle et la B\u00eate?\u201d she asked, pausing at his desk.</p><p>Leave. By all that is holy, by all that is damned, please leave.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a French fairy tale,\u201d he said, forcing boredom into his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m familiar with it. This version, in fact.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cHow do you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t finished it yet,\u201d he growled. \u201cWhich I might perhaps be able to do if you\u2019d leave me be.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, quite close now as she skirted the desk, and he could hardly meet her eyes. He struggled to keep his breathing steady, to keep the pounding of his heart inaudible as it reverberated his torso. His fangs threatened and he pressed his lips together because all he could think of was how close she was. How much he wanted to touch her.</p><p>And of course, how he could not. Ever. Again.</p><p>To slide his hands over that ivory skin, to gather her against him and bury his face in her hair, to cover that impudent mouth that alternately argued and smiled and lectured and challenged.</p><p>He turned his attention to the ever-present throbbing on his shoulder, focusing on the pain there. It didn\u2019t seem to be as harsh as it used to be...or perhaps he was becoming even more inured to it.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, Corvindale?\u201d she asked. Her night rail billowed out enough that it nearly brushed the tops of his boots. Her essence filled his nose.</p><p>\u201cOther than the fact that you\u2019re disturbing my studies, yes, of course,\u201d he replied and managed to step back without appearing to retreat.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d she said. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She left.</p><p>Maia fled to her chamber.</p><p>Her stomach was in an upheaval, swirling and pitching like a ship in a storm.</p><p>She\u2019d thought for a moment that he was going to...do something. Reach for her. Touch her. Ask her to stay.</p><p>Tell her not to marry Alexander.</p><p>But he\u2019d been the same cold, harsh Corvindale. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sat on her bed. Perhaps not quite the same. There had been those moments of softness. She hadn\u2019t imagined them.</p><p>Had she?</p><p>Flopping back onto her bed, she looked up into the darkness, misery welling up inside her. Emptiness filled her chest, making it hollow and cold.</p> <p>She closed her eyes at the sting of tears. Foolish, addled woman.</p><p>That was she. Foolish. Addled. In love with a cold, hard man. The wrong man.</p><p>Foolish...</p><p>Maia must have slept, for she dreamed.</p><p>He was there in her dreams again, but this time she recognized him. The wide, strong hands, the dark hair, the smooth sensual brush of lips, the flash of fangs as they slid easily into her shoulder.</p> <p>For the second time that night, she woke suddenly, heart pounding, breathless.</p><p>Her dreams were so real. Her body was damp and alive, throbbing and tight...but she was alone.</p><p>Maia sat up. All at once she remembered the dream she\u2019d had when Corvindale was gone, the dark, frightening one. The dream that must have been...could it have been...what he was experiencing? At the hands of Mrs. Throckmullins?</p><p>Did that mean that...</p><p>She swallowed hard, heat rushing through her. Could that mean that, just now, he was dreaming the same thing that she had been?</p><p>Heart thumping madly, hardly realizing what she was doing, Maia slid off the high bed to the floor. She glanced at the window to see a faint glow in the distance, out over the rooftops. Dawn was near. Her feet made no noise on the wood planks as she went to the door and opened it.</p> <p>If he were dreaming what she was dreaming...</p><p>Her fingers closed around the doorknob and she hesitated. Her knees trembled. She knew what she wanted to do. What she was about to do...but would it make any difference? Would it not only cause deeper problems?</p><p>But as she stood there in the shadows, half in the corridor, half in her chamber, she realized that she stood on a different threshold.</p><p>If she went back to bed, she would remain Maia Woodmore, soon to be Mrs. Bradington, peer of the ton, the epitome of propriety and gentility. She\u2019d marry Alexander and they would be happy together, they would have children, God willing, and she would have a very even, calm, proper life. And she would never forget the Earl of Corvindale.</p><p>And if she didn\u2019t go back to bed... Her insides filled with butterflies, and for a moment she almost swooned with fear and apprehension...and hope.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t go back to bed...anything could happen.</p><p>Good or bad.</p><p>Loving or hurtful.</p> <p>Maia closed her eyes, struggled and made her decision, closing the door softly.</p><p>18</p><p>WHEREIN ALL IS LAID BARE</p><p>Dimitri woke to find himself hard, hot, damp and tangled in the bedcovers. His fangs were fully extended, his body swollen with need. The Mark on his shoulder shuttled pain through his limbs, but even that deep agony wasn\u2019t enough to chase the potent dreams from his thoughts.</p><p>All at once, he realized his chamber door was ajar. Opening. That was what had awakened him from the dream.</p><p>He smelled her.</p><p>Satan\u2019s stones. Dimitri froze, holding his breath, pulling himself out of the sleek, hot dream with great effort.</p><p>He dared not move. He could hardly think as she slipped into the chamber and closed the door behind her. His heart pounded, filling his ears, and in his mind he kept thinking, no, no, no, no.</p><p>Yet his body raged and beckoned.</p><p>If it had been anyone else disturbing him, he could have bellowed and ordered them out. Or even leaped from the bed to show them the door.</p><p>But he was paralyzed.</p><p>She stopped next to the bed, and he looked up at her in the dark, able to see the details of her face, even the curl of a lock of hair over the white night rail.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he managed to say. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Get out.</p><p>Her eyes found his in the dim light. He saw her draw in a deep breath and bite her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m not certain,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThen leave. Now.\u201d His breathing had become unsteady and he gripped the bedcoverings, curling his fingers into them, forcing his body to remain still. Like stone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call off the wedding.\u201d She was close enough that her gown brushed the side of his bed. His hand, wrapped in a sheet, rested on the edge right next to it.</p><p>He forced himself to remain rigid. Tight.</p><p>\u201cThat would be outside of foolish,\u201d he said, his voice harsh and grating even to his own ears. \u201cMaia. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said, shifting. The warm cotton gown brushed the back of his wrist and Dimitri\u2019s fingers released the crumpled bedcoverings all on their own.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He forced an edge of disdain into his tone. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as if to clear it, her eyes steady on him, as if to somehow read the lie there, even in the dark.</p><p>And then she touched him. Her fingers, settling gently on his bare wrist next to the edge of the mattress, released him from his paralysis. He was done.</p><p>His arm lurched, moving before his conscious thought, and his hand whipped out, dragging her onto the bed. His other hand moved around to slide fingers into her hair, guiding her lush warmth down onto him. Yes.</p><p>Maia didn\u2019t pull back, didn\u2019t resist. If she had, he\u2019d have released her immediately. But, foolishly, she came willingly, sliding onto the bed, her knees pinning her blousy night rail to the mattress before she collapsed next to him, tangled in the soft cotton.</p><p>Dimitri was aware of a rushing sound in his ears, of a warning voice in his head, but it was too late. He had her. In his arms, wrapping Maia in the warmth of his body and the tangled bedclothes, their flesh separated only by a flimsy gown. Wild need surged through him, and he ignored all of the reasons he should send her away.</p><p>Taking care not to cut her with his fangs, he covered her mouth with his, drinking desperately from the corners of her lips, sliding over and across them, nibbling and sucking as she shifted against him, her mouth hot and teasing in a slick, sensual kiss, her breasts rounding against his chest.</p><p>He gathered her close, imprinting her body against his, capturing her against him with one bent leg and his hands, sliding along her slender back, pulling her onto him, into him, close. She burned him.</p><p>His breathing was out of control, his body tight and throbbing, his fangs jutting so far that his mouth hurt.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he managed to say, focusing on the sudden sharp pain from his Mark. Ah, that was it. If the pain became worse, then Luce was unhappy with his actions. And right now, now that he\u2019d stopped, now that he was set to do the right thing, to send her away, the pain was white-hot, blasting and searing down his side and around by his left hip. An incentive for him to change his mind. \u201cThis is your last chance. Leave now.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps her eyes had adjusted to the dim light, for she focused on him, met his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless you truly do not want me.\u201d</p><p>Even then, he couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t send her away.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said in a harsh voice, horribly aware that his Mark eased. That Lucifer approved. \u201cI will give you nothing, Maia. Do you understand? This is nothing more than me, taking what you offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that not how it\u2019s always been?\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYou must wed Bradington,\u201d he said, grasping the front of her gown as he twisted around, shoving her back onto the bed, curving over her, pinning her down with the weight of his hips. \u201cI can give you nothing else,\u201d he said again. \u201cNothing. And wedding him will save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make no promises,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cNor do I.\u201d And, his patience gone, his goodwill trampled, he shoved his conscience away. She\u2019d come to him. He\u2019d warned her off. He grabbed her gown with his other hand and yanked, renting it down the middle with a loud, violent tear that made her slender body jerk.</p><p>With a little more care, but no lesser intent, he whipped the cloth away and bent to her again, covering her mouth with his. She reached up and slid her arms around him, pulling him down so that they were skin to skin, her soft, pale and silky curves rising up into his hard, hirsute body. So warm. Her long hair caught beneath them, and he tugged it away, threading his fingers in and around it.</p><p>He buried his face in her neck, tasting the hot, sensitive skin there, his lips tracing the curve of her shoulder as he struggled to keep from sinking his fangs deep. The need pounded in him, in his swollen gums and thrusting teeth, through his veins, in his cock, tight and raging against her thigh. Maia shuddered and sighed as he sucked hard on the delicate rise of her shoulder, still fighting to keep from sinking deep and drinking of her.</p><p>Dimitri moved to her breast, covering the taut rise of nipple with his mouth, sliding his tongue around the sensitive little tip. She dug her fingers into his hair, arching closer as he licked and gently sucked, his fangs gently surrounding the areola, brushing her skin with their tips. One little nick... She exuded heat, and the musky, sweet scent of desire filled his nostrils as she writhed and moaned against him.</p><p>He slid his hand down between her legs, finding her slick and swollen. She shifted against him, lifting up into his palm, and he pressed down into her, trembling a little at her passionate response. Sliding a finger inside, into the tight heat, Dimitri shifted as he teased and slid in and out and around, releasing her lush musky scent, turning his vision red and cloudy. Desire pounded in him and his gums throbbed, his cock shifting insistently next to her. Maia gasped something, reaching out blindly, her hands pulling at his shoulder, drawing him close.</p><p>He could wait no longer. Dimitri moved quickly and decisively, rising back up to rear over her slender white body and sliding his leg between hers. She curled her fingers around his shoulders, pulling him down as he fitted himself inside her. Maia\u2019s gasp was swallowed by the roaring in his ears as he slid in, deep, filling. His muscles shuddered with the effort of control...she was sleek and tight and he found his face buried once again in her throat as he moved rhythmically: away, then closer, away...closer. Hot, damp, smelling of her, that sensitive, erotic spot...</p><p>It was too much to resist. His fangs brushed her skin and as he slammed deep between her legs, he bit into the warm, silky skin at the juncture of neck and shoulder, the points of his teeth sliding in with ease. She jolted and gave a soft cry, shuddering, but he was too intent, and he held her steady as the warm flow of lifeblood rushed into his mouth. The pleasure was heavy, the taste of rich, lush earth and life laced with Maia\u2019s own particular essence, filling his senses, over his tongue, down into his body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no holding back, no waiting. His world turned into a frenzy of pleasure, rising uncontrollably. His veins sang, swelled, his body slid against hers. Dimitri was vaguely aware of her nails scoring into his back, her head twisting and rolling on the pillow as he drank, as he thrust in and out, driving closer and longer until he could no longer think.</p><p>The explosion, when it came, was white-hot and red, draining him of awareness. He barely remembered to pull free of that hot, sleek place just before his seed spilled, twisting his hips away as he released her neck. Heavy, warm blood still in his mouth, he gave a soft groan of release as he pulsed and throbbed, damp and warm. He swallowed the last bit and closed his eyes.</p><p>Maia gave a soft whimper next to him, bringing him back from the easy slide into darkness, and he rose up to look over her. Her eyes were dark in a pale face, her lips parted, her breathing unsteady. She didn\u2019t seem frightened or overset by his roughness. She beckoned.</p> <p>Dimitri bent to her shoulder and tasted the leaking blood with his lips and tongue, gently licking it away, swirling the last bit into his mouth to stop the bleeding. At the same time, he reached down between them to slide over her quim, full and damp and still ready for him.</p><p>With a little nibble of apology along the tendon in her neck, he found the tiny core and as he shifted to cover her mouth, he slipped and stroked, luring her over into the same vortex of pleasure he\u2019d recently enjoyed. His mouth stifled her soft cry of release and he felt her shudder against him.</p><p>Dimitri finished the kiss with a soft little nibble on that top, full lip, then collapsed onto his back, still wrapped in sheets and legs and her long hair.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long they lay there, tangled and close, for he slipped into something between sleep and wakefulness, comforted by the slight, warm figure next to him, the sensuous smells of their coupling and her.</p><p>Something distant must have awakened Dimitri, for it drew him from that half slumber and into the wakefulness of reality. The first thing he saw was a blood streak on the sheets, and then the small marks on her slender, ivory neck. The scent of coitus stained his fingers and the bedcoverings, the little flutter behind her eyelids told him she was dreaming.</p> <p>Maia was curled up amid white sheets and his dark body, her hair cascading over the bedsheets and pillows. A soft, delicate snore was coming from her parted lips. Something started to turn inside him, rolling and opening, and he stopped it.</p><p>He stopped it cold, pulling that brick wall back around to bar those soft feelings.</p><p>Oh, what he\u2019d done. Dimitri closed his eyes as uncertainty and anger flooded him. After so many years of denial, he\u2019d succumbed easily and thoroughly in the past weeks. Bitterness tinged his mouth as his heart thumped an erratic, accusatory beat. He\u2019d warned her, yes, he\u2019d told her to leave, but he knew better.</p><p>It was never that easy with a woman. Never that simple. And the tender, unfurling feelings in his belly were guilt and pleasure wrapped into one. Emotions that he must learn to do without.</p><p>He heard rapid footfalls coming down the corridor, and then there was an urgent knocking at the chamber door.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d The knock became more urgent.</p> <p>\u201cOne minute,\u201d he growled at the door.</p><p>\u201cPlease, my lord, it\u2019s an urgent matter!\u201d</p><p>Dimitri glanced down at Maia, who was now stirring. He clapped a hand over her mouth just as her eyes bolted open in shock and dismay.</p><p>He put a finger to his lips and then yanked the bedclothes up to cover her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he bellowed. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the elder Miss Woodmore,\u201d said Crewston, poking his head around the open door. A single shaft of daylight spilled into the dark chamber from behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s gone missing!\u201d</p><p>Dimitri felt her go rigid beneath the sheets. He pressed his hand down on top of her to keep her still, glad that Crewston was mortal and unable to scent the strong essence of coitus that lingered in the chamber. \u201cNonsense. She\u2019s likely gone for a walk or shopping this early in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, my lord, but her Mr. Bradington is below, claiming she agreed to walk with him this morning. Surely she wouldn\u2019t have left before he arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Bradington\u2014\u201d Dimitri barely managed to keep a snarl from his voice \u201c\u2014that she had an emergency with her wedding frock and had to visit the seamstress this morning, and that she will return shortly. And send him on his way, if you please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrewston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, my lord. But the younger Miss Woodmore is beside herself with fear that Miss Woodmore has been abducted again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvise Angelica that I am confident her elder sister will return shortly. And I don\u2019t wish to be bothered for any reason until she returns, or until after dinner. Whichever occurs first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Crewston withdrew, his disbelief and annoyance barely masked.</p><p>No sooner had the door clicked closed than Maia erupted from beneath the sheets, holding them to the front of her torso. She opened her mouth, likely to begin barraging him with questions or recriminations, and Dimitri decided to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and launch his own attack first.</p><p>\u201cAre you aware that you snore, Miss Woodmore?\u201d he asked in a mild voice.</p><p>She drew back, a glint of fierceness in her eyes, and closed her mouth. The sheets were a bunch against her chest, revealing only the barest curve of one shoulder. \u201cWhy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t bother me, but if you decide to share a bedchamber with Bradington, it might become a concern.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened and she replied in a low-pitched voice, \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Corvindale. Do you think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing? Trying to divert me, trying to anger me? Or hurt me so that I go running off to Alexander?\u201d</p><p>He closed his mouth and blinked. Her intelligence and foresight never failed to surprise him.</p><p>\u201cI know better than that, Corvindale. I know you better than you realize,\u201d she said, lowering her voice still further, watching him steadily. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve lost the power to hurt me like you might wish to, because I know why you do it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d become very still. \u201cIs that so?\u201d was all he trusted himself to say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just like the beast from that fairy tale, locked away, cold and angry and afraid to allow anyone close to you, or to divert you from your research. But you\u2019ve missed everything that\u2019s important. And this,\u201d she said, spreading her hand to encompass the events of the last night, \u201cis...was...a bit too close for you. I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Woodmore,\u201d he said, barely holding on to the fury he managed to dredge up, just able to keep the truth of her words from penetrating, \u201cyou have no idea of what you speak. The only thing I care about,\u201d he said, his lips and jaw tight, \u201cis freeing myself of this.\u201d</p><p>He turned sharply so that she could see the back of his left shoulder.</p><p>Maia\u2019s sudden intake of breath was audible and he felt her body still next to him. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri knew what she saw: the horrible Marking of the devil spreading down like black roots over his shoulder. When he\u2019d first awakened to find himself signed thus, the lines had been narrow, like fine cracks in shattered glass. But over the years of his abstinence, his disregard for Lucifer\u2019s will, the lines had grown thicker and darker as they welled with pain. Now they rose from his skin like slender black-red veins, writhing and twisting with agony, pounding and pulsing with his every defiance of the devil.</p><p>\u201cThis is the Mark of my covenant with Lucifer,\u201d he said, keeping his voice steely. \u201cI\u2019m damned, Maia, damned and tied to him, and because of that, I cannot\u2014I don\u2019t want\u2014anything or anyone in my life. I want to be left alone. I want to be free.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t taken her eyes from his shoulder, and when she reached to touch him, Dimitri moved away.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, taking control of his voice, changing it from the desperate tones of a moment ago to one matter-of-fact and calm, \u201cthis is what will happen. You\u2019re going to leave here, Maia, you\u2019re going to go to your chamber and dress and pretend you were on a walk and forgot your appointment with Bradington. And you\u2019re going to marry him as planned. And you\u2019re going to forget about all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that, my lord,\u201d she said, surprising him with the formal use of address.</p><p>\u201cYou must. There is nothing I can do for you, nor that I want to do. I\u2019ve allowed you to invade my house, my den and now my bedchamber\u2014\u201d she tensed at that comment, and, gratified that it had hit the mark, he went on \u201c\u2014but I\u2019m finished now. Lerina\u2019s visit last night has me concerned that she has some other plans. And I\u2019ve done everything I can to ensure that you wed Bradington without a hint of scandal. That is all I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth had tightened. \u201cI cannot do that, Corvindale. Did you not hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot, Corvindale,\u201d she interrupted in a stiff voice, \u201cbecause, much as I desire to leave your vile presence, I cannot walk from one end of your house to my chamber in the other dressed like this.\u201d She flung the bedcoverings away from her naked torso.</p><p>Lord. He caught his breath before he realized it, then looked away. But the image was burned into his brain, the delicate shape of her body, the shadow of her collarbones, the high handfuls of breasts tipped with tight pink nipples, the hollow of her waist and curve of hips, and the peek of a slender white thigh. Remember it.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said in a strangled voice. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange it for you, Miss Woodmore.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head, her full lips flat and mutinous. \u201cI will return to my chamber, but I don\u2019t see how I can marry Alexander when I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>He stilled as something sharp darted through his gut. \u201cYou\u2019re even more foolish than I thought if you believe that, Miss Woodmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is one thing I believe we must agree on, my lord. I am foolish.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd regardless of what you might think you feel, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he said, \u201clove has nothing to do with whether you wed Bradington or not. Is it not all about the match? The income, the family, the title? Whatever you might think you feel has no bearing on your reputation or your marriage.\u201d</p><p>Something glinted in her eyes and he thought for a startled moment that his feisty Miss Woodmore might be tearing up. But she blinked and the shininess was gone.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d she said, \u201cI will tell him the truth. And either he\u2019ll wish to go forward with the wedding, knowing that not only do I not love him, but I don\u2019t come to him untouched, or he\u2019ll drop me and our engagement will be broken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere will be a scandal,\u201d he said, despite the fact that he would ensure that Bradington didn\u2019t drop her. \u201cYour reputation will be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease refrain from stating the obvious, Lord Corvindale,\u201d she said in a parody of an admonishment he\u2019d once given her. \u201cI\u2019m willing to risk it. I will not live a lie with Alexander. He needs to know the truth. And that is why I felt compelled to tell you the truth of how I feel, even though I knew precisely how you would react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Maia,\u201d he said, keeping his voice cold so that it wouldn\u2019t break. \u201cI\u2019m immortal. I live forever. And when I die...I belong to the devil. I belong to him even now. I have nothing to give. That,\u201d he added nastily, thinking of Wayren and her stories, \u201cis what makes me different from the fairy-tale beast. I own nothing of myself. I have nothing to give.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>OF IRONY, UMBRELLAS AND INFERNOS</p> <p>After his icy pronouncement, Corvindale swept out of the chamber into his adjoining dressing and bathing room, leaving Maia sitting alone on the bed. Numb.</p><p>Moments later, she heard the door open onto the hall from that room, and then shortly after that, he returned, stalking into the bedchamber, his hands filled with garments. He was dressed simply in an untucked shirt and trousers.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll need assistance dressing,\u201d he said, placing the clothing on the bed with surprising gentleness. She\u2019d expected him to throw them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, snatching up a chemise. She refused to ask how he\u2019d obtained the garments. It was impossible to imagine that the earl would have gone into her chamber and dug through her wardrobe and drawers. \u201cI don\u2019t need your assistance.\u201d</p><p>The chemise floated down over her shoulders and hips.</p><p>Maia disdained the corset and drawers and pulled on the simple day dress he\u2019d provided. Fortunately the empire-waist style allowed for her to go temporarily without the corset. She would thus be able to return to her chamber and then get properly dressed with Betty\u2019s help, appearing as if she had just returned from a walk if anyone encountered her in the meanwhile.</p> <p>Then she could go down and have a difficult conversation with Alexander.</p><p>After she found a way to cover her vampire bites.</p><p>Once his grudging assistance was refused, Corvindale turned away and stood in front of a curtained window, his back to her, while she finished dressing.</p><p>As she did so, Maia reflected on the amazing fact that she was in the earl\u2019s bedchamber, alone with him and dressing after spending several hours wrapped in his arms. Naked. And now he would hardly acknowledge her presence. They\u2019d talked so coolly and calmly about everything that had happened, as if it were a story that had unfolded on the pages of a book instead of to them. In real life.</p><p>Looking at the bedraggled mattress, she gave a little shudder of remembered pleasure tinged with regret. She would never forget the feeling, tumbling onto his nude body, warm and hard, rough with wiry hair and firm with planes of muscle, his arms closing around her. His mouth taking from hers.</p><p>She belonged there.</p><p>\u201cThe only time I loved a woman,\u201d he said suddenly, still turned away, \u201cI gave everything for her. My heart. My life. And, quite literally, my soul.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s movements were arrested as she bent to pick up the unused bundle of clothing. Her heart thumped. She had so many questions. \u201cLerina?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod and the Fates, no. Do you think I\u2019m completely mad? Her name was Meg. It was because of her that I...that I am what I am today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a pact with the devil for her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, fingering the heavy drapes that still cloaked the window. \u201cI thought I was saving her life. Our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Maia asked, imagining that she\u2019d died of old age in his arms as he remained forever young.</p><p>\u201cShe left.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, too.\u201d</p><p>Something soft swelled in her chest and it was all Maia could do not to reach for him. Even with his back to her, she could see the tension in his shoulders. She imagined she could make out the black lines of the horrible marking on his skin, the writhing black veins as thick as rose stems, through the cotton of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDid you love Lerina, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved no one since.\u201d</p><p>Maia swallowed. Including me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that, too, Corvindale.\u201d She held the bundle of clothing to her chest and paused.</p><p>He shifted as if he meant to turn, then stopped suddenly and remained with his back to her, his fingers curling around the edge of the curtains. \u201cYou\u2019re aware that my given name is Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I see no reason to use that appellation,\u201d she said stiffly. Lerina had, calling him \u201cdarling Dimitri\u201d with such a false, sugary tone that Maia had felt ill. Aside of that, they weren\u2019t intimates. Not any longer.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting that you do, Miss Woodmore.\u201d His voice softened a bit as he continued. \u201cMy mother was a Romanian princess who married my father the earl, and she named me Dimitri Gavril. She called me Gavril.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s lips twisted, for she understood why he\u2019d told her. \u201cGavril, or the Greek, Gabriel. I believe it translates as \u2018man of God.\u2019\u201d</p><p>As she looked at his dark head, held high, his shoulders broad and straight, and the hint of the black markings of the devil beneath his white shirt, she knew the irony must be that much more bitter to him.</p><p>\u201cIf you please, advise Mr. Bradington that Miss Woodmore is here to speak with him,\u201d Maia said to Alexander\u2019s butler, Driggs, as he took her umbrella.</p><p>\u201cThe master has been indisposed since last evening, miss,\u201d Driggs told her gravely. \u201cI shall attempt to rouse him.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her nervousness as Driggs gestured for her to wait in the small, private parlor. Alexander had left Blackmont Hall the morning after the \u201cmix-up\u201d with their appointment to go for a walk. And he hadn\u2019t returned that afternoon, nor the day after.</p><p>The fact that he hadn\u2019t done so left an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of Maia\u2019s being, and now today, when she finished dressing, eating as much dinner as she could stomach\u2014which was to say, not very much at all\u2014she decided to take matters into her own hands and call on him directly.</p><p>Calling on a gentleman wasn\u2019t done, unless one were chaperoned, but in the case of one\u2019s fianc\u00e9, it was much more permissible. Still, Maia didn\u2019t particularly want to be noticed and so she was grateful for the heavy rain and dark clouds that gave her an excuse to hide under an obstructing umbrella as she hurried up the short walk to his front door. For that same reason, she\u2019d ordered a hackney instead of taking one of Corvindale\u2019s carriages. And, conscious of the warnings of both Dewhurst and Corvindale, she\u2019d left Blackmont Hall through the back, servants\u2019 entrance, well-cloaked and hidden under a hood. Anyone waiting for an opportunity to abduct her not only wouldn\u2019t see her leave, but if they did, she would be assumed to be a maid or other servant.</p><p>Now inside, listening to the pouring rain, she adjusted her skirts neatly across her knees. They were weighted by their damp hem, which just skimmed the tops of her water-speckled slippers. They\u2019d be ruined, but the state of her shoes was the least of her worries.</p><p>How was she going to tell Alexander? What was she going to tell him?</p><p>Did he suspect something, and that was why he was indisposed? No, certainly not. How could he suspect anything?</p><p>He must simply be unwell, which explained why he wouldn\u2019t have come to call. Poor Alexander, always the gentleman. Likely attempting to keep her from getting his sickness. Perhaps...she hoped he wasn\u2019t ill over worry for her. That would be simply too much for her to bear.</p><p>The parlor door opened suddenly, and Maia jumped at the unexpected noise.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she said, calming her nervous heart and rising promptly to her feet. She scanned him closely, looking for signs that he had been ill or sleepless.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he replied, smiling at her. He didn\u2019t appear to be unwell, his Scottish heritage showing in a handsome face shaven and faintly ruddy as it always was. His gray-blue eyes scanned her with appreciation and his chestnut-colored hair and sideburns were combed and pomaded as if he\u2019d dressed for her. \u201cI am so delighted to see you. I meant to call on you today, but I\u2019m afraid I must keep an appointment this afternoon. Perhaps you would join me, and we could talk in the carriage? I believe we have much to catch up on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, feeling a bit off center, as if nothing had happened. Perhaps, in his mind, nothing had.</p><p>In his mind. A very cold feeling settled over her. Corvindale. Had he come and persuaded Alexander that nothing was amiss? Had he enthralled her fianc\u00e9 to force him into marrying her, regardless of what she told him?</p><p>Could he even do that?</p><p>Maia firmed her lips. She would have to have a word with the earl. Again.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then, my dear,\u201d he said, offering her his arm as he opened a large umbrella. \u201cI promise our appointment won\u2019t take long at all.\u201d</p><p>He held the covering up and over as they fairly ran through the downpour to his waiting carriage. The rain came down so hard that it splashed up and under the umbrella, soaking the bottom third of her frock.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I must tell you,\u201d Maia said, gathering up her bravery as well as her heavy skirts as she settled into the carriage across from him. She was breathing heavily from the short dash. \u201cThere\u2019s something we must talk about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even if Corvindale had been here, or somehow talked to Alexander, she would still tell him what she needed to tell him, and deal with the earl later.</p><p>\u201cI have things to talk with you about, too,\u201d Alexander said as he latched the door and knocked on the roof of the vehicle. \u201cThings have changed.\u201d</p><p>That was when she realized something was wrong. It was the way he said it, the way he was looking at her. There was an odd note in his voice, a strange inflection that sent a prickling along the backs of her arms.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she managed to say as the carriage lurched off speedily.</p><p>He smiled at her, displaying a gleaming white set of fangs.</p><p>Maia barely stifled a shriek. \u201cAre those real?\u201d she asked, trying to keep her voice\u2014and her mind\u2014steady. Impossible. Her mind tried to scatter, but she forced herself to focus. This was not the time to panic.</p><p>In response, he settled eyes on her that glowed red. \u201cWhy do you not come here and find out?\u201d He leered, patting the seat next to him.</p><p>\u201cAlexander! How did this occur? What happened?\u201d Her heart was a runaway in her chest, her palms damp beneath her gloves, but she remembered to keep her gaze averted.</p> <p>\u201cI had a visitor on the day you forgot about our engagement to take a morning walk. It was all very odd, for she asked me to come for a drive in her carriage, that you wanted to meet clandestinely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Throckmullins. Lerina,\u201d Maia said, her heart sinking.</p><p>Alexander nodded, a funny smile twitching the corners of his mouth. \u201cYes, indeed. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize that she wasn\u2019t taking me to meet you, but that she had another plan in mind. She\u2019s quite annoyed with Corvindale, and as it turned out, I wasn\u2019t at all adverse to her suggestion that I join her race. It was either that, or she was to kill me. When confronted with immortality or death, I didn\u2019t find it a difficult choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you...you\u2019ve given your soul to the devil,\u201d she said. \u201cYou chose the certainty of being damned for eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I shall live forever,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the care of Lucifer. Thus that event will never come.\u201d</p><p>Maia shook her head. \u201cAlexander, no, you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough of that.\u201d He moved, suddenly shifting to the other side of the carriage next to her. \u201cI see that you\u2019ve already been introduced to the particular pleasures of my new race,\u201d he said, grasping her arm with one hand to keep her next to him. With the other, he lifted the thick choker she wore to hide the nearly healed scars from Corvindale\u2019s bites.</p><p>\u201cRelease me,\u201d she said, trying to keep her head. The carriage door was on the other side of Alexander, and it was latched. She\u2019d have to get past him, and get it unhooked in order to jump out\u2014and the carriage was going at a very rapid pace. Her insides heaved unpleasantly as a chill blanketed her. \u201cMy brother will have your heart on a stake if you harm me. If Corvindale doesn\u2019t get to you first, which I assure you, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I\u2019ve heard about your attachment to Corvindale.\u201d His smile had been relatively benign, but now it hardened. \u201cI presume that is how you obtained these marks.\u201d</p><p>Before she could react, he turned, his weight shoving her into the corner of the seat as he lunged onto her. Maia drew in a breath to scream, but he clapped a hand over her mouth and plunged his fangs into her shoulder.</p><p>She jerked at the pain, arching up, clawing with gloved fingers and fighting at him, trying to twist away from his smothering hand. She felt the release of blood from her veins, the feel of his lips over her skin, the heavy, hard weight of his body pressing her down, down into the dark corner of the carriage as the wheels rumbled beneath them.</p><p>He groaned, his chest heaving against her as he gulped the blood from her flesh, his hand tight, pressed roughly into her mouth and cheeks. One of her arms was trapped between them and the back of the seat, but the other one she whipped free, flailing desperately at him, pulling at his hair, scratching ineffectively at his arm.</p><p>Alexander pulled away after she managed a particularly loud cuff against the side of his head, over his ear. Eyes blazing red, blood gathering at the corners of his mouth and staining his teeth, he shifted, releasing her mouth and grabbing both of her arms. He captured her wrists with one strong hand, forcing them down between them, where his weight held her arms captive between their torsos.</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d she gasped, trying, hoping that she might somehow penetrate whatever frenzy had seized his mind, \u201cCorvindale and Chas will kill you. Let me go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that, my dear Maia,\u201d he said, his tongue swiping around the corners of his mouth to get the last bit of blood. \u201cI have my orders. But there isn\u2019t any reason why I cannot sample you. I never expected it to be this pleasurable.\u201d He bent again, and she tensed, expecting him to shove his fangs into her once more, but this time, he covered her mouth roughly with his.</p><p>Tainted with blood, he tasted like copper, and something dark and ugly. He was hard and brutal, his fangs scraping against her mouth and cutting her lips as his tongue thrust and stroked. She twisted and fought more, tears of frustration and fear leaking from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>Corvindale. Chas. Hurry.</p><p>She felt the warmth draining from her body from the wound on her shoulder as he moved to the side of her neck, then the slice of pain as he drove his fangs in once more. They weren\u2019t going to get to her in time. He was going to drain her. Kill her.</p><p>Maia closed her eyes, trying to focus, trying to push away the horror blinding her. In the background of her fear, she heard the drumming of rain on the roof and the vibration of the vehicle as it rolled along. She must remove herself from this moment of terror and think. Think. Was there something she could do to stop him? He hadn\u2019t begun to tear her clothes away, but she felt the hard bulge that indicated his arousal, and she suspected with a deep, terrible fear, that he soon would move on to other violations.</p><p>But the heat and life flowed from her, along with her consciousness, and she found herself floating somewhere in a plane of fear and pain, hands rough on her, the incessant rumbling of the carriage beneath her.</p><p>And then it stopped.</p><p>He pulled away and sat back, looking at her. A drop of blood colored the corner of his mouth and his eyes, glazed with desire, burned down at her. \u201cAlas,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</p><p>Maia tried to pull herself up, but the interior spun and she fell back weakly onto the seat. Blood trickled down her shoulder and neck, over her upper chest and seeped into the neckline of her dress.</p><p>She heard a click and the carriage door opened. The rush of cool, damp air did a bit to revive her, but when she saw Mrs. Throckmullins standing there, Maia felt a rush of fear.</p><p>\u201cHello there again, my dear Miss Woodmore,\u201d she said, rain drumming frantically on her umbrella. \u201cI see that you\u2019ve taken a bit of a sample of our friend here, darling Alexander. But what a mess you\u2019ve made of it. Fool.\u201d Her voice hardened. \u201cShe cannot bleed to death.\u201d</p><p>With a sharp movement, Lerina flung the umbrella to someone behind her, and Maia caught a glimpse of a brick wall looming beyond in the low light. Then all other thoughts fled as the woman surged into the small space and pulled the door closed behind her.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s see to this,\u201d she said, settling on the seat across from her and Alexander. \u201cHold her,\u201d she said as Maia began to struggle, trying to slip up and out of the small vehicle.</p><p>Alexander grabbed her shoulders and then her wrists, holding Maia still as Lerina moved closer. \u201cShe smells delightful,\u201d the other woman said, sniffing delicately. \u201cI thought as much the first time we met.\u201d She traced a finger down into the blood still oozing freely from the bites on her neck, then brought it to her lips. With a vigorous swipe, she tasted the red drop and smiled.</p><p>\u201cNow, now, you needn\u2019t fear, Miss Woodmore,\u201d she told her, seeing Maia\u2019s eyes grow wide. She grasped her chin, holding it with strong, sharp fingers. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt a bit, and then I\u2019ll see to stopping the bleeding. We don\u2019t want you to die until Dimitri gets here. Just close your eyes now and enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Maia would have screamed, but the woman slapped a flat hand over her mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t need your cries ringing in my ears,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cIt ruins the experience.\u201d</p><p>Maia couldn\u2019t move, for Alexander\u2019s weight and hands kept her body in place and her arms pinned between them while Lerina held her head immobile. The woman bared her fangs, a dark glint in her eyes, and drove her sharp teeth into the top of Maia\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Maia\u2019s vision fluttered dark and light, her stomach pitched and rolled as she gagged behind the fingers clamped over her mouth. The rhythmic tug and suction from the woman\u2019s lips echoed through her body, dragging up from deep inside. A little flutter of unwanted pleasure uncurled in the pit of her belly, just a quiet tingle within the dark world of fear and pain and Maia felt tears rolling from her eyes again.</p><p>After a long moment, it was over. Lerina pulled away, her lips full, her eyes bright red. She made a soft humming sound of pleasure, bloodscent filtering from her heavy breaths. Maia kept her eyes closed, focusing on the fact that they weren\u2019t going to kill her. At least until Corvindale arrived.</p><p>A trap for him. Of course it was a trap, but he was smart.</p><p>And strong and powerful. Too smart to be tricked, especially again. And he had Mr. Cale and Chas and even Dewhurst and Iliana to help him. Surely he wouldn\u2019t be hurt. Surely\u2014</p><p>Lerina leaned forward again, and Maia tensed, feeling the tightening grip of Alexander\u2019s hands on her shoulders. She twisted, but she was powerless, and this time, instead of biting her, Lerina swiped her tongue out. Worse than having the fangs penetrating her flesh was the feel of the woman licking her shoulder, licking and gently sucking away the last bit of blood from the fresh wounds.</p><p>Maia trembled low and deep as they held her down, both of them now lapping at the marks on her neck and shoulders, one on each side. Her skin crawled beneath the sleek whorls of tongue and lips and she tried to faint, tried to fall into some black unconsciousness so she didn\u2019t have to feel the sensations on her sensitive skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t have long to wait. Mercifully, weakness overcame her, and darkness flooded her vision. Maia slipped into it gladly.</p><p>Dimitri stared down at the note. His body had gone cold and then numb, then his mind shattered into terrified pieces. Now it was working its way into blazing fury.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t allow terror into his mind, so he focused on the fury.</p> <p>I have something you desire.</p><p>That was all the missive said, but he needed no other information. Lerina\u2019s scent, along with that of Maia\u2019s blood permeated the paper.</p><p>Dimitri stopped his thoughts as soon as he smelled it. No. Going down that avenue would turn him mad. Focus on the facts, on what he knew.</p><p>Maia had left early that afternoon, many hours ago, to call on Bradington. She\u2019d taken a hack instead of one of his carriages, a fact which he didn\u2019t learn until supper when Angelica pounded on his study door to inform him that her sister hadn\u2019t returned.</p><p>Even then, he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to be too concerned, instead, torturing himself with the image of two lovers reuniting and forgetting the passage of time. But now...</p> <p>He forced his mind to remain calm and empty. To go through a list of steps with logic and objectivity. Obviously Lerina wanted him to come. Obviously she had something planned.</p><p>Obviously Maia wouldn\u2019t be killed, at least until he got there. He hoped. Lerina wasn\u2019t Cezar Moldavi.</p><p>He\u2019d need assistance, someone to have his back. He wasn\u2019t that foolish. Giordan. Chas was still in Scotland, blast. Iliana. Even Voss. Eddersley. Gehrington. Perhaps Eustacia, the woman who sometimes practiced fighting with Iliana, if she was back from Rome.</p><p>Not that he would wait for any of them to arrive. But at least they\u2019d be coming behind him.</p><p>Thus Dimitri kept his thoughts cold and steady as he barked orders to Crewston to send messages to Rubey\u2019s, to the back rooms at White\u2019s and to Dewhurst. He called for Tren and Iliana, giving Hunburgh direction on how to secure the house and whom to contact in the event the worst happened.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t think on that.</p> <p>Where would they be? She\u2019d given no direction, no indication...they had to be at the same place they\u2019d escaped before. Or, at least, he had to start there and track them if necessary. He wished he had his dogs, but he never brought them to Town.</p><p>These thoughts, these cold, steely thoughts, kept him calm as he removed his waistcoat and changed into clothing meant more for a tradesman than an earl. Loose trousers with pockets and a shirt, sturdy shoes. And a coat with more pockets, where he put stakes. He picked up his sabre that masqueraded as a walking stick and walked out of the house as prepared as he could be.</p><p>He disdained the carriage that was waiting, for a saddled horse was much faster, and Tren, quick as he was, had prepared both. The carriage would follow once the others arrived.</p><p>If they did.</p><p>Dimitri galloped through the streets, grateful for the full moon that lit the world nearly as brightly as the sun. It was well into the night, and dawn would be only hours away.</p><p>When he got near the abandoned, shrouded house near the fishermen\u2019s wharf where he and Maia had been imprisoned, Dimitri slid from the horse before he even stopped. He landed on the ground and gathered up the reins, looking for somewhere to tie the beast, or some urchin to pay to watch him. The house was several blocks away, and he wanted to approach it as secretly as possible.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was long past midnight, the docks were by no means deserted. Fishermen and sailors walked, talked, fought, loaded and unloaded. The air was filled with noises of altercation and jollity. The smells of fish and sea-water mingled with something burning nearby and the ever-present odor of garbage.</p><p>Still calm, icily so, he looked around. And then he saw them.</p> <p>Lerina stood in the center, in the narrow street. She was flanked by two men\u2014likely vampire makes\u2014and she watched Dimitri as he approached. Her eyes glowed faintly and she stood regally, as if she were a queen and he a subject approaching for obeisance.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Dimitri demanded, his control slipping when he scented Maia on Lerina...and on the man standing next to her. Bradington. Whose eyes glowed mockingly.</p><p>Alarm rising inside him, Dimitri fought it back. So that was how Lerina had managed to get to Maia. He allowed his eyes to glow just a bit, to show the very tip of a fang. They were no match for him in strength or speed, and Lerina must know it. Even she, without the use of rubies, was no threat to him. And he sensed no rubies on her or her companions.</p><p>That fact filled him with unease.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t certain you would still want her. Now that we\u2019ve finished with the little chit,\u201d she replied. \u201cAlthough I can see now why you\u2019ve enjoyed her. She\u2019s a tasty piece.\u201d A lift in the breeze brought a stronger waft of fish accompanied by the smell of flame and burning wood.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t certain about your feelings for her the first time,\u201d Lerina was saying conversationally. \u201cAfter all, you were under duress. But you did feed from her\u2014your control and abstinence are legendary, you know, and it was a shock to find that something had caused you to give it up. And then there was the way you looked at her...well, I had my suspicions. So of course I had to see for myself. It was rather amusing the way she came to your assistance, that night at\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dimitri moved sharply and had Lerina in his hands, a stake poised over her generous bosom before she could finish. \u201cWhere is Maia?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in blatant admiration and she arched a bit toward him, her hips bumping his. \u201cLuce\u2019s cock, you can still set my heart fluttering, Dimitri. All that power and rage rumbling beneath.\u201d She shrugged in his arms, her breasts pressing beneath them as she tipped her head back as if to give him a better target. \u201cGo ahead, do what you will. But if you kill me, you won\u2019t know where to find Miss Woodmore. And time is running thin.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, fighting rising alarm, he released her, trying to keep his thoughts from scattering into wildness. \u201cTell me where she is.\u201d He glanced at Bradington, who\u2019d taken a step back and looked a bit less confident than he had a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cAh, feel free, Dimitri. I\u2019d love to watch you, and he was merely a tool to get to...here. Right here, right where I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so I\u2019m here.\u201d He glanced behind her when another blast of smoke reached his nostrils and noticed a low glow in the distance. All at once, his senses went dead. The house, the very house in which they\u2019d been imprisoned, was in flames.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dimitri. She\u2019s in there,\u201d Lerina said.</p><p>But he was already pushing past her, flying toward the house. His heart in his throat, he tore through the night, knowing there had to be some sort of trick...some sort of surprise waiting for him.</p><p>She could be dead. She could be made. She might not even be in there, it might be some sort of ruse... Even Cezar could be waiting inside.</p><p>Tongues of flame snarled through the windows, smoke poured from the roof. The house was wholly ablaze. If she was inside, how could she be alive?</p><p>For a moment, Dimitri was propelled back in time to the Great Fire, and he slowed for a moment. A mere moment, and then he went on, as strong and fast as before.</p><p>For this was different. This was Maia, this was now, and he was a Dracule. Fire didn\u2019t harm him; it merely lashed around in a reminder of what hell would be like. Hot, searing, but without actually eating into him. If he could find Maia, he would be fast enough to pull her out, to cover her and streak safely through the flames with her.</p><p>If he could find her. If she was still alive.</p><p>His mind was three steps ahead of his feet, and he tore off his shirt, plunging it into a rain barrel. Wet and damp, it would help to protect Maia if\u2014when\u2014he found her and brought her out.</p><p>This time, as he approached the building, he didn\u2019t have to find an opening that wasn\u2019t burning. He crashed through a flaming door and found himself in a dark, hot place, filled with smoke that blinded him though he could normally see through the dark.</p><p>\u201cMaia!\u201d he bellowed, inhaling a lungful of the hot smoke and ash as he tore through the lower level, looking for a place that wasn\u2019t aflame. He tried to smell her, to find her scent amid the soot and burning wood, and he caught it at last as he came to the stairs.</p><p>She was here. She was here.</p><p>Or she had been here.</p><p>\u201cMaia!\u201d he shouted again, ducking as a flaming beam tumbled from the ceiling. The entire place was in shambles, the sheets that had covered furnishings gone up in flames.</p><p>Fire snarled through spots in the walls, and the roar like a powerful windstorm filled his ears.</p><p>He called her name over and over as he dashed up crumbling stairs, down the hall to where they\u2019d been imprisoned\u2014he could tell by scent more than sight\u2014and back.</p><p>There was no one there.</p><p>Tears stung his eyes, and they burned with the grit from hot ash and the heat. He used the dripping shirt to wipe it away. She had to be here. She must\u2014</p><p>And then he heard something. Faintly.</p><p>\u201cMaia!\u201d he shouted, stumbling over a half wall as he turned toward the sound. He wasn\u2019t certain where he was any longer in this building, he just listened, smelled, and then...</p><p>No.</p><p>He realized the trap before he even got there, for the weakness took hold.</p><p>He found her, coming into the very deepest part of the house, and stumbled into the chamber.</p><p>There she was, sitting in the center of the room with flames licking the edges, smoke swirling above. Maia was slumped in the chair to which she was tied.</p><p>Bound by ropes and ropes of rubies.</p><p>20</p><p>HELL</p><p>A great roar started deep inside and Dimitri fought it back. He would do it. He had to do it.</p><p>Dimitri started toward her, panting, sweaty and hot, but his limbs wouldn\u2019t work. They weakened, slogging him to a slow halt as if he were fighting to run upstream a violent river. He released the shirt clutched in his fingers and grasped at the ground, trying to pull himself along using his fingers between old rotting floorboards. But they were weak. He was weak. His lungs tight, his limbs like lead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maia. Please.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get to her. He couldn\u2019t get to her.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he managed to groan. Was she even alive?</p> <p>He could see little in the dark room, but when she shifted, lifting her head, hope rose in him. She was alive.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he called again, coughing a bit and when she tried to respond, nothing came from her mouth but a choking cough. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m coming for you.\u201d</p><p>The flames roared closer, and a large beam tumbled from the ceiling, clattering to the floor next to him. It appeared that the fire had started from the perimeter of the building and was working its way in and up, crawling along the walls and across the roof. He knew Maia couldn\u2019t last much longer with the thick, clogging smoke. While he...he could stay forever in this hell on earth.</p><p>Dimitri took another step and his knees wavered, then gave out. He tumbled to the floor and felt a wave of paralysis roll through him, constricting his lungs, leadening his muscles. No. He\u2019d fight through it.</p><p>He had to get to her. He couldn\u2019t\u2014</p> <p>There was a movement behind him, and he twisted his head to look up and behind. Lerina stood there, as unaffected by the fire as he was.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve found her,\u201d she said over the roar.</p><p>Rage sliced through him and he tried to lunge to his feet, but the rubies did their work and made him clumsy and slow.</p><p>\u201cWhy,\u201d he managed to gasp, curling his slow, fat fingers into the hem of her gown and dragging her down as he tried to pull himself up. But the rubies...they weighted him down.</p><p>Lerina pulled away and he tumbled to the floor, his hand landing on a piece of loose wood. \u201cBecause,\u201d she said, pitching her voice to be heard over the roar in his ears, \u201cI wanted you to watch her die. I wanted you to see what it\u2019s like to lose what you love. And to live with that image for eternity.\u201d</p><p>He closed his fingers around the wood, feeling its slender length, and felt the rage surge through him. Gathering up all of his strength, what little remained, he launched himself toward her ankles and captured them in the crook of his arm. He\u2019d pull her down to the ground and use his weight to hold her until he could slam the thing into her black heart.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve...spent...\u201d he gasped, trying again to get his muscles to cooperate, to upset her balance, \u201ctoo...long...with... Cezar.\u201d His grip was weakening as she fought to free herself, the desperation evident in her flailing movements and wild kicking. He was never going to let her go. She would die along with Maia. Even slow as he was, she was no match for him.</p><p>But then a noise, a great crash behind him had his rage disintegrating into blind fear. His grip lessened and Lerina pulled away as Dimitri turned back around with a weak lurch. A large flaming chunk of building had fallen between Maia and him, bouncing to the side. The fire leaped and danced, and he couldn\u2019t see past it.</p><p>\u201cMaia!\u201d he shouted, forgetting Lerina, dragging himself closer to the blazing piece of wood and to the side. \u201cMaia!\u201d he cried again, desperate to hear her respond.</p><p>But he knew the closer he got to his goal, the weaker he\u2019d become. Her hands were bound and she had no way to loosen herself from the rubies. There were too many of them.</p><p>It was an impossible task. Impossible.</p><p>Impossible for a vampire whose Asthenia was rubies.</p><p>A labored twisting on the floor to look behind told him that Lerina had gone, perhaps fearful that if he gave up on saving Maia he\u2019d come after her.</p><p>He collapsed on the floor, his face and bare torso grinding into the grit even as he used his toes, his fingers, to try to propel himself closer. Just a little closer. The length of a fingernail. The distance of a flea jump. He dragged, writhed, heaved, trying to make himself move.</p> <p>The power from the gems emanated from Maia more strongly than the flames and smoke, but at last he moved himself to where he could see her again.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said, then coughed. She seemed to be more awake now, more lucid. She\u2019d regained her strength, only to die?</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t...\u201d he choked out, his throat closing with emotion. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His fingers dug between two wooden planks, but they were so weak that he could barely fit them into the groove. It was too much. Something stung his vision, gritty and bitter.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, somehow mustering the strength to speak over the choking smoke in her lungs. \u201cI know it.\u201d Her beautiful face was streaked with black, her hair messy and sagging, her gown filthy and the malevolent rubies shining like dancing red beacons in the roaring flames.</p><p>\u201cMaia. God, Maia...I\u2019m...sorry,\u201d he groaned, tears stinging his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, holding his gaze somehow through the smoke and darkness. \u201cI love you...Gavril.\u201d</p><p>I love you. The emotion flashed into his own mind, burning there like some great revelation. Truth.</p><p>At the same time as that self-realization, that long-denied truth, a sharp slice arced through him. For a moment he thought something had fallen, landing on his naked back. Or that a stake had stabbed him, piercing his heart. But it wasn\u2019t that, it wasn\u2019t external. It was something inside, cracking, splitting. Pain blazed through him and his muscles collapsed at last, his face slamming into the dirt. He couldn\u2019t lift his finger. Could barely blink. His breath was short and restricted, his mouth filled with dirt and ash.</p><p>Dimitri squeezed his eyes closed, the pain overtaking him. With one last breath, he heaved himself up, lifted his face to look at her once more. He had to tell her. He couldn\u2019t let her die without knowing the truth.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even speak the words, but he thought them, sent them to her with his gaze. I love you. Maia, I love you. I have always loved you.</p><p>The pain snapped and sizzled, centered at his Mark and raging through his flesh, his muscles and organs, and down through his limbs, radiating torture like never before. He cried out in agony, seizing and shuddering, trying to throw it off, to escape.</p><p>Never. Never anything like it.</p><p>It burned like a thousand fiery whips laying into his skin until he thought he would explode, go mad, scream until his throat was raw. And then, impossibly, he saw Wayren...nodding, with a quiet smile.</p><p>Then...nothing.</p><p>Black. Darkness.</p><p>21</p><p>IN WHICH MIRACLES BECOME CURSES</p><p>Dimitri opened his eyes to darkness and a roaring that filled his ears. Heat. Roiling heat. His thoughts were confused, sluggish, and as he lifted his head, he remembered.</p><p>Pain. But it was gone now.</p><p>Maia. Oh, God.</p><p>Emptiness and fear stilled him for a moment, then he dragged his eyes back open and looked around. Golden and red flames swirled and danced, heat seared him. His lungs burned, his eyes were raw. Beyond the flames, darkness loomed.</p><p>He\u2019d died. He was in hell.</p><p>Where is Lucifer?</p><p>He\u2019d seen Wayren for that one, odd moment...but nothing of the fallen angel.</p><p>Dimitri found that he could move, and he rolled over, his body weak and aching, but mobile. And then he saw her.</p><p>Maia, impossibly, still there, still in the same place. On the chair, still bound in rubies, the flickering light illuminating her face.</p><p>How could she still be there? How could the fire not have swallowed her up, choked the life from her?</p><p>She was watching him with a horrified expression that, as he staggered to his feet, changed into one of bewilderment.</p><p>And then wonder.</p><p>The same shock and strength rushed through Dimitri, even as he coughed and choked, the black smoke swirling around him. The heat raged and he felt it on his skin as if it sat there, branding him.</p><p>But he was moving. Toward her. The rubies seemed to have no effect on him any longer.</p><p>Yet, Dimitri stumbled, clumsy, coughing and choking so hard that he doubled over, clutching at his middle. What\u2019s happening to me?</p><p>And then, suddenly, he realized he felt no pain. No pain.</p><p>Not even from the Mark of Lucifer.</p><p>Just the blazing burn of flames roaring around him. The gritty heat of smoke and soot.</p><p>With a sudden burst of clarity, he touched the back of his left shoulder. Although covered with grit and sweat, it was otherwise smooth. Unblemished.</p><p>The Mark was gone. The shock stunned him, paralyzing him as he stood there, doubled over, panting. He realized all at once the blessing...and the curse...of his realization.</p><p>Wayren. That was why she\u2019d been there.</p><p>His covenant with Lucifer had been broken.</p><p>He was mortal again.</p><p>Mortal.</p><p>He kept on, and then he was there, gathering Maia to him, that sweet, smoky, soft bundle. Tearing at the ropes of rubies, he flung them away and pulled her completely into his arms as the dark smoke choked and enveloped them.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he said in a rough, smoky voice, then his breath was cut off by the smothering roil of smoke.</p><p>She coughed, sagging against him, and he bore them both to the floor where the smoke wasn\u2019t quite as thick, wrapping her close to his body, wishing he still had his damp shirt to put over her face. She was kissing him, kissing his jaw and along his bare throat, and he found her lips, sooty and salty, covering them with a desperate hunger. His face was damp with sweat and tears, relief and warmth. And something good unfurled inside him. It was going to be all right. He had her now.</p><p>He was mortal again. Human again. He loved.</p><p>Maia. Thank God I found you.</p><p>She was saying something, and at first he couldn\u2019t understand it. But then he heard it, felt the shape of his name on her lips: \u201cGavril.\u201d</p><p>I love you.</p><p>He felt, rather than heard her say the words. Her lips formed them against his mouth, and he bowed his head into the floor, trying to escape the smoke. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said into her hair. How could I have been so foolish?</p><p>An ominous cracking brought him back to reality. \u201cWe have to...get out of here,\u201d he said, then was overtaken by a fit of rough coughing.</p><p>When he looked up, he saw the wall of flames in front of them. Everywhere he turned, there was fire, raging and snarling. The smoke rose and filled the room, thinner but no less potent near the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked again, twisting his body around on the floor while protecting her from the flames and smoke. A chill began, deep in his belly, and began to roll through his body, leaving him numb.</p><p>There was no way out.</p><p>The fire burned too tall, too hot, too encompassing. There was no way to get through.</p> <p>Impossible.</p><p>Impossible for a mortal.</p><p>Fury and impotence raged through him, replacing the cold fear, and he looked down at her. Their eyes met and he felt the acceptance in her limbs as she relaxed into him, closing her eyes. Resting her smudged cheek on his arm. Preparing to die.</p><p>She knew it. She\u2019d probably always known it.</p><p>No. There had to be some way.</p> <p>He looked around again, seeking some break in the flames, some low rise that he could jump over, carrying her. But there was nothing.</p><p>Bitterness, oh, such bitterness.</p><p>If he weren\u2019t holding Maia, Dimitri would have raged and thrown himself into the flames, wild with fury and frustration. He didn\u2019t care about dying. He\u2019d been ready for decades. It was Maia...it was all Maia.</p><p>He gathered her up, felt her arms curling around him as she shuddered a cough, trying to speak but unable to because of the heavy smoke. Closing his eyes, he huddled around her, positioning his large body to protect her from the falling beams and dancing flames.</p><p>Please.</p><p>The irony, the horror of the situation\u2014that he\u2019d obtained his deepest desire, that he\u2019d finally freed himself from Lucifer but was now useless to save the woman he loved\u2014brought harsh, stinging tears to his eyes. They fell into her hair, burning his dry eyes, salty as they trickled down his cheeks.</p> <p>Damn you. Damn you.</p><p>Help me. Someone.</p><p>He thought of Wayren, her slight, elegant figure appearing in his mind, and her platitudes. Her meaningless platitudes that had come too late: But that\u2019s why men are here. To be bothered. To feel. To live. To love. And...to be loved. That is what makes you different from every other creature. And that is what makes man ultimately more powerful than the Fiend.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d found love. He\u2019d opened himself to it, just in time to lose it. Her. To lose life. The miracle had turned to a curse, and now she would die.</p><p>Maia would die, just as Meg would have.</p><p>If he had stayed immortal...kept the covenant...</p><p>The chill was back, the horrible knowledge that he had the choice. That he could save her, just as he\u2019d saved Meg. It washed over him, dark and evil, even more potent than the fire raging against his mortal body.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known what it meant, before. When Lucifer came to him the first time. But now he knew. He fully knew the hell, the horror, the blackness of what that covenant meant.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want to live it again. But he could.</p><p>Something snapped inside him, something widening into cold, then hot...and then deep, deep calm. An oasis, an island, in the fiery, terrible vortex of the fear and horror that battled within him, and without.</p><p>He could do it. He could save Maia.</p><p>\u201cI take it back,\u201d he shouted into the darkness, his voice rusty and barely audible. Tears streamed from his eyes as he made the decision. \u201cLucifer! Attend me!\u201d</p><p>The flames roared and curled, heat surging in incessant waves. It was getting close. Soon, he wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe. It was a miracle they hadn\u2019t already been engulfed, for the fire seemed to lick and devour, but its speed had slowed. Something seemed to keep it at bay.</p><p>\u201cLucifer!\u201d he bellowed again.</p><p>And then there he was, the Fiend, the devil, there in his mind. \u201cYou have the temerity to call me back after breaking our contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me once if I loved Meg enough to save her,\u201d he said...or, more likely, thought, for this was a dream just as the other had been. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, but now I understand. Once again, I give you my soul, but this time, I do not give you hers. You have me, but she is untouched. Do it now, you bastard. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>Luce smiled that warm, tempting smile and his eyes narrowed. \u201cIt is always gratifying when the most God-fearing turn to me. I\u2019ll have you back, Dimitri. I\u2019ll have you back.\u201d He stretched out his hand to replace his Mark, and searing pain, a shock of white light, blazed in the darkness. Dimitri caught a glimpse of Wayren and thought, Too late...</p><p>And then he was falling.</p><p>22</p><p>OUR HEROES IN DARKNESS</p><p>Maia felt rather than saw the flash of white light from behind closed eyes, and heard a loud crashing splinter. Corvindale\u2019s arms were around her, and suddenly they were falling, tumbling into nothing.</p><p>They landed on hard, cold ground with hardly a jolt. Coughing, wiping her gritty eyes, Maia struggled out of Corvindale\u2019s grip and realized she could breathe.</p><p>It took her only a moment to ascertain that they\u2019d fallen through the floor of the burning building, and were now in some sort of cellar. The fire raged above them, and would soon burn through the rest of the floor, but for now they were safe from smoke and flame. It didn\u2019t surprise her that a strong stench of refuse was mixed with smoke and burning wood, and she suspected that there was a cesspool close by, for that was the purpose of cellars such as this. But perhaps, pray God, there was also a way out. Even if it were through the waste.</p><p>Regardless, they were out of the fire. Miraculously, safely. At least, for now.</p><p>Except that Corvindale wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>Maia crawled up next to him, tugging at his soot-streaked arm and touching his sweaty, filthy face. The light was dim, but the fire cast a yellow glow from above and when his eyes fluttered and his head moved, she could have cried with relief.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said, shaking him urgently. \u201cWe have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and she saw in the dim light that he\u2019d opened his eyes. \u201cMaia,\u201d he murmured in a smoke-roughened voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologies later,\u201d she said, wincing as an ominous rumble sounded above. Something fell from the wooden slats that formed their ceiling, landing nearby and making the hole above larger. \u201cWe have to find a way out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe,\u201d he said, struggling to his feet, his eyes never leaving her. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>He was too tall to stand upright in the small space, but, crouching, he gathered her up to him, touched a quick, tender kiss to her mouth, and then pulled her against him in a tight embrace. She felt the tremors in his arms and torso and breathed in the scent of his salty, sooty, masculine skin, burying her face in the coarse hairs of his chest.</p><p>After a moment, he released her and, still holding her arm, began to look around. But Maia had already noticed the way the tendrils of smoke seemed to be drawn toward a particular corner.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she told him, just as he pointed in the same direction and said, \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>His hand steadying her, they picked their way, leaving the small glow of light and stepping into the dark. It was like ink, black everywhere, close and damp and small. Maia didn\u2019t like it. Something furry scuttled near her foot, and once, she stepped on something that squished and moved, but she stifled the little shrieks that threatened and soldiered on, clutching Corvindale\u2019s arm.</p><p>Her thoughts were spinning, filled with so much to comprehend and absorb that she couldn\u2019t allow her mind to focus on anything except getting out. When they were safe, she\u2019d sort it all out and be with the man she loved.</p><p>Who loved her, too.</p><p>That thought she couldn\u2019t keep submerged, and a flowering warmth started through her limbs, strengthening her wobbly legs and aching body. She\u2019d get out. Because Corvindale\u2014Dimitri Gavril, the Earl of Corvindale\u2014loved her.</p><p>At last, there was a shift in the air and the faintest buffet of cooler breeze. They were close. The impossible darkness eased into dark gray shapes that grew more and more defined as they went on.</p><p>A little splash told her they\u2019d found water, and at first she was concerned it was one of the sewage channels. But there was no accompanying stench, and as it grew deeper, rising to her ankles, she realized it was a relatively clean stream running from the nearby wharf.</p><p>They slogged through water now nearly to her waist, drawn by the light, navigating blindly through the river along uneven rocks, slippery with algae. One of the rocks moved suddenly, scudding against another, and the uneven surface sent them slipping and plunging into the water, which was suddenly up to her shoulders.</p><p>Maia knew how to swim, and she didn\u2019t regret the sudden dunking. When she came up, her hair dripping in her face, she felt cooler and cleaner. She ducked back under again, glad to rinse away the remains of blood and smoke, and the sensation of violating lips and fangs. Relief rushed through her when Corvindale emerged, as well, whipping his wet hair back with a sharp toss of his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked, reaching for her hand as she found a stable rock or brick to stand on. The light was growing stronger by the moment. The sun must be rising above.</p><p>\u201cIt feels good,\u201d she said, her voice still rusty from the smoke. \u201cThe water was refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is one thing even I cannot argue with,\u201d he replied, and his hands were on her shoulders as he looked down at her. \u201cMaia, I\u2019m sorry. For all of this.\u201d</p><p>She was now able to see the water dripping from his brows and hair, and the odd set to his face. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand it, didn\u2019t understand why he looked so stricken. They\u2019d escaped the fire, they were nearly free, he\u2019d admitted his feelings for her and he certainly knew how she felt about him. Why did he look as if something terrible had occurred?</p><p>Beyond that, she was certain that something miraculous had happened there, during the fire. She knew that Voss had become mortal after some horrible incident involving Angelica, and part of her believed\u2014and hoped\u2014the same had just happened to Corvindale.</p><p>How else could he have approached her, as she sat wrapped in rubies?</p><p>Only moments before he came to her, she\u2019d seen him, seizing and fighting what must have been unimaginable pain, screaming in tortured agony...and then collapsing on the ground in the midst of the fire. She\u2019d seen a blast of darkness, a shock of light, a sort of searing, sizzling explosion as he lay there, unmoving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d thought he was dead.</p><p>And then he\u2019d awakened and come to her.</p><p>\u201cMaia,\u201d he said again, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of saying her name. \u201cI love you. But I can\u2019t...\u201d He cut himself off, pulling her against his warm, wet body and covering her mouth with his. She met him eagerly, tasting cool, fresh water and feeling it dripping between them, seeping through their clothing as his heat flowed into her. Her hands planted on the sleek planes of his chest, sliding through the dark hair and over the tops of his shoulders.</p> <p>His lips were soft and needy, fitting to hers, nibbling and caressing with tenderness and an underlying desperation. The arrogance and confidence from previous kisses was gone...this felt like the apology he\u2019d been trying to make. And a severing, a farewell.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t him. This wasn\u2019t the earl who took what he wanted on his own terms. Who begrudged every bit of softness.</p><p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she said, pulling away to look up at him. \u201cGavril. What is it?\u201d</p><p>His face was damp, his eyes hooded. \u201cSomething happened in there, Maia. Something...terrible.\u201d He glanced toward the light, which had become even stronger.</p><p>She could see the faint outline of a stone jutting out, and realized that the tunnel and the river turned just ahead, and that there was safety. Escape. And it was daylight. There would be no vampires waiting for them. She could find covering for Gavril...if she needed to.</p> <p>He drew her to the edge of the underground stream where the water was only just to her knees and settled her on a stable rock. He stood next to her, water trailing in rivulets down his face, plopping steadily to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get to you. She\u2014Lerina\u2014knew that, she knew I couldn\u2019t, once I got through the fire. That\u2019s something perhaps even you don\u2019t know, Maia, my love,\u201d he said, the hint of an affectionate smile curving his lips. But only for a moment, then it was gone and the harsh, stone-faced earl was back. \u201cThe Dracule are impervious to fire. So she knew I could find you...and then she knew I could do nothing when I came upon the rubies. She meant for me to watch you die. She knew it, even before I admitted it to myself, that I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came to me,\u201d she said, reaching to touch his cheek, certain. She remembered the calm presence that had wrapped itself around her during that entire event, once she awakened in the chair to see him struggling toward her. All will be well, had said a voice in her mind. The force seemed to swirl around the chamber, whisking in the air to keep the fire at bay, and the smoke from becoming too thick. It had been pale and golden and peaceful.</p><p>\u201cYou got past the rubies,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething happened...I saw it. There was a flash of light, like an explosion, or a shock of lightning.\u201d</p><p>A grimace tightened his face and he closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them again, she saw that they were flat and dark. Empty. \u201cI broke the covenant. I separated myself from Lucifer and became mortal.\u201d</p><p>Joy rushed through her...then stopped. Why was he still stricken, upset? \u201cIs that not what you\u2019ve wanted? Is there something else?\u201d</p> <p>What if, by leaving Lucifer\u2019s covenant, he had to do something else? Like...die? What if there was some sort of punishment?</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I wanted. Until I realized that I couldn\u2019t... I couldn\u2019t save you. I\u2019d saved my soul, but I couldn\u2019t save you. We were trapped in there, and the only way I could get you out was to become immortal again. To bind myself to him again.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s breath stopped and her heart thudded. \u201cYou...\u201d She couldn\u2019t form the words, she could hardly comprehend it. \u201cYou went back to him...to save me?\u201d Horror and shock had her clutching his shoulders, her fingers digging into the muscles there as she stared up at him, disbelieving. \u201cNo, no, you wouldn\u2019t have done that.... You couldn\u2019t have done that. You know what it meant.\u201d</p><p>His face had become stone, his countenance devoid of emotion. \u201cMaia. I had to. I couldn\u2019t let you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all die, Corvindale. We all die. How could you give up your soul for...me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, his broad shoulders moving beneath her hands, his face placid. But his eyes were now well-illuminated by the sun streaming from around the bend in the tunnel, and she saw how they burned with emotion. \u201cWhen one finds real love, one does anything to protect it.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head, tears filling her eyes. The last bit of relief and joy had sagged away, now a heavy burden settled over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAnd so,\u201d he said, his voice flat and earlish once again, \u201cI won\u2019t be going out there with you.\u201d He gestured toward the light.</p> <p>\u201cCorvindale,\u201d she began, but he held up a hand to stop her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cFor once, please don\u2019t argue with me, Maia.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and then pulled him down for another kiss. Her fingers slid over his chest, up along the strong cords of his neck as he pushed her against the damp stone wall with his body. That sharp flutter of pleasure started in her belly and spread down, flushing out, but was tempered by sorrow.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his wet hair, sliding up along his neck and shoulders...and then she stopped. Pulled away, her heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d she said, pushing at him. \u201cTurn around, Corvindale.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his face darkening, but then it eased as he turned, one of his hands going up to touch the back of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d she said, smoothing her hand over his back. \u201cThe marking is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d he said, his face stunned. \u201cIt can\u2019t be. I gave myself...I called him back to me. He raised his hand to touch me\u2014\u201d Then he halted. \u201cShe stopped him.\u201d He was looking into the distance, his eyes focused on something Maia couldn\u2019t see. His breathing changed, roughened and hurried. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t too late,\u201d he whispered. \u201cShe stopped him.\u201d</p><p>And then, for the first time Maia could ever remember, the Earl of Corvindale smiled.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>LENNING\u2019S TANNERY EXPANDS</p><p>Nearly a month later...</p><p>\u201cI simply don\u2019t understand how you can be so calm about it all,\u201d Maia said, planting her hands on her hips. She was looking up at Corvindale, who\u2019d become Gavril to her in both mind and heart. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting holes in your house. Big holes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed, they are, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he replied. But now, when he called her by her formal name, there was a layer of intimacy, of verbal caressing over the syllables. \u201cBlackmont Hall is so dark and dim, most particularly my study, that I want more windows. Larger ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there is dust everywhere. And flies are coming in. And the noise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we could have waited to have it done while we were on our honeymoon,\u201d said the Earl of Corvindale, looking down at the future Lady Corvindale, \u201cbut I have lived in darkness for so long, I didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. And God knows when your brother will return from Scotland to attend the festivities.\u201d</p><p>Maia\u2019s heart shifted as it always did when she realized just what he\u2019d been through, and what he\u2019d given for her. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, blinking sharply at a sudden sting of tears.</p><p>\u201cHow foolish of me to complain.\u201d What man could give more for the woman he loved?</p><p>She smiled and returned to the stack of books she\u2019d been sifting through in hopes of organizing his bookshelves now that the room was being renovated. Perhaps her propensity for easy tears and sensitivity to dust and noise had to do with the fact that she\u2019d just missed her monthly flux. And like everything else in her life, it was normally ordered and regular.</p><p>\u201cWait a moment,\u201d Gavril said, curving his strong fingers around her arm and turning her back to face him. \u201cIs there something wrong, Miss Woodmore?\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him in surprise. \u201cNo, indeed. I couldn\u2019t be happier. Truly.\u201d</p><p>A little quirk touched the corners of his beautiful lips. \u201cBut you aren\u2019t arguing with me. You\u2019ve agreed with me. Are you quite certain nothing is wrong?\u201d</p><p>Maia laughed. She pulled her arm away and patted him on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m certain nothing is wrong.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to tell him until she was certain. \u201cBut if you prefer that I argue with you, perhaps I ought to take you to task on this disaster.\u201d She gestured to the pile of books that reached from her hip to her shoulder. \u201cDid you realize you have five copies of the same volume of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies, but none of his comedies?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and ran his elegant fingers over one of the spines. \u201cBut that was purposeful, my dear. I was in no mood to read the likes of Two Gentlemen from Verona or As You Like It for the last century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo instead you buried yourself with Hamlet and Macbeth.\u201d She gave a little sniff, but a smile lingered around her mouth. Then, suddenly, she found her eyes getting a bit damp again. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate you weren\u2019t following in the footsteps of poor, tragic Romeo &amp; Juliet,\u201d she said, looking at the dog-eared pages of that play.</p><p>\u201cThere never were two more foolish lovers,\u201d he said arrogantly. \u201cIf they\u2019d merely used a bit of sense, both of them would have been alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t so different, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cSelling your soul back again to the devil. Then where would we have been? You shackled to him after trying to rid yourself for over a century.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, his face settling into that flat, stubborn expression. \u201cI did what I had to do to save you, Maia. I\u2019d do it again, even if it hadn\u2019t worked out as well as it has. And it has all worked out quite well, has it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite clear on how it did, precisely, work out,\u201d she said, the dratted tears hovering in the corners of her eyes again. He really was the most amazing, loving man.</p><p>But how had it happened? Was it because he\u2019d known the hell and torture he was taking on again when he made the sacrifice for her, calling Lucifer back to him? Because he knew precisely what he was giving up this time? That had made the sacrifice all the more meaningful...giving up what he\u2019d wanted more than anything in the world to take the burden back again. That must have been how Wayren had been able to stop him from making the covenant a second time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t know for certain, but it made sense, in its own strange way.</p><p>And Lerina was dead, thanks to Lord Eddersley, who\u2019d taken it upon himself to skewer the horrible woman when he arrived on the scene. Alexander Bradington had scuttled off into the night like the snake he was\u2014athough Maia hadn\u2019t said that aloud, for surely Gavril would remind her that snakes didn\u2019t scuttle. They slithered.</p><p>Nevertheless, he\u2019d assured her that Alexander was long gone to the Continent, and probably beyond, where he was safe from Chas\u2019s vengeful stake (at least for the time being) and Gavril\u2019s own fury.</p> <p>\u201cAre you truly free of Lucifer, even though you called him to you and offered yourself?\u201d she asked, blinking hard.</p><p>Gavril nodded and took the book from her hand. \u201cI am. I\u2019m free and mortal and my soul is my own again. Thanks to you, my dear Miss Woodmore. For nagging me into loving you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him archly, heaving up the heavy stack of books. \u201cI didn\u2019t nag you into loving me. You already did. I merely nagged you into admitting it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, a low, deep sound that sent a delicious little tingle deep in her belly. \u201cThat might be the case. But,\u201d he continued, taking the books firmly from her hands, \u201cI think it\u2019s your turn for an admission. That you shouldn\u2019t be carrying such a heavy burden.\u201d He gestured with the stack of books.</p><p>Maia looked up at him, her cheeks warming a bit. \u201cWhatever do you mean, Lord Corvindale?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you\u2019ve got another burden to carry, and a much more important one, being a future earl.\u201d</p><p>The blush went full-blown and she smiled. \u201cWell, it\u2019s possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been a bit busy since you sold your soul for me.\u201d</p><p>The light that came into his face was like nothing she\u2019d ever seen before: a bit of wonder, a bit of surprise, a lot of love and a twinge of chagrin. \u201cI do love you, Miss Woodmore,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t be happier that I got my soul back to share it with you. So please don\u2019t lift anything heavy for the next nine months, my darling. Promise me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall endeavor to do my best,\u201d she said, not meaning a word of it. \u201cParticularly since you used the very unearlish word please.\u201d</p><p>Then, as was his way, even now, the softness in his face ebbed a bit. \u201cAnd now that we have that settled, I find that I am overdue in a trip to my favorite antiquarian bookstore.\u201d</p><p>Maia knew the one he spoke of, of course. \u201cNo more trips to buy Faustian legend, I presume?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo indeed,\u201d he said, a little bit of a smile twitching his mouth again. \u201cBut I find I am missing several volumes of Shakespeare. In fact, I\u2019m particularly interested in one comedy in particular.\u201d His eyes danced.</p><p>\u201cAnd which one is that?\u201d she asked, although she was already laughing, for she knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cThe Taming of the Shrew.\u201d</p><p>The little antiquarian bookshop was gone.</p><p>Gavril wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>In the place where Wayren\u2019s narrow little establishment had once been was a window that showed nothing but the interior of the tannery.</p><p>After a moment of wry contemplation, and peering into the dusty window to see the tanner stropping a piece of leather, Gavril turned away. Instead of climbing back into his carriage, ducking under the fanlike awning, he walked down the street in the sun.</p><p>Smiling.</p>  </body></html>"]
