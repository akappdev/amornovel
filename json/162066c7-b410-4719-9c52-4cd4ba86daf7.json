She arched into the familiar touch with a purr of delight, a smile curving her lips as she floated up to total awareness.</p><p>\u201cNeshama,\u201d her mate murmured.</p><p>My soul. Just as he was hers.</p> <p>With her eyes stil closed, she rol ed to her back and stretched, pushing her naked breasts up to Charron in deliberate provocation.</p><p>The velvet lash of his tongue across her nipple startled her, eliciting a gasp that dropped her back onto the mattress. Her eyes opened in time to see his beautiful y etched lips surround the hardened point and his cheeks hol ow on a deep, long suckle. She groaned, her body eagerly responding to the attentions of the man for whom she drew every breath.</p><p>She moved to clutch his golden head to her breast, but he straightened, making her aware that he stood beside the bed rather than lay upon it.</p><p>The sight of his ful y dressed body told her why he\u2019d woken her.</p><p>Towering over her sprawled, bared body, he stared down at her with heated eyes. The fangs peeping through his wicked smile betrayed that he, too, had become aroused by the way he\u2019d woken her.</p> <p>Her heart raced at that smile. Her chest ached from the surfeit of emotion he inspired in her. She\u2019d lost everything; at times she stil felt phantom twinges from the wings that had been severed from her back, but Char had fil ed the subsequent hole inside her. Now he was everything to her, the reason she rose every day.</p><p>\u201cSave that thought,\u201d he said in his richly resonant voice. \u201cI\u2019l sate your hunger when I return.\u201d</p><p>Vash pushed up onto her elbows. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He finished strapping on the twin katana scabbards that crisscrossed his back. \u201cWe have a patrol that didn\u2019t check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed, knowing how much time Char had invested in training the fledgling, but the kid couldn\u2019t seem to fol ow orders.</p><p>Char glanced at her before securing a gun holster to his thigh. \u201cI know you think he hasn\u2019t demonstrated sufficient accountability.\u201d</p><p>Swinging her legs off the side of the mattress, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t just think it. He\u2019s proven it. Over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to please you, Vashti. He\u2019s ambitious. Ice doesn\u2019t leave his posts to play. He leaves because he thinks he can be more valuable elsewhere. If an opportunity to impress you presents itself, he\u2019l make the attempt. He\u2019s probably tracking a rogue now or trying to eavesdrop on lycans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be impressed if he fol owed commands without insubordination.\u201d Standing, Vash stretched, then sighed as her mate came to her and stroked his elegant hands down the sides of her torso. \u201cAnd he\u2019s pul ing you out of our bed. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeshama, someone has to pul me from it. Otherwise, I would never leave it.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and pressed her face into the leather vest that hugged his lean chest. Breathing him in, she thought again that he was worth fal ing for. If she could relive making the choice between her wings and her love for Charron, she would have no doubts or hesitation about repeating her \u201cmistake.\u201d The curse of vampirism was a smal price to pay to have him. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Tilting his head, he pressed his cheek to her crown. \u201cTorque says no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot his cal to make.\u201d She pul ed back, her eyes narrowed. Torque was Syre\u2019s son, but she was the Fal en leader\u2019s lieutenant. When it came to the Fal en and their minions\u2014col ectively, vampires\u2014only Syre could gainsay her. Even Char had to take orders from her, which he did graceful y for a man who commanded others by nature.</p><p>\u201cHe has a demon problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. He should be able to take care of it.\u201d Yes, hunting the demons who preyed on vampires was her job. No one was better at it than she was, but she couldn\u2019t be everywhere al the time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s another one of Asmodeus\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she is. Damn it. Three times in two weeks? He\u2019s fucking with us.\u201d That changed things up. Taking down a demon in the direct line of a king of hel was a bit more political y involved. Vash had a reputation for being a wild card; she\u2019d take the heat without casting as much of a shadow on Syre as his offspring would. And now she was pissed off enough to want to deal with it herself. They may have fal en, but they weren\u2019t easy targets.</p><p>Char pressed a kiss to her forehead, then released her. \u201cI\u2019l be back before dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore dark...?\u201d A quick glance at the bedroom window and she understood. \u201cIt\u2019s dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His face was as grim as she knew hers must be.</p><p>Ice wasn\u2019t one of the Fal en, as she and Charron were. He was a mortal who\u2019d been Changed, which meant he was photosensitive. Regardless of his overeager nature, he should\u2019ve checked in before sunrise. Now he\u2019d have to hunker down somewhere until dusk came or Char found him, whichever came first. A few sips of Char\u2019s potent Fal en blood would afford a temporary immunity that would get the errant minion home.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered,\u201d she began, pul ing back, \u201cthat it might be wise to let him stew it out? How wil he learn, if he never faces the consequences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce isn\u2019t a child.\u201d</p><p>Vash shot him a look that chal enged that pronouncement. Ice might be nearly as broad and tal as her mate, but he lacked Char\u2019s steely control, leaving him as impulsive as a kid. \u201cI think you\u2019re projecting traits onto him that he doesn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s about time you trusted my judgment.\u201d His returning gaze dared her to keep pushing.</p><p>It was a look no one else would even consider giving her, and not just because of her rank. While it goaded her obstinacy, she appreciated her mate\u2019s wil ingness to confront her when he felt strongly about something. It was his ability to separate how he treated her as a superior officer and how he treated her as a woman that first stirred deeper feelings in her, during a time when the humanity she\u2019d been sent to observe had begun to spread like a stain inside her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t pinpoint when her feelings for him had deepened. One day, Charron had been just another Watcher angel like her, one of the seraphim sent to earth to report on man\u2019s progress to the Creator. The next, his smile had taken her breath away, and the sight of his powerful y graceful body had caused places low in her bel y to clench. His gilded beauty\u2014his gold-and-cream-colored wings, his tawny skin and hair, and his piercing, flame blue eyes\u2014had morphed from being a mere testament to the skil of the Creator to being an irresistible lure to her newly awakened feminine hunger.</p><p>Hiding her new awareness of him had been torturous, but she\u2019d done it for a time, embarrassed by her mortal weakness and unwil ing to taint him with it. When he\u2019d succeeded in cornering her, then seducing her, he\u2019d taken her with white-hot determination, and she had fal en from grace into his arms with ful awareness of the consequences. She hadn\u2019t shed a tear or made a sound when the avenging Sentinel angels had severed the wings from her back, turning her into the Fal en bloodsucker she was today. She had, however, begged and pleaded for mercy for Charron, and she\u2019d cried the sobs of the heartbroken when they\u2019d stripped him of his gorgeous wings, too.</p><p>His touch on her face brought her out of her memories, returning her to the present and the man whose eyes were now the gleaming amber of a soul ess vampire. \u201cWhere do you go,\u201d he asked softly, \u201cwhen you drift away from me like that?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved on one side. \u201cI was tel ing myself how stupid it is to be irritated by your compassion and desire to mentor when I fel in love with you for those very traits. Among many others.\u201d</p><p>Char fisted his hand in her long hair, bringing the crimson strands to his lips. \u201cI remember you in flight, Vashti. When I close my eyes, I can stil see you with the sun at your back, its light shining off your emerald feathers. You were a jewel to me, with your ruby hair and sapphire eyes. I ached whenever I saw you. The need to touch you, taste you, push inside you was a physical pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry, my love?\u201d she teased, although the levity in her tone was marred by the huskiness of deep emotion. He knew her so wel . Read her thoughts so easily. He was her other half, the best part of her. While she was temperamental and capricious, he was levelheaded and constant.</p><p>When she was impatient and easily frustrated, he was reassuring and forward thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou are far more valuable and desirable to me now than you were then.\u201d His forehead dropped lightly to hers. \u201cBecause now you\u2019re mine. Total y and completely. As I am yours. With al my faults and traits that annoy you.\u201d</p><p>Catching him with a hand at his nape, she took his mouth in a deep, lush kiss that curled her toes and quickened her breathing.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The words were spoken against his lips, her hands clutching him with the strength of al the joy inside her. It was too much sometimes, overflowing and clogging her throat with tears of gratitude. She was embarrassed by the strength of her feelings for her mate. He was in her thoughts at nearly every waking moment and many of her sleeping ones as wel .</p><p>\u201cI love you, my dearest Vashti.\u201d He crushed her naked body to him. \u201cI know you\u2019ve given me considerable leeway with Ice, against your better judgment. I think it\u2019s time I repaid you by listening to your counsel and reining him back.\u201d</p><p>She adored that about him, too, his sense of fairness and ability to bend when appropriate. \u201cYou deal with him, I\u2019l deal with Torque\u2019s problem, and tonight we\u2019l drop off the map for a couple days. We\u2019ve both been working hard lately. We\u2019ve earned a break.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping his hand gently around her throat, he smiled. Eyes bright with sensual promise and affection, he murmured, \u201cWith an incentive like that, I\u2019l make damn sure I\u2019m home early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l see how cooperative Ice is with that. He might have his ass hidden in the most out-of-the-fucking-way place imaginable.\u201d</p><p>He arched a chastising brow for her ribbing, but vowed, \u201cNothing could keep me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not.\u201d She turned away and wiggled her ass at him. \u201cNeither of you wants me hunting you down...\u201d</p><p>By noon, Vashti was sashaying into Syre\u2019s office with a memento from her latest hunt in hand. The vampire leader wasn\u2019t alone, but she felt no hesitation in interrupting. The woman with him was one of countless human females who\u2019d caught Syre\u2019s eye and lost it just as quickly. It didn\u2019t matter if they were forewarned or not; they never believed he was completely unattainable until they experienced his dismissal firsthand. He was a passionate man, but physical enthusiasm was no sign of deeper interest. Syre had lost his wings for love, then he\u2019d lost the woman he had given them up for.</p><p>\u201cSyre.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her with the heavy-lidded gaze that drove women crazy. He stood with arms crossed and his hip canted into the short built-in bookcase behind his desk. Dressed in black tailored slacks and black silk tie paired with a crisp white dress shirt, he was both elegant and devastatingly attractive. His inky dark hair and warm, caramel-hued skin made him exotic in a way that was impossible to classify. Eastern European, some guessed. Syre had been favored once, much loved by the Creator. It was why, she believed, their fal had been punished so harshly\u2014he\u2019d had a very lofty perch to tumble from.</p><p>\u201cVashti,\u201d he greeted, his voice as throaty and warm as whiskey. \u201cThings go wel ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The blonde who\u2019d been overstaying her welcome shot daggers at Vash, as most of his lovers did. They mistook the connection between her and her superior officer as something far more than it was. Their relationship was personal and priceless, but it wasn\u2019t intimate or romantic. Vash would give her life for Syre\u2019s in an instant, but the love she bore him sprang only from respect, loyalty, and the knowledge that he would die as readily for her.</p><p>She gave the woman a sympathetic smile, but spoke bluntly, as was her way. \u201cDon\u2019t cal him; he\u2019l cal you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti,\u201d Syre admonished in a warning tone. He was too much of a gentleman to make the clean breaks that would spare him a lot of messy confrontations.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have such qualms. \u201cHe wanted you, he had you, and you had a good time. There\u2019s nothing else beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d the lovely blonde shot back. \u201cHis pimp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That would make you a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Vashti.\u201d Syre\u2019s voice cracked like a whip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so jealous,\u201d the blonde hissed, her perfect features contorting from her frustration and hurt. Her emotional spil age contrasted sharply with her pristine, perfect exterior. Her sleek chignon, fashionable pil box hat, and tidy feminine suit were so cool compared to her heated response. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand that he\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, the woman couldn\u2019t have been farther from the truth. Vash would give up everything but Charron to see her commander happy again. If it would have made a difference to do so, she would have pointed out what a striking couple they made\u2014the regal blonde and the debonair dark prince. But the heart Syre\u2019s mortal wife had awakened in him had died along with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to save you from weeks of humiliating yourself,\u201d Vash said as kindly as possible.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane,\u201d Syre said firmly, straightening and moving to catch her by the elbow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have to end our pleasurable association so abruptly, but I can\u2019t al ow anyone to speak to Vashti in that manner.\u201d</p><p>Diane\u2019s cornflower blue eyes widened and her painted mouth formed an astonished O. She stumbled along beside him as he led her out of the room. \u201cBut you al ow her to talk to me the way she did? How can you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Syre returned, alone, his handsome features were grim. \u201cYou\u2019re in a mood today,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cI just saved you from a week or more of begging and pleading. You\u2019re welcome. And you need a mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sexual proclivities are none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mental wel -being is,\u201d she shot back. \u201cFind someone whose company you enjoy and keep her around. Let her look after you a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the complication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\u201d She dropped into one of the seats in front of his desk, her hands smoothing her sleek khaki pants. \u201cI\u2019m talking about a business arrangement. I don\u2019t understand it myself, but there are some women who can have sex just because it\u2019s fun. Set one up in a nice place and give her an al owance.\u201d</p><p>Syre shook his head. \u201cYou are becoming my pimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m insulted by even the concept of fucking a woman who feels obligated to comply.\u201d</p> <p>Her brow arched. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a woman alive who would find it a chore.\u201d Even she, a woman who was happily mated to the love of her life, wasn\u2019t immune to Syre\u2019s sexual appeal. He was the kind of man that hit a woman right between the eyes every time she saw him. Sensuous, seductive, hypnotic.</p><p>\u201cYou wil cease talking about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. You need someone to care about you, Samyaza.\u201d</p><p>The use of his angelic name thrust home her seriousness. His gaze sharpened and narrowed as he sank into his chair behind the desk. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say love you. Care about you. Someone to make you coffee in the morning, just the way you like it. Someone to watch a rerun on television with you. You know, just someone who\u2019s around who knows you and wants good things for you.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, he set his elbows on the armrests and steepled his fingertips together. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to explain you at times. Explain what you are to me. I haven\u2019t come up with the right answer yet. You are my second, but you\u2019re not merely a subordinate officer to me. We\u2019re more than friends, yet I don\u2019t view you as a sister. I love you, but I\u2019m not in love with you. I am aware of your beauty as any man would be, yet I\u2019m not interested in sleeping with you. You are the most important woman in my life and I\u2019d be utterly lost without you, but I would never want to cohabitate with you.</p> <p>What are you to me, Vashti? What gives you the right to discuss such personal matters with me?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Categorizing what they were to each other was something she\u2019d never done. For her, their relationship just...was. She was an extension of him in many ways.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your right hand,\u201d she decided, then she tossed him the object she held.</p><p>He caught it deftly, his reflexes quick and agile. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf of a charm I took off Asmodeus\u2019s lackey. I left the other half on the pile of ashes she turned into when I kil ed her. When it was whole, it bore Asmodeus\u2019s sigil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taunting him.\u201d</p><p>Vash shook her head. \u201cThree in two weeks? That\u2019s not a coincidence. He\u2019s al owing, maybe even encouraging, his underlings to toy with us.</p><p>We\u2019re a prize\u2014angels who were thrown away like garbage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have enough enemies as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we have jailers\u2014the Sentinels and their lycan dogs. The demons are possible enemies, if we don\u2019t correct them. We have to take a stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way I would see things handled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. That\u2019s why you put me in charge of dealing with demon annoyances.\u201d She crossed her legs. \u201cYou can shake on a truce with your other hand. I\u2019m the hand that flips them off.\u201d</p><p>A commotion in the hal way pushed her swiftly to her feet. Vash moved to the open doorway with preternatural speed, beating Syre by a mere mil isecond.</p><p>What she saw froze her blood.</p><p>Raze and Salem carried an al -too-familiar body into the house, making a beeline for the dining room, where they laid him on the long oval table.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d she snapped, entering the room and staring at Ice\u2019s motionless body. The minion\u2019s skin was burned black in places and blistered al over. Blood soaked his T-shirt and stained his jeans to the knees. Tears in his clothing revealed the clawing marks of lupine paws.</p><p>His hand reached out lightning quick, caging her wrist. He opened bloodshot eyes. \u201cChar...help...\u201d</p><p>For a moment the room spun, then everything drew inward, coalescing in frigid clarity. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld mil . Lycans...Help him...\u201d</p><p>Yanking one of Raze\u2019s blades free of the scabbard on his back, Vash spun on her heel and raced into the gloaming.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Elijah Reynolds stood naked on a rock in the woods surrounding Navajo Lake and watched his dreams burn along with the decimated outpost below him. Acrid black smoke plumed into the air in wide, thick funnels that could be seen for miles.</p><p>The angels would know a rebel ion had begun long before they reached the ruins.</p><p>Around him, lycans yipped with celebratory joy, but he felt none of it. He was cold and dead inside, his life as he\u2019d known it scorched to embers in the smoldering devastation that had once been his home. He excel ed at one thing: hunting vampires. Doing what he enjoyed came from working for the Sentinels\u2014the most elite of al warrior angels. That indentured servitude, while chafing, was a smal price to pay to do what he loved. But very few lycans felt the same, which had led to this result. Everything that mattered to him was gone, and what was left was a battle for independence his heart wasn\u2019t invested in waging.</p><p>But it was done and couldn\u2019t be undone. He\u2019d live with it.</p><p>\u201cAlpha.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s jaw clenched at the designation he\u2019d never wanted. He glanced at the nude woman who approached him. \u201cRachel.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lowered.</p><p>He waited for her to speak, then realized she was doing the same in reverse. \u201cNow you want to fol ow orders?\u201d</p><p>Her hands linked behind her back and her head dropped. Irritated by her lack of conviction, he turned away. He\u2019d told her a revolt was suicide.</p><p>The Sentinels would hunt them, exterminate them. The lycans\u2019 one purpose for existence was to serve the angels; if they no longer did that, they no longer had a place in the world. But she wouldn\u2019t listen. She and her mate, Micah\u2014Elijah\u2019s best friend\u2014had incited the others to this act of sheer fucking stupidity.</p><p>He sensed the approaching male lycan before he heard him. Turning his head, Elijah watched a golden wolf step into view, then shift midstride into the form of a tal , blond man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rounded up those with self-preservation instincts, Alpha,\u201d Stephan said.</p><p>Which confirmed Elijah\u2019s suspicion that some had fled the battle without considering the brutal days certain to lie ahead. Or perhaps some of the smarter ones had returned to the Sentinels. He wouldn\u2019t hold it against them.</p><p>\u201cMontana?\u201d Rachel asked hopeful y.</p><p>He shook his head, reminding himself that he\u2019d promised Micah on his deathbed that she\u2019d be looked after. \u201cWe\u2019d never make it that far.</p><p>Sentinels wil be breathing down our necks within hours.\u201d</p><p>One of the Sentinels had flown away during the conflict, blue wings spread wide as she raced to report the uprising. The rest had stayed and fought, but the razor-sharp tips of their wings had offered too little protection against the size of the Navajo Lake pack, which had needed thinning for months. Seriously outnumbered, the Sentinels had fought to the death, knowing that\u2019s what their captain, Adrian, would do and expect. During the weeks that Elijah had been a member of Adrian\u2019s pack, he\u2019d seen for himself how tenacious and committed the Sentinel leader was. Only one thing could split Adrian\u2019s focus, and even she couldn\u2019t dul the angel\u2019s kil er instinct.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a network of caves near Bryce Canyon.\u201d Elijah turned his back to the Navajo Lake outpost for the last time. \u201cWe\u2019l hole up there until we\u2019re organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaves?\u201d Rachel asked, scowling.</p><p>\u201cThis was no victory, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>She flinched away from the undercurrent of anger in his tone. \u201cWe\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were hunters and now we\u2019re prey. That\u2019s not an improvement. We kicked the Sentinels when they were already down. They were outnumbered twenty-to-one, taken by surprise, and lacking Adrian, who\u2019s dealing with so much shit right now his head isn\u2019t ful y in the game. This was a one-shot, one-kil deal.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s shoulders went back, thrusting her smal breasts forward. Nudity was nothing to a lycan; flesh or fur, it was al the same. \u201cAnd we took it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. Now trust me to handle the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what Micah wanted, El.\u201d</p><p>Elijah sighed, his anger swal owed by a tide of regret and grief. \u201cI know what he wanted\u2014a home in the suburbs, a nine-to-five job, carpools, and play dates. I would do anything to give you that dream...to give it to any other lycan with a wish for the same...but it\u2019s impossible. You\u2019ve dumped a task in my lap that I failed before I began, because there\u2019s no way for me to succeed.\u201d</p><p>And they couldn\u2019t know what that failure cost him. He would never say. He could only make the best of what he had to work with and try to keep those who were now dependent on him alive.</p><p>He looked at Stephan. \u201cI want teams of two sent to the other outposts. Preferably mated pairs.\u201d</p><p>Mates would protect each other to the death. In times like these, when they would be hunted while separated from their pack, they\u2019d need al the support they could get.</p><p>\u201cNotify as many lycans as possible,\u201d he went on, rol ing his shoulders back to ease the tension in his neck. \u201cAdrian wil cut off outside communication to and from al the outposts\u2014cel phones, the Internet, snail mail. So the teams wil need to tackle the task directly, face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>Stephan nodded. \u201cI\u2019l see to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs to withdraw whatever money they\u2019ve got socked away before Adrian freezes their accounts.\u201d As \u201cemployees\u201d of Adrian\u2019s aviation corporation, Mitchel Aeronautics, their stipends were deposited in an employee credit union that Adrian had complete access to.</p><p>\u201cMost have already done that,\u201d Rachel said quietly.</p><p>So, she\u2019d thought that far ahead, at least. Elijah sent her off to gather the others; then he turned to Stephan. \u201cI need the two lycans you trust the most for a special assignment: Find Lindsay Gibson. I want her whereabouts and status.\u201d</p><p>Stephan\u2019s eyes widened with surprise at the mention of Adrian\u2019s mate.</p><p>Elijah struggled through the driving urge to find Lindsay himself, a mortal woman he considered a friend, the only one he had left now that Micah was dead. In so many ways, she was a mystery. She\u2019d stumbled into their lives without warning, displaying skil s no mere human should possess and garnering the Sentinel leader\u2019s attention in ways Elijah had never witnessed or heard of.</p><p>Unlike the Fal en, who had lost their wings because they\u2019d fraternized with mortals, the Sentinels were angels above reproach. The sins of the flesh and the vagaries of human emotion were far beneath their lofty stations. Elijah had never seen a Sentinel show even a flicker of desire or longing...until Adrian took one look at Lindsay Gibson and claimed her with a fierceness that surprised everyone. The Sentinel leader protected her life with more care than he did his own, putting Elijah in charge of her safety despite knowing that he was one of the rare, anomalous Alphas that were swiftly weeded out of the lycan packs.</p><p>It was during the course of his protection of Lindsay that a friendship had developed between them. Their easy camaraderie ran deep enough that they would die for each other. I\u2019d take a bullet for you, she had told him once. Not many people had friends like that and Elijah had none now but her. He may have become the lycan Alpha, but Lindsay\u2019s safety wasn\u2019t a concern he\u2019d ever relinquish. She had gone missing under the Sentinels\u2019 watch, and he wouldn\u2019t rest easy until he knew she was okay.</p><p>\u201cI want her found and safe,\u201d Elijah said, \u201cby whatever means necessary.\u201d</p><p>Stephan nodded. The unchal enged acquiescence gave Elijah the first hope that they just might have a chance in hel of surviving after al .</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A.\u201d Vash eyed the hazmat suit she held in her hand and felt a shard of icy fear pierce her gut.</p><p>Dr. Grace Petersen rubbed at one bleary eye with a fist. \u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure how the disease is transmitted. Better to be safe than sick\u2014trust me. Bad piece of business.\u201d</p><p>Pul ing on the suit, Vash forced her mind to clear out the rising panic. She focused on reviving the scholarly skil s and mindset she\u2019d been sent to earth with as a Watcher. It had been a long time since she\u2019d approached anything without the warrior\u2019s mindset she\u2019d cultivated as a vampress, but this was a battle she couldn\u2019t fight with her fangs or fists.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got bal s of steel, Gracie,\u201d she said through the receiver in her headpiece.</p><p>\u201cSo says the woman who takes on opponents the size of a double-decker bus.\u201d</p><p>Suited up, they entered the sealed antechamber of the quarantine room, then stepped through to the inner room once given the green light to do so. Inside, a man lay on an exam table as if sleeping, his features peaceful in repose. Only the intravenous lines in his arms and the rapid lift and fal of his chest betrayed his il ness.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you giving him?\u201d Vash asked. \u201cIs that blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re transfusing him, yes. We\u2019re also keeping him in a medical coma.\u201d Grace looked up at Vash through her face shield, her features weary and austere. \u201cHis name is King. When he was mortal, he went by the name of Wil iam King. He was my primary assistant until this morning, when he was bitten by one of the infected vamps we caught yesterday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt takes hold that quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends. According to preliminary reports from the field, some vamps are immune. Others take weeks to show symptoms. Stil more are like King and succumb within a matter of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are the symptoms, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMindless hunger, unreasoned aggression, and an unnatural y high tolerance for pain. We\u2019re cal ing them wraiths.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re shadows of their former selves. Lights on, no one home. Their minds and personalities are shot, but their bodies are stil cruising right along with the party. The ones I\u2019ve managed to keep alive more than a handful of days lose pigment and melanin in their hair and skin. Even their irises turn gray. And check this.\u201d</p><p>Grace brushed the bangs back from King\u2019s forehead with a gentle, slightly trembling hand. \u201cSorry, buddy,\u201d she whispered, before reaching for a corded, handheld device that looked like a retail checkout scanner. Holding his wrist, she aimed at his forearm and activated a pale bluish glow.</p><p>Ultraviolet light.</p><p>Vash bent closer, examining the targeted skin. It rippled minutely, as if the muscle beneath it was having a spasm, but that was the only sign of irritation. \u201cHoly shit. UV tolerance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Turning off the device, Grace set it aside. \u201cThere\u2019s no real immunity at work\u2014the flesh is stil burning; it\u2019s just healing at an accelerated rate. The damaged skin cel s are regenerating as quickly as they\u2019re being destroyed. Ergo, no visible or lasting damage. I ran some tests on two of the other subjects we had in here. Same deal.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes met.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get excited,\u201d Grace muttered. \u201cThat cel ular renewal is what\u2019s causing al the other symptoms. The insatiable hunger comes from the need to fuel the massive energy expenditure required for regeneration. The aggression comes from the hunger, which has to feel like starving to death\u2014 al the damn time. And the high pain tolerance comes from the fact that they can\u2019t focus on anything else but the need to feed. They can\u2019t seem to think, period. Have you seen a wraith in action?\u201d</p><p>Vash shook head.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re like frenzied zombies. Higher brain function is subverted by pure instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re transfusing him because he\u2019l die without a continuous intake of blood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI learned that the hard way. I sedated two of the captures so I could study them\u2014you can\u2019t get near them when they\u2019re ful y functional\u2014and they liquefied. Their metabolisms are so accelerated that their bodies pretty much digested themselves. Pile o\u2019 mush. Not pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that Adrian cooked this up in a lab somewhere?\u201d The Sentinel leader had been tasked with leading the elite unit of seraphim enforcers that had severed the wings from the Fal en. Using lycans as herding dogs, Adrian prevented the vampires from expanding into more widely populated areas. The result was both territorial and financial suppression.</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible, but I wouldn\u2019t have made that leap.\u201d Grace gestured at King. \u201cI can\u2019t see Adrian doing this. Not his style.\u201d</p><p>Truth be told, Vash couldn\u2019t either. Adrian was a warrior to the core. If he wanted a fight, he\u2019d do it face-to-face and hand-to-hand. But he had a lot to gain if the vampire nation withered away to nothing. His mission would be over and he could leave the earth\u2014and its pain, misery, and filth\u2014 behind. Assuming he\u2019d even want to leave now that he had Lindsay, a mate who couldn\u2019t go with him.</p><p>Softening her voice, Vash conveyed her sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your friend, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me find a cure, Vash. Help me save him and the others.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why she\u2019d come, the reason Syre had sent her. Reports of the il ness were cropping up al over the country, the spread so swift it was quickly becoming an epidemic. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore subjects, more blood, more equipment, more staff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDone. Of course. Just get me a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the easy part.\u201d Crossing her arms, Grace shot another glance at King. \u201cI need to know where the Wraith Virus first appeared. Which part of the country, which state, which town, which house, which room in the house. Down to the minutia. Male or female. Young or old. Race and build. I need you to find the very first person who got sick. Then I need you to find number two. How did they know number one? Did they live in the same house? Share the same bed? Or was the connection more tenuous? Were they blood relations? Then, find number three and four and five. We\u2019re talking six degrees of separation gone wild. I need enough data to establish a pattern and point of origin.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly feeling suffocated by the hazmat suit, Vash strode toward the door. Grace met her there and typed in the code that released the seal to the antechamber.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a hel of a lot of manpower,\u201d Vash muttered, fol owing Grace\u2019s example and standing on a painted circle on the floor.</p><p>Something sprayed from the exposed piping over her head, surrounding her suit in a fine mist.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>There were tens of thousands of minions, but their inability to tolerate sunlight seriously hindered their usefulness. The original Fal en had no such restriction, but there were less than two hundred of them. Far too few to provide the blood to minions that would grant them temporary immunity.</p><p>Certainly not enough to manage the pavement-pounding necessary to carry out the requested task in a timely manner.</p><p>Shrugging out of her suit, Vash rol ed her shoulders back and set her mind. The initial reports of the il ness had surfaced at the same time as Adrian\u2019s lost love. Nailing down a timeline would help her to decide if the Sentinel leader had culpability or not. \u201cI\u2019l make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you wil .\u201d Grace paused in the act of ruffling her choppy blond hair and her gaze moved over Vash. \u201cYou stil dress in mourning.\u201d</p><p>Vash looked down at the black leather pants and vest she wore and managed a shrug. After sixty years, the pain was stil there, throbbing to remind her of the vengeance due her for Charron\u2019s brutal slaying. One day she\u2019d find a lycan who could give her the information she needed to pick up the trail of Char\u2019s kil ers. She could only hope that happened before the ones responsible died of old age or on a hunt. Unlike Sentinels and vamps, the lycans had mortal expiration dates.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get that list,\u201d she said crisply, ready to start on the monumental task ahead of her.</p><p>Syre watched the video to the end, then pushed to his feet in a burst of agile movement. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on this?\u201d</p><p>Vash tucked her legs up beneath her on the chair that faced his desk. \u201cWe\u2019re fucked. We don\u2019t have enough people to attack this as quickly as the virus\u2014the Wraith Virus, she cal ed it...As fast as it\u2019s spreading, we don\u2019t have the resources to tackle it.\u201d</p><p>He shoved a hand through his thick, dark hair and cursed. \u201cWe can\u2019t go down like this, Vashti. Not after al we\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>The Fal en leader\u2019s pain was a tangible force in the room. As he stood before the windows that overlooked Main Street in Raceport, Virginia, a town he\u2019d built from the ground up, it appeared as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders. It wasn\u2019t just the problems they faced that pressed down on him. He was in deep mourning, grieving the loss of his daughter after centuries of praying for her return. And he was altered by that loss.</p><p>No one else had noticed it yet, but Vash knew him too wel . Something had changed in him, a switch had been flipped. He was harder, less flexible, and that was reflected in the decisions he was making.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do the best I can,\u201d she promised. \u201cWe al wil . We\u2019re fighters, Syre. No one wil give up.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her, his beautiful face set in fierce lines. \u201cI received an interesting cal while you were with Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His tone and the glitter of his gaze set her on edge. She knew that look of his, knew it meant he was resolved to his course but expected resistance.</p><p>\u201cThe lycans have revolted.\u201d</p><p>Vash\u2019s spine stiffened painful y, as it always did when discussing the Sentinels\u2019 dogs. \u201cHow? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin the last week. I assume Adrian\u2019s distraction over my daughter was seen as a prime opportunity to break free.\u201d His arms crossed, his powerful biceps flexing with the movement. Adrian had first been attracted to Lindsay Gibson because she was the latest incarnation of Shadoe, Syre\u2019s daughter and Adrian\u2019s longtime love. In the end, it was Lindsay who\u2019d won both Adrian\u2019s heart and the right to her own body, leaving Syre mired in grief over the loss of his child and Adrian knocked a bit off his game. \u201cThe lycans wil need us if they want to stay free, and it appears we need them just as badly.\u201d</p><p>She pushed to her feet. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m asking of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? This is akin to me asking you to work with Adrian, knowing he\u2019s the reason your daughter is gone. Or me tel ing you to partner with the demon who kil ed your wife.\u201d</p><p>His chest expanded on a slow, deep inhale. \u201cIf the fate of every vampire in the world was dependent on my doing so, I\u2019d do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you and your guilt.\u201d The words slipped out before she could hold them back. Whatever else Syre was to her, he was first and foremost her commanding officer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Commander.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed her concern with an impatient flick of his wrist. \u201cYou\u2019l pay me back by finding whoever the lycan Alpha is and offering an al iance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no lycan Alphas. The Sentinels have made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be one or the revolt would never have happened.\u201d</p><p>She began to pace, her heeled boots rapping out a quick staccato on the hardwood floor. \u201cSend Raze or Salem,\u201d she suggested, offering up her two best captains. \u201cOr both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you hate lycans and your reluctance wil hide our desperation.\u201d He rounded the desk, then half sat on the front edge, his long legs crossing at the ankles. \u201cWe can\u2019t give them an advantage. They have to believe they need us more than we need them. And you\u2019re my second.</p><p>Sending you delivers a powerful message as to how seriously I would take the proposed al iance.\u201d</p><p>The thought of working with lycans stirred a rage inside her that fogged her vision. What if she inadvertently worked alongside one of the lycans who\u2019d ripped Charron to ribbons? What if she saved one of their lives, thinking they were an al y? It was so perverted it made her stomach roil.</p><p>\u201cGive me some time to try to handle this on our own. If I don\u2019t make sufficient progress within a couple weeks, we can revisit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian could exterminate the lycans by then. The timing has to be now, while they\u2019re stil on uneven footing. Think about how quickly we could search with thousands of lycans at our disposal.\u201d</p><p>She continued to traverse the length of the room at a pace that would make mortals dizzy to fol ow. \u201cTel me your request has nothing to do with your hatred for Adrian.\u201d</p><p>Syre\u2019s mouth curved on one side. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t. I want to kick Adrian while he\u2019s down. Of course I do. But that wouldn\u2019t be enough to ask you to do this, knowing what it\u2019s going to cost you. You mean far more to me than that.\u201d</p><p>Coming to an abrupt halt, Vash approached him. \u201cI\u2019l do this because you\u2019re ordering me to, but I won\u2019t set aside the retribution I\u2019m owed. I\u2019l use this opportunity to find those responsible for Charron\u2019s death. When I act on that information, I won\u2019t be held liable for the consequences. If that\u2019s not acceptable to you, I\u2019l present your offer of an al iance, then I\u2019l go my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wil not.\u201d Syre\u2019s low tone held a wealth of warning. \u201cI\u2019l support you, Vashti. You know that. But at this moment, the exigency of the vampire nation must come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe revolt began at the Navajo Lake outpost. Start in Utah. They can\u2019t have gone far.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>\u201cWe need to find out whether or not there are other Alphas.\u201d Elijah glanced at the lycan who walked beside him, wondering at how easily Stephan had stepped into the role of his Beta.</p><p>Instinct weighed heavily on everything they did as a fledgling pack, a truth that unsettled Elijah more than it soothed. He would prefer that their destinies be shaped by their own hands and not by the demon blood that flowed through their veins.</p><p>But as he traversed the long stone hal way, the number of verdant gazes staring back at him was irrefutable proof of how dominant a lycan\u2019s baser nature was. Every one of them had the luminous green irises of a mixed-bloodline creature. They lined the wal s by the hundreds, staring as he passed them, forming a gauntlet through the red rock caves in southern Utah that he\u2019d selected as his headquarters. They thought he was a damn messiah, the one lycan who could lead them into a new age of independence. They didn\u2019t realize that their expectations and hopes for freedom imprisoned him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made it a top priority,\u201d Stephan assured. \u201cBut half the lycans we send out don\u2019t return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they\u2019re returning to the Sentinel fold. As far as quality of life goes, we had it better working for the angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs any price too high to pay for liberty?\u201d Stephan asked. \u201cWe al know the Sentinels don\u2019t stand a chance if we take the offensive. There are less than two hundred of them in existence. Our numbers are in the thousands.\u201d</p><p>The gentle prodding for Elijah to be proactive instead of reactive wasn\u2019t lost on him. He could feel it in the air around him, the crackling energy of lycans ready and wil ing to hunt. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An arm shot out and grabbed him. \u201cWhat the fuck are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Elijah paused and turned, facing the brawny male whose eyes glowed in the shadows of the cave. The lycan was bristling and half shifted, his arms and neck covered in a grayish pelt.</p><p>The beast in Elijah growled a warning, but he held it in check, a control that made him Alpha.</p><p>\u201cAre you chal enging me, Nicodemus?\u201d he asked with dangerous softness. He\u2019d been waiting for this, had known it was coming. It would be only the first of many chal enges until he established his dominance through physical prowess in addition to a lycan\u2019s instinctive need to fol ow a leader.</p> <p>The lycan\u2019s nostrils flared, his chest heaving as he fought against his beast. Lacking Elijah\u2019s control, Nic would lose.</p><p>Prying the man\u2019s grip from his arm, Elijah said, \u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned his back to the chal enge and walked away, deliberately baiting Nic\u2019s beast. The sooner they got this over with the better.</p><p>Nic had asked him what he was waiting for. He was waiting for cohesion, trust, loyalty\u2014the cementing framework that would hold al the packs together. Greater numbers or not, there was no way they\u2019d win against a tightly commanded elite military unit like the Sentinels if they didn\u2019t work together.</p><p>A female approached him at a near run, agitation radiating from her tense frame. \u201cAlpha,\u201d she greeted him, quickly introducing herself as Sarah.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a visitor. A vampire.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cA vampire? As in one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She asked for the Alpha.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s curiosity was more than piqued. The lycans had been created by the Sentinels for the sole purpose of hunting and containing the vampires. The fact that the lycans had revolted from Sentinel control didn\u2019t mean they\u2019d forgotten their ingrained hatred of bloodsuckers. For a vamp to walk into a den alone was suicidal.</p><p>\u201cShow her to the great room,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sarah turned and ran back the way she\u2019d come, with Elijah and Stephan fol owing at a more sedate pace.</p> <p>Stephan shook his head. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vamp\u2019s desperate, for some reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that our problem?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Elijah said, \u201cCould be our gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we real y want to become a safe house for bloodsucking losers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight: we rebel and we\u2019re better off, but a vampire bolts and they\u2019re a loser?\u201d</p><p>Stephan scowled. \u201cYou know as wel as I do that the pack won\u2019t take in vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimes have changed. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re pretty damned desperate, too.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah was stepping over the threshold into the great room when he heard the growl behind him. Lunging forward, he shifted into his lupine form before his paws hit the rock floor. He whirled around at the same moment he was charged by Nicodemus, taking a ful -on ramming in the side that knocked the wind from him. Rol ing over, he regained his feet, righting himself in time to catch his chal enger by the throat mid-leap. With a toss of his head, Elijah threw the other lycan across the room. Then he howled his fury, the sound reverberating through the massive room.</p><p>Nic skidded sideways on his paws, then found traction and attacked again. Elijah rushed forward to intercept him.</p><p>They col ided with brutal force, their jaws snapping for purchase. Nic caught him by the foreleg and bit hard. Elijah went for the flank, his teeth digging in deep, his beast growling at the heady taste of hot, rich blood.</p><p>Kicking off his attacker, Elijah turned, ripping a chunk of flesh away. Nic yelped and came back around, limping. Elijah crouched, prepared to leap, when the lush scent of ripe cherries slid across his senses in teasing tendrils. The fragrance swept through him, burning through his blood and sending aggression pumping through his veins.</p><p>He was abruptly sick of playing with Nicodemus. Elijah vaulted ahead, twisting midair to avoid Nic\u2019s snarling maw and coming down on the lycan\u2019s back. Catching him by the throat, Elijah pinned him to the floor, his jaws clenched tight enough to wound and warn but not enough to kil . Yet.</p><p>Just the slightest increase in pressure would cut off Nic\u2019s air.</p><p>Nic writhed for a few moments, his limbs flailing in an effort to shake off his opponent. Then blood loss and exhaustion stole his strength. He whimpered for his release and Elijah let him go.</p><p>Elijah\u2019s low growl rumbled through the room. He turned, his gaze meeting those of every lycan in the cave. They stood around the perimeter, their gazes lowering quickly as he dared al comers.</p><p>Satisfied that he\u2019d made his point for the moment, he shifted and faced the arched entry to the great room, his attention riveted to that ripe, sweet scent that was making his dick hard.</p><p>\u201cGet me a change of clothes,\u201d he said to the cave at large, not caring who did it, just that it got done. \u201cAnd a damp towel.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d barely finished speaking when she appeared, looking just as he remembered her\u2014black high-heeled boots, black Lycra bodysuit that clung to every curve, scarlet red hair that fel to her waist, and pearly white fangs. She looked like something out of a BDSM-laced wet dream and he wanted to fuck her nearly as badly as he wanted to kil her. The lust was instinctual and unwelcome; the fury was laced with grief and pain. She\u2019d kil ed his best friend in a slow, agonizing death while trying to get to him, mistakenly believing he\u2019d murdered her friend Nikki, a vampress who\u2019d also been Syre\u2019s daughter-in-law.</p><p>Be careful what you wish for, bitch.</p><p>Baring his teeth in a semblance of a smile, he said her name. \u201cVashti.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed as she picked up his scent. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Vash stared at the naked, blood-spattered lycan standing across the room from her and her fists clenched. The lack of the familiar weight of her sword sheaths on her back had already been driving her nuts, but now it pissed her off.</p><p>He\u2019d kil ed her friend, and he was going to pay.</p><p>She stalked closer, her booted heels clicking across the uneven stone floor. They lived in a goddamn cave and fought among themselves like animals. Fucking dogs. She\u2019d tried for days to talk Syre out of this fool\u2019s errand, but the vampire leader would not be swayed. He believed the old \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u201d She might\u2019ve agreed with that if they were talking about anyone but lycans.</p><p>\u201cThe name is Elijah,\u201d he corrected, watching her with the focused gaze of a natural hunter zeroing in on its prey.</p><p>Another male approached him with a towel in one hand and clothes in the other. Elijah took the towel and began to wipe the blood from his mouth and jaw. His gaze never left hers as the cloth moved across his broad chest and arms.</p><p>Vash found her attention reluctantly drawn to the stroking of white terry cloth over golden skin. He was ripped with powerful muscles from head to toe, beautiful y defined in a way she couldn\u2019t help but appreciate. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of extraneous flesh on him and his virility was unquestionable, even without his display of impressive cock and weighty testicles. His scent was in the air, an earthy yet exhilarating fragrance of clove and bergamot that was rich with male pheromones.</p><p>He handed the towel to the lycan standing next to him, then stroked his long, thick penis from root to tip.</p><p>\u201cLike what you see?\u201d he taunted in a deep, rumbling voice that affected her physical y. Blood oozed from a nasty gash in his calf, the scent so delicious her mouth watered for a taste of it.</p><p>She forced her gaze to lift from his groin with insolent leisure. \u201cJust marveling that you don\u2019t smel like wet dog.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cYou smel like sacrificial lamb.\u201d</p><p>Vash laughed softly. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you, lycan. You\u2019re safe while you\u2019re underground. But you\u2019l have to surface at some point, and beneath the open sky is where the angels wil slaughter you al . Since you\u2019re already fighting among yourselves, you won\u2019t have a chance in hel against Adrian\u2019s Sentinels without al ies.\u201d</p><p>The lycans around the room rumbled their disgust at the very idea. She raised her voice and spoke to the assembly at large. \u201cI absolutely agree with you. I don\u2019t want to work with you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you came when Syre sent you,\u201d Elijah said, stepping into a loose pair of jeans. \u201cWalked straight into a wolf\u2019s den at his order.\u201d</p><p>She faced him again, her chin lifting. \u201cWe\u2019re more civilized than you, lycan. We know the value of a hierarchy of power.\u201d</p><p>He approached her, his barefooted stride sleek and predatory. The tight roping of muscles over his abdomen flexed as he walked, riveting her gaze. A surge of heat moved through her as his scent grew stronger.</p><p>Fuck. She\u2019d been celibate too long if a lycan could make her hot.</p><p>Her hands fisted as he stopped in front of her. Too close. Invading her personal space. Trying to intimidate her with his powerful body and sharply edged hunger. She saw his need in his eyes and smel ed the enticing pheromones in the air around him. He hated her, yet he desired her.</p><p>Despite her height and heels, Vash had to tilt her head back to look up at him. \u201cJust tel me to fuck off and I\u2019m out of here. I only agreed to present the offer. I real y don\u2019t want you to accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I have no intention of turning you down until you go into the details.\u201d He caught a lock of her hair between his fingers and rubbed it. \u201cAnd I want to see your face when you find out I didn\u2019t kil your friend.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. She told herself it was from surprise and not from the feel of his knuckle brushing over her breast. \u201cMy sense of smel is damn near as good as yours.\u201d</p><p>One side of his mouth lifted in a cruel smile. \u201cDid you check my blood sample for anticoagulants?\u201d</p><p>She stepped back in a rush. She knew the Sentinels kept samples of every lycan\u2019s blood in cryogenic storage facilities at the lycan outposts, but she hadn\u2019t considered that those samples might be vulnerable to abuse. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was set up. You, however, are guilty of kil ing my friend. Hopeful y you remember him, since his murder signed your death warrant. The redhead you pinned to a tree and left for dead?\u201d</p><p>He circled her. Dozens of pairs of emerald eyes watched her with open hostility. The chances of getting out of the cave alive diminished to zero.</p><p>\u201cIf you kil me now,\u201d she warned, \u201cyou\u2019l have both the vamps and Sentinels after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s problematic,\u201d he murmured, rounding her shoulder from the back.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s something I want more than my life. If you help me get it, I\u2019l let you kil me in a way that looks like self-defense.\u201d</p><p>Elijah stopped in front of her again. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear the room.\u201d</p><p>With a wave of his arm, he gestured everyone out.</p><p>\u201cAlpha...?\u201d Stephan questioned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI can take her.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou can try, puppy. Don\u2019t forget I have a few eons on you.\u201d</p><p>In less than a minute, the room was emptied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d he said, his eyes glittering dangerously.</p><p>\u201cOne of your dogs kil ed my mate.\u201d Familiar rage and pain raced through her veins like acid. \u201cIf you think what I did to your friend was bad, it was nothing compared to what was done to Charron. You help me find the ones responsible and let me kil them, I\u2019m al yours.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cHow do you plan on finding these lycans? What are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the date, time, and place. I just need to know who was in the area then. I can narrow it down from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch bloodthirsty loyalty.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to look at him. \u201cI could say the same about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to stay with me,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI expect to be present anytime you question a pack member. It could take days, maybe weeks.\u201d</p><p>The scent of his lust grew stronger by the moment and she\u2014damn it al \u2014wasn\u2019t immune.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years. A few weeks more won\u2019t kil me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wil . Eventual y. In the meantime, I don\u2019t have to like you,\u201d he said softly, \u201cto want to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>She swal owed hard, damning the elevated rate of her pulse, which she knew he could hear. \u201cOf course not. You\u2019re an animal.\u201d</p><p>He circled her again, leaning in and inhaling deeply. \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d</p><p>She had none, which was screwing with her head. In al the years since Char had been kil ed, the need for sex had been less than an itch. But she wasn\u2019t about to confess that he was getting to her in a way no man had since her mate. Especial y when she was certain her reaction had less to do with him than with her own anxiety at being in a den ful of creatures she hated without a weapon on her back. With her fangs and claws, she could take down a half-dozen lycans; with Charron\u2019s twin katanas, she could hold her own against a legion. Only Char himself could rival her skil with the swords. \u201cNo excuses necessary. I\u2019m a heterosexual woman and you\u2019re an exhibitionist who likes to fondle his big dick. The show had its merits.\u201d</p><p>He bared his teeth in a semblance of a smile and crossed his arms. \u201cWhat does Syre want in return for protection from the Sentinels?\u201d</p><p>Vash studied him, noting his wide-legged stance and uplifted chin. He was a solid, anchoring presence. She could almost imagine him remaining an immovable object in the midst of a tornado. Although his rage was a tangible force, battering her senses along with his desire, his beautiful emerald eyes were shadowed with pain. Whatever else he was, Elijah was loyal. If he was trustworthy as wel , he could be an asset to the vampire nation. And to her.</p><p>Her arms crossed in mimicry of his pose. She watched his eyes dip to the vee of her neckline and his jaw clench. He didn\u2019t want to want her. That made her smile inwardly. She\u2019d been using her sexuality as a weapon since Charron died; she was as deadly with it as she was with a blade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something Elijah was about to discover firsthand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kil me,\u201d Vash said softly, \u201cin retaliation for the death of your friend, who died because I was seeking the same vengeance for Nikki. No...let me finish before you argue. I\u2019m not going to renege on our agreement. When al is said and done, you\u2019l be doing me a favor. I\u2019l even lay my neck across a stump and make it easy for you.\u201d</p><p>The lycan\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for your sympathy or compassion. I just want you to look for the same fidelity in me that I see in you. I\u2019l come into this al iance with al I\u2019ve got. You do the same and we\u2019l both end up with what we want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWil we?\u201d His tone was low and intimate, belying the anger that thinned his sexy mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep your wants realistic,\u201d she qualified drily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dodging my question, Vashti. What does Syre expect to gain from this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an almost even trade.\u201d Lifting her hand, she ran her fingers through her hair, noting how his eyes fol owed the fal of the crimson strands. She meant to tease him with what he hungered for, but instead found herself heated by the fierceness of his regard. The desire of such a gorgeous, virile beast of a man was a seduction al by itself. \u201cWe both need bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lead the lycans into war with the Sentinels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo? Stil feeling the pinch of the col ar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStil aware that the Sentinels serve a purpose,\u201d he shot back. \u201cThey\u2019re needed to keep the rogues in check. That\u2019s why I think Adrian hasn\u2019t fal en like you did, even though he\u2019s crossed the same line. He\u2019s the weight that balances the scale, which makes him too necessary to throw away.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched, pushing infuriating thoughts of the Sentinel leader aside because she needed to keep her head cool. \u201cYou also need money now that you\u2019re al unemployed. The vampire nation has amassed considerable wealth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me at a disadvantage. You want me grateful.\u201d He unfolded his arms and stroked a hand down his chest, rubbing his palm over one beautiful y defined pectoral. Showing off his mouthwatering body. Playing her game. His voice was gravel y. Warm crushed velvet. It brushed over her like the stroke of a tongue. \u201cI won\u2019t subordinate the packs to anyone. We\u2019re equals or we\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to see this fal through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I can afford. And what I\u2019m wil ing to pay. I\u2019ve got nothing left to lose, but that doesn\u2019t make me desperate. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p> <p>She started to turn away, hiding a smile. \u201cI\u2019l grab what I need and return tomorrow. Be ready to get down to business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d</p><p>Looking over her shoulder at him, she realized he could hold his own. Sandwiched between two powerhouses like Adrian and Syre, she felt little doubt that he could and would take on either side in battle if necessary. The submissive qualities she was so used to seeing\u2014and disparaging\u2014in other lycans were notably absent in the Alpha. Yet Adrian had kept him in service, a marked deviation from his usual practice of segregating Alphas from the others. Not only that, the Sentinel leader had trusted Elijah with Lindsay\u2019s safety. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play me.\u201d His voice rumbled with warning, setting off a sweep of goose bumps over her skin. \u201cI\u2019ve admitted I want you, but I won\u2019t be led around by my dick. Two can play the game. It won\u2019t leave my mind that you want me, too. I don\u2019t need to hear you say yes when I can smel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate lycans,\u201d she said without heat. It was a simple fact, best laid out there in case he missed the memo. \u201cThe thought of fucking one makes my skin crawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the thought of fucking me makes you wet.\u201d His tone was as emotionless as hers had been. \u201cLet\u2019s put that on the table from the start. I\u2019l wring you out and you\u2019l milk my last drop, and we can stil hate each other in the morning. Nothing is going to change how this association wil play out.\u201d</p><p>Genuine amusement slid through her. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her throat. \u201cAnd whoever\u2019s been feeding off you is done. The only lips that wil be touching your skin are mine. I don\u2019t share.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers lifted involuntarily to the twin fang tears that were healing with unusual slowness. Lindsay had taken the bite out of her after Syre\u2019s failed attempt to recover the soul of his daughter, Shadoe. Vash was reminded that the first time she had seen Elijah he\u2019d been with Lindsay, protecting Adrian\u2019s mate with his own life. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but it won\u2019t be happening again.\u201d</p><p>She began the long walk back to the cave entrance, feeling unsettled in a way she hadn\u2019t in...forever. Elijah was going to help her find the lycans she sought. As adversarial as their \u201cassociation\u201d was, she trusted that he\u2019d fol ow through, if only to get his revenge at the end. That should make her feel good about working with him. Instead, she felt twitchy.</p><p>She was now dependent on the trustworthiness of a creature whose breed she\u2019d long reviled for its treachery. The lycans had once been Watchers. Instead of taking the same punishment as the rest of their brethren and becoming vampires, they\u2019d begged the Sentinels for leniency.</p><p>Adrian had given it in the form of indentured servitude as lycans. With transfused werewolf blood sliding through their veins, they\u2019d lost their wings but retained their souls...and their mortality. They lived, they whelped, and they died as slaves, which is the least of what they deserved.</p><p>But now they\u2019d betrayed the Sentinels\u2014just as they had the Fal en\u2014by switching al egiances again.</p><p>She\u2019d be damned if the dogs would have the opportunity to be faithless to the Fal en a second time. Whatever she had to do, she\u2019d make sure that if someone was going to get a knife in the back, it would be a lycan.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>\u201cI have the right to kil her,\u201d Rachel snapped, her eyes lit with a roiling fury. \u201cYou can\u2019t take that from me.\u201d</p><p>Elijah stood with his palms flat on his desktop. He kept his gaze on the schematics in front of him, fol owing the red lines that showed where electrical cables would transfer power from generators into various caverns. \u201cI can delay that right and I am.\u201d</p><p>Because they weren\u2019t the only two people who had a claim to a piece of Vashti\u2019s luscious hide. Lindsay, too, had lost a loved one to the vampress.</p><p>\u201cMicah would have avenged you, El. Don\u2019t forget he died protecting you. Vashti kil ed him trying to find out where you were.\u201d</p><p>To avenge Nikki\u2019s death, because his blood had been planted to frame him for the crime. It didn\u2019t matter that he was innocent of Nikki\u2019s abduction. He was nevertheless guilty of being the reason Micah died. \u201cMicah didn\u2019t have thousands of lycans depending on him, Rach. We need this al iance to keep us al alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you. You want her.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it.\u201d She held his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stil going to kil me,\u201d Vashti interjected as she joined them.</p><p>Al eyes turned toward the arched entrance and the vampress who strode through it. In direct opposition to her appearance the day before, Vash had returned armed to the teeth. Katana scabbard straps crisscrossed between her lush tits, and two knife sheaths hugged her lithe thighs. She carried a smal navy duffel in her hand. Her stride was long and sure, her chin lifted high and proud. As usual, she wore black from head to toe, this time sporting skintight cotton pants topped with a leather vest that was secured with brass snaps down the front. Her hair was twisted atop her head into a bun that was secured with what he suspected were slender throwing knives.</p><p>Like the first time he\u2019d seen her in a parking lot in Anaheim, the look of her hit Elijah like a fist to the gut. His visceral response to her was so strong he sucked in a breath to push through it, then forced himself to exhale slowly.</p><p>Rachel growled, and he glanced her way. He took her sneer as his due, knowing how he would feel if their positions were reversed.</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d He straightened. \u201cThis is Rachel, the mate of the lycan you kil ed. Rach, this is Vash, Syre\u2019s second.\u201d</p><p>He watched the two women careful y, painful y aware of how difficult it must be for Rachel to face her mate\u2019s kil er and be forbidden to seek revenge by the very man who\u2019d contributed to Micah\u2019s death. His hand lifted to his chest, rubbing at the ache that shortened his breathing.</p><p>Vash dropped her duffel on the floor in front of his desk. \u201cIt won\u2019t comfort you to hear that I know how you feel, Rachel, but I do. My mate was kil ed by lycans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he mortal y wounded and left to die over the space of several days?\u201d Rachel asked bitterly.</p><p>\u201cNo. He was disemboweled and had his vitals eaten while he was stil alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie,\u201d Rachel spat. \u201cLycans don\u2019t hunt that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Elijah gestured at his Beta, who worked on a laptop at an adjacent desk. \u201cThat\u2019s Stephan over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Beta,\u201d she greeted him. Then she smiled at his upraised brows. \u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>Stephan acknowledged her with a brisk nod.</p><p>Vashti kicked at a rock on the floor. \u201cI love what you\u2019ve done with the place, El. You take rustic charm to a whole \u2019nother level.\u201d</p><p>The look he shot her said everything he needed to say about her sarcasm.</p><p>She stepped closer, looking down at the schematics with a wry twist to her mouth. \u201cCute. But you can put those away. We\u2019re not staying here.\u201d</p><p>He sank into his chair and reclined, waiting for her to get to her point.</p><p>She half sat on his desk. \u201cI\u2019m not sticking my guys on cave-watching duty. They\u2019re not going to be happy about this al iance as it is. Besides, we need more power than generators are going to provide. No way you\u2019ve got Internet or cel reception in this hole in the ground, and you\u2019l need both to have the information and communication necessary to pul the packs together. And I need the same to keep track of my men and my agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d Elijah glanced at Rachel, and his voice softened. \u201cLet the others know we\u2019l be vacating shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d she asked, wide-eyed. \u201cShe says jump and you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it however you want.\u201d As much as he regretted the position he was forced to put her in, he wasn\u2019t going to argue his point with anyone.</p><p>His word had to be law if they were going to survive. \u201cYou can stay here, if you prefer. Tel the others they can stay with you or come with me\u2014their choice.\u201d</p><p>Stephan rose to his feet as Rachel stomped out. \u201cI\u2019l see to it, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have you fol ow up. For now, I\u2019d like your input here.\u201d</p><p>Vash shook her head. \u201cI hope you can keep a lid on the drama. We have enough on our plates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as? The time for showing your hand is now.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a moment, her lips pursing slightly as she considered whatever it was she had on her mind. \u201cWe have a situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me something I don\u2019t know. You wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to run some background checks, and I need bodies pounding the pavement during daylight hours. I don\u2019t have enough of the Fal en to cover the ground necessary in the time we\u2019ve got to work with.\u201d Her fingertips drummed on the desktop, betraying her restlessness. \u201cI\u2019l cover your ass and provide safe passage for the lycans fleeing the other outposts. In return, you put those lycans to work helping me dig for information.\u201d</p><p>Elijah waited for her to elaborate. In the interim, he took her in, noting the fine texture of her creamy skin and the darkness of her thick lashes. The amber of her eyes, a trait universal among al vampires, was striking against the brazenly bold hue of her hair. He wondered what she\u2019d looked like with the flame-blue eyes of a seraph angel. Like a china dol , he imagined. There was an elegant fragility to her that wasn\u2019t immediately apparent and total y lost at a distance. Her penchant for black leather and Lycra distracted one from noticing how softly feminine she real y was.</p><p>With a sigh, she capitulated and withdrew a flash drive from her cleavage. \u201cThis wil explain everything better than I can.\u201d</p><p>Stephan retrieved his laptop from the other desk and set it up in front of Elijah, who plugged the drive in. Shortly, a video began to play. It was clearly surveil ance video of a cel in which a vampire with foam at the mouth and bloodshot eyes bashed his head against a brick wal until it burst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen an infected vamp like this before,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d Vash stood and faced him, her focus razor sharp. \u201cWhen? Where?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back again. \u201cThe first time was in Phoenix, about a month ago. I believe she was the friend you wanted to avenge\u2014brunette, petite, a pilot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki.\u201d Vash took a deep breath. \u201cJesus. I thought Adrian was ful of shit when he said she was fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cleaned out a nest in Hurricane, Utah, two days later. Half the occupants were foaming at the mouth like that.\u201d</p><p>Bending down, she dug in her duffel and pul ed out an iPad. She typed as she spoke. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the hel this sickness is, how quickly it\u2019s spreading, or where it started. That\u2019s what we need to determine and what we need you for\u2014we have to work night and day. We can work in shifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this is population control.\u201d</p><p>Her head lifted. \u201cDon\u2019t play me. I don\u2019t play nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave any of the Fal en been infected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She set the tablet in front of him, revealing a map of North America dotted with multicolored spots. \u201cThe red spots are the first reports. You can see Nikki\u2019s appearance in Phoenix was part of the first wave. Orange is second. Yel ow is the most recent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stephan leaned closer. \u201cThey\u2019re al over the map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019d expect to see an outward spread from one point, but it looks like there were four, as if they were deliberately spaced to speed the rate and area of infection. We know Sentinels raided a nest outside of Seattle, and you can see that\u2019s one of the first known cases.\u201d</p><p>Elijah shook his head, knowing where this was going. \u201cAdrian\u2019s clean on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Doesn\u2019t mean a Sentinel isn\u2019t responsible, but Adrian is in the clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Vash began to pace, briefly distracting him with her graceful and agile stride. \u201cAnd the Sentinels won\u2019t act without his orders, so that leaves us with what? Demons? A lycan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rule out the Sentinels.\u201d</p><p>Stil ing, she looked at him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman was taken from Angels\u2019 Point while under Sentinel guard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen they al owed it to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to this woman. Adrian would kick off Armageddon first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould he? Hmm...\u201d She spun on her stiletto heel and left the cavern.</p><p>Elijah was right behind her, fol owing in her cherry-scented wake. He was damn near dizzy by the time he reached the surface, his chest expanding on a deep breath that cleansed his lust-addled brain. He watched Vash pul an iPhone out from under a crimson bra strap and hit a speed-dial button. A moment later, the vampire leader appeared on her screen via a video feed.</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d Syre greeted his second-in-command with warm familiarity. \u201cAre you wel ?\u201d</p><p>Elijah interjected. \u201cYou didn\u2019t care about that when you sent her to me alone and unarmed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me see him,\u201d Syre said, prompting Vash to angle the screen in Elijah\u2019s direction. \u201cAh. The lycan Alpha. You\u2019re precisely what I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected you to be smarter.\u201d Elijah crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be an idiot to harm my lieutenant. I would hunt you down and spread your hide in front of my fireplace as a rug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hide is worth the same as hers?\u201d He glanced at Vash, irritated that he gave a shit about the respect\u2014or lack of\u2014that she was shown by her commander.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d been able to take her down, yes. She\u2019s a damned fine warrior, armed or not.\u201d</p><p>Vash flipped the phone back around to face her. \u201cHow did you get your hands on Lindsay?\u201d</p><p>The hair on Elijah\u2019s arms and nape rose with his sudden fury. He\u2019d pinned the vampress to a tree by the throat before she knew what\u2019d hit her.</p><p>Vash found herself flattened into the coarse bark of a tree trunk by over six feet and two hundred twenty pounds of bristling, growling lycan. Her fury over being caught unawares was exacerbated by her prickling dislike of Elijah\u2019s proprietary feelings toward Lindsay Gibson.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she taunted, catching the wrists of his hands presently wrapped around her neck. His heavily muscled thigh was shoved between hers and his lean hips pressed against her pelvis in a way that set her heart racing. \u201cGot a hard-on for Adrian\u2019s woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was mocking. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I hated that bitch for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Adrian.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s head turned toward the iPhone on the ground and Syre\u2019s steely-eyed visage. \u201cIs she unharmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s stil alive, she\u2019s healthier than she\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p><p>A chil slid down Elijah\u2019s spine. He looked at Vashti, whose eyes were bright with chal enge. While a mortal would have lost consciousness by now from lack of air, the vampress was merely flushed, which made her even more beautiful. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat she wanted done,\u201d Syre answered. \u201cRelease my second, Alpha, before I decide you\u2019re more trouble than you\u2019re worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Maybe not ever, if his growing suspicions were realized. His gut knotted as the fear deepened.</p><p>Vash smiled. \u201cHow did you get her, Syre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was brought to me by members of the Anaheim cabal.\u201d</p><p>Elijah growled. \u201cThere\u2019s a vampire nest in Southern California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe prefer to cal them cabals or covens,\u201d she corrected, \u201cdepending on the size.\u201d She turned her gaze to Syre. \u201cDid they tel you how they got her out of Angels\u2019 Point?\u201d</p><p>It was no secret that Angels\u2019 Point, Adrian\u2019s compound in Anaheim Hil s, was a fortress. Set high above the city, it was guarded by Sentinels and lycans\u2014before the revolt\u2014as wel as the finest electronic surveil ance mil ions could buy.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The turning wheels in Syre\u2019s mind were evident in his contemplative tone. \u201cI assumed they\u2019d acquired her somewhere between her work and the Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk to them. They have a winged contact they\u2019re not sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l see to it. And I\u2019ve sent the Alpha\u2019s blood sample from the scene of Nikki\u2019s abduction out to be analyzed for anticoagulants, as you requested.</p><p>I\u2019l let you know the results when I have them.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cAre you al right there, Vashti?\u201d</p><p>The circle of her fingers released Elijah\u2019s wrists, freeing her hands to slide up his arms like a lover. Teasing him. Goading him. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck in regularly, so I can be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Syre.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Syre. Elijah was determined to hear her cede to him as thoroughly...while she was beneath him, taking hard, deep thrusts of his aching cock. That he could want her and want to kil her at the same time was fucking with his head. Rachel\u2019s pain was a vice around his chest...Lindsay had lost her mother to Vashti\u2019s viciousness...yet stil he craved the vampress with a ferocity that shook him.</p><p>She squeezed his shoulders with a vampire\u2019s strength, which just happened to be the exact pressure he most enjoyed. Her hands ran down either side of his spine, kneading, before reaching his ass and palming it. Her tongue peeped out and slid over her ful lower lip. \u201cYou can\u2019t have Lindsay, you know. She\u2019s brain-dead over Adrian. Gave up her life for him.\u201d</p><p>He fought the seductive lure she was trying to wrap him with. \u201cWhat\u2014exactly\u2014did you do to her, Vashti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a Sentinel dog for years. Bet you\u2019ve never seen Adrian look twice at a woman. Why her? What\u2019s special about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014wel , she was\u2014Syre\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Elijah froze, his fingers going slack with shock. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>None of the vampires could procreate\u2014soul ess creatures couldn\u2019t create a being with a soul. But...Lindsay had shown anomalous traits almost from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cShe was born with another soul inside her. The reincarnated soul of Syre\u2019s naphil daughter, created before he fel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Vashti?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat had to be done for one soul to overcome the other.\u201d</p><p>Rage burned through his blood like fire, tightening his hands around her throat. In that moment, he was a breath away from separating her head from her neck.</p><p>\u201cDid you Change her?\u201d he snarled, fighting off the shift rippling just beneath his skin. \u201cDid you kil her spirit? Is Lindsay gone?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, fear shadowed her eyes and whitened her lips. As his claws extended and pierced through her pale skin, blood slid over the upper curve of her breasts in crimson tendrils. \u201cShe\u2019s stil Lindsay. Shadoe\u2019s soul was lost when Syre finished the Change. And he wasn\u2019t lying\u2014 Lindsay wanted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBul shit. She hated vampires because of you. Because you kil ed her mother. She would never become one wil ingly.\u201d</p><p>A frown marred the space between Vash\u2019s brows. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo decades back. A pretty little blond five-year-old and her mother, having a nice picnic in the park...until a pack of vamps decided to have a snack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The confusion cleared. Her gaze bored into his. \u201cNot my style. And if you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask her. She must\u2019ve figured it out when she gnawed these holes in my neck and dug into my blood memories. She had me down and pinned with a sharp piece of wood nearby; she could\u2019ve vanquished me, but she let me go.\u201d</p><p>Needing definitive answers, he pushed away from her plush, pliant body. He derided himself for wanting to believe her. \u201cI need to know she\u2019s okay. Make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got bigger things to worry about.\u201d</p><p>He staked her to the tree with a fierce glance. \u201cNow, Vashti.\u201d</p><p>Cursing under her breath, she retrieved her phone from the ground and riffled through her contacts. A moment later, ringing came over the phone, fol owed by the clipped greeting of a receptionist at Mitchel Aeronautics. \u201cAdrian Mitchel , please. Tel him Vashti is cal ing.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s arms crossed as he waited, his mind spinning from the fact that the vampires had once had Lindsay in their clutches and had let her go back to Adrian, effectively forfeiting the Sentinel leader\u2019s only weakness. Why?</p><p>\u201cVash.\u201d Adrian\u2019s richly sonorous voice flowed through the phone\u2019s speaker, sans video.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the new love of your life, Adrian?\u201d Vash\u2019s mouth curved bitterly. \u201cDid she make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s exceptional y wel . How\u2019s your neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStil holding my head and body together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou continue to have vicious rogues in your numbers, Vashti.\u201d Despite the harshness of his words, the Sentinel leader\u2019s tone remained as even and smooth as always. \u201cWe\u2019l be hunting them.\u201d</p><p>Al of the Sentinels displayed that steely control and neutrality of emotion, but Elijah had heard Adrian speaking with Lindsay and he knew the angel\u2019s stil waters ran deep.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cNot everyone in your ranks is toeing the line either, I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l stay away from Lindsay. She\u2019s no longer any concern of yours or Syre\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Vash looked at Elijah. \u201cShe\u2019s a vampire, Adrian. That makes her one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mate; that makes her mine. Forgetting that wil see your neck no longer serving its purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you talk dirty,\u201d she purred. \u201cGive my regards to Lindsay.\u201d She ended the cal , then redialed. The video activated and Syre\u2019s face appeared. \u201cLindsay\u2019s okay. And Adrian threatened me over her, so he\u2019s stil protecting her. She\u2019s in loving hands, Samyaza.\u201d</p><p>Elijah stepped closer, his gaze riveted to the vampire leader\u2019s haunted eyes. A long moment later, Syre swal owed and a deep exhale escaped him. \u201cTodah, Vashti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Her face and voice softened. \u201cI should have checked sooner. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>Silent understanding passed between the two vampires. The instinctive exchange bespoke of a long relationship and deep compassion. Elijah was contemplating his own changing perceptions about Vashti\u2014most especial y his absorption of her as a person who had a soft heart beneath the hard exterior\u2014when she ended the cal and faced him.</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough for now.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t feel total y settled until he spoke with Lindsay himself, but at least he knew she was with Adrian, who would die for her. His friend was safe for now.</p><p>\u201cLess inclined to kil me now?\u201d</p><p>He bared his teeth in a smile.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWorth a shot.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>As Vash opened the rear hatch of her Jeep, she felt Elijah\u2019s stare move down her back.</p><p>Something had shifted between them a moment ago. She\u2019d felt it, even if she couldn\u2019t define it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d His rough, rumbling voice at her shoulder prompted a deep, cleansing breath, and she closed her eyes.</p><p>The hardest transition from Watcher to Fal en hadn\u2019t been the loss of her wings; it had been the surge of emotion that shattered her previously inviolate equanimity. Since Charron, the only blessing she\u2019d received was the numbness of al -encompassing fury. That a lycan\u2014one of the very creatures who\u2019d made her what she was today\u2014should be the one to break through her shel and rattle her was the most heinous irony.</p><p>\u201cThese are surveil ance cameras.\u201d She pul ed out one of the long rods that had a camera on top of it. \u201cYou\u2019l want to get some of your men to place them around the perimeter in widening circles. Then station a team on the surface to monitor the feed.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, she let him see that the rear seat had been laid flat, expanding the cargo area to hold dozens of cameras.</p><p>\u201cJumping in with both feet,\u201d he said, glancing at her with those bril iantly verdant eyes.</p><p>She set the tip of the camera pod on the ground and leaned her weight into it. Syre didn\u2019t want the lycans to know just how much they were needed, but there\u2019d been too many skeletons popping out of closets already. Considering who they both were\u2014hunters of the highest caliber for their respective factions\u2014there would certainly be more transgressions they\u2019d hate each other for. Neither of them could afford to hold back from this point forward, just as they couldn\u2019t delve too deeply into their pasts. Theirs was a merger of necessity. Regardless of the things they\u2019d done previously, they needed each other now. Digging up secrets would only make the going more difficult; it couldn\u2019t change the route.</p><p>Vash met his gaze. \u201cWhat choice do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d But the line of his mouth softened.</p><p>\u201cThese are just a temporary precaution. We\u2019l start moving your people out of here in the morning. I know you\u2019l want to be near rural areas, but we need a command center with easy transportation access. I\u2019ve got specs on some properties that meld the two needs. Money isn\u2019t a concern.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shifted his stance, and his irises took on a preternatural glow. Her hackles rose. She spun around before she heard the rustle behind her, kicking herself inwardly for being caught unawares, another sign that Elijah had knocked her off her game.</p><p>A slender woman stepped into the clearing. Dressed in a simple sleeveless floral dress with buttons down the front, she looked fresh and innocent except for her eyes, which were narrowed and hot with hatred.</p><p>Rachel. The mate of the lycan Vash had tortured in an effort to find Elijah, whose blood had been left at the scene of Nikki\u2019s abduction.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Rachel,\u201d Elijah warned.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine, El.\u201d</p><p>Vash moved subtly, firming her stance and preparing to unsheathe the blades on her back. She commiserated with Rachel\u2019s loss and she didn\u2019t disagree with the lycan\u2019s right to chal enge her\u2014after al , revenge for a murdered mate was a goal they shared\u2014but damned if she\u2019d go down for anyone without fight.</p><p>\u201cNo, Rachel,\u201d he growled softly. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me this. He died protecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me up. I won\u2019t deny that.\u201d He moved closer, stepping in front of Vash, acting as a shield. \u201cBut Micah set me up in the first place. He planted my blood, and that lured Vash to hunt me.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel\u2019s mouth curved, but the smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cHow would he do that? Only Sentinels have access to the cryogenic storage facilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same Sentinel or Sentinels who took Lindsay from Angels\u2019 Point?\u201d</p><p>If Vash hadn\u2019t been watching so closely, she might\u2019ve missed the shiver of fear that raised the hairs on Rachel\u2019s arms. As it was, Vash felt a grudging admiration for the Alpha, who was so swiftly piecing together a picture of double-crosses and fractured loyalties.</p><p>Rachel ripped open the front of her dress and shifted, and Vash whipped out her blades. Elijah darted forward in human form, catching the snarling she-wolf in the air and deflecting her.</p><p>If Vash had harbored any doubts that he was an Alpha, they would have been completely dispel ed. She\u2019d never heard of a lycan able to resist a shift while under attack. Never thought she\u2019d see it.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Elijah barked, his words cracking like a whip.</p> <p>But Rachel was beyond caring. She hunkered low and came at Vash again. Vash leaped to the roof of the Jeep to gain the high ground and prepared to slice back, but Elijah pivoted with a roar, grabbing Rachel and crushing her spine to his chest. Standing on her hind legs in lupine form, the female was bigger than he was. She clawed at the air with her forepaws, her jaws snapping over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCut it out.\u201d His bare feet skidded on the ground as he wrestled her writhing body. \u201cDon\u2019t make me hurt you, Rach. Don\u2019t\u2014 Damn it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s back paw scraped his calf, eliciting a bel ow of pain and fresh gushing of blood as his injury from the day before rent anew. The potent scent of his blood fil ed Vash\u2019s nostrils. Her fangs descended; her body tightened with hunger. She crouched, her gaze shooting to the mouth of the cave. A witness would be helpful, but she saw none forthcoming.</p><p>Elijah hurled the wolf aside again and tore open his button fly. In a split second, he\u2019d shifted into a pony-sized wolf with rich chocolate fur and a lupine face as majestic as his human one was gorgeous. He howled, the sound echoing off the red rock and rol ing like thunder through the canyon.</p><p>Rachel slinked across the dusty ground, her lips pul ed back in a snarling display of wickedly sharp teeth. Elijah stalked her, growling low and deep with unmistakable menace. Vash\u2019s breathing quickened. She smel ed the third lycan before she saw him.</p><p>In human form, Stephan leaped onto the rooftop beside her and landed nimbly on his feet. \u201cJesus,\u201d the Beta hissed. \u201cThis is the last thing we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my witness,\u201d she said, before diving off the SUV with her blades leading the charge, her body stretched to its ful length.</p><p>The she-wolf pounced with a bark, meeting her halfway. Her katanas were a mere inch from fur-covered flesh and muscle when Elijah tackled Rachel from the side, slamming her out of the way. Vash\u2019s blades sank into the ground where the she-wolf had been a mere second before. Using the anchored swords as leverage, she held the hilts and flipped, her legs arcing over her head and landing on the other side. She hit the ground in a crouch, her boots pounding into the dirt. The sickening crunch of broken bone sounded behind her.</p> <p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A,\u201d she cursed, knowing death when she heard it.</p><p>Elijah shifted forms, the power of his lycan sight diminishing into that of a human\u2019s, then blurring with tears. He stared down at the lycan lying at his feet, watching fur melt into flesh as life flowed out of Rachel\u2019s body from the punctures in her broken neck. Dropping heavily to his knees, he threw his head back and howled his grief.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Vash snapped at his back. \u201cYou should\u2019ve let me do it. It would have been self-defense. The others would\u2019ve accepted that easier than they wil you kil ing a lycan while protecting a vamp.\u201d</p><p>A growl at his back alerted him to Stephan\u2019s presence behind him. Bracing for the agony of a bite he wouldn\u2019t defend himself against, he was startled when the expected attack didn\u2019t come and Vashti spoke instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hit him while he\u2019s down, Beta,\u201d she said drily. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to protect him from me, even if he does need a smack upside the head for jumping in when I can protect myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you.\u201d Gathering himself, Elijah stood and col ected his jeans, yanking them on. \u201cI can\u2019t afford disobedience now. Letting you two get to each other after I ordered Rachel away would only prove that my word isn\u2019t law, and it needs to be.\u201d</p><p>His chest heaving, he swiped his tears away and fought down the rising bile in his throat. An icy lump had settled in his gut, guilt eating through him like acid. He\u2019d kil ed the woman he had promised to protect from harm, the widow of his closest friend. While her death had been certain from the moment Micah died\u2014lycans couldn\u2019t live long after the loss of their mate\u2014he\u2019d never imagined the nightmare of being the hand that dealt the fatal blow.</p><p>Stephan shifted, but kept a defensive position between Elijah and Vash.</p><p>\u201cAlpha.\u201d His voice was calm and control ed. \u201cHow do you want to handle this?\u201d</p><p>Elijah faced him. \u201cI\u2019l inform the others. Take whoever you need and see Rachel buried as wel as possible. Then take these cameras and set them around the perimeter in ever-widening circles. If you need help setting up the feed, Vashti wil assist you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Stephan\u2019s immediate compliance might\u2019ve soothed him, if that had been even remotely possible. Before his Beta walked away, he stopped him.</p><p>\u201cStephan...thank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>Giving a brief nod of acknowledgment, Stephan gathered his clothes from the ground and moved away.</p><p>Elijah set off toward the caves. Remorse weighted his shoulders and stung his eyes. He\u2019d never wanted this, never wanted the responsibility of making such brutal decisions or having the power to see them enforced.</p><p>\u201cHold up, Alpha.\u201d Vash drew abreast of him, swords stil in hand. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>The way she strode by his side, armed, offered her support without words. They were a united front. Al ies. He almost laughed at the terrible absurdity.</p><p>\u201cYou have to put it away, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>He came to an abrupt halt, his hands fisting at his sides.</p><p>\u201cWanna take it out on someone?\u201d she asked softly, facing him and sliding one blade into its scabbard. \u201cI\u2019m your girl. I\u2019m always up for a heated sparring match. But you\u2019l regret carrying that baggage in front of the others. Trust me. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he chal enged. \u201cHave you kil ed someone you promised to protect with your life?\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, her beautiful amber eyes softened with something like sympathy. \u201cI\u2019ve done some horrible things, things I\u2019m not proud of and have a hard time living with. It\u2019s part of the job of being a leader. I\u2019m not saying you should suck it up and get over it, because you\u2019re not going to get over it.</p><p>That\u2019s also part of the job\u2014if you stop caring, you\u2019re worthless. I\u2019m just saying you can\u2019t stand in front of your troops seething with guilt, because that implies culpability and this was an assisted suicide. Rachel had to know she couldn\u2019t possibly win against you or me. She was ready to go, and this was how she chose to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d His friendships were precious to him. As frustrated as he was with Rachel, she was stil a friend and a pack member and he ached from her loss.</p><p>Vash shrugged. \u201cNothing wil . But you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It was a shitty thing to do, yeah, but it had to be done. For her sake, my sake, your sake, and the sake of this al iance that we both real y fucking need. As I said, if you wanna knock it out, I\u2019m here. Just don\u2019t take it in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wil be more,\u201d he muttered, respecting her counsel and appreciating\u2014however reluctantly\u2014that she\u2019d offered it. \u201cThe others didn\u2019t know what they were getting into when they orchestrated this revolt, and many of them aren\u2019t going to be happy with the decisions I\u2019m making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2019em. Until they\u2019ve been in command, they can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. She knew what it was like, which created an unexpected affinity between them.</p><p>She smacked him on the shoulder. \u201cReady, puppy?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. She was hot as hel but total y crazy. Irreverent and unpredictable, too. Yet when he\u2019d researched her, he\u2019d heard the stories of her hunts\u2014 she was like a lycan on the scent when she pursued, dogged and unwavering, dependable for those who hunted with her. And now it seemed there was a method to her madness.</p><p>He growled. It\u2019d been better when the only thing he admired about her was her tits. \u201cStick close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Make it easy for me to have yours.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him as they entered the main cavern. Blood stil stained the ground from his earlier fight and he was trudging in more, his wounded leg leaving a crimson trail in his wake.</p><p>Throwing his head back, he howled, a purely inhuman sound. Within moments, the space began to fil . Vash appeared startled by the number of lycans who poured in. \u201cJeez. Who knew so many furries could fit in one cave?\u201d</p><p>Elijah waited until the room was so ful that a mere five feet of clearance surrounded them. He relayed the recent events without inflection\u2014 starting with Vashti\u2019s arrival and ending with his reason for taking the life of a packmate. His remorse and frustration roiled, twisting around his vitals, but he contained them, even as he expressed sincere regret that they\u2019d lost one of their own.</p><p>As some of the lycans in the room shifted into their lupine forms, Vash lifted her blade and set the flat of it against her shoulder. While her pose was casual, it conveyed her battle readiness. The beasts paced and she tracked them with her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to trust the orders I give and the actions I take,\u201d he finished, \u201cwhether you understand and agree with them or not. If you can\u2019t, I won\u2019t stop you from leaving and I won\u2019t think less of you. If you stay, some of you wil be on the move tomorrow and working with vampires. In either case, try to get some rest tonight. Things wil be stressful for al of us for the next while.\u201d</p><p>He started forward, heading for the cavern he was using as sleeping quarters. The female who\u2019d announced Vash\u2019s arrival the day before stepped into his path. Sarah was a young Omega\u2014he guessed mid-twenties\u2014and exceptional y pretty, with long straight black hair and tip-tilted eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlpha.\u201d She met his gaze shyly. \u201cAl ow me to tend your wounds.\u201d</p><p>He almost brushed her off, his emotions too volatile to welcome company. But her earnestness touched him. While there were many who would chal enge him, there were others who needed a different sort of guidance\u2014a soft touch and gentle words to go along with a firm hand. It was the sort of leadership he longed to provide and hoped he could eventual y achieve once their situation became less precarious. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful if you would, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Battery-operated lights lined the passageway. Gesturing at his office, he spoke over his shoulder to Vashti. \u201cGrab your bag.\u201d</p><p>She muttered something under her breath, but complied. She joined him a few minutes later in his room, entering at the moment he had his hands on his fly. He shed his ruined pants and sat on the military locker placed at the foot of his air mattress. Sarah sank to her knees between his spread legs and opened the first-aid kit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d Vash queried tightly.</p><p>Elijah looked up at her, noting the rigidness of her jaw and her narrowed gaze. Nudity was nothing to a lycan, but perhaps it meant something to Vashti. Wondering if the vampress could possibly be feeling as proprietary about him as he felt about her, he reached out and tucked Sarah\u2019s hair behind one ear. Vash stepped closer, the hand not holding her duffel wrapping tightly around the hilt of a blade strapped to her thigh.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my room?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI\u2019l give you some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing in it.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lifted from his cock to his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rooming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hel .\u201d</p><p>Canting his arms back, he gripped the rear edge of the trunk and stretched his wounded leg out. \u201cIt\u2019s the one place I can trust you\u2019l be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can damn wel take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, released it. \u201cNo argument, but the odds are against you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t fight off a pack of puppies, I deserve to bite it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Syre would come down on me in a swarm of vamps. How much shit am I expected to have shoveled on me?\u201d</p><p>That knocked her back a bit. She looked at the queen-sized air mattress, clearly debating the risks and benefits of sharing it with him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both adults,\u201d he pointed out. Then he groaned softly as Sarah smoothed ointment over his torn skin. He\u2019d be healing faster if he was eating properly, but he was quickly becoming undernourished on the sparse amount of food to be found while roughing it. \u201cNothing wil happen that you don\u2019t want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything besides you keeping your end of our agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve got no worries. Why don\u2019t you show me those property specs you mentioned?\u201d</p><p>Vash stared at him for a long moment, then muttered something beneath her breath and dug in her bag. She set it down on the ground a moment later, her hand emerging from the depths with a folder clutched in her grip. She looked at Sarah, who was tying off a bandage. \u201cAre you done yet?\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s gaze searched Elijah\u2019s face for instruction.</p><p>He dismissed her with an easy, \u201cThank you, Sarah.\u201d</p> <p>The lycan closed the first-aid kit and said, \u201cI\u2019l get you some dinner, Alpha. Esther made an awesome venison stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d Ideal y, they\u2019d each be eating their own deer, but they weren\u2019t in a position to dine wel under the circumstances. Instead they were divvying up what they caught among everyone, which kept them alive. Barely.</p><p>\u201cAlso...\u201d She offered a timid smile. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay with you when you make the arrangements to send some of us out with the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d Vash crooned with syrupy sweetness. \u201cPuppy love. How touching.\u201d</p><p>Sarah rose to her feet with graceful dignity, but the look she shot Vashti was poisonous, a rare display of hatred from an Omega.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l work something out,\u201d Elijah answered, his decision taking into account her innate Omega gift for soothing and comforting others. She\u2019d be best utilized in a support position, rather than on a hunt.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Alpha.\u201d She left the room in a calm, graceful glide.</p><p>Pushing to his feet, he rol ed his shoulders back, feeling better already. He felt Vash\u2019s gaze slide over him and he glanced at her with an arched brow.</p><p>\u201cWil you put some damn clothes on?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take yours off?\u201d</p><p>She bared her fangs. \u201cIn your wet dreams, lycan.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWorth a shot.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>They were on the road before dawn and across the Utah/Nevada border before midmorning.</p> <p>Vash gripped the steering wheel and tried not to think about the restless night behind her. Elijah, damn him, had slept like a log, which said more clearly than anything that he didn\u2019t consider her a threat at al .</p><p>She\u2019d tried to work. There was so much to be done. But she\u2019d been distracted by the way he had stretched out next to her with one arm tossed carelessly over his head, showing off beautiful y defined biceps. And the way the sheet had clung tantalizingly low on his hips...A tiny tug would have revealed al of his impressive assets.</p><p>Vash loved a healthy man\u2019s body as much as the next woman, but Elijah\u2019s was a work of art, his powerful frame covered in mouthwatering ridges of muscle she wanted to trace with her tongue and hands and\u2014 \u201cThese are al warehouses,\u201d Elijah muttered, looking over the property listings she\u2019d printed out.</p><p>\u201cWarehouses with plenty of parking, room for a helipad, top-of-the-line electrical systems, and air-conditioning.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cI know how touchy you lycans get when you\u2019re overheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy being furry.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for the levity of his dry statement to sink in. Looking out the windshield, she felt her lips curve. He was feeling more himself, it seemed, and she was relieved. His pain yesterday had moved her, made her see him in a far more personal way than she would\u2019ve wished. His sincere grief proved his strength of character in many ways\u2014he\u2019d taken an action he knew would cost him personal y to benefit the many. She respected both that toughness and his wil ingness to shed tears without shame.</p><p>\u201cThese properties are expensive,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cSyre\u2019s making a hel of an investment in an al iance that hasn\u2019t been tested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l kil you if you double-cross me. Stake your head on a pike for other lycans to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to screw you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour breed\u2019s track record isn\u2019t so hot. Your ancestors ditched us for Adrian to save their hides and you just ditched Adrian, once again to save your ass.\u201d</p><p>His gaze seared her profile. \u201cYou\u2019re skipping over mil ennia and multiple generations. With the average lycan lifespan being two hundred and thirty years, there\u2019s not a single lycan in existence who\u2019s been touched by what happened to the Watchers. Most of them couldn\u2019t even tel you which angel they\u2019re descended from.\u201d</p><p>Yet the memory of her fal was as fresh to her as if it had occurred mere weeks ago instead of lifetimes. \u201cSo if you forget an obligation, it doesn\u2019t count?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what I meant. It\u2019s just a tough sel enforcing promises made on behalf of someone who\u2019s centuries away from being born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour great-great-grandwolfies made that decision for you. A shame you can\u2019t ask them about it.\u201d Familiar bitterness coated her tongue. \u201cI expected fidelity from the angels who served beside me. We made our beds\u2014it\u2019s not a tough sel thinking they\u2019d be honorable for lying in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told the Fal en who became lycans hadn\u2019t broken the laws the rest of you did,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>Vash shot him a scathing glance and became even more irritated by how delicious he looked. She would\u2019ve thought that after seeing how impressive he was naked, seeing him dressed would be no big deal. But he managed to make the casual attire of wide-legged jeans and plain black T-shirt look stunning. He was a big, brawny hunk of a male, capable of taking on a woman of her strength and force of wil in a way very few men could. That got to her. Made her hot and hungry for the greedy touch of a passionate man\u2019s hands. His hands. The hands she\u2019d watched stroke over his bare skin in deliberate provocation.</p><p>Of course, she wasn\u2019t even sure she remembered how to have sex anymore... She looked away. \u201cThat\u2019s a cop-out. We al lost our way in some manner or another. We were tasked with observing and reporting. Any sort of contact with mortals was outside our scope as Watchers\u2014seeing, talking, hearing, touching, teaching. But we were scholars. We thirsted for knowledge, the giving and receiving of it. We couldn\u2019t resist the desire to interact.\u201d</p><p>He tucked the property spec sheets back in the file. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t. Not like the others did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharron. Another Watcher like you. Not a mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what they say about me, that I martyred myself out of a twisted sense of loyalty to the others, that I wasn\u2019t as guilty because I mated with another angel. But I fraternized in nonsexual ways. I taught what I knew, gave man knowledge they weren\u2019t ready for yet. So when I walked up to a Sentinel with my head held high and accepted my punishment without a fight, it\u2019s because I deserved it. I also thought His fury was just a test of our resolve. The Creator had never al owed the shedding of an angel\u2019s blood before. I thought if we showed our remorse and repentance that we\u2019d be forgiven our trespasses.\u201d She blew out her breath in a rush. \u201cAnd then the Sentinels were created.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lost their focus on the road, her mind rewinding to that bleak, heartrending time of her life. She would never forget looking down from her hidden vantage, seeing Adrian and Syre battling in the field below while Sentinels rimmed one side and the soon-to-be-Fal en Watchers the other.</p><p>The deadly dance had been terrifyingly beautiful. Adrian with his alabaster wings and Syre with wings of iridescent blue. Both men tal and dark.</p><p>Works of art lovingly crafted by the Creator. The best and most favored of their respective castes.</p><p>Their fists had pummeled each other viciously; tenderizing flesh and rippling muscle. Twisting and lunging, their wings had swirled fluidly around them like massive capes.</p><p>But Syre had been no match for the honed instrument of punishment that was Adrian. Syre was a scholar; Adrian a warrior. Syre had been softened by the humanity that seeped into him via his love for his mortal mate. Adrian was too new to the earth; his control and purpose had yet to be eroded by emotion of any kind. And his entire body was lethal. Unlike the Watchers, the Sentinels were weaponized from head to toe. The tips of their feathers sliced like knives, and their hands and feet clawed with talons that shredded through skin and bone.</p><p>Syre had been vulnerable; Adrian inviolate.</p><p>In the moment after the Sentinel leader had severed the wings from Syre\u2019s back, his head had lifted and his flame-blue gaze had locked with hers. There had been nothing in the cerulean depths but angelfire, the scorching vengeance of the Creator from which he\u2019d been forged. Over time Vashti would watch those eyes change, as the Sentinel leader settled into his life on earth and fel prey to Shadoe\u2019s erotic hunger.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Elijah\u2019s voice broke into her reverie. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian\u2019s getting a taste of his own medicine now,\u201d she said hoarsely, thinking of the Sentinel\u2019s beautiful crimson-tipped wings. Those ruby bands of honor were the bloodstains that marked him as the first being ever to draw the blood of an angel. \u201cI hope it goes down like acid.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew the aviator shades he had slung over his col ar and put them on. \u201cThere are very few people I admire more than Adrian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hypocritical asshat. A total douche for breaking the very rules he busted our asses over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t his decision to punish you, and it isn\u2019t his decision to not be punished himself. That order has to come from the Creator, right? If you break a law in front of a cop and the cop doesn\u2019t arrest you, whose fault is it that you don\u2019t get punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? He could at least show a little remorse. A little guilt. Something. He\u2019s completely unrepentant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething I admire him for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me an asshat is a guy who\u2019d fuck around, angst about it, then fuck around again as if angsting about it absolved him in some twisted way.</p><p>Adrian owns his mistakes and he owns his feelings for Lindsay, which is just what you did when you gave up your wings without a fight. I think he\u2019d do the same thing, if the punishment comes his way. He certainly wouldn\u2019t make excuses, because he\u2019s not making any now.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Vash stared across the hood at the expanse of flat nothingness that hugged the stretch of Nevada highway they traveled on. Resenting Adrian was one of her tenets. She wasn\u2019t prepared to lose it alongside losing her hatred of every single lycan in existence. One truce was enough for now. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him, but she suspected he was smiling. Smug bastard.</p><p>\u201cOur exit,\u201d he said, and she pul ed off.</p><p>\u201cThis works.\u201d</p><p>Vash looked at him. \u201cJust like that? First place we see and you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the vast open space again and shrugged. It had been the distribution center for a smal import company that hadn\u2019t survived the economic downturn. The exterior was marked by loading bay doors and the interior by soaring ceilings that suspended moving cranes on elaborate tracks. Skylights flooded the space with il umination, dissipating any possibility of feeling closed in. \u201cIt has everything you say it needs. No point in wasting the day looking at more of the same. Besides, you liked this one best, and it\u2019s your dime we\u2019re dropping.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t bother him to take the handout and it didn\u2019t shake his confidence, which she grudgingly admired. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I liked this one best.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d She pul ed out her iPhone and cal ed Syre\u2019s assistant, Raven, to complete the sale. Then she speed dialed Raze. \u201cHey,\u201d she said when he answered. \u201cYou win. And...I didn\u2019t cheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Be there in ten.\u201d</p><p>She ended the cal and met Elijah\u2019s gaze, explaining, \u201cHe was sure you\u2019d go with my choice.\u201d</p><p>Amusement warmed his eyes. There\u2019d be no repudiations from him, no defensiveness, even though it could be easy for her to say he was so used to fol owing commands that he was easily led. His poise and self-possession stirred her admiration. And her desire. There was nothing so attractive as a powerful, handsome, and self-assured man.</p><p>God. What the hel was the matter with her?</p><p>She needed to eat. That was it. She hadn\u2019t fed in days, and hunger was making her vulnerable to Elijah\u2019s appeal and making it too easy to forget what he was.</p><p>Trying to get her mind off it, she texted Salem to make sure he was en route with the busload of lycans Stephan had been tasked with rounding up. Assured that everything was on track, she took a moment to make sure the Alpha was on track, too.</p><p>\u201cAre you al right?\u201d she asked him. \u201cAbout yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His face shuttered. \u201cBut I\u2019l survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou handled the announcement wel last night. I meant to tel you that.\u201d But she had been distracted by aggravation with the fawning lycan who\u2019d patched him up. Not that she\u2019d ever admit it.</p><p>He stared at her a minute. \u201cThanks. And thanks for the pep talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Suddenly feeling awkward, she gestured toward her Jeep. \u201cHelp me unload before Raze arrives.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were just finishing up when the sound of a helicopter approaching signaled Raze\u2019s arrival. He landed smoothly in the empty parking lot and cut the engine. The remote location of the property spoke to the ambition of the previous owners\u2014they could\u2019ve expanded indefinitely as business grew. Instead, the rising cost of fuel and weak retail traffic in stores had led to a short sale. Their loss was now her gain.</p><p>The heavily muscled vampire, one of the Fal en like her, climbed out of the aircraft with a grin, his eyes hidden behind wraparound sunglasses, his shaved head shining under the desert sun. He sized up Elijah with a long, sweeping glance. Then he looked at Vash. \u201cI\u2019l have to make another trip, at least. Maybe two more.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get you unloaded, then.\u201d</p><p>It took al day to move the necessary supplies into the building, even with the help of the four dozen lycans they\u2019d brought in via bus. In addition to the electronic equipment, which took priority, they set up rows of bunk beds that drew groans from the lycans, because they were identical to the ones they\u2019d been provided while indentured to Adrian. Cameras were set up on the roof, since any angelic incursion would come from the air, and the windows were covered with UV-blocking film, to create a safe haven for the minions that would join them in a few hours under cover of darkness.</p> <p>The most important thing for Vash, however, was the van-sized map that showed the pattern of contagion around the country. She stood in front of it with her hands on her hips, knowing the radiuses had extended in the last few days she\u2019d spent setting up the lycan/vampire al iance.</p><p>Turning her head, she watched as the lycans worked alongside her most trusted captains, Raze and Salem. Lycans and vampires working together. It was insane, real y, considering the seething hostility that weighted the air, like flammable gas awaiting the strike of a match. She was restless in anticipation of a sparking event, knowing it wouldn\u2019t take much to set off an explosion that could devolve into a bloodbath.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape her attention that Elijah was the force keeping it al together. As the temperature rose, he took most of the outside shifts, hefting the heavy equipment and carrying it into the loading bays without a word of complaint. She knew how lycans hated the heat; she\u2019d exploited how testy they became when uncomfortable countless times on hunts. But Elijah was such a powerful example of grace under pressure that the others were shamed into good behavior\u2014lycan and vampire alike.</p><p>Although sweat poured down the lycans\u2019 laboring bodies and their chests heaved, they worked quickly and efficiently. And the vampires gave the Alpha only a token amount of flak when he directed their efforts with firm, unwavering command. They didn\u2019t trust him, but they couldn\u2019t fault his leadership style. It was impossible to do so. There was something inherently majestic about Elijah, a core strength of wil that was unshakable. And he was compassionate. He took the time to speak to each lycan individual y, putting a hand on their shoulders and gifting personal words of thanks and praise.</p><p>More than once she found herself staring at and admiring him. We\u2019re equals or we\u2019re nothing, he\u2019d said, referring to vampires and lycans as a whole. But it was true for them as individuals, too.</p> <p>No, she corrected herself. He outranks me. His equals were Syre and Adrian. For the first time, she was confronted with an attraction to a man who wasn\u2019t beneath her in rank. She was startled at how much that changed the dynamic.</p><p>\u201cIf this al iance sticks,\u201d Elijah said at the end of the day, \u201cit\u2019l take me years to get used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many of these lycans can you trust to have your back?\u201d</p><p>One slashing brow rose. His hair was damp from a recent shower, inciting a mental picture him of standing beneath a spray of water, naked and wet and irresistibly sexy... \u201cHel if I know,\u201d he said without heat.</p><p>Honest to a fault. She liked that about him, among too many other things. He was a goddamned lycan, a race of beings that couldn\u2019t be trusted\u2014 His other brow rose to match the first. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She brushed past him on her way out, her nostrils fil ed with the wildly clean fragrance of his skin mixed with the earthy pheromones he exuded as a matter of course...pheromones her senses soaked up as if starved for them. \u201cI\u2019l see you in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hear him come up on her, but she felt him. Was overly attuned to him. Damn it al to hel . \u201cDon\u2019t nip at my heels, puppy,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re charming when sexual y frustrated.\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched. \u201cI\u2019m hungry for food, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your food. We discussed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou discussed it.\u201d She stepped outside into the chil y desert night and took a deep breath of air untainted by the primal scent of hardworking lycans. As she walked, her head began to clear...Then Elijah cut her off by stepping in front of her, fogging her mind with the exotic scent that was unique to him, a fragrance reminiscent of cinnamon and cloves. It was delicious, as everything about him was.</p><p>\u201cYou stay with me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat part of the deal was mutual y agreed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be back. I need to take care of something.\u201d She needed blood, and\u2014for the first time in damn near sixty years\u2014sex. Then she could deal with him without tripping over how scorchingly beautiful he was.</p><p>Sidestepping him, she reached into her cleavage for her Jeep key.</p> <p>He caught her wrist before she passed him. \u201cHow much shit have you got in there? Cel phones, jump drives, keys.\u201d</p><p>Yanking her hand free, she gestured at the skintight, sleeveless black catsuit she wore. \u201cWhere the hel else am I going to carry things?\u201d</p><p>His hand, however, didn\u2019t budge, despite the ferocity of her movement. It remained suspended by her shoulder, close enough that she tensed in expectation of his touch. Slowly, as if she might yet bolt, he adjusted his position to bring them face-to-face again and reached for the exposed zipper that was nestled between her breasts. Breasts that swel ed and began to ache, growing heavy in anticipation of his touch.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten what it felt like to be physical y aroused, forgotten how intoxicating it was, how it impeded the ability to think rational y and act with common sense.</p><p>\u201cKeep your paws to yourself,\u201d she bit out, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wanting to be mauled doesn\u2019t make me scared, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Emerald eyes glittering with chal enge in the moonlight, he held up both hands. \u201cI promise to keep my paws to myself. I just want to see what else you\u2019ve got in there. Cash? ATM cards? Spare tire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve shown you mine,\u201d he taunted softly, goading her with a lycan\u2019s overt sexuality. Vampires were sexual creatures, too, but lycans were pagans, their demon-tainted blood spurring wild natures. Elijah was more brutal y sexual than any other lycan she\u2019d ever met, his confidence and quiet command stemming from his comfort with himself, his luscious body, and his awareness of his virility and strength.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get the image of him out of her head\u2014naked, bloody, his big hand stroking his big cock, his eyes dark and hot with wanting her. The memory had haunted her al night while he slept soundly. Fucker.</p><p>Pissed at the imbalance in the attraction between them, Vash yanked her zipper to her navel and pul ed the separated halves aside. Her breasts bounced free, the tips hardening as a cool breeze slid across them. She was braless due to the natural constriction of the suit, which hugged her so tightly any underwear would have marred the sleek lines. The garment was comfortable, affording her ful range of movement, and it distracted her opponents\u2014win/win al around.</p><p>He stared, unblinking, his face hardening into an austere mask of ferocious hunger. His arms fel slowly to his sides, his hands fisting.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Pure feminine power slid through her, her anger and frustration soothed by his undisguised helpless captivation. When she moved to close her top, he growled low and deep, the rumbling sound an unmistakable animal warning. She stil ed instinctively, her body freezing in place as if lack of movement would make her invisible to the predator stalking her.</p><p>In her haste to retaliate, she\u2019d awakened the beast. Now the steady, powerful drumming of his heartbeat was spurring her potent vampiric needs.</p><p>The intrinsic hunger for blood and sex. His blood. His sex. That\u2019s what she craved with a force that shook her, as if the desire for a man\u2019s touch had always been inside her. Lying dormant. Waiting for the right man to jolt it to life.</p><p>That man stepped closer. Then lowered his head... \u201cElijah.\u201d She breathed his name, her pulse pounding violently. Her body was straining toward his without her volition, every muscle taut with expectation and wanting. She should\u2019ve backed away again, would have done so if she\u2019d been capable of moving. Instead it felt like her feet had been encased in concrete, rooting her in place.</p><p>His breath gusted hot over her nipple, his lips hovering over the stiffened peak. \u201cNo paws,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Then he stroked his rough tongue across her with a long, leisurely lick. Her gasp was a whiplash in the stil of the night; her body jerked as if she\u2019d been tasered. She felt as if she had been. Needles of sharpened awareness swept over her skin from head to toe. The roots of her hair stood on end, tingling with the need to feel his grip fisting the crimson strands.</p><p>He groaned, the sound fil ed with pleasure and torment. \u201cOffer yourself to me,\u201d he ordered roughly, licking his lips.</p><p>She swal owed hard, tasting blood and realizing her fangs had descended and pierced her. Her hunger beat at her senses, rushing through her veins, mingling with her sexual desire until they were one and the same. She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d cupped her breast and lifted it to his mouth until she was scorched by the heat of his lips. The drenching burn was quenched by a sudden hard suck that made her moan and stumble a fraction of an inch closer. His tongue fluttered maddeningly over the elongated tip, worrying it, making her sex clench in jealous greed.</p><p>The wind blew softly, riffling through his dark hair and urging the thick silk to brush over her tender skin. He touched her nowhere else, with nothing else but his mouth, which began to tug with rhythmic pul s. The measured tempo pulsed through her, making her wet between the thighs and achy with emptiness.</p><p>He released her with a pop of breaking suction.</p><p>\u201cI love your tits,\u201d he growled, each word said with arousing vehemence. \u201cI\u2019m going to squeeze them in my hands, holding them together as I slide my dick through al this lush, firm flesh until I come al over you.\u201d</p><p>No man had ever talked to her that way, so crude and raw. No man would dare.</p><p>Taming Elijah would be impossible, she realized, quivering with longing tinged by apprehension. She was a strong woman, but she couldn\u2019t imagine bending him to her wil . Because he was strong, too. Maybe even stronger than she was.</p><p>Elijah looked up at her as his head turned slightly to bring his mouth over her neglected nipple. \u201cYou want that, too. I can smel how it turns you on to think about giving it up to me however I want it. Giving up al that power and command you\u2019re used to shoving everyone around with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...you wil , Vashti. Long and hard. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>He was suckling her before she could retort, pinning her nipple to the roof of his mouth and massaging it with his tongue. She almost came from the sweet sting of it, the delirious pleasure/pain of voracious draws so powerful they hol owed his cheeks. He was relentless in his taking, his teeth sinking into the turgid peak with just enough pressure to send a shiver of wariness through her.</p><p>\u201cVash.\u201d</p><p>Salem\u2019s voice behind her startled her into jerking away from the wicked ecstasy of Elijah\u2019s mouth. She cried out at the sharp scrape of teeth over tender flesh, then again with surprise at the orgasm that was almost triggered by the bittersweet pain.</p><p>Elijah had her zipped up and steadied with lightning-quick efficiency. If not for his labored breathing, she might\u2019ve thought he was unaffected.</p><p>Then he caught her hand and cupped it around his erection, grinding himself into her palm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he cal ed out, pushing her hand aside and taking a step back.</p><p>They were only yards away from the door. Salem would have seen Elijah\u2019s bent head and smel ed their mutual arousal.</p><p>\u201cI need your wheels,\u201d her captain said, lingering by the warehouse instead of approaching. Agitated by the scent of desire, he shoved a meaty hand through his electric orange hair. It was a testament to how bad-ass he was that he could flaunt a hair color that was a bul \u2019s-eye on his massive cranium. \u201cTime for a run to Shred.\u201d</p><p>Swal owing hard, she stared at Elijah but spoke to Salem. \u201cI\u2019l go with you.\u201d</p><p>Shred was one of Torque\u2019s most exclusive and secretive dens. Located far off the Vegas Strip, it was a way station for fledgling minions and older vamps alike, offering safety, sex, and blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l drive,\u201d Elijah said, bending to pick up the car keys she\u2019d unknowingly dropped from her lax hand.</p><p>Any one of the lycans in the building could have snuck up on her and she would never have noticed, her brain fried by the heat of Elijah\u2019s mouth on her breast. It was unacceptable. She needed to get her shit together before she got herself kil ed. \u201cI\u2019m not tel ing you where it is, lycan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d He turned toward the Jeep. \u201cI\u2019ve hunted there before.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Pissed off and frustrated by his own weakness where Vashti was concerned, Elijah made no attempt to hide his raging lust from either Vash or Salem. Instead he obstinately pumped pheromones into the air around him, permeating the Jeep\u2019s interior until Salem cursed viciously and adjusted himself in his leather pants. Vash had chosen to take a seat in the back, a mistake that guaranteed the smel of his need whipped across her face and through her hair, carried by the wind surging through the window Salem opened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCut it out, Alpha,\u201d she shouted, punching her fist into his seat back.</p><p>He met her furious gaze in the rearview mirror, his own hard and brittle. She was as angry as he was; he had made sure of it by reminding her that he\u2019d hunted her kind, that he\u2019d observed and studied their habits and places of congregation in minute detail so he could kil the ones who stepped out of line.</p><p>She deserved to be uncomfortable for putting him through this hunger, for making him want her more than he\u2019d ever wanted anything. The moment he\u2019d stroked his tongue across her skin, her taste had exploded across his senses with the force of an incendiary grenade. There was nothing reasoned or calculated in his response to her. It was pure primal recognition of a unique and potent physical attraction. Lust at first sight, exacerbated by their heightened lupine and vampire natures.</p><p>He could stil taste her, damn her. Smel her. His palms burned with the need to feel her. Inside, his beast howled with rage to be freed, forcing him to struggle in a way he\u2019d never had to before. Because he...liked her. Crazy as that was. Crazy as she was. Control ing his baser nature had always been as easy as breathing, but it was exhausting him now. Wearing him down. Clawing at him from the inside and shredding what restraint he had left after a week of painful blows and savage lows and highs. She\u2019d witnessed those trials and, in her own way, been an asset to have around while going through them.</p> <p>He growled. Vashti\u2019s returning feminine hunger was eating at him like a cancer. As tough as she was, he now knew he could make her soft and submissive, and he wanted her like that. Wanted her limp and panting beneath him, completely at his mercy. He could accept nothing less.</p><p>The nearly two-hour drive to Shred ended up feeling like two years, and not just for him. Salem unfolded from the Jeep before it drew to a complete stop and was through the thick metal entrance door in a flash. Vash was fast on his heels, fleeing Elijah as if the hounds of hel were after her. When the door slammed shut behind her, he barked out a mirthless laugh.</p><p>As if a simple door could prevent what was coming. If only it was that easy.</p><p>Needing to get himself under control before he entered a vampire den, Elijah took his time locking up the SUV and scoping out the exterior of the unobtrusive building for changes. He surveyed the immediate area, refreshing his memory of the industrial properties on the periphery that had closed long before the party got started. He took note of the armed vampires on the roof before they deliberately made their presence known. They smel ed him coming, and because he was spoiling for a fight, he lifted his hand and flipped them off.</p><p>One decided to oblige him, leaping agilely from the top of the three-story building and landing in a graceful crouch. The vamp was sleek and sinewy, his world-weary eyes and economy of movement betraying significant age. They circled each other slowly, baring fangs and canines, claws extended. Neither of them looked away from the other when the door opened and a masculine voice shouted out, \u201cDredge! Leave him alone. He\u2019s Vashti\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>The vampress\u2019s protection so enraged Elijah that his spine rippled with a partial change. He didn\u2019t fucking need her to clear the way for him. He could damn wel do it himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you a pet, dog?\u201d Dredge taunted, his amber eyes glowing. \u201cOr a meal?\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s a lycan\u2019s bitch.\u201d</p><p>Dredge lunged. Expecting the reaction, Elijah met the vamp\u2019s incoming face with his fist, hurtling him backward across the parking lot and into the side of a delivery van, creating a massive dent that mimicked the shape of his body.</p><p>Shaking the sting out of his fist, Elijah turned toward the open door, his ears trained for the sound of a retaliatory ambush from the others on the roof. But none came, proving the extent of Vash\u2019s power\u2014her word was law for vampires. Seeing the proof of it made Elijah\u2019s dick impossibly harder, spurring his need for her, which had grown steadily over days of watching her run the show. She wielded power with the same control and skil that she used to wield her katanas, which turned him on as much as her body did.</p><p>Once inside the outer door, he encountered a second entrance. It opened as soon as the first door shut, releasing a flood of pounding techno- pop music and the rich metal ic smel of freshly spil ed blood. The scent of sex engulfed him in a steamy mist, spurring his ferocious mood. He wanted to fight and fuck with unmitigated ferocity, and the need to do both increased with every second that passed.</p> <p>Rounding a corner, he was thrust into a massive room fil ed with writhing vampires. Some were dancing, grinding their undulating bodies against whoever was close enough. Others were feeding, their bloody mouths latched on to throats, wrists, and thighs. Stil more were openly fucking, like Salem, who was dril ing a vampress from behind as she drank from the femoral artery of a woman spread-eagled in front of her.</p><p>The unrestrained hedonism bombarded Elijah\u2019s ravaged senses, the thick humidity in the space almost suffocating him. Maddened to the edge of insanity, he searched for Vash among the crowd, his beast lunging against the cage of his control, trying to batter its way out at the thought that she might be spread for someone else.</p><p>Leaping onto a tal boy table, he roared, drowning out al sound. The room froze, the music becoming glaringly loud within the absence of sound.</p><p>Then a slender blonde mimicked his leap and gained the bar top. She ripped her shirt apart and exposed her tits, shaking them with wild abandon and screaming, \u201cFuck yeah!\u201d</p><p>The crowd ignited into a frenzied mass. Drunk on endorphins, they resumed their carnal excess, the pounding bass of the music spurring them like a war drum.</p><p>Elijah vaulted up to the second-floor balcony, hunting his vampress.</p><p>Vash entered the third-floor VIP lounge and scanned the room\u2019s occupants with a sweeping glance. She was searching for something in particular and she found him. He was long and lean. Blond. His eyes were heavy-lidded, his lounging pose was insolence personified. His chest and feet were bare; his skin was pale and smooth. The antithesis of Elijah. But best of al were the piercings riddling his body\u2014his ears, brows, nose, lips, nipples, navel...She was certain there would be more in places she couldn\u2019t yet see. And the carvings in his skin. Intricate designs that had been sliced by a skil ed blade and prevented from healing by application of silver-laced cream or shavings.</p><p>The man enjoyed pain. Sought it out deliberately and found beauty in it. And she wanted to inflict pain on someone who could take it and wanted it. Because she hurt and was infuriated by that hurt. Because she\u2019d pushed her way through dozens of beautiful, desirable male bodies to reach the lounge, and none of them had moved her or stirred the hunger simmering in her blood. Because she was dead to every male just as she\u2019d been ever since the day Charron died...every male but one.</p> <p>\u201cYou.\u201d She beckoned her quarry with a crook of her finger.</p><p>He straightened with a slow, sensual smile and came to her with a leisurely, confident stride. Reaching her, he took her in from head to toe with a covetous glance, then licked his lower lip. \u201cI was beginning to think you\u2019d never come for me.\u201d</p><p>Bored already, she raised her brows. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Tilting his head, he exposed his neck...and the tattoo that was written there with silver-tainted ink: VASHTI, BITE HERE.</p><p>A shiver moved through her at the craziness of the act. They\u2019d never met, yet he\u2019d marked himself as her property.</p><p>Of al the men to meet her criteria for the night, she had to pick a groupie, one of the far-too-many minions who were aroused by the thought of being a blood slave to one of the Fal en.</p><p>She almost waved him away\u2014there was enough crazy in her life as it was. Then she heard Elijah\u2019s roar, felt it vibrate through wal s and rattle the bloodstained glasses on the tables. The fierceness of the desire that shot through her made her sway on her feet, as if she was hardwired to answer that dominant cal . She didn\u2019t have time to be discerning. She needed blood to manage her desire for Elijah and she needed it now.</p><p>Knowing she had maybe five minutes at most before the lycan worked his way through the crush of bodies on the stairs to get to the third floor, Vash shoved the vamp into a chair and circled him, grabbing his jaw from behind and yanking it out of the way to expose his neck. She\u2019d prefer his wrist, to keep it impersonal, but she needed to be quick and nothing beat an arterial gush for speed.</p><p>Her fangs descended, her gaze riveted to the thick pumping vein at his throat. As her stomach gnawed in hunger and dizziness swept through her from the need to feed, the lounge door was ripped off its hinges and thrown over the balcony into the teeming mass of vampires below. Elijah fil ed the threshold, his body big, hard, and virile. His irises glowed in the shadows cast by the muted wal sconces.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d Just the one word, spoken low and terrifyingly deep, as if ripped from the beast inside him instead of from his human throat.</p><p>Something warm and slightly twisted slid sinuously inside her, some alien feeling of...pleasure that such a magnificently masculine creature should be so powerful y possessive of her.</p><p>His gaze dropped to the minion seated in front of her. \u201cGo, before I kil you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to eat, damn you!\u201d she shouted, weary of fighting herself over him and desperately clinging to the hope that a replenishment of nutrients would free her from her inexplicable fascination.</p><p>But she knew he wouldn\u2019t let her drink from anyone else, not now. The act of feeding was too innately sexual, even when the only contact was fangs to vein and lips to skin. He was too territorial to al ow that connection, however impersonal. Yet she couldn\u2019t afford to drink from him... wouldn\u2019t drink from him, because she knew, instinctively, that she would have the same reaction to the taste of him as he\u2019d had to the taste of her\u2014the hunger wouldn\u2019t be appeased; it would grow. She would crave more. More of his potent lycan blood. More of him.</p><p>She would have to restrain him long enough to get a meal in edgewise.</p><p>Taking command of the situation, Vash closed the distance between them and caught him with a fist in his shirt. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She pul ed him, but succeeded only in ripping the shirt off his back. Elijah didn\u2019t move at al , was too powerful for even her vampire strength. Her sex clenched with greed for this male who was more than a match for her.</p><p>Flushed and breathless, she skirted him and exited to the hal , trying to get herself under control before he realized how close to the edge she was. If she wasn\u2019t careful, he\u2019d have her begging for his cock. The thought of that weakness terrified her as nothing else could. She had to be strong, for herself and for Char, and for al the vampires who needed her to keep them alive and thriving.</p><p>Elijah fol owed so closely she could feel his heavy exhalations on her nape. Stalking her again. And she couldn\u2019t deny that some recessed part of her wanted him to. Because it ratcheted up her desire, made her hot and wet.</p><p>Vash saw the smal green light lit above a door and went to it quickly. There were more doors and more lights. Most were red, which signaled locked and occupied. Some were yel ow, which signaled vacant but in need of housekeeping. Only a few were green and she chose the nearest one, opening the door and cursing as Elijah crowded her into the smal playroom. He caught her around the waist and tossed her onto the massive bed, barely giving her the time to scoot up before he pounced.</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d she gasped, as he landed neatly on al fours, caging her to the bed with his hands pressed to the mattress at her shoulders and his knees hugging the sides of her thighs. Fear paralyzed her, not of him but of the raging desire that was quickly consuming her. The need to arch upward and offer herself to him was a driving force. It pounded her heart against her ribs and squeezed the air from her lungs.</p><p>Her eyes adjusted to the dimness of the room, the only il umination provided by recessed lighting in the baseboards. His eyes glowed with preternatural green fire and his head lowered, his chest expanding on a deep inhale as he breathed her in.</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve brought us here when we arrived,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cYou\u2019d be coming now.\u201d</p><p>He took her mouth before she could reply, his lips sealing over hers and stealing her breath. His tongue swept inside her on a groan, his hand moving to her zipper to slide it down to where it ended at her pubic bone. She\u2019d barely swal owed her first rich, dark taste of him when he pushed his hand beneath the edge of her suit and claimed her breast in one big, hot hand.</p><p>Her fangs sharpened in a rush of need, piercing his tongue. His blood flowed into her mouth, the flavor intoxicatingly exotic. He kneaded her breast, plumping it, then focusing his thumb and forefinger on the tip, rol ing and tugging on her hardened nipple until her sex spasmed in the same rhythmic tempo.</p><p>Out of her mind for him, Vash sucked on his tongue with the same voracious pul with which he\u2019d sucked her nipples earlier, drawing more of his blood over her taste buds. Her eyes rol ed back in her head, her ability to reason lost to the addictive deliciousness. He growled into her mouth and sank between her thighs, grinding the rigid length of his cock into her aching sex. Whimpering, she gripped his hips and tugged him into her, rocking her hips upward to stroke her clit against his erection.</p><p>Elijah lifted his head and watched her as he rol ed his hips, watched her head arch back as an orgasm hovered just out of reach. \u201cTel me you want it, Vashti. Tel me you need my cock in you like you need blood to live.\u201d</p><p>Her body quaked violently as he gave voice to her greatest apprehension.</p><p>I won\u2019t be led around by my dick, he\u2019d said what seemed like ages ago in the Bryce Canyon caves. But she feared she wasn\u2019t as strong as he was. She\u2019d never been so desperate for sex as she was at that moment, and he was the only man she wanted to have sex with. Her attraction to him wielded too great a power over her, and she feared giving him what he demanded of her\u2014total surrender.</p><p>Tossing her leg over his hip, she gained the leverage to flip him to his back. Moving as fast as if her life depended on it, Vash focused on the purpose of bringing him to a playroom to begin with. In a split second, she had him restrained, his wrists and forearms banded with barbed silver- plated steel cable. He roared as the tiny rounded points pierced his flesh, scarcely enough to draw blood but enough to expose the wounded flesh to the one metal that weakened Sentinels, vampires, and lycans alike. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bed quaked with his fury, his irises burned bright enough to light up the room. \u201cYou fucking bitch!\u201d</p><p>But she was beyond caring now. She was slick and swol en between her legs, her breasts were tender and heavy, and his flavor permeated her mouth, deterring thoughts of fleeing as she might\u2019ve done if she\u2019d had any sense of self-preservation left.</p><p>\u201cLet me loose.\u201d He clawed at the bed with the heels of his boots. \u201cFucking let me go... now! \u201d</p><p>Vash fought to be free of her catsuit, struggling out of both it and her boots in a near-mindless frenzy. Once naked, she fel on his twisting body, wrestling his bucking hips to yank open his button fly.</p> <p>\u201cVashti!\u201d He arched violently. \u201cNot like this, damn you. Don\u2019t fucking tie me up like an animal.\u201d</p><p>As always, Elijah was commando beneath his jeans, ready to shift forms at a moment\u2019s notice. Nothing impeded her mouth from his cock, which she swal owed greedily, her lips and tongue tightening around his raging length.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he hissed, bucking his hips in an attempt to throw her off. \u201cGet your bloodsucking mouth off me!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. If the entire den poured into the room and found her fel ating a lycan, she didn\u2019t think she could stop. Her hunger for the taste of him was too great, her need to bring about his surrender even greater. Pumping the thick root with her fist, she tongued the wide head, her mouth sucking hard and quick as she drove him relentlessly toward orgasm. He fought the whole way, his powerful thighs bunched with strain, his chest rumbling with furious growls, his torso twisting back and forth to dislodge her.</p><p>When he climaxed, it was with a wolven howl that brought goose bumps to her skin. The baying sound was high and plaintive, purely animal with none of the human evident in it. Tears stung her eyes even as she drank him down, something ancient and primal within her ravenous for the heady flavor of his savage virility.</p> <p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d He panted, his chest heaving as she shoved his jeans to his knees. \u201cDamn you to hel , you traitorous\u2014 Fuck!\u201d</p><p>Her fangs sank into his femoral artery and she lost what tiny bit of humanity she clung to. His blood mingled with the semen in her mouth, creating a blended essence that was the most delicious thing she\u2019d ever tasted. She circled his powerful thigh with both arms, embracing it like a lover, her throat working with each gulping swal ow.</p><p>\u201cFucking bitch,\u201d he spat. \u201cYou goddamned fucking bitch. You\u2019re stealing my right to give what belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>She heard the anchors in the wal creak in protest as Elijah strained against his bonds, a testament to how strong he was, so strong that the silver that incapacitated most vamps wanting a true submissive experience was barely enough to contain him.</p><p>Dizzyingly intoxicated, Vash slid her fangs free and closed the punctures with soothing licks of her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop,\u201d she whispered, achingly empty and needing him, despite the terrible effort she\u2019d made not to. No lycan could tolerate being caged, and Elijah was no mere lycan. He was an Alpha. As rare as a new angel and in some ways just as fragile.</p> <p>She crawled over him, putting her back to his enraged face and training her eyes on the door. A door that would see them exiting far differently than they\u2019d come in. His fury was pulsing off him in searing, battering waves. Yet she couldn\u2019t stop herself from gripping his stil -hard cock and positioning herself over the massive crown.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d he warned in a thick, hoarse voice.</p><p>She licked the taste of him off her suddenly dry lips. \u201cI...need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this, Vashti. Don\u2019t take me like this.\u201d</p><p>Their intimate flesh touched. The lips of her sex hugged him, flexing gently around him. Her hand gripping him shook like a junky\u2019s in need of a fix.</p><p>\u201cThis is the only way I can have you.\u201d</p><p>Vash sheathed him in a swift plunge of her hips. He roared as she cried out, her body shocked by a penetration it hadn\u2019t experienced for over half a century. The cement wal behind the bed exploded with a deafening sound; dust and debris burst in a cloud around her. She was catapulted forward violently, her body thrust toward the door and down, her torso slammed into the mattress with breathtaking force.</p><p>She was mounted before she knew what hit her, Elijah\u2019s rock-hard body nailing her to the bed with a powerful thrust of his rigid cock into her aching sex. The coils of cable that had failed to contain him thudded to the floor, the sound reverberating through her.</p> <p>Elijah wrapped his forearm with the spil ed length of her hair. Fisting the tresses at the root, he pul ed her head back and growled in her ear, \u201cYou can\u2019t tame me.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his hips, pul ing free of her clinging depths only to drive into her again. \u201cYou can\u2019t chain me.\u201d</p><p>Yanking her up by the hips and hair, he brought her to her hands and knees. \u201cAnd you goddamn can\u2019t rape me.\u201d</p><p>His next lunge hit the end of her, driving his supremacy home with a heavy surge of his hips. She cried out, completely at the mercy of his primal need for her and her own for him. He pounded into her, riding her hard and deep, stroking over and over and over a tender spot inside her that made her shake and moan. She had no leverage, no way to move or participate. Or so she told herself.</p><p>It was a lie, of course. He was stronger than she was, but she could fight him off. She could hurt him, make him work for it. They both knew she could. Yet she let him have his way, for reasons she couldn\u2019t grasp.</p><p>Something broke free inside her.</p><p>Set adrift, she clung to Elijah as the only anchor against the storm that whipped through her. Tears fel . Her chest ached. Her body burned with the feverish pleasure buffeting her from al sides, shattering the wal s that had protected her for so long.</p><p>He gave her no quarter. Elijah fucked her like the animal he was, rutting into her with unmitigated ferocity. She climaxed in a helpless rush, screaming his name because he didn\u2019t relent, didn\u2019t falter. He kept driving the ecstasy into her, making her take it. Al that he was. Everything.</p><p>Beyond what she could handle, what she\u2019d tried to limit herself to.</p><p>He fol owed her down when she melted into the mattress, her head and shoulders hanging off the edge. \u201cYou\u2019l take me as I am,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l want me as I am. Or you won\u2019t have me at al .\u201d</p><p>His knee shoved her legs wider; his big cock sank a fraction deeper. His grip on her hair pul ed her head down toward the floor, forcing her into the most submissive of poses. She felt his teeth sink into the nape of her neck, his canines inhumanly long, his bite firm enough to break the skin but not tear it.</p><p>Subdued, mounted, and dominated in every way, Vashti came again and again, sobbing her pleasure, shame, and guilt. Begging him to forgive her. To finish her. To fil her.</p><p>Which he did, hours later, pumping his lust and fury into the greedy depths of her body, emptying himself with a serrated groan that sounded like the sweetest agony.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>From his vantage point high on a rocky hil, Adrian Mitchel surveyed the blond fledgling vampire attempting to sneak up on three of the most fearsome angels ever created, one of whom was his lieutenant. They stood with their winged backs to her, their focus on the papers spread out on the teakwood patio table in front of them.</p><p>Dawn had passed and now the morning sun rose in the east. The soft pinkish golden glow that would have fried any other minion caressed her pale limbs and austerely beautiful face just as his lips had done mere hours ago. Behind her, their house clung to the hil with the appearance of defying gravity, its three tiers jutting out from the craggy rock, its weathered wood and rock exterior making it seem a natural part of the native Southern California landscape.</p><p>He watched and waited, his crimson-tipped wings tucked close to his back to avoid catching drag in the wind. He admired the vampress\u2019s bravado, even as he acknowledged the futility of it. She couldn\u2019t take on even one of his Sentinels; three was impossible.</p><p>Crouching, she slunk across his wide deck with a slender blade in her hand. When she pounced, he appreciated her grace and agility, which nearly matched Damien\u2019s when he turned at the last possible moment and caught the business end of her blade in his hand, proving he\u2019d sensed her coming.</p><p>One might have thought that would be the end of it, but she surprised them al by using the Sentinel\u2019s grip to support her weight as she kicked out spread-eagled and knocked the two Sentinels flanking Damien into the table like fal ing chess pieces, sending papers flying.</p><p>Adrian leaped from his perch, his wings extending to their ful thirty-foot span to catch an updraft. He soared, then dove, spiraling downward, relishing the rush of air through his hair and over his feathers. He skimmed the wide deck, the tips of his wings touching the planks, before he darted upward again, using the pul of gravity to slow his momentum and pul him back to the earth.</p><p>Lowering with effortless strength, he settled into place beside his mischievous mate, landing on the bal s of his feet without a sound.</p><p>She caught his wrist and squeezed, opening her mind so that her thoughts became his. Watching you fly makes me so hot.</p><p>\u201cWatching you hunt is similarly affecting.\u201d His face and tone of voice revealed nothing of his feelings for her, out of deference for his men, but the way her fingertips slid across his palm told him she knew.</p><p>Malachai and Geoffrey straightened from their ignoble sprawls.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating,\u201d Malachai said, stretching and flexing wings that were the color of sunset\u2014pale yel ow that darkened into deep orange tips.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s smile was bril iant. \u201cOne-on-one I get my ass kicked, but I think I might be able to work with a group. Using one to distract the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d Geoffrey scoffed, looking disgruntled. He\u2019d recently likened Lindsay to a troublesome cat, one who crouched under couches and swiped at anyone hapless enough to walk by. But in truth, he appreciated her ceaseless efforts to hone herself so that she wasn\u2019t as much of a liability. While Lindsay was an expert marksman and bladesman and was working hard on her hand-to-hand combat skil s, she was stil a fledgling vampire newly Changed. She hadn\u2019t yet achieved the power and resilience that would eventual y come with age. In the interim, she was unbearably vulnerable and easily broken.</p><p>Damien sighed. \u201cNo, that\u2019s Lindsay. It\u2019s our fault we weren\u2019t ready for her.\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant was wary of Lindsay\u2019s impact on Adrian and the Sentinels\u2019 mission, but he admired her as a warrior. While Adrian\u2019s original second and beloved friend, Phineas, had been a strategist and Phineas\u2019s replacement, Jason, had been good for morale, Damien\u2019s strengths were found in battle and those were the same strengths he most appreciated in others.</p><p>Lindsay slid her blade into the sheath strapped to her thigh. \u201cI touched base with al the international packs overnight. The communication blackout is working\u2014you stil have one hundred percent containment of the overseas lycan outposts. They have no idea the North American packs revolted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the Creator for smal favors,\u201d Malachai muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t risk using those lycans to contain their rogue brethren,\u201d Geoffrey said. \u201cEven though some of them wil do so wil ingly.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s gaze lifted to the building set a half mile away\u2014the lycan barracks. Once home to his pack and now home to a mere dozen lycans who\u2019d straggled in over the last week and a half since the outposts had begun fal ing like a chain of dominos. More lycans returned to him every day, and when he touched their minds, as he did Lindsay\u2019s, he felt their fear and confusion\u2014and their loyalty, which humbled him.</p><p>The crumbling of the order he\u2019d worked so hard for was part of his punishment for loving Lindsay, he knew\u2014the loss of the lycans, the guilt of knowing others were paying for his mistakes, the strain of holding on to the tenuous balance between vampires and mortals by his fingernails.</p><p>Although he\u2019d committed the same offense as the Fal en, his penalty was different; he suspected that was because he was too useful to throw away. But he was paying in other ways, every day of his endless life. He\u2019d paid for centuries watching Shadoe die over and over again, and he would continue to pay mental y and emotional y for an indefinite time to come. \u201cWe need to reinforce the Sentinels stil holding on to their outposts, which leaves us with only a handful here in the States to pul everything back together.\u201d</p><p>They were outnumbered by a fatalistic margin. He had a firm hold on the Jasper and Juarez outposts, but the others were lost. He looked at the beautiful vampress beside him, once the vessel that carried Shadoe\u2019s soul and now the woman who carried his heart in her hands. Her vampirism offered her a better chance of survival than she\u2019d had as a mere mortal, but she was stil weak and in need of frequent feeding. And Adrian\u2019s powerful Sentinel blood was al she would drink, which afforded her the ability to withstand sunlight but also meant he couldn\u2019t be separated from her for too long. As fragile as she yet was, that made her a terrible disadvantage for him.</p><p>His hands fisted against the need to touch her, a display of affection she wouldn\u2019t welcome, not in front of his Sentinels. She was ever careful to keep from flaunting the love that consumed them both, knowing the risks he\u2019d taken to claim her as his own. Angels weren\u2019t supposed to crave or need another to complete them. They were meant to be above the failings of mortals, but he wasn\u2019t so perfect. He hungered and ached for Lindsay with a ferocity he couldn\u2019t control, and he couldn\u2019t regret his trespass because it would belittle what he felt for her. He couldn\u2019t profess his love for Lindsay in one breath, then beg forgiveness for it with the other without rendering both pledges worthless. And he couldn\u2019t walk away or turn his back to her. She was the very air he breathed, his reason for waking and fighting and persisting against the odds.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, he looked to the sky for answers and found none. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to hunt both lycans and vampires. We have to choose. We know what we\u2019re dealing with on the latter front. The lycans, however, are a mystery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey could expose us to mortals,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>\u201cThey could hunt us to neutralize the risk we present to them,\u201d Malachai suggested.</p><p>\u201cThey could al y with the vampires,\u201d Geoffrey threw in. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past Syre.\u201d</p><p>Adrian nodded, knowing Syre was hurting now, having lost his daughter forever when Lindsay had exorcised Shadoe\u2019s reincarnated soul from her body. \u201cThat\u2019s the most likely scenario of the three.\u201d</p> <p>The three Sentinels didn\u2019t know what it was like to lose a piece of one\u2019s heart\u2014they hadn\u2019t been compromised by human emotions as Adrian and Syre had been. Adrian didn\u2019t doubt that the vampire leader wanted to strike out in his grief, and the lycan revolt would give Syre the perfect means to that end.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s eyes lost their brightness. She shook her head vehemently. \u201cI can\u2019t see that happening. Elijah lives to hunt vamps, and he wants Vashti\u2019s head on a platter for what she did to Micah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Syre, Torque, and Vashti want his because of Nikki\u2019s abduction,\u201d Adrian said, \u201cbut vengeance can be postponed with the right incentive.\u201d</p><p>He softened his voice, knowing she considered the lycan a friend. \u201cYou never thought he would revolt and he did.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip, her eyes reflecting her concern. Even now she worried about the Alpha.</p> <p>Adrian brushed across her mind, a gentle caress to calm her, because he couldn\u2019t bear to see her troubled. It wasn\u2019t just Elijah\u2019s fate making her anxious, but Syre\u2019s, too. She wasn\u2019t the vampire leader\u2019s daughter by blood, but carrying Shadoe\u2019s soul inside her had left a mark\u2014she\u2019d been exposed to Shadoe\u2019s memories of Syre: fond, sweet recol ections of a daughter\u2019s love for her father. While they weren\u2019t her memories, Lindsay felt the emotion of them as if they had been, and she grieved their loss.</p><p>She shot him a warning look, reminding him of her demand that he not \u201cmess\u201d with her mind. His head tilted in acknowledgment, but he didn\u2019t cease soothing her because he didn\u2019t perceive that as messing with her. At least not to his way of thinking.</p><p>Lindsay caught his wrist and imagined sticking her tongue out at him, the thought entering his mind with vivid clarity. He felt a silent laugh move through him. She was so ful of vitality and humor despite the many blows life had dealt her. He was so different from her, having been created to punish and imprison, to maim and kil . But she was teaching him a different way, changing him in slow degrees, bringing her light into his darkness.</p><p>And he made a concerted effort to learn and grow, to be the sort of man who could bring a smile to her face and happiness to her life. Because she was his soul. Who was he if not the man who loved her beyond al reason and self-preservation?</p><p>The phone began to ring in his office. They al heard it despite the distance from where they stood and the glass patio door that closed off his workspace from the outdoors. Lindsay frowned and turned, stil growing accustomed to her vampiric senses.</p><p>Adrian moved away, rounding the corner. The glass panel slid aside as he approached and he wil ed his wings away. They dissipated like fog in a stiff wind when he stepped inside, affording him comfortable movement as wel as the ability to blend with mortals. The speakerphone was engaged by the third ring and his gaze held Lindsay\u2019s as he settled into his chair.</p> <p>\u201cMitchel ,\u201d he greeted the cal er.</p><p>\u201cCaptain. Siobh\u00e1n here.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, settling in. He\u2019d tasked Siobh\u00e1n with studying the disease ravaging the vampire ranks, and she had been working ceaselessly on that mission for weeks. It was she who\u2019d inadvertently discovered that Sentinel blood cured the il ness when a Sentinel working with her was bitten by one of the infected, resulting in the infected returning to a normal vampiric state. Considering the tens of thousands of vampires in North America alone and the less than two hundred Sentinels left in existence, it was information they couldn\u2019t afford to have the vampires discover before an alternate cure was found. \u201cHow are you progressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlowly but surely. I\u2019ve got a dozen infected in stasis now. We can keep them alive with steady blood transfusions, but they have to stay anesthetized or they\u2019re impossible to control.\u201d</p><p>Adrian had seen the monstrosities in action firsthand. He knew how mindlessly violent they were. \u201cHow quickly do they lose higher brain function?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far do you want me to go to find out?\u201d she asked grimly. \u201cThey\u2019re already infected by the time I get them. If you want a play-by-play of what happens from exposure to il ness, I\u2019l need to deliberately infect healthy subjects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. Our blood is a cure, so we can reverse the damage.\u201d It was a brutal order and one he didn\u2019t enjoy making, but the ends justified the means. When Nikki had attacked him and nearly taken his life, she\u2019d stil been cognizant enough to speak to him coherently. How recently had she been exposed? Had she been an example of someone who\u2019d been recently contaminated? Or someone who\u2019d been il for a while? \u201cHave you been able to spot any patterns in the rapidity of progression?\u201d</p><p>Some vamps were dead within a few days, others lasted a few weeks, and stil others appeared to be immune. Why?</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m onto something in that regard.\u201d Her excitement came through in her voice. The pixielike Sentinel was ravenous for knowledge. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely positive yet, but it seems as if the advancement varies depending on how far removed the minion is from the Fal en heading their vampiric hierarchy. For example, Lindsay is once removed from Syre. Her infection would advance much more slowly than a minion she Changed, who would be twice removed from Syre. And so on and so on.\u201d</p><p>He set his elbows on the armrests and steepled his fingers together. \u201cYou need to test Fal en blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be helpful, yes,\u201d she conceded, certainly knowing how difficult it would be to attain. \u201cThen I could see if it at least slows the development of the disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your best chance of getting it,\u201d Lindsay interjected. \u201cAs a vampire myself, I\u2019d fit right in to any location where they congregate.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s response was immediate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted. Her amber eyes chal enged him\u2014the distinctive irises of a vampire. One who could move among the others with ease, but who was stil frail in many ways. His Sentinel blood would protect her from the il ness, and she knew how to fight and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kil , but she\u2019d stil be vulnerable and he wouldn\u2019t be close enough to protect her. And there was the fact that while most minions would have no idea who she was, some of the Fal en did because of Syre and Shadoe. She wasn\u2019t total y anonymous.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t risk her, couldn\u2019t lose her. \u201cNo,\u201d he said again, pushing the negation into her mind for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my head, angel,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n\u2019s melodious voice floated out of the phone\u2019s speaker. \u201cI\u2019m also going to need more lycan blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d He had plenty cryogenical y stored, for identification and genetic testing purposes. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps...\u201d She hesitated a moment. \u201cPerhaps other angelic blood samples. From a mal\u2019akh or even an archangel. Preferably both. Perhaps we Sentinels aren\u2019t the only ones who carry the cure in our veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ask for much, do you?\u201d Adrian said drily. Even though malakhim\u2014the lowest rank of angel in the lowest sphere\u2014were the most numerous, getting blood from one was no easy task. \u201cI\u2019l see what I can do. Keep me posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Captain. Of course.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, his gaze never leaving Lindsay\u2019s face. She was careful not to openly chal enge him in front of his subordinates, a circumspection she\u2019d always displayed and he had always appreciated. But she\u2019d chal enge him in private. He would never tel her how much it aroused him when she did so. He\u2019d just continue to show her instead... \u201cWe need a plan B, Lindsay. Work on coming up with that.\u201d</p><p>Elijah shoved both hands through his hair, his heart pounding violently, his gaze on the woman sprawled prone on the bed. Vashti\u2019s hair was a crimson cloud around her, the glossy strands lying sinuously atop her back and shoulders. Her face was turned toward him, her lips parted with her panting exhalations. Her clawed hands fisted the fitted sheet, and trails of tears were stil visible on her pale cheeks. Not due to him, but to the nightmare she\u2019d suffered that had woken him.</p><p>No...please...stop... Over and over in a broken litany. Whimpers and gasps of pain. Moans of agony that ripped through his vitals.</p><p>He would never forget the bloodcurdling scream that had sent him leaping from the bed as a man but landing on the floor in his lupine form.</p><p>Without his wil . His beast had bypassed his control for the first time ever. For her. Because she\u2019d cried out in distress, struggling through the throes of a nightmare.</p><p>And he\u2019d been unable to shift back until the beast was certain she was al right. He\u2019d paced the room, sniffing along the cracks around the door and in the corners, growling because there was no other outlet for his helpless fury but to search and find nothing to kil . Once he\u2019d been assured that nothing in the locked room posed a threat to her, he\u2019d padded over to the bed. He had nuzzled against the crown of her head and licked away her tears. She\u2019d calmed then, settling back into a fitful sleep. Only then had he been capable of shifting back.</p><p>Everyone was wrong about him\u2014he was no Alpha or he would never have shifted without conscious thought. Which meant they needed to find one who was. Quickly.</p><p>In the meantime, he was crazily attuned to Vashti. To the extreme. Their primal mating had brought on more than explosive orgasms. It had altered him and his reactions to her, eroding his control along with his goddamn common sense. He could hardly recognize himself this morning.</p><p>What the fuck was the matter with him?</p><p>He was afraid he knew. Those endless moments when he\u2019d been bound and captured beneath her, helpless to stop her as she took his blood and his semen into her mouth, riveted by the burn of fury and ferocious desire as she sheathed his aching cock in her tight, hot depths...they\u2019d shifted him on the inside. And when he had taken over and she\u2019d shattered beneath him, he had accepted the surrender of such a powerful and lethal woman with a possessive surge of awe and gratitude.</p><p>Someone\u2019s fist pounded against the door, and Elijah yanked it open, scowling at the interruption of Vashti\u2019s rest.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he snapped at Salem, who sucked up al the space in the hal way. Elijah didn\u2019t give a shit that he was bare-assed naked.</p><p>Neither did the vamp.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Vashti?\u201d Salem barked back. Then his nose twitched as he scented the air. His eyes widened as he comprehended just how thoroughly Elijah had seen her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping. Come back later.\u201d Elijah backed up and shut the door.</p><p>Salem stopped the latch from catching with a slap of his palm against the metal. \u201cSleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Eyes closed. Lack of consciousness. Sound familiar? Go away.\u201d</p><p>Salem pushed to widen the opening. \u201cMove aside, lycan.\u201d</p><p>Bored with the conversation and stil aggravated by Vash\u2019s nightmare, Elijah stepped out to the hal way and shut the door careful y behind him.</p><p>Then he shoved the vampire across the hal and into the opposite doorway, which Salem busted through to slide into the foot of a heavily occupied bed. Elijah got a glimpse of enough bare limbs and arched necks to make up at least four bodies.</p><p>Salem was up and in Elijah\u2019s face in a split-second. \u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off, dog. Vash doesn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does when she\u2019s tired.\u201d</p><p>Amber eyes glowing, Salem\u2019s voice lowered ominously. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y?\u201d Elijah asked drily. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your damn business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hurt her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elijah laughed at that, a sound with little humor in it. He\u2019d been chained and assaulted, and the vamp was worried about Vash. \u201cShe can take of herself.\u201d</p><p>Salem stared him down. Elijah yawned.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t slept in decades,\u201d the vamp said final y.</p><p>\u201cWel , that might explain why she\u2019s so bitchy.\u201d Elijah\u2019s voice changed, lowered. \u201cBut then bitchy is preferable to broken.\u201d</p><p>The vamp\u2019s jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her, Salem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her yourself, lycan.\u201d Salem\u2019s mouth curved with mocking cruelty. \u201cUntil she tel s you that, you\u2019ve got nothing but sex with her. You\u2019re just a dick with stamina.\u201d</p><p>Elijah was a second away from slamming his fist in the vamp\u2019s taunting face when Salem turned and stepped back into the room he\u2019d crashed into, lifting the warped door off the ground and popping it into the frame with himself inside.</p><p>It took Elijah a few minutes and several deep breaths to rein in his volatile mood enough to return to the room he shared with Vash. He pushed the door open slowly and just wide enough for him to slide in. What he saw inside froze him.</p><p>Vashti sat on the edge of the mattress, his shirt in her fisted hands and pressed to her nose. She jerked guiltily when he came in, as if she\u2019d been caught doing something she shouldn\u2019t. Her hands dropped into her lap, baring her gorgeous tits.</p><p>She stood in an agitated rush. \u201cWhat time is it? We should get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little after seven.\u201d He didn\u2019t need a watch to tel him that. His circadian rhythm was instinctively set by the moon, wherever in the world he was, courtesy of the werewolf blood in his lineage. He approached her cautiously, as if nearing a skittish animal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes were huge in her face, and even in the dark room they were shadowed. The stench of fear and pain stil clung to her skin, which might have been why she\u2019d buried her nose in his scent instead. Or maybe she just craved it, as he craved hers. He could struggle with that craving, even hate himself for it, but he\u2019d learned that ignoring it was too dangerous, leaving him too off-balance and unstable to control himself as he needed to.</p><p>He was a creature of instinct and she cal ed to that primal part of him in a way he couldn\u2019t afford to ignore or marginalize.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already late getting back,\u201d she said, attempting to turn away as if to reach for her clothes.</p><p>He caught her with a gentle but firm grip on her elbow. The feel of her skin against his fingertips was like satin, and a powerful jolt shot through him. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElijah\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tugging her closer, he gripped her nape and pul ed her face into the crook of his neck, where he knew his scent would be concentrated. She inhaled sharply, then sighed. A heartbeat later she was nuzzling her face into his skin, her lips feathering over his rapidly elevating pulse. He wondered if she knew how much pleasure her gesture gave a lycan, then decided she didn\u2019t, which was for the best. She didn\u2019t need to have any more ammunition to use against him.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he absorbed the feeling of her lushness pressed against him and the blessed lack of tension between them. Her height was just right and her curves molded into his harder frame as if they were two halves of a whole. A perfect fit...with the absolute wrong woman. \u201cWhat do you dream about, Vashti?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened and tried to pul away, but he\u2019d anticipated that and held tight.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she said crossly.</p> <p>\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could make you.\u201d</p><p>His hand fisted in her hair, pul ing her head back to look into his eyes. \u201cYou can ask me nicely and I\u2019l think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , that\u2019s not a very nice way to ask, but okay.\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped her and was quickly stifled, but it was breathtaking while it lasted. Deep and husky, it was rusty, but as ful -bodied as she was.</p> <p>He scooped her up and set one knee on the mattress, then the other, until he reached the center, where he laid her out. Joining her, he stretched out along his side and propped his head in his hand. He laid the other on her taut, smooth stomach with his fingers splayed, holding her down without pressure while also anchoring her for his questions.</p><p>\u201cWho hurt you, Vashti?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is. I can\u2019t kil them if I don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hel it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe screwed around once. Don\u2019t make anything out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActual y\u201d\u2014he grinned\u2014\u201cit was more like a dozen screws. Give or take a few.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave it alone, puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cShit. You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 Boy Scout, aren\u2019t you? Saving the world one problem at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping you find the ones who kil ed your mate, but you won\u2019t trust me with those who hurt you? Do I get to you in some way, Vash?\u201d he goaded. \u201cDo I make you feel vulnerable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flatter yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo put me in my place.\u201d</p><p>Vash took a deep breath, her muscular abdomen lifting into his palm. \u201cSyre took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook care of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, Elijah. It\u2019s done and over with. Ancient history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna tel me.\u201d He lifted his hand to her mouth, running his thumb across her bottom lip. He slid it inside when she started to protest.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not today, but soon.\u201d</p><p>He groaned when she sucked on his finger, her bottom teeth scoring over the pad. His cock lengthened and thickened, remembering what it felt like to have her mouth on him. She\u2019d taken from him by force what he would\u2019ve given her wil ingly, but the pleasure had been there nevertheless, his hunger for her so sharp he\u2019d wanted her however he could have her. But what he real y needed was to be gentle with her and she needed that tenderness, even though she fought so damned hard against it. Fought enough for both of them.</p><p>He parted her lips with a gentle downward press of his thumb and bent his head to lick teasingly inside, barely enough for her to feel him. As badly as he\u2019d wanted to devour her in the parking lot the night before, he wanted something softer and sweeter now.</p><p>Her hand wrapped around his wrist. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this. We\u2019ve got a lot to get done.\u201d</p><p>Cupping her cheek, he took her mouth in a deep, wet kiss. He kept the pace slow when she tried to speed it up, resisting giving her the swift plunges of his tongue that she begged for with her plaintive whimpers and heated enthusiasm. Instead he stroked and he licked. His lips moved softly against hers.</p><p>She gasped, slinging one long, lean leg over his hip. \u201cStop playing with me.\u201d</p><p>Elijah rol ed over her and pinned her down. Linking their fingers, he restrained her hands on either side of her head. \u201cWe need to play, Vashti. I need to. After this last week...the last fucking month, real y.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, looking younger and more fragile than he\u2019d ever seen her. She was ageless, a fal en angel who\u2019d existed for mil ennia.</p><p>She\u2019d kil ed countless beings, some viciously, as she had Micah, and she would kil countless more. And yet she was soft and lax in his arms, warm and open, exposed for a moment due to a nightmare she\u2019d avoided facing for decades. He wondered if he would ever have her like this again or if she would always be as she\u2019d been last night, brutal y determined to objectify him.</p><p>And he wondered why he gave a shit either way when he was going to kil her.</p><p>\u201cYou like me,\u201d he murmured, sliding his tongue along her bottom lip, which was plump and swol en from his kisses.</p><p>\u201cI want you. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>Vash turned her head away from his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I wish I didn\u2019t.\u201d He settled comfortably in the cradle of her thighs. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be afraid of liking me. I won\u2019t use it against you, except when I need my cock in you. You\u2019l like that, too, once I show you how it\u2019s real y going to be between us, without al the bul shit you pul ed last night.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled his nose between her breasts, breathing in her luscious scent now mingled with his own. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance that us liking each other wil change our agreement. You like that about me, too\u2014that I keep my word.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted to his waist and he hummed his approval. He was a lycan; he liked to be touched. Petted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to piss me off,\u201d she said, before sinking a fang through his earlobe.</p><p>The sweet nip of pain swel ed his dick to the point of aching. Provoked, he rocked his hips against hers, nudging against her cleft. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou k-know why.\u201d Her slender arms wrapped around him. \u201cI know why.\u201d</p><p>Because a pissed-off Vashti he could deal with. It was the newly discovered, tormented one that shredded him. She was so strong and fearless.</p><p>To see such a magnificent woman reduced to cowering fear offended him deeply, made him want to rip something\u2014or someone\u2014apart.</p><p>Her fingers walked down his spine, eliciting a soft growl of pleasure. \u201cThank you for irritating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActions speak louder than words. Touch me, Vashti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere.\u201d The way he needed her to but wouldn\u2019t explain, not after the rough night they\u2019d had. He could want her and like her, but needing her was too much. Didn\u2019t make any damn sense. But then he wasn\u2019t at his best now. In some ways, perhaps, the violent upheaval in his life had left him as raw as she was.</p><p>She moaned when he plumped her tit in his hand, then hissed as his mouth surrounded her and his tongue flicked lightly over her hardening nipple.</p><p>He also liked to lick.</p><p>\u201cMmm...\u201d She arched her spine, pushing her lushness into his working lips. \u201cYou\u2019re a breast man.\u201d</p><p>He was a Vash man, but kept that to himself. Instead he wal owed in her, breathing in the cherry-sweet scent of her that drove him out of his mind.</p><p>She responded by pushing her fingers into his hair and kneading his scalp, holding him close. His eyes closed on a groan. A shudder racked his frame.</p><p>\u201cCan you be so easy to pleasure, lycan?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try and see what happens?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><p>Syre glanced over at his son standing in the doorway and took one last, deep drink from the wrist at his mouth. He licked the wound closed and lifted his head, looking into the dazed blue eyes of the sexy brunette who\u2019d been feeding him. \u201cGet some orange juice, Kel y, and go lie down for an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, coming to a ful er awareness. Her mouth curved as she focused on him, completely unaware that she\u2019d just donated a pint of blood to his diet. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l join you,\u201d he promised, looking forward to it. Kel y was hot to get fucked, having come into Raceport for the express purpose of indulging in as much booze and sex as she could get her hands on. He\u2019d careful y cultivated Raceport to become a premier destination for bikers and their babes, needing the adventurous transients to fuel the proliferation of cabals and covens in the area. The abundance of sexual partners was a side benefit he hadn\u2019t considered in advance, but was certainly appreciative of now.</p><p>Sex was one of the few activities in his life that made him feel...human. For a little while.</p><p>Pouting, she pushed to her feet and tossed her long hair over her shoulder. Her midriff was bared by her cropped tank and her legs were exposed by super-short cutoff jeans. Her slender arms were covered in sleeves of tattoos, and her navel was pierced with a tiny silver ring. Syre enjoyed the view despite its inability to truly inspire him. He preferred a different sort of female, mature and discerning, but he\u2019d long ago realized what a mistake he was in those women\u2019s lives. He could give nothing but physical pleasure, which eventual y turned into emotional pain. So he\u2019d learned to ignore what suited him best in favor of partnering with women whom he best suited, even though that was very rarely one and the same.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner you leave, Kel y,\u201d Torque said drily, \u201cthe sooner he\u2019l join you.\u201d</p><p>She turned, realizing they weren\u2019t alone in his suite after al . For a moment, she looked irritated; then her gaze swept over Torque, warming with interest.</p><p>The resemblance between him and Torque was so slight as to be almost nonexistent. Like his twin, Shadoe, Torque had taken after their mother in his facial features. He was shorter than Syre by half a foot, lean in the waist and hips but thick with muscle in the thighs, arms, and chest. His brutal y short hair was spiked in opposing directions, the thick Asian locks dyed a shocking green at the tips. It was a style that suited both his sloe eyes and his sharp-edged lifestyle. Torque managed a chain of clubs that offered haven to fledgling minions while also catering to the hungers of elder vampires.</p><p>Licking her lips, Kel y offered, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us, too?\u201d</p><p>Torque\u2019s face stayed hard, his heart too freshly shattered by the loss of his mate, Nikki, to even think about sex. \u201cSorry. Sharing pussy with Syre is a bit too incestuous for my tastes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncestuous?\u201d She frowned and glanced at Syre, who appeared to be about ten years older than Torque\u2019s mid-twenties appearance. \u201cNo way are you related.\u201d</p><p>Syre caught her gaze and murmured, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>The compulsion settled into her mind and she nodded, exiting the room with a dreamy smile.</p><p>\u201cThey never believe me,\u201d Torque said, coming deeper into the room and dropping into a black leather wingback.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep asking me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep being evasive.\u201d He knew his son\u2019s pain, had experienced it himself when he\u2019d lost his mate so very, very long ago. And Torque was a naphil, one of the nephalim children he and the other Fal en had created with their mortal mates before their fal . The nephalim were halflings, part angel and part mortal. Unlike the Fal en or minions, they had souls. They felt joy and pain more deeply; Syre\u2019s lingering grief was a shadow of what his beloved son felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrible,\u201d Torque said bluntly. \u201cThe Alpha told Vashti the truth: there was anticoagulant in the blood we found at the site of Nikki\u2019s abduction, which makes it possible he was set up to take the blame. I\u2019m back at square one looking for whoever took her from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l find them,\u201d Syre promised, vengeance hot and fierce in his veins. It was the overriding emotion in his life of late, as his careful y constructed world crumbled around him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it. The cabal in Anaheim has been slaughtered. Every single member.\u201d</p><p>Syre hissed out his breath. \u201cAn angel somewhere is covering his or her tracks. Whose side are they are on? They steal Lindsay from Adrian and deliver her into my hands, then vanquish the vampires who saw to her delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck knows?\u201d Torque\u2019s booted foot rapped out a frustrated staccato on the hardwood floor. \u201cEven if it is an angel, there\u2019s no guarantee it was a Sentinel. It could be a winged class of demon who took her from Angels\u2019 Point, for al we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else would have access to stored lycan blood but a Sentinel?\u201d Adrian\u2019s cryogenic storage facilities were wel guarded by Sentinels. Not even the lycans themselves had access to their own samples.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming there\u2019s only one individual responsible for both Nikki and Lindsay\u2019s abductions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOccam\u2019s Razor,\u201d Syre murmured, his mind shifting through the known facts.</p><p>\u201cFuck Occam. I\u2019d like to shove his razor up his ass.\u201d</p><p>Brows lifting, he refocused on his son. \u201cUse your anger to strengthen your focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us have our head in the game, Dad. We\u2019re al reeling.\u201d Torque took a deep breath. \u201cBut the reason I interrupted your afternoon snack is Vash. I just got off the phone with Salem, and he\u2019s concerned about the Alpha.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He would never forget the sight of Vash pinned to a tree by a bristling, infuriated lycan\u2014a breed she had just cause to revile.</p><p>\u201cHe fucked her last night.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passed as Syre\u2019s brain struggled to process the impossible. \u201cBe careful how you speak of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else am I supposed to say it?\u201d Leaning forward, Torque set his elbows on his knees and clasped his hands. \u201cI know how she feels about lycans, and this one is under suspicion for Nikki\u2019s kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we seem to have discovered that he\u2019s not responsible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget the lycan she tortured for information. What are the chances the Alpha doesn\u2019t know about that or that she was hunting him when she did it? You ever heard of a lycan not avenging the unprovoked death of a packmate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he forced her? Or extorted her cooperation in some way? Is that what Salem said?\u201d Syre\u2019s voice was low and furious. The thought twisted through his mind, rousing a murderous ferocity.</p><p>He would raze the earth to protect Vashti. She was his conscience, his adviser, his hammer, his ambassador, and countless other extensions of himself. She was the strongest woman he\u2019d ever known, yet he\u2019d seen her shattered into pieces. Utterly broken and defiled. She\u2019d pul ed herself together in the years since, but the cracks and fissures remained. While others thought she was harder and more inviolate than she had ever been, he knew she was more fragile. It was why he forced himself\u2014against every instinct\u2014to keep her on the front lines. If she thought he viewed her as diminished by the desecrations inflicted on her, it would be a blow he didn\u2019t think she was strong enough to bear. His belief in her strength was what bolstered her belief in herself.</p><p>\u201cSalem doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on; that\u2019s why he cal ed. He only knows that they had sex and the Alpha wouldn\u2019t let him see Vash this morning, said she was sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Syre pushed to his feet, knowing damn wel that Vash hadn\u2019t slept in ages.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t touched a man since Charron,\u201d Torque reminded him unnecessarily. \u201cYou real y think her first go would be with a lycan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReady my plane.\u201d Syre stalked toward his bedroom to pack. He\u2019d heard enough. \u201cI want to take off within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Vash blinked against the harsh glare of the sun as she exited Shred. Behind her, Elijah growled at the Vegas heat not yet at its fiercest. Lycans were sensitive creatures, which\u2014if she\u2019d been thinking clearly\u2014might\u2019ve clued her in to how much Elijah enjoyed being touched. She knew now, and she damned the time constraints that prevented her from indulging him. She\u2019d had him purring at the time Salem came back to pound on the door. Her captain had given them barely thirty minutes between interruptions, just long enough for Salem to get a blow job while he cal ed Torque, taking multitasking to the extreme.</p><p>If she could have...if there had been time...she would have sent Salem away so Elijah could finish what he\u2019d started. She was shamed now to think of what she\u2019d done to him the night before in her fear. Her own astonishing weakness for him made her so vulnerable, which both terrified her and made her blind to his returning vulnerability where she was concerned. That she, a woman who\u2019d long ago learned to use her attractiveness against men, could miss that susceptibility was a sign of how skewed she was. It would have soothed her body and mind to do it over again, to start the day with gentle morning sex to erase the lingering anger of the night before and to reestablish her control of herself and the situation.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she tried to clear Elijah from her mind. She\u2019d reached the Jeep alongside Salem before she realized the Alpha wasn\u2019t with them. Turning around, she looked for him and found him circling slowly, his head tilted back to put his nose in the air. Something in the way he held his body warned her. She grabbed one of her katanas and her cel phone from the backseat and returned to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Vash inhaled again, but her sense of smel wasn\u2019t as acute as a lycan\u2019s.</p><p>As she shoved her phone into her top, he looked at her, his face grim. \u201cAn infected. No more than two blocks over. Somewhere to the north of us.\u201d</p><p>Yanking his shirt over his head, he toed off his boots and dropped his jeans. In an instant he was wolven, a big and beautiful y regal beast. A moment beyond that, he was gone.</p><p>She was right on his tail, tracking the scent of him that seemed embedded in her senses. Distantly, she was aware of Salem at her side. They\u2019d been hunting together so long it was effortless. He feinted in counterpoint to her, darting around obstacles like Dumpsters and discarded cardboard boxes. With nary a signal between them, they took to the wal s, racing opposite each other down an al eyway. Her hair whipped in the wind, her steel stilettos bit into the stucco, breaking off chunks to crumble to the ground below.</p> <p>And in the back of her mind she was aware that Elijah had thrown himself into a hunt for a vampire without a second thought. One of her people, as they were al hers. As if it was instinctive for him to do so when in truth he\u2019d simply been wel trained. By Adrian.</p><p>How could that have slipped in importance in her mind?</p><p>The shattering of glass preceded her turning a corner. Elijah\u2019s tail disappearing through a broken window directed her along with his scent. It was a building under construction; most of the windows stil bore the manufacturer\u2019s sticker. Salem bounded through first, widening the opening. Vash sailed through after him, tucking and rol ing and springing up onto her feet. And froze.</p><p>The construction workers that should have been al over the site were al over the floor instead. In pieces.</p><p>Salem cursed. Elijah crouched low and growled.</p><p>The bare concrete was covered in blood and entrails. Limbs and heads were scattered across the floor or lifted to ravenous foaming maws of at least a dozen wraiths. Bloodshot eyes glittered, nostrils twitching as they smel ed fresh meat.</p><p>Vash had seen such carnage before, when a rogue minion, driven insane by the deterioration of his mortal soul, had Changed everyone in his family. Lost to the initial bloodlust of the Change, they\u2019d gone on a rampage, slaughtering their entire neighborhood.</p><p>God. It never got easier to bear.</p><p>One of the wraiths stood apart from the others. Hunched and shuffling, he darted back and forth swiftly, wearing a semicircular path in the blood.</p><p>His gaze was riveted to Elijah, who paced with restless energy. With his ears flattened to his head, the Alpha snarled a threat.</p><p>The sickened vamp glanced at Vash and Salem. \u201cGo. Away.\u201d</p><p>The words were uttered in a voice so guttural it took her a moment to figure out what he\u2019d said. \u201cFuckin\u2019 A. Did that wraith just talk?\u201d</p><p>Just as she processed the possibility of higher brain function, the wraith leaped a good twenty feet across the room...directly at her. Startled, she raised her katana, knowing she was a split second too late and steeling herself for the impact.</p><p>Elijah blocked the assault in midair, jaws first, catching the wraith in the juncture between the shoulder and neck. A sickening crunch reverberated through the space, inciting an unexpected reaction\u2014the bloodpack abandoned their feast and lunged at the powerful lycan en masse.</p><p>Vashti leaped into the fray with a scream of rage, cutting anything that got in her way. Salem waded in bare-handed, cracking heads and necks as he progressed. None of the wraiths came after them. They remained dog piled on Elijah, ignoring the incoming vamps with a complete lack of self-preservation. Tossing his head, Elijah threw one after another over the writhing bodies surrounding him, his growls and barks lost amid the mindless screeches of his attackers.</p><p>She sliced through the frenzy toward the center, her heart pounding when she lost sight of him completely. Spurting blood obscured her vision as she hacked her way deeper. She swiped at her eyes, searching for Elijah amid the massacre, yel ing his name.</p><p>His yelp of pain seized her lungs. His pained howl broke her paralysis. \u201cSalem! Goddamn it. Help him. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get to him. Shit. I\u2019m fucking trying!\u201d</p><p>Yanking heads back by fistfuls of gray hair, she ripped wraiths off her lycan and decapitated them, her stomach knotting at the sight of chunks of bloodied fur clinging to their foaming mouths.</p><p>An agonized scream rent the air, fol owed by another.</p><p>Not Elijah. The tone wasn\u2019t deep enough. Jesus. The room was spinning around her in her panic.</p><p>She hauled another wraith back and saw Elijah in the space she\u2019d opened up. The wraith\u2019s body went limp in her grasp, then began to convulse.</p><p>Another wraith jerked away. Then another.</p><p>Suddenly what was left of the bloodpack fel away from the downed lycan. Flopping on their backs like fish out of water, they writhed, foam pouring from their mouths and their eyes rol ing back. The one who\u2019d spoken clutched his head, wailing. Abruptly, he ceased, crashing to the ground in a dead faint.</p><p>Or just dead, period.</p><p>When nothing moved in the lake of blood, Vash dropped her blade and sank to her knees beside Elijah, who lay panting on his side, his fur matted and his flesh torn away in deep gouges. She reached out, wanting to comfort but unsure of how she could.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him!\u201d Salem kicked bodies out of the way as he approached.</p><p>Elijah gave a low warning growl.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wounded animal, Vash. You know better.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she knew. Lycans were at their fiercest when they were most vulnerable. But as she looked into the green eyes of the wolf, she saw the man.</p><p>The man who\u2019d mastered her during the long night, then surrendered to her touch in the morning.</p><p>\u201cCan you shift?\u201d she asked softly, knowing that the process of shifting forms would knit some of his injuries and staunch the copious amounts of blood draining from his body.</p><p>His eyes closed on a shuddering breath. He was stil for so long she feared she\u2019d lost him.</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d The urgency in her voice made it harsh. Uncaring of the danger, she gingerly touched his head, stroking it. His eyelids lifted slowly, revealing unfocused irises. \u201cShift. Now. You can do it, you arrogant son of a bitch. You\u2019re too fucking stubborn to let a couple of diseased vamps get the best of you.\u201d</p><p>His rumbling growl was stronger than before, giving her wild hope.</p><p>\u201cVash\u2014\u201d Salem set his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Elijah lifted his head and bared his teeth, snarling.</p><p>Salem yanked his hand back. \u201cCrazy assed dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalem wil have to take care of me if you can\u2019t do it,\u201d Vash goaded, fighting off another spurt of panic. \u201cRaze, too. Maybe even that pretty pincushion I almost sucked on last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fire lit Elijah\u2019s eyes. He began to shimmer, like heat waves rising from sun-scorched asphalt. For a breathless moment he hovered in that in- between state, flickering between human and lupine form. Then, with a rattling exhale, he settled before her as a nude, severely wounded man.</p><p>\u201cGet the car,\u201d she ordered over her shoulder, pul ing Elijah close to cradle his head in her lap.</p><p>Salem left so fast, he caused a draft. Around her, the wraith bodies began to gurgle and shake. She watched, horrified, as they disintegrated into puddles of a thick tarlike substance. \u201cEww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m not...as bad off as I look,\u201d Elijah whispered, his eyes stil closed.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d But the blood that wasn\u2019t his was now clearly demarked by its obsidian coloring, leaving far too much crimson on his ravaged skin. It ran in thin rivulets over her lap and eroded canyons in the black ooze. \u201cYou damned heroic idiot. Stop protecting me. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let you have al the fun?\u201d</p><p>Pain twisted in her chest. Lifting her wrist to her mouth, Vash pierced the vein with her fangs and pressed the gushing wound to his mouth. He gagged, then struggled weakly, but she held fast, pinching his nose so that he was forced to swal ow. One gulp. Two. Three. His protests gained strength and she ceased, licking her wound closed.</p><p>\u201cTurn me into a vampire,\u201d he said hoarsely, \u201cand you\u2019l be the first I suck dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to take me down first.\u201d She brushed his sweat and blood-soaked hair away from his forehead. His heart beat too strongly to slip into the Change, but if she\u2019d waited another few minutes...? She pushed the thought away.</p><p>\u201cThis babying you\u2019re doing...as good as a verbal admission that you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Her eyes stung, but she told herself that was from the blood spatter on her face. She couldn\u2019t stop touching him, running her fingertips over his face and stroking through his hair to his scalp. \u201cYou pul ed this little stunt just to play on my sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my fault you\u2019d look hot in one of those naughty nurse\u2019s outfits.\u201d His chest lifted and fel with a sharp breath.</p><p>Their banter was breaking her heart, knowing how much the effort was costing him. But she didn\u2019t relent. As bad as it sucked, his pain was keeping his heartbeat elevated, which was helping to pump her healing blood through his veins. It was nowhere near as powerful as a seraph\u2019s pure blood, but it would nevertheless speed his healing.</p><p>\u201cWho knew I was so damn popular?\u201d he groused. \u201cMust be you, sweetheart. You want a piece of me...now they al do.\u201d</p><p>The one wraith with some active brain cel s had baited Elijah. She\u2019d bet her ass on it. He\u2019d goaded the chase that led to this ambush and then provoked Elijah by attacking the woman covered in his scent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Higher brain function is subverted by pure instinct, Grace had said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t imagining it, was I?\u201d she asked, noting that the brainy wraith\u2019s puddle had some shape to it, unlike the others. As if he was deteriorating more slowly. \u201cHe did talk, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told their brains are mush. Lights not on and no one home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour friend...Nikki...she talked.\u201d</p><p>Vash stiffened. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing worth remembering, but it was English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She jerked in surprise when her cel phone rang.</p><p>\u201cYour tit\u2019s ringing.\u201d</p> <p>Pul ing her phone out, she saw Syre\u2019s name on the cal er ID.

I\u2019l shred him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a number,\u201d Elijah muttered.</p><p>Realizing how she must look with blood al over her, she spoke quickly. \u201cWe ran into some wraith action in Vegas and it got messy, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me where you are and I\u2019l be there in less than thirty minutes. I\u2019ve got a helicopter on standby now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMcCarran. I just landed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god.\u201d She exhaled in relief. \u201cWait there. I\u2019l send Salem to you with Elijah and you can take them to the warehouse. He needs medical treatment and we\u2019re set up for it there.\u201d</p><p>Syre\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cThe Alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere wil you be?\u201d</p><p>Vash didn\u2019t say her intentions aloud, unwil ing to jinx her plans. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Elijah said, his eyes open and staring into hers.</p><p>Yes, she thought. You.</p> <p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Lindsay woke when the steady hum of the car\u2019s engine and air-conditioning ceased. Lifting her head from the seat back, she blinked at Adrian, who sat behind the wheel. \u201cI fel asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he agreed, his blue eyes warm and soft. He reached for her hand and linked their fingers together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She straightened and looked around, noting that they were in the driveway of a two-story peach stucco home in a quiet residential neighborhood. In lieu of grass, white gravel covered the yard, which wasn\u2019t unusual in Las Vegas. \u201cOh man...and you drove because you wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>Needing to utilize every minute of his endless time, Adrian was usual y chauffeured from one place to another, al owing him to work even when he was on the road. In addition to his duties as leader of the Sentinels, he owned Mitchel Aeronautics, effectively giving him two ful -time endeavors to manage. It was fortunate that he didn\u2019t require sleep, or he\u2019d never get anything finished.</p><p>She shoved her free hand through her short blond curls and looked at her lover contritely. Sentinels had astonishingly acute hearing. There was no privacy to be found at Angels\u2019 Point. Every word and sound could be picked up by any Sentinel within a mile radius. When Adrian wished to speak to her privately, he took her away, flying her to remote hil s surrounding the Point so that eavesdropping would be impossible. He\u2019d suggested they make the five-hour drive to Vegas alone, shunning both a driver and the use of any of his many privately owned aircraft so they could chat at length as they so rarely had the opportunity to do.</p><p>He hummed softly and reached out to stroke a fingertip down the side of her face. \u201cWatching you sleep was a joy as wel , neshama.\u201d</p><p>My soul. The endearment stil astonished and awed her. How could she be the soul of this man...this angel? Her eyes swept over his beloved features, his dark and seductive beauty tightening her chest. His inky black hair framed a face so savagely masculine just looking at him turned her on. Winged brows and thick lashes framed eyes of a preternatural cerulean\u2014the pristine blue found at the heart of a flame.</p><p>Too often she forgot what he was, a powerful winged being not of this world. When her hands and mouth stroked over his impossibly perfect body, worshipping warm olive skin stretched taut over rippling muscles, his abandoned and feverish response made him al too human. His voice when he spoke to her privately, in the flesh and in her mind. The way he touched her...nuzzled against her...wrapped himself around her when they took to their bed...He was simply a man to her. Earthy, sultry, and achingly fervent.</p><p>Adrian, my love, she thought, guilt and sorrow tainting the edges of her happiness. He was the greatest gift she\u2019d ever received in her life, her solace and dearest pleasure. And she returned that joy by being a tragedy in his life, a weakness and a sin she feared he would one day pay too steep a price for.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d It was the nature of what he was that his voice could be so mesmerizingly resonant while also sharp and furious.</p><p>Embarrassed that he\u2019d heard her maudlin internal pity party, Lindsay tried to tug her hand out of his and break the connection. He held fast, his seductively curved mouth thinned into a determined line. \u201cPerhaps I should demonstrate how much solace and pleasure you give me in return.</p><p>Maybe the memory has faded in the hours since you last wrang me dry. If so, I\u2019l need to work harder to leave a more indelible recol ection.\u201d</p><p>A shiver moved through her and her eyes slid helplessly to the thick vein pumping strong and steady along his throat. She licked her lips, her own blood hot and thick with wanting him. She\u2019d fed from his wrist just before she slept, but her hunger was acute, both for his blood and his rockin\u2019 body.</p><p>\u201cSex,\u201d she breathed, overwhelmed by her sudden need for it. For him. The rapidly heating interior of the car only increased her desire. The continuing evolution of her Change made her a tactile creature, one who responded swiftly, and often unexpectedly, to external stimuli. Once she matured past the fledgling stage, she\u2019d be impervious to such things as external temperature, but for now everything seemed capable of setting her off.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d he corrected, cupping her cheek with his free hand and leaning toward her. \u201cExpressed physical y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeatedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he purred, sliding his mouth softly across hers. \u201cYou\u2019re teaching me every day, in so many ways, how to love. I thought I knew, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She fought off a twinge of jealousy over Shadoe, the naphil daughter of Syre whom Adrian had loved for ages. Over many reincarnations. The last one being Lindsay herself. And yet faced with the culmination of his endless quest to possess Shadoe, he\u2019d chosen her\u2014Lindsay\u2014instead. She wondered if she would ever truly understand why.</p><p>His lips moved against hers. \u201cBecause you showed me what love truly is just by giving yours so selflessly. I wasn\u2019t made for love. It wasn\u2019t weaved into the fabric of my being. I didn\u2019t know what it was, what I was looking for, what I needed. I had no point of reference, no examples, nothing. Until you.\u201d</p><p>Adrian took her mouth in a lush, deep kiss, his tongue stroking along hers, the leisurely rhythm and his total control a blatantly erotic promise of things to come.</p><p>She moaned, the sound both a plea and a surrender.</p><p>Lifting his head, Adrian watched her with heavy-lidded eyes, his thumb brushing over her swol en mouth and peeping fangs. \u201cShadoe possessed me. I was consumed by her hunger and her conviction that I was meant to be hers. I was a void, neshama. An emotionless being. When you bring something into nothing, it\u2019s impossible to know if it\u2019s good or bad for you. You know only that losing what you have would leave you with nothing again. She brought me emotional pain and physical pleasure, and I clung to those things even as I wanted nothing so much as to go back and make a different choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say any more.\u201d The torment in his voice made her heartsick.</p><p>\u201cBut you, Lindsay my love, delight me. You fil the hole in me I didn\u2019t know was there. The pleasure of your touch is the sweetest agony, because it\u2019s never enough. I\u2019l never have enough. As many times as I have you, I always want more. What I feel for you consumes me. I couldn\u2019t live without it.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay pressed her forehead to his. \u201cI\u2019m learning, too. Slower than you, but I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made me a man,\u201d Adrian whispered, his tongue tracing the curve of her bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me human.\u201d</p><p>She cried at that, tears slipping free. That\u2019s what she feared most\u2014that she\u2019d irrevocably damaged something irreplaceable.</p><p>You make me stronger than I\u2019ve ever been. She broke me down; you built me up. Why don\u2019t you know this, neshama? Tell me how to show you.</p><p>\u201cYou do. Beautiful y. It\u2019s the Change, Adrian. It\u2019s like premenstrual syndrome times a thousand. I\u2019m having mood swings. Cravings. My sex drive is out of control. God, how do you put up with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d His clever fingertips stroked a circular pattern over the tender flesh behind her ear. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing about you.\u201d</p><p>She met his fierce gaze and held it. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Adrian\u2019s smile was so potently sexual and warmly tender that she grew slick between the thighs.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you again. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. I\u2019m yours.\u201d He glanced at the dashboard clock. \u201cWe have just enough time before the others catch up with us.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d taken off an hour and a half before the two lycans who would be accompanying them, so they\u2019d be assured of privacy. Then she\u2019d messed it al up by fal ing asleep only a couple of hours into the drive.</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cHow are you going to get anything done once I get to the point where I don\u2019t need sleep anymore? I can\u2019t keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>He exited the car and rounded the hood to her door before she could blink. His laughter sifted through her mind as he extended his hand to assist her out. \u201cWhat we\u2019l do with each other during sleepless nights isn\u2019t a concern I\u2019m ever going to have.\u201d</p><p>Looking at the lovely but average house in front of her, she asked, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelena\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s hand tightened on his. She knew how it tormented him that he\u2019d lost one of his closest and most treasured Sentinels.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying here? Maybe the Mondego would be better?\u201d she suggested, thinking of the glamorous hotel and casino owned by Raguel Gadara, a man known worldwide as a real estate and entertainment mogul. In celestial circles, he was known to be one of the seven earthbound archangels, his territory encompassing al of North America. Fal ing two spheres and several rungs lower in the angelic hierarchy than Adrian, Gadara was ambitious in both halves of his life.</p><p>\u201cAfter the stunt he pul ed last time? No.\u201d While his voice didn\u2019t rise, the adamancy in it was unmistakable. \u201cRaguel\u2019s more trouble than he\u2019s worth.</p><p>I just want his blood.\u201d</p><p>A chil rol ed down Lindsay\u2019s spine. The way Adrian spoke sounded figurative as wel as literal, which would be bad news for Gadara. She wondered if Adrian\u2019s enmity had anything\u2014or everything\u2014to do with Gadara helping her flee Adrian and her forbidden feelings for him so many weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cRaguel makes enough trouble for himself on his own,\u201d Adrian answered. Linking their fingers, he led her to the front door.</p><p>The strengthening of his grip on her hand wasn\u2019t an indication of disquiet, but she knew visiting this place must be hard. Helena had been special to him. She\u2019d been a Sentinel Adrian considered pure of purpose and unshakable in her faith. She had been his proof that the Sentinels weren\u2019t destined to fail their mission as a rule, that his transgressions with Shadoe and herself were unique failures of his.</p><p>But Helena had fal en in love with her lycan guard and she\u2019d given up her life trying to be with him, shattering that tender hope.</p><p>Adrian unlocked the door and they stepped inside. As he typed the access code into the beeping security system keypad, she frowned. \u201cIs someone staying here?\u201d</p><p>His gaze raked the room. \u201cGood question. Nice and cool in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my thought exactly\u2014why is the air-conditioning on?\u201d</p><p>Skirting him, Lindsay moved deeper into the living room. A glass walkway bisected the vaulted ceiling, connecting rooms over the garage with a room over the kitchen. Square windows near the ceiling al owed light to flood the space, creating an open and airy feel in the smal , welcoming home.</p><p>Her nose twitched and she caught his wrist, pushing her thoughts at him. Doesn\u2019t smell musty, like you\u2019d expect a closed-up house would. The plants are looking healthy, too.</p><p>Sleek tendrils of smoke unfurled from his back, taking on the shape and substance of wings. Gorgeous, bloodstained wings. They were soft to the touch, but deadly, capable of slicing through anything with the precision of the finest sword. If she was ever inclined to forget how dangerous he truly was, those wings would remind her\u2014she\u2019d watched him deflect bul ets with them. He was a being created for war, an enforcer of such power he wielded the fist of God.</p><p>I\u2019ll take the upstairs, he said. Please be careful.</p><p>Not for the first time, Lindsay wondered if he knew how much his trust in her ability to defend herself meant. He was a possessive man and one who was ferociously concerned for her wel -being, yet he knew that to hold her back or smother her would only lead to resentment and unhappiness.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t equal to him and never would be, but she couldn\u2019t hide behind his wings and stil look at herself in the mirror. As disparate as their skil s and natural weapons were, they had to face their battles side by side or there would be no hope for them as a couple. Adrian understood and made concessions for that tenuous balance between them, even though she knew it cost him dearly to do so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Concentrating hard, she got her fangs and claws to extend. She was stil getting used to what she was\u2014a monster; one of the bloodsucking creatures she\u2019d trained herself to kil in vengeance for her mother\u2019s murder. Making peace with her new identity was difficult at the best of times, but there were occasions\u2014such as this one\u2014when she appreciated the benefits.</p><p>Adrian moved quickly and silently, one moment at her side, the next on the glass walkway above her. If transients had holed up in the house, they were about to receive the fright of their lives. Perhaps that would teach them not to squat in someone else\u2019s abode.</p><p>Lindsay entered the combination family room/kitchen through an open archway. The space was smal but cozy. A dinette fil ed the alcove in front of a backyard window and a couch faced a flat-screen TV hung over a smal gas fireplace. A homey fragrance hung in the air, soothing her enough that her claws retreated without her volition. She was trying to process her lack of control over her body when a photo of Adrian and Helena on the mantel caught her eye, momentarily distracting her. It was a costly lapse.</p><p>\u201cHel o, Lindsay.\u201d</p> <p>An agonizing shard of pain in her shoulder dropped her to her knees with a sharp cry. Dizzy, her flesh sizzling, she looked at the smal throwing knife embedded in her shoulder. Then she lifted her head to meet a face that haunted her nightmares. \u201cVashti.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s memories of her mother\u2019s kil ing were hazy at best\u2014more like impressions and feelings than true pictures\u2014but Vash was a hard woman to forget. The vivid red hair and penchant for painted-on black clothing made her almost a caricature of a comic book superhero. But when Lindsay had bitten into Vash\u2019s throat and swal owed the vampress\u2019s blood, she\u2019d been exposed to the memories that blood carried and Rachel Gibson\u2019s brutal slaying was absent from them. Vash was the spitting image of her mother\u2019s kil er, but that was al . Stil , Lindsay couldn\u2019t fight the terror and revulsion she felt every time she saw the vampress.</p><p>Residual fear gave her the strength to yank the blade from her arm, but she moved too slowly. A mere split second and she found herself on her feet with Vashti pressed to her back and another silver blade\u2014a dagger\u2014held to her throat.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Vashti.\u201d Adrian\u2019s voice was chil ingly modulated, his face impassive as he suddenly fil ed the threshold between the kitchen and living room.</p><p>Lindsay wasn\u2019t fooled by his calm demeanor. With her heightened senses, she felt his turmoil and fury roiling through the air\u2014a tempest barely leashed.</p> <p>\u201cAn unexpected surprise finding you here,\u201d Vash said, speaking over Lindsay\u2019s shoulder, their faces nearly cheek to cheek. \u201cI was waiting on Helena, but you\u2019l more than compensate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Adrian repeated, taking a step into the room. \u201cI warned you, Vash. I won\u2019t do so again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as weak as a babe.\u201d Vash shifted, positioning her body so that both Lindsay and the kitchen island stood between her and Adrian.</p><p>\u201cFledglings are like infants, you know. Floundering in their own bodies, overwhelmed by their senses, easily damaged. She real y should be with the rest of us. We can teach her how to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018she\u2019s mine\u2019 don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you hate it, she\u2019s also mine and she\u2019s presently a rogue minion. I have the right to take her life. We police ourselves, as you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd do a piss-poor job of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave you something to do.\u201d</p><p>His chest lifted and fel with a deep inhalation. \u201cWhat do you want, Vashti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so the fierce and mighty Adrian bends...for a vampire. I so wish I had time to enjoy this.\u201d Vash snatched something off the counter and tossed it at Adrian, who caught it deftly. \u201cBut I\u2019m in a hurry. Fil it up.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay began to struggle when she saw what it was.</p><p>A blood bag.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d Lindsay said, realizing just how dangerous this confrontation had become. If Vash had sniffed out the effects of Sentinel blood on the infected vampires and wanted to test the cure, the resulting discovery endangered every life on earth. As few Sentinels as there were, they stil managed to keep the vampire population in check, sparing countless mortal lives. If they were hunted to extinction for their blood, the whole world would suffer.</p><p>\u201cHow noble and self-sacrificing,\u201d Vash murmured scornful y. \u201cAnd monumental y stupid. The helpless fledgling sacrificing herself for the powerful Sentinel. You two are so sappy you\u2019re making me nauseous.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian took another step toward them. \u201cYou used to know what it was like to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a step closer or I\u2019l have to kil her.\u201d The flat of the blade sizzled against Lindsay\u2019s neck, making her squirm. \u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t. My life means nothing to me\u2014you know that.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay stared hard at Adrian. \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Vash\u2019s lips pressed to her ear like a lover\u2019s. \u201cIsn\u2019t Elijah worth it to you? Or is your friendship so fickle?\u201d</p><p>Stiffening, Lindsay\u2019s breath quickened. The familiar scent that had sent her claws into retreat was Elijah\u2019s. And it was al over Vash. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been done can stil be undone...with a little Sentinel blood.\u201d</p><p>A tremor racked Lindsay\u2019s frame. She hadn\u2019t spoken to Elijah since he mutinied. She had no idea what had prompted him to revolt or whether his doing so made them enemies.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter, she thought grimly. What she and Elijah were to each other now might be a mystery, but what they\u2019d been to each other before was not. He\u2019d been a friend and trusted companion when she needed one. She couldn\u2019t bear to think of him suffering.</p><p>\u201cHe might die,\u201d Vash prodded. \u201cThis could be the one thing capable of saving him.\u201d</p><p>Swal owing hard, Lindsay continued to stare at Adrian, who would\u2019ve heard every word with his powerful Sentinel hearing.</p><p>\u201cYour blood is damn near as good as mine, Vash.\u201d Adrian\u2019s wings flexed, a sign Lindsay recognized as agitation. \u201cIf you want to save him, do it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given him what I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019s dead already.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s stomach knotted. \u201cTake me. I\u2019l be your blood bag. I\u2019m easier to transport and no spil age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay, no.\u201d To the casual observer, Adrian appeared unmoved by her statement. But the compulsory resonance in his words hit her like a Mack truck, sending a racking jolt through her body.</p><p>Vash\u2019s grip loosened a fraction. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you fed from him?\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to squeeze an answer past Adrian\u2019s compulsion. \u201cThree hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d Adrian\u2019s voice rumbled through the room like thunder.</p><p>The world exploded in a shower of glass. Lindsay was thrown outside the house and into the street...or so it seemed. When the world shuddered back into place, she realized Vash had leaped with her through the glass door and over the wal ...into a waiting convertible. They tore off like a bul et with Adrian directly behind them.</p><p>Lightning split the sky and hit the asphalt in front of the car.</p><p>Cursing, Vash jerked the wheel to the left and punched it around a corner, tires squealing as they nearly careened up the side of the curb and into a streetlamp.</p><p>\u201cBetter grab the wheel when the time comes,\u201d the vampress hissed. \u201cYou\u2019l be the only one who dies if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay, feeling il from the lingering effects of the silver, clung to the door handle and tried to kick her rattled brain into gear.</p><p>Adrian landed on the trunk with a violent thud, his feet sinking deep prints into the metal.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Vash yel ed, deflecting Adrian\u2019s grasping arm and lunging at him between the two front seats.</p><p>Throwing herself across the center console, Lindsay snatched at the wheel. Her sudden grab jerked the car right, then left as she tried to steer a straight line while lying on her side. Adrian was thrown free.</p><p>Vash tumbled into the backseat with a curse. \u201cDrive straight, damn it! Get to the Strip. He\u2019l have to back off.\u201d</p><p>A massive shadow darkened the sky over the car as Adrian swooped in again.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape Lindsay\u2019s mind that she was fleeing her very reason for living, the one individual she couldn\u2019t live without. But that\u2019s why she was doing it. Adrian\u2019s blood was too precious\u2014and the ramifications too great\u2014to risk what Vash demanded.</p><p>\u201cRed light!\u201d Lindsay shouted.</p><p>\u201cA little busy!\u201d Vash shot back, straightening to fight off Adrian\u2019s dive bomb. \u201cYou\u2019re making a spectacle of yourself, Sentinel!\u201d</p><p>Lightning struck the vampress square in the chest, knocking her unconscious. She slumped into the corner of the backseat like a broken dol .</p><p>\u201cMove, Lindsay,\u201d Adrian ordered, dropping wingless into the driver\u2019s seat and taking over the wheel. He turned into a strip mal and parked with a squeal of rubber over pavement. Twisting in the seat, he faced her with burning irises. \u201cWhat the hel are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck if it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it is,\u201d she argued, looking at Vash to make sure the vampress was stil out cold. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this for Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut that benefits you, too. You and I both want to figure out what happened with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what happened with him. I give a shit about you. Maybe you haven\u2019t been paying attention\u2014I can\u2019t live without you. Damned if I\u2019l risk you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah won\u2019t let anything happen to me. You know that, or you would never have made him my guard.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s knuckles whitened with the force of his grip on the steering wheel. \u201cElijah\u2019s half dead, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know if you can. Your blood has a negative effect on some beings. Don\u2019t forget I watched you slide a knife into a dragon\u2019s impenetrable hide just by coating the blade with your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiobh\u00e1n thinks that\u2019s because I was carrying two souls inside me,\u201d she reminded, \u201cand the creatures that were affected by it were demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a guess. We don\u2019t know, and Elijah has demon blood in him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, knowing that demon blood\u2014werewolf blood\u2014is what had turned some of the Fal en into lycans rather than vampires. \u201cI\u2019l tel him the risks and let him decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of the reasons he\u2019d be incapacitated in Vashti\u2019s keeping. One, she fucked him up because of the Nikki incident or because she\u2019s looking for Charron\u2019s kil ers. Two, they\u2019re working together and he got jacked in the process. You\u2019re either reviving him to put up with more torture or reviving him to col ude with the vampires against us. Nothing good is going to come out of doing this. In the meantime, you\u2019l be among the very people who need me weakened to achieve their aims. You\u2019re cutting out my heart and handing it to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d She cupped his cheek in her hand. His jaw was tight beneath her palm, the teeth grinding together. \u201cI would do that and more to save your life.\u201d</p><p>He set his hand over hers and squeezed. \u201cMy life is nothing without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me do this for your Sentinels. You\u2019l be putting their welfare ahead of mine and I think they need to feel like you would, at least under certain circumstances. And what wil it say to the lycans that you\u2019ve done this for Elijah? More may come back to you because they won\u2019t be afraid that you\u2019l kil them on sight. And the vampires...if they ever considered the thought that having me in their possession would weaken your mission, they\u2019l see that\u2019s not the case. Everyone knows what I mean to you. You\u2019l make a powerful statement by using me this way.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sweet talker, you.\u201d Lindsay reached into the medical supply store shopping bag on the floorboard between her feet and pul ed out a blood bag from an open multipack. \u201cHere\u2019s your opportunity to get the Fal en blood Siobh\u00e1n needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please stop being so fucking rational about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d she retorted. \u201cMore than my life. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your cel phone on you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He pul ed his out of his pocket and began tweaking the settings on it. \u201cYou\u2019l check in every hour on the hour. I want to hear your voice. Something goes south and you can\u2019t say it aloud, cal me Sentinel instead of my name and I\u2019l know. You miss a cal by more than ten minutes and I\u2019l raze the desert looking for you. I\u2019ve set the alarm to remind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Climbing over the seats, he grabbed Vashti\u2019s biceps with enough force to act as a tourniquet and slid the needle attached to the blood bag into her vein.</p><p>The vampress jolted awake to find the crimson tip of one of Adrian\u2019s wings curled inward and pressed to her throat\u2014the slightest resistance and she\u2019d lose her head.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d she growled, glaring.</p><p>\u201cYou have twelve hours,\u201d he said with icy impassivity, watching the bag fil . \u201cYou\u2019l bring her back to me without a scratch or I\u2019l stake you to a wal and make you watch as I disarticulate every one of the Fal en and shove their severed limbs down their throats. Without Lindsay I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. Do you understand? Nothing wil stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew the needle, then his wing. \u201cShe\u2019s going to cal me every hour and you\u2019re going to let her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJeez, Adrian,\u201d Vash muttered, sitting up. \u201cOne would almost think you didn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the shoulder?\u201d Vash asked Lindsay as the helicopter lifted gracefuly into the scorching desert sky with Raze at the cyclic. The car she\u2019d stolen was whipped with sand scattered by the revolving copter blades, but that probably wouldn\u2019t matter as much to the owner as the dents Adrian had left behind.</p><p>\u201cGood as new.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s voice betrayed her irritation. \u201cAre the blindfold and restraints real y necessary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could knock you out,\u201d Vash offered, smiling because the other woman couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cGee, you\u2019re so helpful,\u201d Lindsay muttered.</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like that worked out too wel for Elijah, considering he\u2019s on his deathbed.\u201d</p><p>Vash took the hit with clenched fists. She felt guilty and worried, her mind racing ahead of her common sense. She\u2019d risked more than her own hide by going after Sentinel blood. That she\u2019d done so for a lycan who intended to kil her made no damn sense at al .</p> <p>Leaning forward, she tapped Raze on the shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s the Alpha doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think? He\u2019s like a wolf in a bear trap\u2014he\u2019s snarling and snapping at everyone. Not that the lycans seem to mind. They\u2019re tripping over themselves trying to take care of him. I thought they were going to riot when he was unloaded from the chopper, but they calmed down when he told them he was jumped and you saved his ass.\u201d The Fal en captain looked over his shoulder at her. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop asking for you. I tried to distract him with a hot little honey named Sarah, but that\u2019s not doing the trick.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled as she remembered the demure lycan who\u2019d been so eager to tend Elijah\u2019s injuries and remain by his side.</p><p>Vash fel back into her seat with a heavy exhale, struggling to find her balance. She was an emotional disaster.</p><p>The helicopter was landing fifteen minutes later. The moment Raze cut the engine, Vash shoved the door open and hopped out. \u201cGet her. Keep her eyes covered until we\u2019ve got her in a room.\u201d</p><p>Her heels clicked across the parking lot and she entered the warehouse to find an industriously working crew. Van Halen blared on the radio as various groups went about unpacking and moving in. Salem stood before the map of contagion, explaining its significance to a mixed group of minions and lycans. Syre stood in the center of the vast space, clearly the orchestrator of activity.</p> <p>Dressed in sleek black trousers and a gray silk shirt, the Fal en leader was drawing the eye of everyone in the room. Elegant, powerful, compel ing. A crazed minion had once cal ed him the antichrist, the dark prince who would mesmerize the world and bring about its destruction. A ridiculous assertion if one knew Syre\u2019s heart at al , but she conceded that his charisma was fierce and seductive enough to bend the wil s of even the most contained of individuals. Even Vash, as used to him as she was, was drawn to him inexorably.</p><p>\u201cCommander,\u201d she greeted him as she approached. \u201cYour visit to Vegas is an unexpected surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn appreciated one?\u201d he queried smoothly, his whiskey-warm gaze searching her features.</p><p>\u201cDepends on whether or not you\u2019re here for the fun of it or because you think I need a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould the latter be so terrible?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like to think so.\u201d He held up a hand when her mouth opened in protest. \u201cFragility isn\u2019t always a weakness, Vashti. It happens to be one of your greatest strengths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a crock.\u201d Her mouth twisted rueful y. \u201cSir.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head at her, then froze, his gaze locked on something over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLindsay,\u201d she said, knowing without looking. Damn it, she\u2019d been so scrambled over Elijah, she had forgotten Syre would be present to see the mortal shel that once housed his daughter\u2019s reincarnated soul.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than Adrian al owed me to do. Lindsay offered to come when she learned Elijah was injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he said tightly. \u201cWhat purpose does her presence serve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Sentinel blood source, in lieu of Adrian\u2014\u201d She gasped when Syre cut off her breath with a crushing hand wrapped around her throat.</p><p>Her boots dangled two feet off the floor.</p><p>His eyes burned into hers, his fury stunning and frightening. \u201cYou went after Adrian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-Helena...actual y,\u201d she managed, fighting the urge to claw at the constriction that impeded her ability to speak.</p><p>He threw her thirty feet across the room at Salem, who caught her deftly. The warehouse fel into silence as someone hastily shut off the stereo; then the growls of agitated lycans rumbled through the air like war drums.</p><p>Vash struggled free of Salem\u2019s hold, embarrassed at being so publicly chastised and worried about Syre\u2019s cracked control. He didn\u2019t use physical force as a rule; he didn\u2019t need to. He could mesmerize like a snake charmer to get his way.</p><p>She was his fist. At least she had been until now.</p><p>Brow arched, Raze had stopped his progress across the warehouse floor halfway between the main door and Syre, his hand gripping Lindsay\u2019s elbow. She was stil bound at the wrists and blindfolded...by her choice. Her vampire strength could easily break the rope. She could lift her hand and push the blindfold up at any time. Her continuing cooperation was starting to make Vash suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Elijah?\u201d the blonde asked sharply. \u201cI want to see him. That was the deal.\u201d</p><p>The lycans responded with low rumbles. The ones who were seated rose to their feet, while those who stood sidled closer.</p><p>Unsure of whether their support lay with Lindsay or Elijah, Vash caught Raze\u2019s gaze. \u201cTake her to him.\u201d</p><p>Raze glanced at Syre, who stood unmoving for a long moment before giving a curt nod. Al heads turned to track Lindsay\u2019s progress. The smel of fear became thick and oppressive.</p><p>No one in the room doubted that her wel -being was tied to theirs. Adrian\u2019s wrath was something no one wished to incite.</p><p>When she disappeared through one of the office doorways lining the rear wal , the room as a whole seemed to exhale in a rush.</p><p>Syre pivoted and disappeared behind another door. The latch engaged with a quiet click, but the sound struck everyone like a gunshot report.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d Salem snapped behind her.</p><p>She shoved a hand through her hair. \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The tension in the room was so brittle it scraped along her skin. Making a beeline for the locker room and a much-needed shower, Vash fled the consequences of her inexplicable actions.</p><p>Elijah stirred from a half-conscious state when the door to his makeshift infirmary opened. \u201cVash?\u201d he croaked through a dry throat.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He stil ed, his nostrils flaring. Opening gritty eyes, he tried to blink through the fog of pain. \u201cLindsay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, El,\u201d she said softly, lifting his hand from the bed and gripping it. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Had the Sentinels rooted them out so quickly? He pushed the concern aside, finding he cared less about that than Lindsay\u2019s welfare. He lifted his other hand to scrub at his eyes. Trying again to see, he looked toward her voice and found worried vampire irises glowing down at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus. You are a vamp,\u201d he managed, taking some comfort in the fact that he smel ed Adrian al over her. The Sentinel real y hadn\u2019t turned his back on her when she was returned to him as something different from what she\u2019d been when she was taken.</p><p>\u201cYeah, imagine that.\u201d Releasing him, she picked up the water cup on the table beside the bed, twisting the straw around to offer it to him.</p><p>He drank deeply and grateful y, soothing his parched throat. When he\u2019d emptied the cup, his head fel heavily into the pil ow. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m overdue for blood donation and I heard you were in line for a transfusion.\u201d</p><p>His chest tightened as the import of her words sank in. \u201cLindsay...\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at Raze, then offered a smal smile to Sarah. \u201cWould you two give us a minute, please?\u201d</p><p>Both Raze and Sarah hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Elijah said, hating that he was so weak the others feared leaving him alone. \u201cShe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>Once the door shut, he studied Lindsay\u2019s face. Her hair was stil styled in short blond curls that framed a breathtaking face. Delicate brows and dark lashes framed eyes that had once been chocolate brown but were now the honey hue of a vampire. Her generous mouth was curved in an affectionate smile that revealed no fangs at present, but he could imagine them there.</p><p>\u201cKinda weird, right?\u201d she said wryly. \u201cI\u2019m stil getting used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told you wanted the Change. Was I lied to?\u201d Nothing would save Syre if that was the case. Elijah would kil him the moment he was strong enough to do so.</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way.\u201d She settled into the seat by the bed. \u201cThere were two people inside me\u2014two souls\u2014and one of them had to go. That\u2019s why I had that crazy inhuman speed as a mortal. That\u2019s also what I need to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>He listened to Lindsay\u2019s explanation of the possible hazards to accepting her blood before he asked, \u201cHow the hel did you get here? Where\u2019s Adrian? How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Vashti who brought me.\u201d Al the warmth left her face. \u201cWhat did she do to you, El? If she\u2019s just going to hurt you again, healing you isn\u2019t going to be enough. You have to tel me what I\u2019m dealing with here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVash found you?\u201d His eyes closed on a shaky exhalation. Christ. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came after Sentinel blood. She said she needed it to save you, but she wouldn\u2019t tel me why you were hurt in the first place.\u201d She gestured toward the door. \u201cI smel other lycans out there. Are they using you to control the others?\u201d</p><p>Fuck...He\u2019d do just about anything to not disappoint Lindsay. Anything except lie to her. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do this to me, Linds. We were working together and I got jumped by a pack of vamps. She tried to get to me, but she couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking together,\u201d she repeated. She slumped back into her seat, her gaze stark and sad. \u201cWhat about Micah\u2019s death? Was that part of some plan between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! For fuck\u2019s sake. You know me better than that. We\u2019re working together in spite of Micah\u2019s murder, not because of it.\u201d</p><p>She looked him straight in the eyes, then nodded, as if she saw the truth of what he said on his face. \u201cTel me honestly. Are we enemies now? Are you gunning for the Sentinels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I\u2019m just trying to save as many lycan and mortal lives as possible.\u201d He thought of the wraith ambush and a chil moved through him. What kind of world would they be living in if such attacks were commonplace? \u201cThe vamp infection we saw in Hurricane is spreading. Vash is trying to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you stop it with us?\u201d Straightening, she set her elbows on her knees and leaned in close. \u201cWhy did you have to revolt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want this.\u201d He pled for her understanding with his gaze. \u201cBut once it happened, I couldn\u2019t not step up. Those who want to work with the Sentinels wil find their way back to Adrian. The rest need an Alpha or they\u2019l die. I couldn\u2019t just turn my back and let that happen.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Vash walked in. \u201cHow cozy. I\u2019m not interrupting an intimate moment, am I?\u201d</p><p>Elijah felt the knot in his gut loosen at the sight of her. She was fresh from a shower, dressed in her trademark stark black with her damp hair pul ed back in a ponytail. Her skintight pants barely clung to her hips, while her short sleeveless vest was smal enough to pass for a bra. It was a testament to how incapacitated he was that his dick couldn\u2019t muster more than a semi in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy bitch,\u201d he said gruffly. He glanced at Lindsay. \u201cYou, too. Adrian can\u2019t be happy about this. Shit, I\u2019m not entirely happy about it.</p><p>You\u2019re too exposed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I going to do?\u201d Lindsay shot back. \u201cLet you die? Couldn\u2019t do it, El.\u201d</p><p>Vash gave an exaggerated sigh and rol ed her eyes. \u201cMy god, the way women fawn al over you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay snorted. \u201cSo says the vampress who fought off Adrian to get blood for him.\u201d</p><p>The ringing of a cel phone had Lindsay pushing to her feet. She dug it out of her pocket and answered. \u201cAdrian...Yes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>As she moved into a corner to talk, Vash stepped closer. She put her hands on her hips and glared at him. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hammered shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>Muttering to herself, she reached out and pushed her hands through his hair, brushing the strands back from his face. He nuzzled into her touch, moved by what she\u2019d done for him. He was a man sworn to kil her, yet she had risked her life to save him. \u201cYou went to a lot of trouble, Vashti. Put a lot on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read anything into it,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWe need the lycans, and you\u2019re a package deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s al this is,\u201d she insisted, scowling.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what this is,\u201d he said softly. Somewhere along the way, in an impossibly short span of time, their higher reasoning in regard to each other had been subverted by impulse.</p><p>Lindsay returned. She gave Elijah a searching glance. \u201cAre we going to do this?\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was asking, whether or not he wanted to risk the possible hazards of her blood. After what she and Vash had gone through to get it for him, it was a no-brainer. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Needing air, Syre left the building. It was dusk now, the desert sky painted in shades of orange, pink, and purple. A streak of lightning arced through the sky, then another. Out of place, he thought, but beautiful.</p><p>The sizzling heat of the day had abated, as had the fury of his earlier mood. His second-in-command had put every vampire at risk by her actions, but part of him was secretly relieved to see her fighting for something beyond her vengeance. She\u2019d been twisted by bitterness for so long. Long enough that it had become the only thing she lived for.</p><p>He pul ed his phone out of his pocket and dialed Adrian. When the cal went to voice mail, he left a message. \u201cAdrian,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cVashti\u2019s actions today weren\u2019t sanctioned. Nevertheless, I\u2019l go to the wal for her. If it\u2019s vengeance you want, you know where to find me. Leave her out of it.\u201d</p><p>Kil ing the cal , he rounded the corner of the building and came to an abrupt stop. Raze leaned against the metal siding of the building\u2019s exterior, his arms crossed and massive biceps bulging. His gaze was riveted to the slender female silhouette just a few yards away. She was pacing, as if agitated, and speaking on a phone. To Adrian.</p> <p>Syre waved the Fal en captain away and shoved his hands in his pockets, taking up the watchful position he\u2019d dismissed Raze from. Syre\u2019s emotions were a morass of pain, guilt, sorrow, grief, and anger. As he watched the woman who\u2019d supplanted his beloved daughter in every way\u2014 the woman who was the greatest vulnerability of his oldest adversary\u2014he realized he had no idea what to say to her...or do with her. If anything.</p><p>\u201cI can tough it out,\u201d she was saying. \u201cI\u2019l be home soon, neshama. Please don\u2019t worry...Yes, I know that\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Because I\u2019m worried about you...I wil ...I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Ending the cal , she stared down at the phone in her hand and sighed. There was something in the sound, a note of regret and weariness that struck a chord in Syre.</p><p>Pivoting, she faced him and saw him standing there. She froze, her eyes blinking in the waning light. She was a fledging, stil growing into her new senses.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling, Lindsay?\u201d</p><p>She shoved her hand through her curls, a habit he remembered she fel into when discomfited. Her mouth opened, then closed. She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNot so hot.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, slowly, approaching her in a nonthreatening manner. As he neared, he saw the fever brightness of her eyes and her rapid, shal ow breathing. \u201cHow much blood did you give the Alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pint. Maybe a little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon after the Change,\u201d he murmured, lifting his hand cautiously toward her face. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>He found her skin burning hot. \u201cHow often is Adrian feeding you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d He caught her chin when she looked away. \u201cHow long, Lindsay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix. Maybe seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Syre remembered how the act of drinking blood had so horrified her. She\u2019d almost died by refusing to feed. He was surprised to find that he was relieved she\u2019d survived after al .</p> <p>He blew out his breath. \u201cCome inside.\u201d</p><p>Reaching into her back pocket, she pul ed out a bandana and began to tie it around her head, covering her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safer for me. And for you. If something happens to me, Adrian wil go bal istic. The less risk I pose, the better for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl right.\u201d Gripping her elbow, he steered her back into the building and toward the office he\u2019d commandeered as his own.</p><p>As they crossed the vast space, lycans who\u2019d been sitting at various points around the open warehouse pushed slowly to their feet, eyeing him with hostile suspicion. Old habits die hard, he thought. Going head-to-head with Adrian and the Sentinels wasn\u2019t something they were wil ing to risk yet. They weren\u2019t going to let him incite a war with Adrian over Lindsay.</p><p>Syre shut them out by closing his office door, then tugged the bandana off her face. Although his night vision was excel ent, he was struck by the sight of her in the harsh glare of the fluorescent overhead lights. She was nothing like Shadoe, but stil ...he felt oddly soothed in her presence.</p><p>Something that had been vibrating with disquiet inside him settled down. She sank into one of the two chairs positioned in front of the utilitarian metal desk and he took the one beside it.</p><p>She studied him boldly.</p><p>His brows rose in silent inquiry.</p><p>\u201cI was scared the first time I saw you,\u201d she explained. \u201cAfterward, I was distracted and then very il .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scared now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very careful that I won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved and her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...very attractive,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how young you appear.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he set his elbows on his knees and got to the most pressing point. \u201cYou drank from me once before. Wil you do so again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat. Fledglings are easily damaged by lack of blood. It\u2019s been too long between feedings and you\u2019ve given some of your blood away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I know why I should want to, but I don\u2019t know why you would.\u201d</p><p>Syre looked down, gathering his thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a combination of things, I suppose. You\u2019re as close as I\u2019l ever be to Shadoe. Until I pass on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Shadoe.\u201d Her voice was soft and compassionate, earning his appreciation and respect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard some families of organ donors keep in touch with the transplant recipients.\u201d He glanced up at her. \u201cThere\u2019s a bond there, whether it\u2019s real or imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that healthy?\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to shrug. \u201cWho can say? There\u2019s something else, though, that would lead me to make this same offer. I Changed you, Lindsay. In that respect there\u2019s no doubt I sired you.\u201d</p><p>The space between her brows was marred by a frown. \u201cHow long does that sense of obligation last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI real y can\u2019t say. I\u2019ve only Changed two individuals in my life: Shadoe, who didn\u2019t complete the transformation, and you, who won\u2019t if you don\u2019t feed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cOnly two of us? How is that possible? There are so many vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf each vampire infected just one other person, our numbers would be great. Of course, there are those who Change far more than one.\u201d His mouth curved wryly. \u201cAre you disappointed I\u2019m not more evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot disappointed, but I\u2019m struggling with it. Not just about you but about al vampires in general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian\u2019s brainwashing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian has nothing to do with it. Vampires kil ed my mother in front of me. They held me down...made me watch as they brutalized her.\u201d A violent shiver moved through her, fol owed by the immediate stiffening of her posture. \u201cMy feelings about vampires are my own, based on my own truths and experiences.\u201d</p><p>Syre reached for her hand and was pleased when she let him take it. \u201cThere are minions who lose their sanity with the Change. They\u2019re the most responsible for the spread of vampirism, not the Fal en.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were on a picnic in the park on a cloudless day. They were either Fal en or the kept pets of one\u2014or more\u2014or they couldn\u2019t have tolerated the sunlight.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled sharply. \u201cTel me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not Shadoe,\u201d she said again. \u201cStil , I feel...a connection to you. I have memories of you and her together that feel like they\u2019re mine. It\u2019s messing with my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is blood loss.\u201d Sinking his fangs into his wrist, he stood and came around her, setting one hand on her head and lifting his bleeding wound to her mouth.</p><p>She might have been able to refuse him if he\u2019d expected her to make the punctures herself. But with the coppery scent of blood fil ing her nostrils, her instincts kicked in and she was too much of a fledgling to fight them. Cupping the back of his wrist with both hands, she drank greedily, her eyes rol ing back in her head before she closed them.</p><p>He would\u2019ve preferred she ingest more than she did, but somehow she found the fortitude to pul away. He admired her strength of wil . Most fledglings that hungry would\u2019ve had to be ripped away for the safety of the donor.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Nodding, she licked her lips. Already the unnatural brightness of her eyes was softening and a healthy flush stained her cheeks. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you accepted.\u201d He leaned against the desk and crossed his arms. \u201cI would be even more grateful if you\u2019d trust me with what you remember of the attack on your mother.\u201d</p><p>He listened as she described a trinity of vampires who sounded remarkably like Vashti, Salem, and Raze.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t them,\u201d he said quietly when she finished, having no doubt as to their innocence.</p><p>\u201cI know that now. When I bit Vash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I won\u2019t forget that.\u201d He smiled inwardly, recal ing how infuriated Vashti had been at being bested by a fledgling. His second hadn\u2019t fought back, of course, out of deference for his paternal feelings. Which only made it more concerning that she\u2019d brought Lindsay to heal the Alpha. It seemed Vashti had been focused on the lycan\u2019s health to the exclusion of every other consideration.</p><p>\u201cAdrian searched through my mind and he concurs with my description, but says the memory is faulty. Too murky. More of an emotional impression than a photographic one.\u201d</p><p>He settled in his chair again. \u201cI\u2019d see for myself if you hadn\u2019t lost enough blood already. I could\u2019ve looked when I drained you for the Change, but I didn\u2019t want to personalize you. I know how cold that sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the truth.\u201d One side of her mouth lifted. \u201cHot or cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter whether I see the memory myself or not. I believe you. I\u2019l investigate and see what turns up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Thank you, again. For obvious reasons, I\u2019d love to know who they are.\u201d She took a deep breath, then released it in a rush. She looked away quickly when he caught her gaze, but he\u2019d seen how her eyes were shadowed and haunted.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is troubling you, Lindsay?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cWil you tel me?\u201d</p><p>There was a long hesitation before she said, \u201cI lost my father recently. The day before I met you. It\u2019s hard, you know...feeling this way about someone else. Even though I know they\u2019re Shadoe\u2019s feelings\u2014knowing doesn\u2019t change how it affects me.\u201d</p><p>Syre nodded grimly. \u201cYes, it feels somewhat disloyal, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m warring with the same thing. I don\u2019t want a replacement for my daughter; I want her. But I can\u2019t help the sense of affinity I feel for you. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in al my years on earth, it\u2019s that certain events change our lives for a reason and that certain paths cross because they\u2019re meant to. We don\u2019t have to be enemies, Lindsay. Or even al ies. Perhaps you and I can just...be ourselves. Perhaps we can just accept that we have a bond and not fight it or try to analyze it. Perhaps we can even come to nurture it, if we decide we want to.\u201d</p><p>A knock came to the door a second before it opened and Vash stepped in. \u201cSyre, I\u2014 Oh. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s mouth twisted rueful y.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s al right, Vashti,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a word. Elijah wants to see you, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Pushing to her feet, she moved to pass Syre and paused abreast of him.</p><p>He glanced up at her and was startled when she bent down and pressed a quick kiss to his forehead. She left without another word.</p><p>Syre was glad Vashti had enough to say on her own. It was many moments later before his throat loosened enough for him to speak again.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>It was on a rooftop under the light of the moon that the phone cal was made.</p><p>\u201cSomeone fucked up,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cAdrian arrived almost two hours earlier than I was told to expect him.\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause. \u201cHas he discovered that you\u2019re stil alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I had the interior of the house taken care of. There\u2019s nothing of me to be found in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hel there isn\u2019t!\u201d Agitation forced his wings to unfurl and stretch, casting a massive shadow on the lawn below. \u201cIf he\u2019s got any of his brain left, he\u2019l figure out someone\u2019s been staying there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to say that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you want the shit to hit the fan. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve been working for al these centuries.\u201d He heard the familiar creaking of Syre\u2019s desk chair and his fists clenched. While the cat\u2019s away, the rat will play... \u201cIt\u2019s not time yet, and Syre and Adrian are both focusing more on the virus than I expected them to. I assumed they\u2019d concentrate on each other and the lycans. Anything that distracts them is a good thing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say, you\u2019re not out here hanging in the wind. I told you staying in Helena\u2019s home was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other option would have left a trail in money, paper, or blood.\u201d</p><p>The hardness of the voice on the other end of the line fired his temper further. He was a Sentinel. The vampire on the other end of the line would do wel to remember that. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem concerned about those things when you talked about infecting entire neighborhoods with the pathogen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you have a reason for cal ing me? Or did you just want to bitch?\u201d</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he asked, \u201cAny suggestions on where to hole up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cabal in Anaheim has been eradicated. No one expects Torque to deal with it while both Syre and Vashti are in the field. You can have the entire compound to yourself. That\u2019l put you close to Adrian, but you know how to stay out of sight. Your only concern now is to live the mortal life you\u2019ve been coveting. Go get laid or kil something for the hel of it. I\u2019l be in touch when it\u2019s time for you to rise from the ashes.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead. He crushed the burner phone to dust in his fist, his gaze trained on the lights blazing from Helena\u2019s home across the street.</p> <p>Perhaps it was time to build his own army.</p><p>As he lifted into the air and flew away, the thought twisted through his mind...and found fertile ground in which to take root.</p><p>The sky was an ebony blanket of stars as Elijah drove Lindsay back to Adrian. As crappy as he\u2019d felt just hours ago, he felt like a mil ion dol ars now. Life was good at the moment. The cool desert night air was whipping through the lowered windows and beside him sat one of his dearest friends, a woman to whom he owed his life...yet again. Her Sentinel-laced blood was amazingly powerful, its regenerative properties astonishing.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d he asked, noting her staring pensively out at the desert. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad about the blindfold, are you? I went along with it only because it was safer for you. I trust you, you know. Always have.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d only made her wear the damn thing until they were out of sight of the warehouse. Then he\u2019d tugged it off her himself and thrown it out the window.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to wear it. I thought the same thing\u2014the less of a threat I am, the better.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI was thinking about my dad.\u201d</p><p>Remembering her heartbroken sobbing when she\u2019d heard the news of her father\u2019s death, his chest ached with sympathy...and guilt. He\u2019d handpicked the team of lycans tasked with watching over Eddie Gibson and keeping him safe. \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She twisted in her seat to look at him. \u201cI want to talk to the lycans who were picked to guard him. I would\u2019ve asked you back there, but I want to question them away from the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got questions, too, but they haven\u2019t checked in since then.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay stiffened. \u201cThey disappeared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it like that. My guess? They\u2019re working their way to the West Coast on foot, trying to stay under the radar. What do you want to know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat they\u2019re one hundred percent certain, without a shadow of a doubt, that his death was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019l believe them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do, I wil .\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he asked, \u201cWhy do you doubt it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCars were his life, El. He was pure poetry behind the wheel. Honestly, I\u2019d be more likely to buy a random drive-by shooting than I am a single-car accident. I\u2019ve been with him when creatures have wandered into the road. He avoided a buck, for chrissakes, on a two-lane highway with oncoming traffic and didn\u2019t get a scratch on his car. It\u2019s damned hard for me to believe he overcorrected for an unknown obstruction on an isolated rural lane.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the pain and grief in Lindsay\u2019s voice, he set his mind to doing whatever it took to help her put the past behind her. She\u2019d lost both parents before their time and he knew she was haunted by their deaths. \u201cI\u2019l find Trent and Lucas and bring them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She leaned her head back into the headrest. \u201cYou and Vashti...Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but there\u2019s something there, right?\u201d</p><p>A dry laugh escaped him. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to explain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe went to a lot of trouble to save you. I take it she doesn\u2019t know you intend to avenge Micah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d He stared straight ahead, his gaze looking beyond the swathe of the headlights into the darkness beyond.</p><p>\u201cBut she saved your ass anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs my help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, El.\u201d Lindsay shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the position you\u2019re in. I saw the way you look at her. For a guy who avoids trouble like the plague, you\u2019re deep in it now. It\u2019s not your style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize I had a style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be flippant about something that\u2019s bothering you. You\u2019ve got my undivided attention between here and Vegas\u2014take advantage of it. If you keep everything bottled up, you\u2019l go nuts.\u201d</p><p>Elijah knew she was right. He couldn\u2019t talk about Vash with anyone else. No lycan or vampire would want to listen to him hash out what he was feeling for Syre\u2019s second. Shit, he didn\u2019t want to listen to it himself\u2014would prefer to ignore it altogether\u2014but the path that had seemed so clear in the beginning was now dark and murky. He could use someone else\u2019s input to help him find his way.</p><p>\u201cIf I have a type,\u201d he said final y, \u201cshe\u2019s it. Physical y. I was hot for her the first time I saw her. You were tossing knives at her and I was thinking about doing something else with her entirely.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay choked out a laugh. \u201cJesus, El.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, wel ...when she came to ask for help researching this vampire disease\u2014they\u2019re cal ing it the Wraith Virus\u2014I knew who she was and what she\u2019d done to Micah. And she realized I was supposedly responsible for her friend Nikki\u2019s death. We straightened that out right away, but her guilt over Micah was never in question. We laid out our terms\u2014I help her with the wraiths and she keeps the Sentinels off our backs; I help her find the lycans responsible for the death of her mate and she sets up her demise in a way that keeps Syre off my back.\u201d</p><p>Pinching the bridge of her nose, Lindsay sighed. \u201cWhat a fucking mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no way in hel I could concentrate with the sexual tension between us, so I threw that into the mix, too. But when it went down...it was rough. And a lot more personal than we were counting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before\u2014it\u2019s not like that with lycans. Yes, there\u2019s an inherent level of instinct and physical chemistry that comes into play, but it doesn\u2019t dictate how things go. I\u2019l choose my mate when the time comes, just like a mortal would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortals don\u2019t choose who they fal in love with. I would never have chosen to fal in love with Adrian, knowing how dangerous it is for him to be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about love, Linds. This is physical.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a wry look. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see Vash in action today, El. She went after Adrian. Adrian. I don\u2019t believe she did it because of a pact with you or the need for a booty cal . She was too desperate and worried. And if her big concern was info about her mate\u2019s kil ers, she could\u2019ve asked Adrian while she had me with a knife at my throat.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened on the steering wheel. Vash had been suicidal in her efforts to save his hide. In too deep. Both of them.</p><p>Pul ing her left knee up onto the seat, Lindsay adjusted her position so that she angled toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re awful y quiet after what I just said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you said, there\u2019s something there. It\u2019s...complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have cal ed us that.\u201d Yet they\u2019d put their necks on the line for each other. Supported each other...\u201cBut maybe. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you let your anger about Micah go? If she cares about you, just knowing you\u2019re hurting over what she did could be punishment enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to let it go or stop screwing her. But we\u2019ve stil got nowhere to take this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve thought about possibly continuing a relationship with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly just now. With you pushing me to think about it. I won\u2019t again after I drop you off.\u201d He didn\u2019t have time to waste on impossibilities. \u201cIdeal y, I\u2019l hit up Adrian for the info she wants; he\u2019l have it; Vash and I wil deal with it; and our association wil end. Second best scenario is us wrapping this up quick even without Adrian\u2019s help. If we could just put some distance between us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t help with me and Adrian,\u201d she reminded. \u201cAbsence made the heart grow fonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping. You\u2019re supposed to knock some sense into me. You hate her guts. Make me hate her guts, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time. She saved your life today. I owe her for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life, too. And not for the first time.\u201d As the light pol ution of Vegas appeared in the distance, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose touch with you, Linds. Promise me that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his mouth too dry to say anything in reply.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up on you, El,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare give up on me, or I\u2019l hunt you down and bite you with my fangs.\u201d</p><p>Elijah was stil smiling when they reached the city limits.</p><p>Vash crossed her arms and studied Syre\u2019s face. His posture was different, his carriage lighter. His eyes were less shadowed than they\u2019d been just that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cYou look better,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI feel better.\u201d From their position just outside of Syre\u2019s warehouse office, they watched minions quietly make the necessary preparations for the sleeping lycans to head out at daybreak. They\u2019d work in the field the same way\u2014the lycans taking the day shift and the minions the night. \u201cAre you certain it was a good idea to al ow Elijah to escort Lindsay back?\u201d</p><p>She shifted on her feet, hating to hear her own concern voiced aloud. \u201cI can\u2019t al ow or disal ow Elijah anything. And if he\u2019s going to have second thoughts about this al iance, better he has them now instead of later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...the Vash I know would kil a lycan she couldn\u2019t trust rather than test him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! If that was true, they\u2019d al be dead. Besides, we don\u2019t have that option. He\u2019s the only Alpha around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want him to choose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that why you sent me to him to begin with?\u201d</p><p>Syre turned so that he stood directly in front of her, forcing her to look at him. \u201cI sent you to strengthen our position. Instead, you very nearly kicked off a war today.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze, letting him see her disquiet. \u201cThe Sentinels aren\u2019t in any position to attack us. There are too few of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe they\u2019d wage a battle instead of a war. You\u2019re wrong. They won\u2019t come at us in a swarm. They\u2019l pick away at us, hitting strategic targets and individuals, excising the most valuable players with surgical precision. What\u2019s left of us wil be chaotic and easily overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re guessing,\u201d she shot back. \u201cAdrian isn\u2019t at the top of his game now. He attacked me in ful daylight on a public street! He\u2019s reckless and emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet he risked his most valuable possession, putting his mission first yet again\u2014something I\u2019ve always relied on you doing...until today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah is pivotal to our plans. You said it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour responses are making me wonder if the Alpha is more of a liability than an asset,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Vash schooled her features to show no emotion, even though the elevated rhythm of her heartbeat gave her away. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Alpha you\u2019re worried about\u2014it\u2019s me. If you think I\u2019m compromised, you should assign someone else to deal with him as I suggested in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>His arms crossed. \u201cYou misunderstand me, perhaps deliberately. I don\u2019t want to separate you from anything that makes you happy, and frankly, the Alpha\u2019s fascination for you works to my benefit. His hunger for you is a weakness. If we can control him with it, we\u2019l have an even stronger advantage. But I can\u2019t al ow anything or anyone to jeopardize the vampire nation, including you. Enjoy your lycan, Vashti, but don\u2019t forget where your priorities lie. Like you said, the time to have second thoughts is now.\u201d</p><p>Pressing the heels of her palms against her eyes, she cursed under her breath. Everything was screwed up. She was screwed up. Her priorities had shifted at some point, from the past to her present. Now the thought of manipulating Elijah like a puppet made her sick.</p><p>She dropped her arms and looked at him. \u201cPair him with Raze. It\u2019l be best for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said softly, pressing a kiss to her forehead. \u201cPerhaps a bit of distance wil clear your perspective and you\u2019l be able to revisit. Do you want to tel him or should I?\u201d</p><p>That Syre made the offer told her how shaky the ground was that she walked on. For him to step up personal y rather than delegate meant he gave the matter serious weight.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019l do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t take it wel .\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>Remembering how Elijah had responded the last time she tried to gain a little space, she smiled rueful y. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but probably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse me if you need me.\u201d He dug into his pocket and she heard the rattle of keys. \u201cI\u2019m heading to Shred with some of the others. You\u2019re welcome to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019l see to the final prep here. I want to get this entire crew out tomorrow, so we can get the next wave in and debriefed. Hopeful y we\u2019l pick up some strays while we\u2019re out in the field; we need more than one outpost\u2019s worth of lycans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l dig into that in the morning. See you then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remembering something she should never have forgotten, Vash cal ed after him. \u201cCommander. Adrian took my blood.\u201d</p><p>He turned slowly back to her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to know. Something with the Wraith Virus, perhaps?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out.\u201d He left, his stride clipped with repressed violence.</p><p>Vash got to work on the composition of the teams she\u2019d be sending out into the field in the morning. She\u2019d hoped to tap Elijah for assistance with that, but he was stil gone and they were already a day behind schedule.</p><p>Sitting at one of the computer workstations, she started creating groups based on physical characteristics, trying to create wel -rounded teams of short and tal , big and smal , heavy and slender.</p><p>The moment El returned, she felt it. The air in the room became charged with his energy...and the stirring animosity of the vampires who smel ed him approaching.</p> <p>He came back.</p><p>A shiver of excitement coursed through her, along with a flood of relief that nearly made her dizzy. She watched him approach with eyes that devoured every breathtakingly sexy inch, eyeing his confident stride and the sleek fluidity of his movements. And she wasn\u2019t the only one awed by the air of command that clung to him. His path across the open space between them was tracked by everyone, but his eyes were locked on her. Hot and fiercely determined. Fil ed with admiration, but nothing close to deference.</p><p>God, he was gorgeous. Beautiful, real y, although she\u2019d never cal him that to his face. He was too fiercely masculine to be even remotely pretty.</p><p>And his body...so hard and strong. Defined by slabs of powerful muscle. She remembered how it felt to have al that power against her. Over her.</p><p>Inside her... The other vampresses in the room eyed him with equal avidness, lust burning along with distrust and lingering resentment. She wasn\u2019t completely off her rocker for being sexual y attracted to a lycan, but the quantity of female attention Elijah received was beginning to chafe. He wasn\u2019t available for that kind of interest and she wanted everyone to know it. To respect it.</p><p>He paused by a table of vamps putting together travel packets of cash, debit cards, IDs, and cel phones. He thanked them for their hard work, offered to help, and smiled genuinely when it was refused with less hostility than had been displayed when he\u2019d walked in.</p> <p>The smile stayed in place as he headed toward her, but it took on a wicked, sexy edge that sizzled through her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said when he stopped beside her. He looked at the computer screen and shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t put Luke and Thomas in the same group. They\u2019l fight. And Nicodemus has a thing for Bethany and so does Horatio. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t put her in a group with either one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck it al .\u201d She pushed back from the desk. Of course he knew such personal details. He took the time to know everyone. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on this for over an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got the vamps lined up straight? Then don\u2019t worry about the rest. I\u2019l make the adjustments to the lycans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy morning?\u201d Studying him up close, she noted the exhaustion that rimmed his eyes and mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use sleep,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut it won\u2019t take much.\u201d</p><p>She stood and rocked back on her heels. What she real y wanted to do was step forward into him. He smel ed delicious. She knew he tasted that way, too. Al over. Inside and out. \u201cCan I talk to you a moment?\u201d</p><p>She led the way to one of the offices. It was dark inside, as was most of the warehouse, to accommodate the sleeping lycans. Neither she nor Elijah required light to see, which was working to her benefit now. By keeping the lights off, he would be less likely to read anything on her face she didn\u2019t want him to.</p> <p>The door had barely shut behind them when she found herself in his arms, his lips cool and firm on hers. Caught at the waist and nape, she was held immobile against him. Claimed. She gasped in surprised pleasure, and the kiss swiftly heated. His tongue slid deep and slow into her mouth, thrusting in a steady unhurried rhythm that made her ache for more. Much more, damn it.</p><p>She slid one hand through his hair and the other up beneath his shirt. He arched and groaned at her touch, as responsive to her as she was to him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered huskily against her parted lips.</p><p>Vash swal owed, trying to hang on to the wits that would enable her to tel him about their altered working relationship. The exquisite taste of him sidetracked her, scattering her reason.</p><p>He nuzzled his nose against hers. \u201cI brought back some news that might make you happier about keeping me alive.\u201d</p><p>She was too happy about that. Already she was dreading his getting on a separate plane from her tomorrow, one that would take him to the opposite side of the country from where she\u2019d be. She was glad now that she hadn\u2019t plugged either of their names into her outlined groups. He would have seen straightaway, and they might be arguing now instead of kissing. Elijah was a damned good kisser. He took his time with it, as he did with everything, savoring the act as if he didn\u2019t care if anything more intimate fol owed it.</p><p>But she cared. Sixty years without sexual desire and suddenly being naked with Elijah was damn near al she thought about.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d The words were out of Vash\u2019s mouth before she realized she\u2019d thought them. Mortified, her head fel forward to press her forehead into his shoulder. She just had to get through another six hours until they parted, a few of which he\u2019d sleep through. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His hand at her waist dropped to the curve of her ass and molded her into the thick ridge of his erection.</p><p>Her entire body lit up like a live wire. He was hard and ready for her, and she craved him\u2014one last time before she sent him on his way with Raze and got her head back in the game. \u201cYou need to take it easy and get some rest. Tomorrow, we hit the ground running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do al the work. I\u2019l just kick back and come.\u201d</p><p>She bit him in the pectoral with her fangs.</p><p>\u201cOw! Damn it.\u201d He shoved her back. \u201cGo easy on me. I\u2019m in recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you need sleep, not sex.\u201d But god, he tasted good. She licked her lips, making sure she didn\u2019t miss a drop.</p><p>His eyes glittered in the darkness. \u201cYou\u2019ve revved me up. Now the sleep won\u2019t come without the sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCry me a river. Listen, I have something to tel you.\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his hand. \u201cI cal ed mine first.\u201d</p><p>Vash growled. His grin flashed before he released her.</p><p>\u201cGet on with it, then,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d There was nothing even remotely apologetic in his tone. He popped open the brass snaps holding her vest together and took possession of a heavy, tender breast. \u201cAl the blood has flowed into my other brain. Have to take care of that first.\u201d</p><p>The sheer audacity of his statement stunned her silent for a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, she liked the effect it had on him. He was a serious guy by nature; this more relaxed version was hitting many of her hot buttons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to get laid by the hottest woman on the planet. That tends to cheer a guy up. Plus, I\u2019ve got a present for you. It may not be quite as lifesaving as the one you brought me today, but hopeful y it\u2019l turn out that way.\u201d</p><p>Warmth twisted through her, along with shards of near-painful delight as he tugged on her nipple with his thumb and forefinger. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lead on Charron\u2019s kil ers.\u201d</p><p>Her breath clogged behind a tight throat. \u201cWhat...? How...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d Elijah pul ed her closer. \u201cI asked him what he knew. He\u2019d heard the rumors about your mate and sent Jason to investigate. The lycans who admitted to being involved were interviewed. He doesn\u2019t recal their names or what their story was, only that they didn\u2019t relay the events the way you told them to me or he would\u2019ve terminated them himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti, he was never told Charron had been slaughtered in the manner you described. He knew only that your mate was dead and lycans were involved. If he\u2019d heard differently, he would\u2019ve had the matter looked into more closely. I believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019ve known him a hel of a lot longer than you have.\u201d She blew her hair off her face and pushed away. Refastening her vest, she began to pace. \u201cI need names, El. I don\u2019t care what those lycans said. I know what I saw and I know Char. He would never have done anything worthy of a death like that. He was a kind, gentle-hearted man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe interviews were recorded on tape, then later transferred to disk and uploaded to a backup cloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he give you copies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And he doesn\u2019t have the password to access them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBul shit. He\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms and looked straight into her eyes. \u201cNo, Vashti. He isn\u2019t. Each outpost has a separate log-in to the cloud. It was a safety precaution that prevented a ful -system breach at the outpost level. I know he\u2019s right because Stephan broke into the system at Navajo Lake. There was no access to information about the other outposts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who has the password?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason and Armand. Unfortunately, Jason was at Navajo Lake and Armand was stil at the Huntington outpost\u2014where the interviews were taken \u2014when the revolt happened. Both Sentinels are presently considered missing in action.\u201d</p><p>She strode up to him and gripped his belt loops. \u201cYou can get the data.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything left of the place, yes. But regardless, the names of those lycans are in the cloud. So even if Huntington is trashed, it won\u2019t be the end of the road.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Vash struggled to get her emotions under control. If pressed, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to identify them. Elation, maybe.</p><p>Fear, certainly. More than a little confusion, as wel . Where did one go when they reached the end of the road? And twining through the mess of her mind was her acute awareness of the man she held on to. She was working on something for Char while in a compromising position with another man and she didn\u2019t feel guilty. She searched for the sense that she was doing something wrong...being disloyal...but she didn\u2019t find it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tel you what this means to me, Elijah,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>His warm hands encircled her wrists. \u201cThen show me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Amused by his very male one-track mind, Vash scoped out the furnishings in the smal room. \u201cThe choices are limited here, sex fiend: desktop or the floor. I\u2019m lacking a penis, so I can\u2019t nail you against the wal . And every chair in this room has arms, so straddling you is impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your imagination?\u201d Letting her go, Elijah tugged his shirt over his head. She was so focused on looking for any lingering injuries that she missed him toeing off his boots. Her hands were sliding over his torso, feeling for wounds she might have missed with her night vision when his jeans hit the floor.</p><p>The ful force of his nudity hit her and she hissed, riveted by his blatant masculinity.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She unstuck her tongue from the roof of her mouth. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you wanted me to forget you said.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lifted to his, found his eyes feverishly bright. She wanted those eyes on her, sliding over her with their heat and hunger. No one had ever looked at her quite that way, with a desire that was untamed and wild.</p><p>She shrugged out of her vest and tossed it aside. Balancing on one foot, she unzipped one boot, then fol owed up with the other. As she pushed her pants down her legs, he sank into a chair, settling back and watching avidly.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Vashti.\u201d The rumble lacing his words was almost a purr. It drifted over and around her like warm tendrils of smoke.</p><p>Straightening, she kicked her pants aside.</p><p>\u201cI want you\u201d\u2014she deliberately paused\u2014 \u201cto let me do al the work. You were torn up good today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l promise not to overly exert myself and we\u2019l cal it square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tie you up again, maybe. But you\u2019d fuck us both to death for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t top me, Vashti,\u201d he said harshly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you need. Not what you want. Don\u2019t ever try again.\u201d</p><p>She approached him. Gripping the back of his chair, she lowered her lips to his brow and breathed him in, letting the scent of his skin slide through her. Soothing her.</p><p>He knew her, saw through her. She didn\u2019t know how, but he did... Whatever. It didn\u2019t matter. This was the last time they\u2019d have this; their association was coming to a close. Soon she\u2019d be the Vashti she knew, the one everyone needed her to be. Once she had Charron\u2019s kil ers beneath her boot heels, she\u2019d honor her end of their bargain. They\u2019d both have what they real y wanted, which\u2014contrary to the way things were going at that moment\u2014wasn\u2019t each other. \u201cTonight wil be slow and easy.\u201d</p><p>The fingertips of his right hand skimmed lightly along the outside of her thigh. The caress was barely there, yet it reverberated through her in waves of warmth and need. That he didn\u2019t do more, didn\u2019t take over, gave her the chance to wipe the slate clean between them.</p><p>I need that, too, she thought. Needed to leave him with a different memory than the one from Shred.</p><p>\u201cShow me how to work around this damned chair,\u201d she muttered, although just the thought of wriggling and squirming over his hard body made her wet.</p><p>\u201cStand back first. Lemme look at you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She straightened slowly. Stepping back, she thrust her hands through her hair and piled it on top of her head. Arching her back, Vash posed like a \u201950s pinup.</p><p>He breathed roughly, his hands fisting around the ends of the armrests. \u201cMy god, Vashti...\u201d</p><p>It was the note of awed pleasure in his voice that pierced her, slicing through her defenses to strike the tender places within. A shiver moved through her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn gorgeous,\u201d he growled. \u201cLush and curvy. Fucking perfect. And you\u2019re so strong. Strong and tough.\u201d</p> <p>There was possession in the way he spoke. And she relished that, which confused her. She was a woman who took care of herself. Always had been. Char had known that about her and hadn\u2019t been territorial. She had a job to do, one that outranked his, and he\u2019d stayed to the side and let her do it, fol owing her commands when she gave them to him. That\u2019s what she needed from her mate, what she wanted...Support. Acceptance.</p><p>Yet Elijah\u2019s dominant streak turned her on like crazy.</p><p>Turning slowly, she hid how shaken she was by presenting him with her back.</p><p>\u201cCome closer. Back up to me,\u201d he ordered, reminding her that he\u2019d never stand to the side. He would always require her surrender, even as he praised and admired her strength and toughness.</p><p>His splayed hand caressed the length of her back, gentling her. \u201cBend over.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing how exposed she\u2019d be in the position he wanted her in, she leaned forward slowly, widening the spread of her legs to better support her canted weight. His hands cupped the backs of her thighs in the crease just below the curve of her buttocks. His thumbs rubbed gently over the lips of her sex, parting her, opening her to his gaze.</p><p>\u201cMmm...you\u2019re wet and soft already.\u201d</p><p>She swal owed hard, then bit her lip to stifle a moan. His breath fanned hot and humid over her most sensitive flesh. Her hands went to her knees, adding support to keep her from toppling onto her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l make you wetter,\u201d he promised darkly, the moment before he licked leisurely across her swol en cleft.</p><p>She gasped, the sound overly loud in the quiet room. It was exciting to be wil ing and ready for him. Bereft of control.</p><p>His tongue swiped over her again. The texture was rougher than before, like wet velvet, and the reach longer. She moaned in delight, wondering if he\u2019d made that slight shift in form for her pleasure or his. Either was equal y arousing. The last time they\u2019d been together, he\u2019d arranged her the way he wanted her and taken her. Taken what he needed, how he needed it, and expected her to find her pleasure in giving it to him. Which she had. She\u2019d never come so hard or often, never experienced ecstasy so fierce and wild. No boundaries. No limits.</p> <p>His groan vibrated against her. \u201cYour taste drives me insane. I could eat you for hours. Days. Lick up every sweet, creamy drop of you.\u201d</p><p>The next glide of his tongue teased her slick opening, rimming it in leisurely circles that had her straining toward him. He kept her in place with his easy grip, nudging her clitoris with the tip of his tongue and humming a soft chastisement.</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cElijah...what?\u201d</p><p>Her teeth grit. \u201cElijah, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...what?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop the frustrated noise that escaped her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t rush,\u201d he said smoothly, \u201cor I might overly exert myself and break my promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUsing your tongue?\u201d</p><p>When she attempted to straighten, he kept her in place with a hand at the smal of her back. \u201cIs it so difficult, letting me take the lead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No. That was what chafed the most. Sure, he was an Alpha, but he wasn\u2019t her Alpha. And for her people, she was damn near the Alpha.</p><p>What would they think if they could see her now?</p><p>\u201cEven though doing so brings you pleasure?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>Vash looked at him over her shoulder. He was looking right back at her, not at the slick hot flesh quivering for more of his attention. Prurient interest would have soothed her, oddly. His focus on her reactions and her emotions was far more intimate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of the countless bitches sniffing around after you,\u201d she snapped. \u201cSubservience isn\u2019t in my nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Women without backbones make me twitchy.\u201d He kissed her, right on the ass. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great rack, but even your spectacular tits wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep me interested past the first screw. That must mean I\u2019m in this for your charming tendency to bark orders and run everything around you...except for me, of course. Now, finish your damn sentence: Elijah, please do what? You want me to do whatever I want with you? Say so. You want to give me some direction, go for it. I\u2019m open to suggestions.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to the floor. Damn it, she wanted to direct him and she wanted him to do whatever he wanted. She didn\u2019t know which one she wanted more.</p><p>So she split it down the middle.</p><p>\u201cElijah.\u201d She exhaled in a rush. \u201cPlease lick me until I come. Then do whatever the hel you want with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d never ask, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>If the hand at the smal of her back hadn\u2019t reached around to clasp the front of her thigh, Vash would have fal en over with his first deep lick. He used his mouth as only a creature who relied on it as much as he did his hands would. The stroking of his crushed-velvet tongue was rhythmic and precise; the tempo of his thrusts into her needy sex had her rocking back on her heels, trying to capture the perfect pressure that would push her into orgasm. She could see him between her legs, see how thick he was. How rigid and long. The heavily veined length so brutal y beautiful. Just like the man himself. She wanted it...wanted him... Christ. She wanted so fiercely, it hurt. Her breath soughed from her lungs; her nipples were hard and tight. Her stomach concaved with her helpless writhing, desperate whimpers escaping her as he massaged her clitoris with the roughened pad of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged, when she couldn\u2019t take another minute.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He gave a fierce, quick suck, and she climaxed with a relieved cry, shuddering violently as the pleasure broke over her in rippling spasms.</p><p>As her legs shook and threatened to col apse, Elijah drew her into his lap and urged her to lean against his chest. Her head lol ed on his shoulder, his scent fil ing her nostrils and intoxicating her already floating senses. The feel of him against her back, so solid and warm and strong, made her never want to move. His arms came around her, one hand cupping her breast while the other caught her knee and widened the spread of her legs.</p><p>\u201cGuide me,\u201d he whispered against her cheek. \u201cPut me inside you.\u201d</p><p>Swal owing past a dry throat, she fisted him in her hand, pumping his cock from root to tip. Once. Twice. Then more. He was so hard, and she was enamored with the feel of him and the effect she had on him. He was rumbling his pleasure in her ear, his chest vibrating against her back. Her hand grew slick with his semen as his excitement built, her own body responding to his hands on her breasts. With practiced skil , he kneaded the heavy flesh, his talented fingers rol ing and tugging on the sensitive tips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make me come,\u201d he warned, his teeth scraping along the top of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the goal, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf al I wanted was an orgasm, I\u2019d have skipped the long walk across the warehouse and taken the offer I got in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>Her fist tightened on him and he made a noise that was half groan and half laugh. Damn him, he knew she hated how females salivated over him.</p><p>He was deliberately pushing her in the direction he wanted her to go and she complied anyway. Because she had the right to take what other women could only hope for.</p><p>Rising, she gained the height needed to position the wide crest of his cock against her. One deep breath later and she was lowering onto him, her eyes closing as he fil ed her, stretched her. She was tight in this position, squeezing down on him, making him work to claim her.</p><p>His low groan of pleasure was so erotical y charged she almost came from the sound of it. It was laced with a whisper of his own surrender, reminding her that they were equal y captured by their al -consuming desire. Equal y helpless to fight the pul of attraction between them.</p><p>With his hands caging her ribs just below her breasts, he control ed the speed and angle of her descent, increasing her awareness of every ragingly aroused inch of him as he possessed her. As she possessed him in return. Her hair fel over his shoulder, and her hips began to circle without volition. Her arms came up and behind her to push her fingers into his thick, dark hair.</p><p>\u201cMmm...\u201d She moaned. \u201cFeels so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...more.\u201d Vash went lax in his arms and let him have his way.</p><p>He eased her lower, effortlessly supporting her weight. She wasn\u2019t a smal woman. She was tal , with an overabundance of curves. She\u2019d never in her life felt delicate, but Elijah made her feel more feminine than anyone ever had besides Char. It was a feeling she relished\u2014to be something other than a vampire, someone other than Syre\u2019s lieutenant.</p><p>Once he was to the hilt in her, he embraced her from behind. His arms reached around her and crossed over her chest. Sweat coated the skin between them, sealing them together. Her thighs splayed along the top of his; his teeth nipped at her shoulder. Inside her, he throbbed. She was utterly claimed. She felt it, even though he didn\u2019t say it.</p><p>Elijah reached between her legs, found her exposed clitoris and massaged gently with the pads of two fingers. She climaxed with a breathless cry. His soft growl of satisfaction spurred her hunger, kept her on the edge so that she wanted more. More of him and the way he made her feel.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you squeeze me when you\u2019re coming,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou tighten around me...milk me...Do it again.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fel to the arms of the chair and she straightened away from him. As her body leaned forward, he pressed even deeper, the sensation so exquisitely sublime she almost came again. She couldn\u2019t explain how or why he was such an aphrodisiac to her, but there was no denying he was. Everything about him was a delight to her senses, keeping her primed and ready.</p><p>His lips slid gently over her back, the tender gesture making her throat tighten. \u201cRide me, Vashti. Fuck me until I can\u2019t take any more.\u201d</p><p>She did, starting out the first half-hour slow and easy as she\u2019d promised, relishing his white-knuckled response. She lost herself in the rhythmic flux and flow, in the steady lift and fal of her hips...the in-and-out glide of his body into hers...the rush and ebb of need as she timed her movements to the sounds of his breathing. Slowing when he gasped, quickening when he quieted.</p><p>She could have gone on like that forever, but the feel of his fingers between them, circling the base of his cock, brought her scattered mind into focus. He stiffened a moment, then a ferocious orgasm tore through him. He shook so violently, the chair quaked as if rocked by an earthquake, his teeth grinding audibly, the claws of his free hand piercing the solid metal armrests as if they were made of tinfoil. He came long and hard...yet he didn\u2019t. The expected wash of heat never fol owed.</p><p>Oh, no, you don\u2019t, she thought grimly, determined to break his steely control.</p><p>Vash took his knowledge and skil , his ability to hold back ejaculating even while he climaxed, as a chal enge. He was too contained. Too reasoned. While she\u2019d been damn near insensate with pleasure.</p><p>Setting her hands over his, she pinned them down with her weight.</p><p>Then, she took him. Not like the first time. Never again like that. This time, she chained him with desire, his and hers, and the delights of her body. She drove him hard and fast, giving him no quarter, forcing him to the precipice at a speed he couldn\u2019t back away from.</p><p>\u201cVashti,\u201d he gasped, then he cursed viciously. Swearing at her, tel ing her to slow down, hold on, give him a minute.</p><p>When he came this time, it was harder than before, his breath heaving from his lungs, his legs straining beneath hers as he shot hotly into her.</p><p>She felt him go off, relished his shout of her name. Feminine satisfaction pumped through her, kicking off her orgasm to catch the tail end of his.</p><p>His arms banded around her, crushing her tightly against him. They succumbed to their desire together.</p><p>As the sun rose over the desert sands, Elijah found himself greeting the new day in the best shape of his life. No mean feat, considering he\u2019d been on his deathbed the day before. His wounds had healed without scarring, and his strength was back in spades. Whether that was due to the Sentinel blood pumping through him or the lingering charge from a night spent with a warm and passionate Vashti, he couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>Fuck me until I can\u2019t take any more.</p><p>Hel if Vashti hadn\u2019t taken him at his word. He\u2019d tried to hold back, tried to make it last. For her sake as wel as his. She\u2019d been enjoying him so much, taking her pleasure with unabashed delight, instinct driving her into a primal state of animal need and desire where her body had silenced the doubts and anger in her mind... \u201cAlpha.\u201d</p><p>He looked over his shoulder at Raze, who wore black dress slacks and a gray silk shirt, the quiet elegance of his attire making him almost unrecognizable. Pivoting to catch the mini-duffel the vampire threw at him, Elijah asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. You can change at the airport after we check in.\u201d</p><p>Brows raised, he glanced at Syre\u2019s office door. Vashti had disappeared behind it about twenty minutes before, leaving him to get the last few teams on the road while she updated the vampire leader about her personal plans to visit the Huntington post.</p><p>\u201cHer orders.\u201d Raze had the decency to refrain from gloating. \u201cShe put you with me last night.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Now he knew what she\u2019d wanted to talk to him about before desire distracted them, just as he knew she\u2019d changed her mind and planned on heading out to Huntington with him instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaking his head, he adjusted his grip on the bag in his hand and grabbed his shades from the desk. Changed mind or not, they had a few things to work out. She needed to learn that making decisions and giving orders relating to him\u2014relating to them\u2014required both of them. \u201cLet\u2019s rol .\u201d</p><p>They walked to the door abreast of each other.</p><p>The hel of it was, Elijah understood why she\u2019d want the distance, and he understood that it was the information he\u2019d dug up about Charron\u2019s kil ers that had altered her plans. If she\u2019d bothered to talk with him about it, he would\u2019ve told her he didn\u2019t care if she was attracted to him for info, sex, or access to the lycans\u2014anything could serve as a foundation for a relationship between them, something he\u2019d decided he had to pursue because he couldn\u2019t keep his hands or his mind off her.</p><p>What troubled him was the hour or so they\u2019d spent together after they\u2019d sated their hunger for each other. An hour during which they\u2019d gone over the composition of the teams. An hour during which she hadn\u2019t said a goddamn word about shoving him off on someone else. He\u2019d even asked her point blank what it was she had wanted to talk to him about and she\u2019d evaded the question with a breezy reply.</p> <p>As Salem had said, they had nothing if she wasn\u2019t going to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d he asked as they stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cSeattle.\u201d</p><p>With an earsplitting whistle, Elijah stopped two Jeeps that were pul ing out of the lot. He approached the first driver and asked for her team\u2019s orders, then switched them with the team in the car behind them. He tossed Raze\u2019s orders into the mix so that al three teams were reassigned.</p><p>Then he reminded the lycans that his cel phone number was programmed in their contact lists.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to cal me,\u201d he said to each team, \u201cfor anything. Even if you just want to talk, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>As the two SUVs resumed their exit from the lot, Elijah glanced at his new partner. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to Shreveport.\u201d</p><p>Which was apropos, since it was Nikki\u2019s abduction from the city that had first brought him to Vash\u2019s attention and vice versa. Micah had been mortal y wounded there, tortured by Vash in an effort to glean Elijah\u2019s identity and location.</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019l come looking for you,\u201d the vamp surmised.</p><p>He tossed his duffel in the backseat of the Jeep Raze selected. No reply was necessary, so Elijah didn\u2019t give one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding yourself in high esteem, Alpha.\u201d Raze slid behind the wheel. \u201cBut after what she did for you yesterday, I guess you have a right to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMind your own business,\u201d he warned without heat. \u201cShe\u2019s safe with me.\u201d</p><p>The vampire pul ed out of the lot, leaving a smal sand cloud in their wake. \u201cThere\u2019s an off chance I might come to like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hold my breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get that cooler to Grace.\u201d Vash jerked her chin at the red and white ice chest on Syre\u2019s desk.</p><p>He lifted the lid and frowned at the contents. \u201cWhat\u2019s al this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stuff we used to transfuse Lindsay\u2019s blood into Elijah.\u201d</p><p>Syre\u2019s gaze met hers. \u201cYou\u2019re suspicious. Because Adrian sent her instead of a bag of blood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw his eyes when I had a knife to her throat. He\u2019d bleed for her and wouldn\u2019t think twice. So why didn\u2019t he?\u201d She paced. \u201cI wish I knew what she\u2019d said to him while I was knocked out in the back of the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she talked him into letting her come. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she did. And she did it for him, of course. Hasn\u2019t everything she\u2019s done been for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wasn\u2019t this as much about the Alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she came for Elijah, too.\u201d Her hands fisted and she clasped them behind her back to hide the tel tale movement. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t have been enough for Adrian to let her go. There\u2019s something else. After al , what she gave us was pretty much Adrian\u2019s blood, filtered. Why was that acceptable and not the pure stuff? I\u2019m hoping Grace can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Closing the cooler, Syre leaned back against his desk and tracked her movements with his gaze. \u201cGrace is busy researching the Wraith Virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we get someone else. We need more lab rats anyway. Every day that passes, the infection spreads. If we don\u2019t get a lid on this, we\u2019re going to give Adrian the excuse he needs to take us al out. We need to test lycan blood as wel . The wraiths were al over Elijah. They completely ignored me and Salem, but ingesting El\u2019s blood kil ed them. I know we want a cure, but we may not have the luxury of one. We may need to take the infected down for damage control, and if lycan blood is poisonous to them, we should know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l look into some suitable \u2018lab rat\u2019 candidates. As for lycan blood, it could be the touch of demon in them that\u2019s the culprit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , there\u2019s an endless supply of demons. If we need to test them, too, I\u2019l round some up when I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re heading out?\u201d</p><p>She stopped pacing and told him about Elijah\u2019s queries to Adrian.</p><p>\u201cAnd Adrian just gave up this information voluntarily?\u201d Syre crossed his arms. \u201cTo the very lycan who\u2019s weakened his position so drastical y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lindsay argued on Elijah\u2019s behalf. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s that close to the Alpha? Is there something between them?\u201d</p><p>Vash exhaled harshly. \u201cFriendship. Adrian would\u2019ve kil ed him if it was anything else. Actual y, maybe they\u2019re more like family\u2014siblings or close cousins. She gave up her mortal life to be with Adrian; I can\u2019t imagine she had many close ties to be able to do that so easily. And Elijah...he\u2019s somewhat of a lone wolf. He\u2019s a hands-on leader, but he doesn\u2019t share so much as he supports. What few friends he has are valuable to him.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d kil for them. Was planning on kil ing her for one of them. That Lindsay was one of the rare and fortunate people to occupy that inner circle in Elijah\u2019s life irritated Vash to no end. Knowing there was nothing romantic involved didn\u2019t stem her irrational jealousy. And thinking about just how much Micah must have meant to Elijah sent acidic surges of guilt through her. She\u2019d learned long ago not to nurse regrets. It was too dangerous to do so when living an endless life. But hurting Elijah as she had...for a crime he\u2019d turned out to be innocent of...it ate at her.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re taking him with you to Huntington?\u201d Syre asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I told you my price in the beginning\u2014I\u2019d round him up for you, but I get what I need from him, too.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l check in and keep you apprised. It shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d She was eager to get going. Not just to get the task done but to work alongside Elijah.</p><p>In the tasks they\u2019d tackled together so far, he\u2019d balanced her. Leveled her out. And she\u2019d done the same for him. They worked wel together.</p><p>It was his more intimate effect on her that knocked her off kilter.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Vashti. And watchful for traps. His authority is stil being established, and he\u2019l be chal enged often. I don\u2019t want you caught in the crosshairs. No one wants to see what I\u2019d do if something happened to you.\u201d</p><p>She caught his hand and squeezed, grateful for him and his faith in her, something that must have been hard to maintain in the years since Charron died.</p><p>Opening the office door, she strode out into an eerily quiet warehouse. Not a soul moved in the cavernous space and while it might have been possible that Elijah was in one of the offices, she knew right away he was gone. She felt the void, and her stomach knotted, a reaction that set off her temper. She wasn\u2019t mad that he\u2019d left\u2014it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what must have unfolded while she was distracted\u2014but it infuriated her that it rocked her to find him gone. It stung that he had been able to leave without a fight after she\u2019d struggled with just the thought of it.</p><p>Grabbing a set of car keys off the wal rack, Vash was halfway to the door when it opened and the next busload of lycans poured in, brought to her courtesy of Salem, who\u2019d headed out before dawn to pick them up.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A.\u201d She was trapped until she and Salem could get the new teams squared away. Elijah had plugged in his suggestions for team compositions that morning, which would save her time, but there was no way she\u2019d catch him before his flight left the ground.</p><p>Her anger simmering, she hung the keys back up and got to work.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Elijah knew something was off the moment he turned his rental vehicle onto a residential street in a suburban neighborhood on the outskirts of Shreveport, Louisiana. Although it was early evening, he thought there were too many cars in evidence, especial y considering how few lights were on in the homes. When he unfolded from the economy sedan, his sense of unease deepened.</p><p>It was too quiet. Almost deathly so. No birds chirping, no dogs barking, no television sets or radios. With his hearing, he should be hearing toilets flushing, people chatting, dinner simmering.</p><p>Rol ing his shoulders back, he repeated what Lindsay had said when they\u2019d first arrived in Hurricane, Utah, moments before they\u2019d found a nest of wraiths: \u201cThis place crawls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Raze looked at him over the roof of the car. \u201cI was hoping it was just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBound to catch a snag at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought we\u2019d already done that,\u201d Raze groused.</p><p>Elijah grinned. They\u2019d hit the ground running, renting a car at the airport and heading immediately to the home of the vampire who\u2019d first cal ed in a concern to Syre. That visit had introduced them to a very pretty male vamp who went by the name of Minolo. The leggy blond had buzzed them into his UV-blocked apartment and proceeded to serve lemon cookies and tea in floral cups with saucers. Minolo had taken an instant shine to Raze, and over the hour they\u2019d stayed to conduct the interview, the vamp had flirted and fluttered his mascara-coated lashes at Vashti\u2019s captain with warm invitation.</p><p>\u201cNot interested,\u201d Raze had growled final y.</p><p>\u201cI can fix that, sugar,\u201d the blond shot back with a saucy wink.</p><p>Elijah had stepped in then, just to avoid bloodshed, redirecting Minolo\u2019s attention to the reason they\u2019d come. They\u2019d learned it was an interview conducted by the local authorities that first roused Minolo\u2019s suspicions. He\u2019d waylaid the investigation into the disappearance of a former lover with a bit of vampire mind compulsion; then he\u2019d started digging around on his own. Minolo was the gossip center of the area\u2019s vampire community, and it hadn\u2019t taken more than a couple of days to ascertain that several vampires he was familiar with were no longer being seen around town.</p><p>Elijah and Raze\u2019s subsequent five-hour canvas of the city had turned up enough information to let them know there was definitely a problem in Shreveport. They\u2019d worked their way outward from Minolo\u2019s residence in an ever-widening circle, interviewing the neighbors of vamps gone missing.</p><p>Most of the minions they\u2019d inquired after worked nights, so their neighbors had scant opportunity to observe their comings and goings. In those cases, he and Raze would appear to drive away, only to return shortly after to enter those residences on the sly. They checked out the interiors and found empty homes, which led to a grim conclusion\u2014there were too many minions whose whereabouts were unaccounted for in the bright light of day.</p><p>But the subdivision they\u2019d just driven into was by far the most concerning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l need backup,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cAt the very least, the two minions we\u2019ve got coming in on the red-eye to take the nightshift, but ideal y more than that. I\u2019d say a team of a dozen or more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to reconnoiter? We\u2019ve got a bit of daylight now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t help. We had daylight in Vegas and three of us.\u201d</p><p>Raze rubbed a hand over his shaved head. \u201cI hate walking away. Makes me feel like a pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it either, but it\u2019s best. Trust me.\u201d Elijah got back into the car. \u201cWe\u2019l hit up the tech team to access the layout of this subdivision and we\u2019l get a plan in place for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Raze took another look around. \u201cAl right.\u201d</p><p>Elijah didn\u2019t discount how easily the vamp had ceded to the advice of a lycan. Whether that was because he was banging Raze\u2019s commanding officer or because of his own merits, he couldn\u2019t say, but he\u2019d take it for now. Eventual y they would al trust him. Because he\u2019d earn it.</p><p>They headed back to the motel, changed into jeans and T-shirts, and decided to make dinner easy by hitting up the adjacent restaurant on foot.</p><p>They\u2019d chosen to stay in a rural area, far from the city. Pine forest surrounded the uninspired motel they were bedding down in, which Elijah found soothing, something his mood needed after hitting a road bump with Vash. Every minute that passed brought him closer to their inevitable confrontation. He was ready for it now, on edge because of a fruitless hunt and the aggravation of separation.</p><p>Settling into a booth, he ordered two of the house special and a beer. As the waitress walked away, he and Raze leaned back to size each other up, something they\u2019d avoided doing earlier because the job came first.</p><p>Elijah took special care with his examination, having learned that Vashti rarely went anywhere without Raze or Salem\u2014usual y both\u2014in tow. Both vampire captains were big for their kind; the Fal en were usual y slender and elegantly built, their bodies having been made for flight. Salem was the bigger of the two, towering at a good six feet six inches and easily two hundred and fifty pounds of pure muscle. Raze was similar to Elijah\u2019s size of six feet three inches and a solid two hundred and twenty pounds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Vashti was a powerful woman, tal and leanly muscular, a renowned expert with al weaponry. She didn\u2019t need bodyguards. And from a resources standpoint, it didn\u2019t seem wise for Syre to tie three of his best Fal en together.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your story, Alpha?\u201d Raze drawled. While Elijah wasn\u2019t much of a judge when it came to male attractiveness, he\u2019d noted the number of female glances that fol owed the vamp when he had stepped outside to take a cal .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l tel you mine, if you tel me yours.\u201d</p><p>Raze snorted. \u201cI suppose you want me to focus on my story as it relates to Vash.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cShe carries a lot of manpower in you and Salem, but she\u2019s strong and smart. She can take care of herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stil a woman.\u201d</p><p>Elijah took a long pul on his beer and absorbed that. He knew damn wel Raze and Salem had a healthy respect for Vashti or they wouldn\u2019t be taking orders from her. Which meant the mention of her sex wasn\u2019t gender bias.</p><p>Women were vulnerable to attack in ways men rarely were.</p><p>Syre, Raze, and Salem were al fiercely protective. And the way she\u2019d first had sex with him...restraining him...trying to maintain total control... \u201cLycans?\u201d Elijah asked tightly, fury simmering in his blood.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>So...Raze wouldn\u2019t discuss Vash outright, he\u2019d only al ude. Elijah respected that, even as he hungered for more information.</p><p>Raze draped his arm along the window ledge. \u201cYou know what we were before\u2014Watchers. After we fel , we had to figure out what to do with ourselves. We al had different areas of knowledge, and that\u2019s where we focused our efforts. Vashti specialized in armaments\u2014how to create them and use them. Even as a scholar, she was a warrior.\u201d</p><p>The note of affection in Raze\u2019s voice tightened Elijah\u2019s grip on his bottle. \u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time, we thought maybe we just needed to earn our way back into the Creator\u2019s good graces. Pay a penance of some sort. Make amends. Vash took to hunting demons, which came in handy later on when they started fucking with us. We were the throwaway angels, the ones they thought they\u2019d have carte blanche to screw around with.\u201d Raze exhaled audibly. \u201cSyre wanted to take a more diplomatic approach, while Vash was more aggressive. Since she was the one in the field, her way prevailed. It\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 major understatement to say she wasn\u2019t popular in the demon community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus...\u201d Elijah fel heavily into the booth back. He\u2019d seen the leavings of demon attacks. Just the thought of that sort of damage in any relation whatsoever to Vashti made his stomach knot.</p> <p>\u201cAnd demons like to kick you when you\u2019re down. The death of a mate is one of those perfect times for them.\u201d</p><p>Teeth grinding, he bit out, \u201cShe said Syre took care of it. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He took care of it. When he was done with them, he dumped their ashes into a trash can and sent them back to their liege.\u201d</p><p>Elijah bitterly regretted that he wouldn\u2019t be able to exact vengeance of his own. The feeling of impotence was so sharp it was painful. \u201cWhat was your specialty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTriage.\u201d</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his face, Elijah pul ed everything together and created a picture that gnawed at his gut. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said again, remembering how roughly he\u2019d taken her in Vegas, how completely he\u2019d dominated her.</p><p>Raze smiled at the waitress when she returned with Elijah\u2019s food. She smiled back, her eyes bright with interest. She asked Raze twice if he was sure she couldn\u2019t get him anything and he replied that he was just waiting for her to go on break, if she was of the mind to share it with him. Which she was, of course.</p><p>\u201cSex wil limber you,\u201d Raze said to Elijah once she\u2019d walked away. \u201cYou might want to grab a piece of ass before tomorrow, especial y considering how close you came to croaking yesterday. This might be your last chance to get laid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m touched you care, but my sex life is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like redheads, right? There\u2019s a honey of a redhead that just walked in. You might get lucky.\u201d Raze whistled. \u201cDamn, you didn\u2019t even look.</p><p>Vash must have you wrapped around her little finger.\u201d</p><p>Elijah finished chewing his first bite of an excel ent rare tri-tip. \u201cIs that supposed to make me feel like a douche? I don\u2019t see any problem with knowing when you\u2019ve got it good and sticking with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust \u2019cuz it\u2019s good, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, man.\u201d He popped a hush puppy into his mouth and decimated it in two bites. \u201cYou lost your wings over a woman. You can\u2019t have forgotten what it feels like.\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over Raze\u2019s features, erasing al levity. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that for me. I wasn\u2019t as noble as the others. I was banging everything that let me.\u201d</p><p>Chewing his steak, Elijah wondered if that made Raze feel more culpable than the others or less.</p><p>The vamp shrugged off his sudden dark mood. \u201cAnyway. There was one later on...not too long ago...\u201d</p><p>Elijah set aside the now-empty bowl that once held col ard greens and dropped a cleaned rib bone into it.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Alpha,\u201d Raze muttered, watching him mow through his second platter. \u201cYou can put it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe deserved someone without fangs.\u201d Raze smiled at the waitress, but his eyes were flat. He slid out of the booth. \u201cThere\u2019s my dinner bel . I\u2019l catch you later. Good luck with the redhead. Looks like she wants a piece of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her, too,\u201d Elijah shot back, unfolding the wet nap next to his plate to clean his hands. \u201cMake it a party.\u201d</p><p>Raze laughed and headed out.</p><p>Picking up the check sitting on the edge of the table, Elijah noted the total and reached into his back pocket for his wal et.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The sound of Vashti\u2019s irate voice nearly made him smile, but he restrained himself. \u201cEating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy.\u201d She dropped into the seat Raze had just vacated. \u201cWhat are you doing here in Louisiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking.\u201d</p><p>Her amber eyes were hot with fury, her cheeks flushed and lips red. With her long mane of crimson hair and her sleek black bodysuit, she was so damned delicious she made his mouth water. He wouldn\u2019t change a thing about her, except the pain in her past and her evasive tendencies in the present.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deliberately trying to piss me off, lycan.\u201d</p><p>He pushed to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s take this next door.\u201d</p><p>Tossing cash for the bil on the table, he gestured his bristling vampress toward the exit.</p><p>When they stepped outside, she rounded on him. \u201cWe had a deal.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched. \u201cThat\u2019s the way you wanna play this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I want that information, and you owe it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l get it.\u201d Elijah sidestepped around her and headed to his room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to you!\u201d she yel ed at his back, fol owed by the rapid click of her heels along the cement walkway.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Your gums are flapping, but you\u2019re not actual y saying anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</p><p>His temper began to heat. He opened the door to his room and stepped inside.</p><p>Her palm slapped against the closing door and pushed it open hard enough to bounce off the wal . \u201cYou deliberately switched around the assignments so it took me al damn day to find you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal y? Since you put me with Raze, I would think a quick phone cal to him would\u2019ve cleared things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about putting you with Raze. I was going to talk to you about it last night, but you wouldn\u2019t let me. You just had to talk first and then the next thing I knew, I was fucking your brains out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Talk to me, not with me. You\u2019d already made up your mind. I\u2019m not your pet. I\u2019m your partner. I have a say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a chance to bring it up,\u201d she repeated obstinately.</p><p>Elijah reined in his temper with effort. \u201cAnd this morning? When we were working on the composition of the teams? You could have talked about it then. I asked you.\u201d</p><p>She glared, her face a mask of righteous fury. \u201cWe already had other plans by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we? We never talked about the first plans. I figured we\u2019d be getting around to that after we got the teams dispatched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , you figured wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd before?\u201d he countered tightly, having trouble deciding if he should throw her out or throw her on the bed and fuck her. \u201cYou want to toss our deal in my face, let\u2019s talk about it. You agreed to stay with me. Then you made plans that reneged on our agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agreed to stay with you while we investigated lycans who might possibly be involved in Char\u2019s death,\u201d she shot back. \u201cLast night, that wasn\u2019t the immediate item on the agenda. The hunt was, and I made a strategic tactical decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how were you planning on feeding?\u201d</p><p>Her hands fisted. \u201cYou can\u2019t feed anyone now. You\u2019re stil recovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d She stalked closer.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here, Vashti? Wanna get laid? That\u2019s al you want from me, right? And information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. The reason I\u2019m here is obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me. If you wanted to chew me a new one, you could\u2019ve done it on the phone. If you wanted to deal with the business in Huntington, I could\u2019ve met you there tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted and her arms crossed. \u201cI like to deal with things directly.\u201d</p><p>He barked out a dry laugh. \u201cWel , you\u2019ve accomplished that. Now you can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Deliberately baiting her, Elijah pul ed out the chair tucked into the desk and sat down. \u201cThen by al means, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, a muscle ticcing in her jaw. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask me what was going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I ask you to talk about something you went out of your way not to talk about?\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cFor god\u2019s sake, the plans changed. It was a moot point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me it wasn\u2019t. You want to put distance between us. This was a way to do it, until I came up with information that was more valuable than recovering your skewed peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making this personal when it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hel it\u2019s not.\u201d He\u2019d had enough. Irritated with himself as much as with her, he hit her with the truth. \u201cYou risked your life and a Sentinel war to save me. You flew fourteen hundred miles just to bitch at me. We\u2019ve been fucking each other\u2019s brains out\u2014as you so eloquently put it\u2014for the last few days. Don\u2019t tel me it\u2019s not personal when you decide we\u2019re better off working on opposite sides of the country!\u201d</p><p>Her chest heaved with angry breaths. \u201cThere are bigger things going on here than whether or not you got your feelings hurt over a reasonable decision. It doesn\u2019t make sense to tie up both of us together. We\u2019re too valuable. We need to spread some of that muscle around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Done.\u201d He stood. \u201cGet the fuck out of my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not throwing me out! What about our deal?\u201d</p><p>Elijah caught her elbow and dragged her to the door. \u201cI release you from the deal. I\u2019l get your damned information and you\u2019l have it as soon as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. We\u2019re too valuable to risk as a unit. We need to keep ourselves spread around.\u201d</p><p>Yanking her arm free, Vashti spun and shoved at him. She cursed when he didn\u2019t budge an inch. \u201cYou\u2019re being an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said. Lucky for you, you\u2019re not going to have to be around me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened when he opened the door, as if she real y couldn\u2019t believe he was throwing her out on her ass. \u201cWhat the hel do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespect. Honesty. Trust. A little consideration for the feelings you just spat on.\u201d With an exaggerated sweep of his arm, he urged her to leave.</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A.\u201d She held her ground stubbornly. \u201cHow are we going to work this out if you give up? I\u2019m trying to have a conversation with you and you don\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to deal with bul shit.\u201d He leaned into the edge of the door. \u201cDid you rehearse what you were going to say? Were you thinking about it al day? Trying to come up with ways to justify and spin your way through this discussion so you\u2019re on the high ground and I\u2019m wrong in every way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking. You\u2019re crazy about me, Vashti. You don\u2019t know why...It doesn\u2019t make sense...But you can\u2019t stop thinking about me. Can\u2019t stop wanting me. Can\u2019t stop wishing you were with me when you\u2019re not. Right now, as pissed off as you are and as righteous as you\u2019ve convinced yourself you have a right to be, you\u2019re hot and wet and aching for me. The last thing you want to do is leave, because you\u2019ve been busting your ass al day to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d She tossed her hair over her shoulder. \u201cConceited much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, of course, you\u2019re not going to admit it. You\u2019re not going to really clear the air and confess that you were putting me with Raze because I\u2019m getting too close to you and you think you need space. You think you want it. That it\u2019l be safer for you when you have it because then I won\u2019t be able to get to you the way I do.\u201d He shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. And I damn sure don\u2019t have time to work with someone I can\u2019t trust to be honest with herself, let alone be honest with me. So you can either walk out of here on your own two feet or I can pick you up and toss you out. How do you want it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her throat worked on a hard swal ow. The yearning in her eyes almost broke him, but he held his ground. He wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied with her the way things were. Last night had shown him that he was moving beyond the sexual attraction phase into something deeper. He wasn\u2019t going to wade into those waters alone. Too many people were depending on him. He couldn\u2019t afford to get al twisted up over a woman who didn\u2019t feel the same pul he did. Or at least wouldn\u2019t admit to it. Accept it.</p><p>Vashti moved toward the door slowly, al the anger she\u2019d hit him with seeming to have drained away. It no longer stiffened her spine or propel ed her steps. She paused on the threshold and looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cElijah...don\u2019t be like this. It was a tactical decision that was best for the mission. Let\u2019s talk it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. Raze and I get along fine, things are moving forward, and I\u2019l get to Huntington before the end of next week. Al \u2019s right in your world, Vashti. Leave it be.\u201d</p><p>She stepped outside.</p> <p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d he said as he swung the door closed, \u201cI was crazy about you, too.\u201d</p><p>Vash stared at Elijah\u2019s closed door and didn\u2019t know what to do with the vibrating anxiety that rattled through her. Everything inside her rebel ed at the realization that she was on the outside and he was locked away from her. Closed off in every possible way.</p><p>Christ, she\u2019d come al this way with the thought that she would be with him tonight. She\u2019d been pushing toward that al day and now she had nothing at al ... She\u2019d never seen him so furious. He was livid. And his anger was more terrifying for its quiet strength. If he\u2019d yel ed or hit the wal ... anything...the passion of his response would\u2019ve given her something to hang on to. But his chil y fury had been emotionless. His parting comment had been made without any inflection at al . And spoken in the past tense.</p><p>Cursing, she ran both of her hands through her hair.</p><p>\u201cFucked it up, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at Raze, who sauntered toward her, flush with the healthy glow of a vampire who\u2019d just fed.</p><p>His gaze darted over her face and he sighed. Pity shadowed his eyes. \u201cAh, Vashti. Maybe it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>She nodded violently.</p><p>\u201cYou got a room?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI should head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He tossed an arm around her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big day tomorrow and we can use you. Wanna stay with me? I have two beds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the waitress?\u201d</p><p>One thickly muscled shoulder lifted in an insolent shrug. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>Vash leaned her head in to him. \u201cStil hung up on that med tech in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not in the mood for anything complicated. You know what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Only she didn\u2019t, not real y. She\u2019d connected with Char and, to a certain extent, Elijah. Raze had only ever connected with one woman, a mortal who\u2019d drifted through his life as quickly as al the others but somehow managed to leave an indelible impression behind. Raze had been a man whore as long as Vash had known him. But when he\u2019d come back from Chicago not too long ago, he\u2019d gone from barely keeping his pants on to never dropping them at al . Aside from his fangs, he kept his body parts to himself.</p><p>When she had the time, Vash intended to look up Kimberly McAdams in the Windy City and see if she could get a handle on what it was about the woman that had so drastical y altered one of her best captains.</p><p>He changed the subject. \u201cI have to head to the airport in a couple hours to pick up the night shift and backup crews we have coming in. If you want to tag along, you stil have time to feed. Plenty of selection in the restaurant\u2014a couple truckers, the bartender, a handful of locals. You\u2019l feel better.\u201d</p><p>No...she wouldn\u2019t. Her head turned involuntarily toward Elijah\u2019s door. He had to hear their conversation with his lycan hearing, yet he didn\u2019t come storming out with his demand that she not feed on anyone but him. He\u2019d real y washed his hands of her.</p> <p>Stil , she couldn\u2019t do it. Didn\u2019t want to, even though she was now two days out from when she\u2019d last drunk from Elijah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said instead. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fil me in on what you picked up today and what you\u2019ve got on the agenda for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your stuff?\u201d His mouth curved. \u201cYou brought an overnight bag, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve got the Explorer over there.\u201d He handed her his keycard and she tossed him her rental keys. As embarrassed as she was that she\u2019d been kicked to the curb, at least no one knew she\u2019d been hoping for some after-fight, make-up monkey sex when she\u2019d hopped on a plane a few hours ago.</p><p>A girl had to have her pride.</p><p>Then she looked over her shoulder at the worn blackout curtains that blocked Elijah\u2019s room from her gaze and wondered if maybe she had a bit too much of it.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Vash\u2019s brows rose when she saw Syre exit from the private plane.</p><p>\u201cDamn. We got the big gun,\u201d Raze murmured before stepping forward to clasp forearms with their commander. \u201cSyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn entire subdivision?\u201d Syre asked without preamble. He stood on the tarmac with the wind blowing gently through his hair, his head-to-toe black attire making him nearly one with the darkness.</p><p>A beautiful and deadly dark prince, Vash thought whimsical y. Regal, powerful, and lethal.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Elijah\u2019s take.\u201d Raze glanced at the three lycans and four minions disembarking. \u201cGood thing we brought two cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the Alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnoozing. It\u2019s damn near two in the morning. Unlike us, he needs sleep.\u201d</p><p>Syre acknowledged that with a nod. \u201cWhat\u2019s your take, Raze?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as his. Place gave me the wil ies. It\u2019s like a ghost town.\u201d</p><p>Syre looked at Vash.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t scoped it out yet, but if Elijah says it\u2019s squirrely, then it\u2019s squirrely. We\u2019ve never faced a cleanup of this magnitude before,\u201d she said grimly. \u201cHow do you keep a lid on an entire neighborhood vanishing overnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUFOs.\u201d</p><p>They al turned their heads toward the minion who\u2019d spoken. Vash placed him in his mid-thirties when he\u2019d gone through the Change, and by the brightness of his smile and his twinkling eyes, he hadn\u2019t been a vampire long enough to become world-weary. He wore his dirty-blond hair in a shaggy style, which gave him a laid-back and youthful appearance.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe snag a few of the video cameras that we\u2019re bound to find when we enter the houses and film the rest of you running around with flares in the darkness. You\u2019l look like streaking lights. Then let the government cover it al up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A,\u201d Vash said, deciding to run with the absurdity. \u201cI\u2019l man a camera. Syre, you\u2019re the fastest. You can run around with the flares.\u201d</p><p>The look on Syre\u2019s face was worth the cost of admission. Grinning, she asked the minion, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk around Syre, Chad,\u201d she suggested. \u201cHe might kil you.\u201d</p><p>Chad laughed, but she was only half kidding.</p><p>He was definitely a newbie. One who hadn\u2019t been around long enough to figure out what his moniker would be. Most minions changed their names a century or two into their new lives, when everything they\u2019d once known and loved had burned through the finite days of mortality and passed away. Vamps often chose names that represented who they\u2019d become. Like Raze, who leveled every opponent in his path, and Torque, who tweaked, finessed, and applied pressure to situations as necessary. Contrarily, Vash had kept her angelic name, as a reminder of the woman she\u2019d once been, one who\u2019d been worthy of Charron\u2019s love. She\u2019d changed a lot since then. She wondered what Char would think of who she was now, whether he\u2019d want her as much as he had before, whether he would want her as much as Elijah did.</p><p>Syre held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019l drive. Chad, ride with Raze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee,\u201d Raze muttered. \u201cThanks, sir.\u201d</p><p>Vash took the three lycans with her and Syre; Raze took the four vamps. They hit the road with Vash resetting the GPS so Syre knew where they were going.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here, Vashti,\u201d Syre said, glancing at her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as surprised as I am to see you.\u201d</p><p>He adjusted the rearview mirror. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see one of these wraiths in the flesh and it\u2019s high time I did so.\u201d</p><p>She hit the button to lower the window and rested her elbow on the frame, relishing the cooling kiss of the breeze on her face. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re checking up on me. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am,\u201d he conceded. \u201cYou\u2019re valuable to me and I\u2019m concerned that you\u2019re...conflicted.\u201d</p><p>Great. Pretty soon everyone who mattered would know she was a mess. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot on our plate right now. I\u2019m worried we won\u2019t be fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l know more once the other teams check in.\u201d His voice was low and soothing, wielding his ability to mesmerize and charm.</p><p>\u201cAnd if they al come back with reports of entire neighborhoods taken over by wraiths? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my eternal pessimist. Then I guess we\u2019l stock up on zombie apocalypse movies and try to pick up some pointers.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to smile, so she turned around and looked at the crew instead. The males were dark haired and big. Beautiful male specimens real y, but mere shadows of Elijah. The female was blond and petite, pretty in a wholesome homespun way with her stick-straight hair, green eyes, and pink bow lips.</p><p>Vash briefed them. \u201cElijah wil be able to zero in on the aspects relating to lycans better than I wil , but I\u2019l tel you to be careful regardless. Wraiths seem to have a hard-on for you guys, and our al iance is new enough to be a liability. We haven\u2019t fought alongside each other long enough to dance together without stumbling. A stumble with these guys can get us kil ed. Watch each other\u2019s backs more than usual.\u201d</p><p>Al three glared at her with mute hostility.</p><p>\u201cNames?\u201d she asked, lacking the energy to get into a pissing match now.</p><p>John, Trey, and Himeko, she was told. Turning back around, she cal ed Raze. \u201cHey. How\u2019s the sleeping situation going to work at the motel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked up three additional rooms, aside from the one Elijah\u2019s got. I wasn\u2019t expecting you, Syre, or a five-man backup crew. Hopeful y, we can snag another room for the commander; the motel isn\u2019t exactly in high demand. If not, we\u2019l put you with Syre and I\u2019l take one of the vamps in my second bed. The other two rooms have multiple beds, so we\u2019l have them bunk up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>But when they arrived at the motel, they found the place sold out, thanks to a popular band playing at the restaurant next door. Vash claimed her backpack from Raze\u2019s room and exited out to the sidewalk to wait for Syre, who was grabbing his bag from her rental on the other side of the lot.</p><p>Raze was in the front office, taking care of getting keycards for the new arrivals.</p><p>She stood alone, feeling inexplicably lonely.</p><p>Drawn to Elijah, she sidled closer to his room. Her stomach knotted with every step she took, her mouth watering with the need to taste him. Not just for blood and sex, but the sound of his voice, the beat of his heart beneath her ear, the warmth of his arms around her. It struck her that she was terribly afraid he might open his door and she would plead for him to stop shutting her out, forfeiting al her dignity and pride.</p><p>She was shaken by the depth of her craving. She didn\u2019t understand why he had to make their... association\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to cal it a relationship\u2014so complicated. Couldn\u2019t they just take what they needed from each other, give each other what they had to give, and take it one day at a time?</p><p>She was formulating an argument to hit him with when a suspicious sound caught her ear. When she heard it again, her lungs seized and an icy lump settled in her gut.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d she growled, stalking closer to Elijah\u2019s door. Her blood heated and her heart began to pound.</p><p>Horrified and disbelieving, Vash stared at the number on the door, wil ing it to change when she blinked. The unmistakable sounds of enthusiastic sex emanating from Elijah\u2019s room twisted her stomach into a hard knot. A shard of white-hot pain speared through her chest.</p><p>A woman\u2019s breathless pleas for more...rhythmical y squeaking bedsprings...the growl of a man pumping his way to climax... Her bag fel from her nerveless fingers to the ground. For a moment she stood shattered, something inside her broken into pieces. Then fury took over. Lifting her foot, she kicked in the door. The woman\u2019s high-pitched scream only spurred her bloodlust. The smel of sex hit her hard, propel ing her across the room toward the big figure rising up from the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l kil you!\u201d she hissed, backhanding him so hard he flew from the bed and crashed into the dresser. Her head swiveled toward the cowering nude woman on the mattress, her hand rising and clawed to strike.</p><p>Her wrist was caught in a steely grip midair. \u201cVashti.\u201d</p><p>Syre\u2019s voice, low and furious behind her, penetrated her wrath. She glanced at him. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d</p><p>Her spine stiffened at Elijah\u2019s barked question. Her gaze shifted to the silhouette in the doorway\u2014the familiar broad shoulders, tapered waist, and long legs. He was shirtless, barefooted, his jeans unbuttoned and barely clinging onto lean hips.</p><p>The woman on the bed was stil screaming like a banshee. The man who\u2019d been fucking her moaned from where he was sprawled on the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yanking her arm free of Syre, Vash rounded on Elijah. \u201cThis is your goddamned room!\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered in the semidarkness. His arms crossed, taunting her with the sight of his gorgeous biceps and lickable abs. He was hard al over, precisely cut and built. And she wanted him. Desperately.</p><p>Sudden silence descended as the woman abruptly ceased her caterwauling. Syre\u2019s soothing murmurs registered in Vash\u2019s brain, then faded beneath her roaring blood.</p><p>\u201cIt was my room,\u201d he corrected silkily. \u201cObviously, I moved.\u201d</p> <p>She bit off a scream of frustration. His mouth twitched as his gaze took in the scene behind her.</p><p>Mortified at her lack of control, she got in his face. \u201cDon\u2019t smirk. If that guy had been you, you\u2019d be swal owing your severed bal s right now.\u201d</p><p>He set a hand over his heart. \u201cI feel so loved.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened on a retort when Raze sauntered up with their reinforcements in tow. He looked at the crumpled metal door, the warped frame, and the situation inside. Then he looked at Vashti with one brow raised.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say a word,\u201d she warned him. \u201cNot one fucking word.\u201d</p> <p>Syre came out of the room like a shadow, sinuous and silent. His face was impassive, but his eyes were deadly. \u201cThe mortals won\u2019t remember this incident, but damned if I\u2019l let you forget it, Vashti.\u201d</p><p>His chin lifted. Elijah stepped forward, positioning himself in a way that put him between her and her commander. The gesture was a protective one. And undeniably chal enging.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need a shield with Syre, but that didn\u2019t stop her throat from tightening over Elijah\u2019s wil ingness to be one for her.</p><p>Himeko stepped up behind her Alpha, her smile too damn intimate for Vash\u2019s tastes. \u201cDoes your room have two beds, El?\u201d</p><p>His gaze never left Syre\u2019s face. \u201cIt does, yes. It\u2019s open to whoever wants it.\u201d</p><p>Vash fought with herself, wondering if he\u2019d reject her publicly if she jumped at the chance to share a room with him. She didn\u2019t get the opportunity to find out.</p> <p>Himeko pounced first. \u201cI\u2019l room with you. I know you don\u2019t snore.\u201d</p><p>Vash scowled. How the hell did she know that?</p><p>\u201cCome on, then.\u201d Elijah gestured down the hal way. \u201cWe need to crash. We\u2019re gonna have a hel of a morning in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Which, Vash suddenly realized, was why she needed to be with him so badly. She\u2019d very nearly lost him once. Every minute she wasn\u2019t with him was a minute wasted. The fact that she even thought of her time with him in those minuscule terms was tel ing, considering how long she\u2019d been alive and how much longer she had yet to live.</p><p>Needing something else to focus on, she turned to clean up the mess she\u2019d made. Damn it. The poor bastard inside was probably hurt real bad.</p><p>She\u2019d hit him with the thought that he was a lycan and therefore could take the force of her strength.</p><p>\u201cI took care of it,\u201d Syre said grimly. \u201cHis wounds are healed, but he\u2019l have a hel of a headache.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, she nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake care of that door,\u201d Syre ordered Raze, before col ecting Vash\u2019s bag from the ground and grabbing her by the elbow to steer her away.</p><p>The door to their room hadn\u2019t yet shut behind them when Syre went off. \u201cWhat the hel are you doing, Vashti?\u201d</p><p>Her spine stiffened at his icy tone. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mess. You\u2019re a danger to yourself and everyone around you.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted, accepting the hit. She was hungry, hurt, bewildered...\u201cI am, yes.\u201d</p><p>Cursing, he shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t do a fucking thing about it besides stick close and clean up after you.\u201d</p><p>Guilt humbled her. He had so much on his plate. He needed her running at one hundred percent. Everyone did. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Syre looked at her and she winced at the torment in his eyes. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. After al the times you\u2019ve been there for me...al the ways you\u2019ve helped me over the years...the fact that I can\u2019t do one goddamn thing to help you is kil ing me. You\u2019re fal ing apart, and I can only stand here and pick up the pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamyaza.\u201d She didn\u2019t realize she was crying until she felt the wetness on her cheeks.</p><p>He opened his arms to her and she walked into them. Fisting her hands in his shirt, she poured out her confusion in a storm of tears.</p><p>Vash entered the motel\u2019s restaurant at eight thirty in the morning and found the lycans eating breakfast. John and Trey sat in one booth, Elijah and Himeko in another. The striking beauty was laughing at something Elijah had said; her sloe eyes were bright and her smile warm. When she reached out and set her hand over El\u2019s, Vash knew they\u2019d slept together at some point in their history.</p><p>The bruised feeling in her chest bloomed with a deeper pain and her claws extended, piercing her palms.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath of courage, she did what she\u2019d come to do.</p><p>She approached Elijah\u2019s table, meeting Himeko\u2019s gaze when it lifted to hers. \u201cBeat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet lost. Take a hike. Go away.\u201d</p><p>The lycan visibly bristled. \u201cNow, just a minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHimeko.\u201d Elijah\u2019s calm, quiet voice settled the matter. \u201cPlease excuse us.\u201d</p><p>Himeko looked at him, searching his face for something. With a jerky nod, she grabbed her plate and shot Vash a look of pure unadulterated malice.</p><p>And they were supposed to fight alongside each other today. Terrific.</p><p>Vash settled onto the vacated bench seat and kept her clawed hands clasped under the table.</p><p>\u201cThat was rude,\u201d he said, slicing into a slab of ham and shoving it into his mouth. \u201cThey want to kil you enough as it is. Stop making it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants you.\u201d</p><p>He swal owed. \u201cShe\u2019s had me.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy dug its green talons into her, shortening her breath.</p><p>\u201cNot recently,\u201d he qualified, \u201cand not seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was for me. We had a mutual itch and we scratched it. End of story.\u201d He dumped a pat of butter onto his hash browns and mashed it around.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t say anything else, he asked, \u201cWas there something you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d His eyes were dark and shadowed, his sexy mouth bracketed with deep grooves.</p><p>\u201cDo I? You look drop-dead gorgeous, as always.\u201d He delivered the compliment in so dry a tone she couldn\u2019t take it seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her then, arching a brow when she didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>She exhaled in a rush. \u201cI should\u2019ve made a greater effort to tel you about the plan to pair you with Raze. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d like it, and I chickened out instead of arguing with you. Later, when the plans changed, I avoided the argument altogether by burying it. Trying to bury it. I apologize. I\u2019m not proud that I was a coward about it.\u201d</p><p>Elijah studied her, his gaze so intense she nearly squirmed in her seat. It was driving her crazy to sit so close to him with such a yawning gap between them. Every inhale brought his scent into her nostrils, making her heart pound. She knew he heard it, knew he\u2019d sense her hunger just as he had when they\u2019d first met in the Bryce Canyon cave.</p><p>He resumed eating, his gaze on his plate. \u201cApology accepted.\u201d</p><p>Relief fil ed her so quickly she got dizzy. That was probably why it took her a heartbeat or two to realize she wasn\u2019t going to get any more from him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d she demanded when it settled in. \u201cThat\u2019s al you\u2019re going to give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more did you want?\u201d he asked cool y, scooping his sunny-side-up fried egg onto a triangle of buttered toast. \u201cYou apologized. I accepted.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes burned. Coming so swiftly on the heels of relief, her disappointment blew the lid off her already volatile mood. \u201cI think I hate you.\u201d</p><p>His knuckles whitened on his utensils. \u201cTread careful y, Vashti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you care? No, don\u2019t answer. You already have, loud and clear.\u201d She slid out of the booth and walked away.</p><p>There was a moment of terrible silence.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Vashti.\u201d His silverware clattered onto his plate behind her. \u201cGod-fucking-damn it.\u201d</p><p>She raced the distance to the Explorer, desperate to get away before he saw her crying. God...she real y was a hot mess. And for what? A sexy lycan who strung legions of panting women along for kicks? Stupid. The whole thing was stupid. She\u2019d been way better off with a dormant sex drive and the lycan working for the Sentinels.</p><p>He reached the driver\u2019s-side door just as she locked it with her safely inside.</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d He\u2019d never looked more furious. His eyes were wild and glowing, his voice guttural. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d</p><p>Flipping him the bird with her left hand, she turned the ignition with her right. \u201cEnjoy your breakfast, asshat. I\u2019m going to grab a bite to eat myself.</p><p>Fuck if I\u2019l starve myself for you.\u201d</p><p>His palm slapped against the window, sending hairline fractures exploding through the safety glass. \u201cVashti. Don\u2019t run. I won\u2019t be able to control myself if you run.\u201d</p><p>She gunned the vehicle into reverse, sending gravel flying from behind the tires. She was on the road a second later, having no idea where she was going and grateful that there wasn\u2019t another soul on the winding rural road.</p><p>Pine trees crowded thickly against the serpentine ribbon of asphalt, casting shadows over the highway that perfectly suited her mood. Tears coursed down her face. So many goddamn tears. She\u2019d thought she cried herself dry during the night. It infuriated her that there were more yet to be spil ed.</p><p>Gripping the steering wheel in both hands, she screamed to purge the sick, roiling tension inside her. Then she screamed again as she hugged a curve in the road and came face-to-face with a massive chocolate-colored wolf. In the split second it took her to realize she was going to barrel right through him, her world ground to a shuddering halt. She stood on the brakes, distantly felt the antilock system vibrating the pedal madly beneath her feet. The wheels didn\u2019t lock. The car didn\u2019t slow nearly fast enough.</p><p>Bracing for the impact, she stiffened into a board... ...and nearly lost her sanity when Elijah leaped onto the hood, scrambled over the roof, and jumped off the back.</p><p>The Explorer slid into a cutout on the side of the road and came to a jerking stop. Vash slammed the transmission into park and hopped out.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking insane?\u201d she screamed with fists clenched at her sides.</p><p>His wild green irises were aglow above a vicious snarl. Al animal, with none of the man in them. He was absolutely crazy.</p><p>And she was in big trouble. Huge.</p><p>She was faced with the choice of fighting or fleeing. Holding up both hands, she forced her restless body not to move. She debated her options\u2014 tearing into him with teeth and claws, ripping him to pieces physical y as he\u2019d done to her emotional y, or just running as far and fast as she could.</p><p>She\u2019d outrun lycans before; she could do it again.</p><p>Ears flat to his head and teeth bared, Elijah slinked forward, owning the center of the highway. Vash swal owed hard, as riveted by his lupine beauty as she was by his human form. He was stunningly majestic, his thick fur as glossy and rich as his human hair, his movements lethal y graceful. His growl was a deep warning, a rumbling sound of danger that made the hair on her nape stand on end.</p><p>Something perverse inside her burst free, fueled by her simmering fury and pain. She\u2019d chased him across the country, then chased him down at breakfast. By god, it was time for him to see what it felt like to pursue. She\u2019d been too damn easy. Just like al the other bitches that fel al over him.</p><p>With her eyes on his, her mouth curved in a slow, taunting smile. One of her upraised hands lowered to intersect their line of sight. Al of her fingers curved into her palm except for the middle one. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Vash leaped over the hood of the SUV and darted into the woods.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Fresh from a shower, Lindsay tightened the belt of her floor-length satin robe and went downstairs in search of Adrian. It was barely dawn and she knew just where to find him. She moved swiftly and quietly, not wanting to wake the two lycan guards in the guest rooms.</p><p>It was time for her to get Adrian to talk.</p><p>Being here, in Helena\u2019s former home, was difficult for him, but he wasn\u2019t sharing his pain. And working without Phineas\u2014his second-in- command, whose death had brought them together\u2014was like working without his right hand. Yet he remained reserved and contained, rigidly so. It was the way he needed to be to hold his command, she knew. It was the way he\u2019d been created. But it wasn\u2019t healthy for him. He was adrift and hiding it, shielding her and everyone around him.</p><p>Lindsay didn\u2019t ful y understand how Adrian had come to be. Unlike her, he hadn\u2019t been born or raised. He\u2019d been brought into existence just as he was\u2014a ful y mature male angel with a single purpose: to serve as an implement of punishment against other angels.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t begin to grasp what that would feel like. She\u2019d been raised by adoring parents. She had been hugged a lot. She\u2019d laughed a lot. Not a day went by when she hadn\u2019t heard \u201cI love you.\u201d In contrast, Adrian had been created to be void of emotion. In time, surrounded by mortals, he\u2019d learned to covet and desire. As a creature built to be hard and merciless, it was the edgier feelings that had manifested first. Later he\u2019d learned to feel loyalty and respect. He had established friendships. Now he was learning how to love her, learning how to give. But the guilt and remorse he was feeling over Phineas\u2019s and Helena\u2019s deaths were beyond his experience. He didn\u2019t know how to express his turmoil, and bottling it up was hurting him more than she could bear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy wounded angel,\u201d she murmured, her heart aching for him.</p><p>She\u2019d fal en in love with a kil ing machine, one who was slowly but surely becoming a warmhearted, red-blooded man. There were bound to be trials and growing pains in the process, and she would help him as much as she could. But she needed him to open up to her to do so.</p><p>He\u2019d lost so much in such a short time. He felt that he\u2019d betrayed Helena\u2019s trust, that he hadn\u2019t been there for her as he should have been. Not as a commanding officer, but as a friend. Just as Phineas had been a friend, the closest one he\u2019d had, someone dear and precious to him.</p><p>She exited through the kitchen door out to the backyard patio. The enclosed space was smal , no more than a postage stamp real y, with a circle of mosaic tiles in the center of the rectangle of grass. For some people, the spot would have been perfect for a birdbath or a couple of lawn chairs.</p> <p>Here, she knew it was a landing pad, a place from which angels could lift to the sky and return to the earth.</p><p>The air crackled with the electric energy of an approaching desert storm, a storm that was brewing inside Adrian. One he was keeping at bay by sheer wil alone. And it was costing him. Greatly.</p><p>Tilting her head back, she spoke softly into the dawn breeze. \u201cAdrian, my love. I need you.\u201d</p><p>A moment later he appeared, his bril iantly white wings with their crimson tips a shock of shimmering alabaster against the pinkish gray heavens.</p><p>She\u2019d known he would be close, never too far away to be there for her should she need him. His landing was impossibly graceful, the tips of his extended wings nearly touching the stucco wal s that separated the yard from their neighbors. The bal of one foot touched the tile first; then the ful weight of his body settled firmly onto the ground.</p> <p>As was his custom, he wore only loose linen pants. His powerful chest and arms were bare and beautiful, his caramel-hued skin stretched over lean, rippling muscle. His black hair was tousled by the wind, framing his gorgeous face. And his eyes, with those gorgeous flame-blue irises, slid over her face with love and tender passion.</p><p>Her heart sighed at the sight of him. Her blood heated and flushed her skin.</p><p>And he knew, of course. His mouth curved in a sensual smile. \u201cYou could have cal ed me from the bed, neshama. I would\u2019ve heard you and come to you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Are you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI always want that, but there\u2019s something else.\u201d</p> <p>His wings dissipated like mist as she closed the distance between them. She walked right in to him, pressing her face in to his chest and wrapping her arms tightly around him.</p><p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d His resonant voice was threaded with concern. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much I need you, Adrian? How dependent I\u2019ve become on having you near? Not for blood or sex, although I won\u2019t deny that I need both of those things from you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re the force that makes my heart beat and, when we\u2019re apart, it forgets how to function.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her so tightly against him, she couldn\u2019t breathe. She was grateful her vampire lungs didn\u2019t real y need to because she didn\u2019t want to pul away. One of his hands fisted in the curls of her hair. The other arm banded around her waist, ensuring that every inch of her was pressed tightly to him. \u201cNeshama sheli. You destroy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. So much that I feel your pain as if it were my own.\u201d</p><p>His chest expanded beneath her cheek. \u201cI would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re bottling it up?\u201d Lindsay pul ed back to look up at him. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re not letting me in? You should know I didn\u2019t shield you.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed her head back and looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re torturing yourself over letting me go with Vash,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering what that says about your love for me. But what are you comparing it to? What we have is something no one else wil have. Not just because of who we are as individuals, but because of the obstacles we\u2019re facing together. We\u2019re going to have to take risks\u2014with ourselves and with each other.\u201d</p><p>His irises were flickering blue flames, alien and ancient. Tormented. She wondered how he carried al that roiling emotion inside him, how he hid it behind the smiles he gave her and the stoicism he gave to his Sentinels, how he leashed it when he made love to her and fought battles with clearheaded precision. How she could get him to let it out.</p><p>\u201cI manipulated you, Adrian.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re feeling guilty about Helena.\u201d She tightened her embrace when he jerked against her. \u201cI used it against you to get you to put your Sentinels first and let me go with Vashti to help Elijah.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passed. \u201cThe weakness was mine to exploit. I made it possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for what I did, only for why I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you tel ing me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to,\u201d she said simply, lifting her hand to push his hair back from his forehead. \u201cBecause we\u2019re strongest when we\u2019re one unit. I\u2019m trying to remember that this is al new to you. That you\u2019re trying and you\u2019ve come real y far from the man I met in the Phoenix airport. But I need you to come farther, step closer, let me in. You\u2019re keeping me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d He frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink out loud. When the thoughts are swirling around in your head, give them a voice. Let me hear them. Let me be your sounding board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love me and you need me. I know you have to be strong for the other Sentinels. They lean on you, and if you fal , they fal . But you need to lean on someone, too. That\u2019s where I come in, if you\u2019l let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical y, yes. Damn fine. Emotional y, you\u2019re a wreck.\u201d With her hand at his nape, Lindsay pul ed his mouth down to hers and brushed her lips across his. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done things differently with Helena, Adrian.\u201d</p><p>His hands flexed convulsively against her. \u201cShe came to me for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She came to you for permission. And you told her the truth\u2014you weren\u2019t the guy to ask for it. You broke a law by fal ing in love with Shadoe, then me. Helena wanted you to say it was okay for her to break the law, too, and you couldn\u2019t do that. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t fair for her to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in love, Lindsay. I know how irrational that makes us. I should\u2019ve been more sympathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tel me you weren\u2019t. I know you. It broke your heart when she told you that she\u2019d fal en in love with a lycan. I heard your voice when you cal ed me and, later, when you told me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to separate them. Break them apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the plan,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut you might\u2019ve changed your mind once you saw them together. Or you might have gone through with it. We\u2019l never know. She\u2019ll never know, because she took the option away from you. That was her decision. You can\u2019t go around regretting the actions of someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I forced her hand with my actions?\u201d he shot back, his voice clipped and icy.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Adrian? She asked you for permission to have a romantic relationship with one of her guards and you told her to ask the Big Guy Upstairs. Then she ran away and they kil ed themselves. Where in that series of events are you guilty of forcing her hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew me. She knew what I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You didn\u2019t even know what you were going to do. No...Hang on...Hear me out. You took your time getting to her. You were thinking.</p><p>Debating. Reasoning with yourself. It\u2019s not your fault that we\u2019l never know what could\u2019ve happened if you\u2019d had a choice.\u201d She cupped his face in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. And if Phineas were here, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be tel ing you the exact same thing.\u201d</p><p>A tear clung to his thick bottom lashes. It slipped free. He swiped angrily at it, then stared at his glistening finger with something akin to horror.</p><p>Another tear fel . He whispered brokenly in a language she didn\u2019t understand. When his gaze met hers, Lindsay saw shock. And fear.</p><p>She wondered if he knew that he\u2019d cried the first time they\u2019d made love.</p><p>\u201cNeshama,\u201d she breathed, hugging him tightly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He swal owed hard.</p><p>\u201cYou miss them. I know. You miss them and it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI failed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Shit. No, you didn\u2019t. The system failed. The stupid rules and laws. And your Creator, who\u2019s left you al on your own down here for too long without any guidance or reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>A drop of hot rain splattered on her cheek, another sign of his breaking control.</p><p>He pressed his face into her throat. \u201cHold on to me, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she vowed. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s wings snapped open and they surged into the air, his powerful body flexing against hers as he forced their combined weight into a steep vertical ascent. The effort was nothing for him, no strain at al for muscles he religiously honed for battle. From the cloudless sky, fat drops of sizzling rain struck her like tiny needles, drenching her in seconds.</p><p>Terrified of heights, she buried her face in his chest and hung on, clinging to him so tightly she couldn\u2019t miss that he was sobbing silently. Her heart broke for him, even though she knew he needed to purge in this way. His grief had been pent up inside him, festering, weakening him. She twined her legs with his, clutching at his back beneath his wings and licking the raindrops from his throat and jaw. She murmured nonsensical words of comfort, soothing him as best she could.</p><p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d His mouth sought hers; his lips sealed firmly over hers. His taste was salty from grief, the faint tinge of tears blended with the wet of the rain. The wind whipped through their hair and her heavy, soaked robe.</p><p>They lifted higher and higher.</p><p>Her returning kiss was meant to console, but he wanted more. Needed it. Took it. He ravaged her mouth, his tongue thrusting swift and deep. The clothes between them disappeared, wil ed away by his incredible power. She should have been cold, but he was feverishly hot. And when his hand cupped her breast, her hunger rose to match his, perversely spurred by her terror of heights and her pain over his torment.</p><p>They spun as they rose, twirling in the air. Adrian\u2019s chest heaved from the surfeit of emotion pouring out of him; his lips across her throat were desperate and greedy. He shifted her, positioned her, slid inside her. She cried out, the pleasure so sharp and unexpected. The rain stopped instantly. His head fel back, their ascent slowed until they hovered for a moment, gently turning in the soft light of dawn.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine!\u201d he roared to heavens, his gaze trained skyward. \u201cMy heart. My soul.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes stung, her vision blurred. Then he twisted and turned, aiming them downward.</p><p>They plummeted.</p><p>She screamed and locked her legs around his waist. They fel with dizzying speed, spiraling madly, his wings tucked against his back to give no resistance. Her torso was plastered to his, his steely embrace keeping her immobile. But he wasn\u2019t. His hips were circling, grinding, screwing his cock into her. Fucking her.</p><p>The orgasm slammed into her, the shock of it rippling through her body from head to toe. \u201cAdrian!\u201d</p><p>He groaned, coming hard and deep. Purging his pain and sorrow with hot, wrenching spurts.</p><p>He\u2019s mine, she thought fiercely, as they plunged to the earth in the most intimate of embraces. My heart. My soul. I won\u2019t let you break him.</p><p>Adrian spread his wings and they soared.</p><p>\u201cGrace. It\u2019s good to hear from you.\u201d Syre leaned back in the motel\u2019s vastly uncomfortable desk chair and managed a smile at his iPad, which was streaming a live feed of the doctor and her report. He was sorry to see that she looked haggard and weary, a rare feat for a vampire.</p><p>\u201cThat may actual y be true this time,\u201d she said with a quick flashing smile and a hand shoved through her poorly hacked blond hair. Syre suspected it was a haircut accomplished without the aid of a mirror, just to get it out of her face while she worked.</p><p>Through her camera\u2019s lens, he saw the rows of hospital beds behind her. \u201cI\u2019m always appreciative of good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , how\u2019s this? The blood you sent is a breakthrough.\u201d Her amber eyes brightened. Haircut aside, she was an attractive woman, petite and delicate in feature. \u201cI blended it with samples of wraith-tainted blood and there was a short period of reversal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReversal?\u201d From Lindsay\u2019s blood. No, he corrected himself. Adrian\u2019s blood, filtered through Lindsay.</p><p>\u201cTemporary,\u201d she qualified, \u201cbut that\u2019s the first ray of sunshine to pierce the doom and gloom around here. We could use more\u2014more sunshine, more blood. We got just enough to get excited and not nearly enough to test properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may prove difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l leave that end to you. As for my end, we\u2019re going bal s to the wal . But we\u2019d do a hel of a lot better with an epidemiologist or virologist on board. Got any of those hanging around anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking into it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cVash already hit you up, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d There were very few tricks his second-in-command missed...when she was on her game. \u201cAnd the lycan blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve subjects\u2019 vials. Bril iant, by the way. One or two wouldn\u2019t have been enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l pass along the kudos to Vash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Quick as a whip, that one. She\u2019s a credit to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d He\u2019d trained her wel , having seen the kernel of greatness in her from the very beginning. She was bright and thorough and fil ed with a restless energy that fooled many into thinking she was reckless. She never had been...until the Alpha came along.</p><p>Syre was watching that situation closely. He wouldn\u2019t tolerate Vash\u2019s upheaval for long. A day or two more, and if the lycan didn\u2019t rectify what he was doing to her, Syre would kil him. It would be a waste of a prime hunter, but the Alpha was less valuable if he wasn\u2019t firmly beneath Vashti\u2019s thumb. There was also the possibility that now that the lycans were settled in the warehouse and most were already out in the field, they could turn to vampires for leadership and protection if they lost their Alpha. If not for Vashti\u2019s turmoil, the death of Elijah Reynolds might be ideal... \u201cThe majority of the samples had no effect whatsoever,\u201d Grace went on. \u201cHowever, Subject E is another matter altogether. Whose idea was it to anonymize the samples? Vashti\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He slid his iPhone over and tapped into the cloud, finding the document that linked donor with sample. But he knew who Subject E was before it was confirmed\u2014the Alpha.</p><p>\u201cWel , Subject E is known as FUBAR around here. You want to knock out the wraith population for good, FUBAR\u2019s your man. Or woman. His or her blood is like the Hiroshima bomb to wraiths. Boom, game over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? How?\u201d</p><p>Grace snorted out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m good, but I\u2019m not that good. I got these blood samples yesterday evening. I\u2019ve had just a little over fourteen hours with them. I can give you a \u2018what,\u2019 but it\u2019s going to take more time to work on the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti ran across a wraith with enough brain function to speak coherently. He appeared to be leading a group of other wraiths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Al levity left her face. \u201cEvery wraith I\u2019ve seen has cotton for brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need more than that, Grace.\u201d</p> <p>She scrubbed the back of her neck. \u201cPerhaps the subject had only recently been infected, within a few hours maybe. Not enough time to fry the synapses. Or maybe he\u2019d been infected long enough to kick-start his brain cel s again. I honestly don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t run across anything like that here in the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many questions, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not enough answers. I know. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. And if you can get me more of that blood, it would real y help. Total y the other end of the spectrum there. One annihilates; the other is a possible cure. Knowing you, you\u2019l want both in your arsenal while dealing with this, and I\u2019ve got a friend here I\u2019d like to have back.\u201d</p><p>Syre thought of his daughter-in-law. It was too late for Nikki, but hopeful y others could be saved. \u201cI\u2019l work on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the virologist, please. I\u2019ve got skil s, but this is real y outside my field of expertise.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he ended the cal and exhaled harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know, Adrian?\u201d he murmured softly to himself. \u201cAnd what wil I have to do to get you to tel me about it?\u201d</p><p>Vash raced through the trees, darting and weaving, her heart and limbs pumping strong and steady. Her body was a machine, built for her existence as an angel and sculpted by her life as a warrior. Although she heard the pounding lunges and heaving breaths of the lycan hot on her trail, she didn\u2019t look back. There was no point. It would only slow her down, and knowing where he was or how close he might be wouldn\u2019t make her run faster.</p><p>She\u2019d never been outrun by a lycan. Never. She was too quick, too nimble.</p><p>But she knew Elijah was different. He\u2019d proven that back on the highway, and even while she thought of that, he proved it again.</p><p>She leaped agilely over a fal en log, but he vaulted past her. His front paws dug into the earth and he pivoted, his tail end whipping around 180 degrees.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she hissed.</p> <p>Faced with a wild beast she didn\u2019t have the heart to injure, she sprang and flipped over him. But the leaf-littered forest floor gave her no traction.</p><p>Her feet slipped out from under her. She hit the ground on her bel y and skidded forward, her fingers and toes scrambling for purchase.</p><p>He was on her in a heartbeat, straddling her and catching her by the shoulder with his teeth. His breath was hot and fast, a growl rumbling in his chest. When she tried to move, he shook her gently, his teeth dug in but not breaking the skin. He snarled a warning.</p><p>Vash melted into the ground, completely pliant. Her stomach quivered with something she began to suspect was delight. Perhaps triumph.</p><p>Certainly relief.</p><p>He\u2019d chased her. Captured her.</p><p>Her heart rate kicked up, as did her breathing, reactions her exertions hadn\u2019t been capable of eliciting. She lay prone beneath him, absorbing his warmth into her back, her fingers digging restlessly into the dirt.</p><p>It took several moments before Elijah released her. When he did, it was with another growled admonition to remain unmoving. He gave her a few moments to prove that she would do so without his interference; then he nuzzled her cheek with his wet nose.</p><p>The surprisingly tender gesture had her lifting her head to meet his gaze. \u201cElijah...\u201d</p><p>His lip curled in a snarl. His eyes stil had that primal light burning inside them.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Al right.\u201d She exhaled and relaxed again, her mind trying to work out why she was submitting so meekly. She submitted to no one but Syre and only in certain respects. In many others, she was the dominant. Yes, because he al owed her to be, but stil ...even Char had known to give her the lead.</p><p>She jolted a little when Elijah settled his weight careful y on her, his bel y curving into her spine. He didn\u2019t give her the whole of it, which would have crushed her, but he gave her enough to pin her and make sure she didn\u2019t forget he was there. As if that were possible.</p><p>Vash couldn\u2019t say how long they lay like that\u2014he atop her and quietly panting, gently sniffing her and nudging with his snout. She couldn\u2019t say why it soothed the jagged edges of her mood, edges that had been ripping at her from the inside since he\u2019d shown her the door the day before. She couldn\u2019t say when she realized those edges had been tearing her up for years. She knew only that the equanimity she found in the forest with Elijah exposed an inner torment she hadn\u2019t been aware she was carrying. Anger and hunger for revenge were her constant companions, but the pain had been buried beyond her awareness of it, an ache not noted until it was gone.</p><p>When he shifted forms, she felt the power of it, the ripple that displaced the very space around her. The softness and warmth of rough satin fur morphed into rock-hard muscle and scorching skin. He continued to rub his cheek against her. He continued to pant as if he were exerting himself to his limits.</p><p>Her palms grew damp when she felt the unmistakable length of his erection resting in the seam of her thighs. \u201cElijah...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d His voice was stil guttural. Rough. Sexy as hel . \u201cIsn\u2019t enough...Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, disappointment piercing her like a blade. She wasn\u2019t enough? What they had\u2014whatever it was\u2014wasn\u2019t enough?</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tense,\u201d Elijah gasped, grinding his hips into the plush swel of her buttocks. \u201cDon\u2019t fight. Let me...have you. Make it good...\u201d</p><p>Vash had no defense against the shiver of arousal that rippled through her. \u201cYou want sex? Here? \u201d</p><p>Just the thought made her slick and hungry, the idea that he was so hot for her he couldn\u2019t wait, that he would take her on the ground in a forest like an animal in rut... He adjusted his position, his thighs bracketing hers. Then he straightened, pul ing her up with him. One hand slid between her breasts, a strong hand gripping her throat and pul ing her tight against him. The other reached for the waistband of her stretchy black pants, shoving them down to her knees.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d His words were a tormented moan in her ear. \u201cCan\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t run...\u201d</p><p>Her head fel back into his shoulder when he cupped her between the legs with a shaky hand. She couldn\u2019t stop the circling of her hips into his touch.</p><p>His forehead pressed into her temple. \u201cWet. Thank god...\u201d Bending forward, he urged her back down.</p><p>Her arms stretched out, her palms breaking their fal . With her on her hands and knees, he reached between them and fisted himself, sliding the thick crest of his cock through the moisture coating her cleft...up and down...nudging her clitoris...his body trembling behind her.</p><p>Every muscle in her body was strung tight as a bow, the expectation so thick Vash thought she might snap. She\u2019d wanted this, her hunger for him as elemental a force as her thirst for blood.</p><p>\u201cNeed you. Now,\u201d he growled, rocking her backward to meet the thrust of his entry.</p><p>She screamed at the stretching depth of his possession, the pleasure so fierce her vision blurred. He gave her no time to adjust or steel herself, launching into a primal pounding fuck that used her as a vessel for his lust. A dozen wild thrusts were al it took. His roar reverberated through the forest, sending birds screeching in panicked flight from the trees. He came so hard, she felt it inside her, pulsing hot and thick as he emptied himself in fiery pulses. Her thighs were wet with him when he straightened to his knees, bringing her up to sit in the cradle of his spread thighs.</p><p>He was parting the lips of her sex and rubbing her aching flesh before she could catch her bearings or her breath. Vibrating with the ferocity of her arousal, she shattered into climax with a drawn-out moan of relief, her body clenching and rippling around his spurting erection.</p><p>Then his wrist was at her mouth, offering his franticly throbbing vein. Stil shuddering in orgasm, Vash turned her head away. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>Elijah buried his face in her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She sincerely wanted to reply, but her synapses were fried. And he was stil massaging her clitoris, keeping her hot and needy and so damn ready to come al over again, if she\u2019d ever stopped coming.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t get a grip.\u201d His teeth ground audibly together. \u201cYou ran. I couldn\u2019t think...You have to know, I\u2019d cut off my arm before I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Something vital wel ed up inside her, twining with the understanding of what he was apologizing for\u2014he\u2019d lost control. She shouldn\u2019t have been pleased that his beast responded by marking her in the basest, most animalistic way possible, but apparently she was perverse in that way. Oh wel . If their fights always ended with him coming inside her, she could live with it.</p><p>But his guilt had to go.</p><p>When he pushed his wrist at her again, she shoved his arm out of her face, insulted. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>Elijah lifted her careful y off of him, no easy task when he was stil hard and thick. She let him. Let him throw himself backward into the leaf litter with a forearm tossed across his eyes. Let him ramble hoarsely about her needing to eat and him finding some way to let her do that, since she wouldn\u2019t drink from him...not that he blamed her...he was out of control, losing his mind\u2014 As he muttered to himself, Vash swiftly and silently pul ed off her boots and her clothes. Until she was naked. In the woods. With a lycan. What the hel was the world coming to?</p><p>\u201cElijah,\u201d she purred, crawling over him. \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>She watched his breath catch, then heard it leave him in a rush as she sank back onto him, seizing the intimate connection she craved. His cock was slick with semen cooled by the air, making him cold and hard as marble inside her. He jackknifed upward with a growl, and she caught him with her arms around his neck, meeting him eye to eye.</p><p>\u201cI see shrinkage isn\u2019t a problem for you,\u201d she said drily, noting how his eyes were stil feverishly bright. He was savagely gorgeous. Flushed and disheveled and glistening with sweat. She could stil smel the animal on him and her sex tightened in primitive appreciation. It was so similar to the scent she\u2019d loathed viciously for so long, yet none of her painful past touched him. She stopped debating why and just...accepted it.</p><p>\u201cVashti, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014offended me. Oh, not with the wild animal sex,\u201d she assured him, seeing the torment that crossed his features. \u201cFor offering me your wrist, which\u2014if you didn\u2019t know\u2014is the most impersonal way to give blood to a vampire. I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re beyond that. And if we\u2019re not, we need to work on getting beyond it.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her like steel bands. \u201cBeyond ditching me when you\u2019re scared? Beyond apologizing for some stupid shit instead of the real issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She pushed her fingers into his hair because she knew how much he enjoyed it. Also because she needed to soothe the beast so she could work things out with the man. \u201cYou bounce back quick. I think I liked you better contrite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl or nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice? I\u2019m thinking you\u2019l just chase me if I run.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed, studying her. After a moment, his nostrils flared and he accused, \u201cYou liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I didn\u2019t. You\u2019re the one who kicked me to the curb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho started it?\u201d Elijah\u2019s voice was ominously neutral.</p><p>She swal owed, her eyes sliding away to find the powerful y steady pulse in his corded neck.</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d He shook her a little. \u201cTalk to me. What are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot back to his and she scowled. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf sex is al you want, I\u2019l point out that there are other options that aren\u2019t such a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Himeko?\u201d</p><p>His grin was slow and purely male. \u201cFeeling territorial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fabulous that you\u2019re enjoying my confusion and misery,\u201d she groused. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve already screwed this to hel and back trying to pick my way through on my own. You need to tel me what you want from me. Then I can tel you if I can give it to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA commitment.\u201d</p><p>There was a fluttering panic in her stomach. \u201cWhat kind of commitment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething beyond being a joystick you like to ride when the mood strikes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Vash tried to refocus after feeling Elijah\u2019s \u201cjoystick\u201d flex inside her when referenced to. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk. I know you\u2019re just into me for my tits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019l deal.

Exclusivity and convenience tied in a lot of different things, she knew, but she stil had to ask.</p><p>His gaze was steady, al human, and infinitely patient. \u201cWhat more can you live with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel ...\u201d She ran a hand through her hair. \u201cI can\u2019t live with the cold shoulder. Made me crazy. You were such an ass yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the ass?\u201d</p> <p>She sighed and knew she had to lay it al out there or risk losing him. The beast might be infatuated, but the man wasn\u2019t the type to be strung along. \u201cI want you. Not just for the sex, but for you. I respect you. I respect how you are with your people. But that\u2019s exactly why I can\u2019t keep you. And I\u2019m afraid to want you more. I\u2019m afraid to get hurt again.\u201d</p><p>He reached up with both hands and brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about my responsibilities as an Alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me you\u2019re not,\u201d she shot back. \u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t, you should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m wondering if there hasn\u2019t been a big fucking mistake. This makes twice now I\u2019ve lost it over you.\u201d</p><p>Vash frowned. \u201cWhen was the other time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter when. It happened.\u201d His firm, beautiful y shaped mouth brushed across hers. \u201cThe hunt began the moment I first saw you. It won\u2019t end until you admit you\u2019re mine or I stop breathing. That\u2019s what the beast wants and what I want it to have. As for the man, I admire your strength and your courage. I\u2019m grateful for your advice and that you\u2019ve always been wil ing to share it with me. I\u2019m addicted to your body, but I also enjoy just being with you. You\u2019re the perfect amount of crazy for me. There\u2019s never a dul moment with you, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned into him, something inside her cracking open at what he was saying. Her body tightened around him, hugging him from the inside.</p><p>He growled softly. \u201cI could come again just like this. Just holding you and being held by you. Even if I go on as the Alpha, I couldn\u2019t pretend to take on a mate now. The thought of being intimate with another woman repulses me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed as relief and tenderness flooded her. \u201cThere was only Char. Then you. I want this to work. I want to make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo commit to this, Vashti\u2014sleeping together, working together, staying together. None of which is anyone else\u2019s business. We just have to talk to each other and make each other a priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lycan alive who doesn\u2019t want to kil me, including you sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there are very few vamps who wouldn\u2019t put me down if they thought they could get away with it. Every relationship has its problems and hostile in-laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! You\u2019re a riot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m stubborn and arrogant.\u201d He nipped her lower lip between even, white teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Vash. I dare anyone to chal enge me otherwise. Even you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou suck.\u201d Her mouth tingled deliciously; the flavor of him spread richly across her tongue. \u201cYou knew what you were doing to me yesterday and last night. You knew it would break me down to lose you, that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAnd kicked myself with doubts about drawing a line I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d cross. When I offered my room last night and you didn\u2019t take it, I could\u2019ve strangled you. You tore into a hotel room in a territorial rage, but you wouldn\u2019t take that one step I needed you to take. I started to think there was no way to have you the way I need you. Then you came to me at breakfast and I was too damn close to tel ing you I\u2019d take whatever I could get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too damn close to begging you to stop punishing me.\u201d Her vision blurred and she turned her head. \u201cYou shut me out. It...hurt. I hate hurting.</p><p>It makes me crazy. Crazier.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled and leaned into her. \u201cYou\u2019re damned stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Stung by the truth, she said, \u201cAnd you\u2019re rol ing over and exposing your bel y without much of a fight, puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here before, with Charron. Of course you\u2019d be wary of putting yourself out there again and making yourself vulnerable. This is new to me. I\u2019ve never had this, and I want it. I can\u2019t imagine not having it. Not having you.\u201d</p><p>Vash pressed her palm over his strongly beating heart. \u201cHas it occurred to you that I might be seducing you and making you care so you won\u2019t be able to kil me?\u201d</p><p>He covered her hand with his. \u201cWhat kind of asshole do you take me for? Think I could nail you six ways from Sunday, then nail you again with a stake? I let that go before we went at each other in the warehouse. Micah\u2019s dead. What you did to him was wrong, because your assumptions about me were wrong. But I can\u2019t say I would\u2019ve acted differently. If I kil you on his behalf, I\u2019d just be doing exactly what you did to him for Nikki\u2019s sake. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that won\u2019t bring either of them back, but would destroy both of us.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled into his neck, breathing him in. \u201cSome wil ask that question and ascribe that motive to me. More wil think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo...\u201d she crooned, nibbling behind his ear. \u201cWe have a deal: exclusivity and convenience. You fuck no one but me.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s hands cupped her shoulder blades, keeping her close. He tilted his head to the side, giving her total access to the thick artery in his neck that carried his life\u2019s blood. Such a submissive gesture by so dominant a male\u2014one that came at great cost, she knew\u2014stirred her blood. The hunter in her stretched in anticipation, while the woman in her melted.</p><p>With perfectly gauged strokes of her tongue, Vash expertly plumped his vein. She felt him swal ow hard and she smiled. \u201cDid you know a vampire\u2019s bite can give the sweetest sexual ecstasy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I won\u2019t let you feed off anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too far gone to see to your pleasure in Vegas. I\u2019m sorry for that. I want to please you, Elijah. I want to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I got mine in Vegas.\u201d His hands, those warm and wonderful hands, slid down her back and cupped her buttocks, rocking her onto his raging erection. \u201cAnd you please me al the time, in so many ways. But if you want to make it up to me anyway, I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d As she dragged her fangs delicately across his throat, she couldn\u2019t fail to feel the fine tremors rippling through him. \u201cYou\u2019re an apex predator, and you\u2019re about to be another predator\u2019s snack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man,\u201d he retorted gruffly, \u201cwho\u2019s about to lie back, relax, and enjoy his woman riding him to a mind-blowing orgasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you chauvinist,\u201d she scolded with laughter in her voice. But her smile faded when she pul ed back to look at him. His face was etched into tense lines and his eyes, those jeweled eyes that saw right through her, were aglow. The man could tease, but the beast inside him was struggling with being food for another being. She gentled him with soothing strokes of her hands through his hair. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Elijah. I can take a wrist from someone else. Quick and clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman, if you prefer. We could go to a den. You could fuck me while I feed. It might turn you on to watch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn you.\u201d His voice was deep and rumbling, nearly a snarl. He caught her by the back of the neck and yanked her to his throat. \u201cI\u2019l be the one who gives you what you need. Do it.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she sucked in a deep, shaky breath and found her focus. His pleasure was more paramount than her need to eat, because she understood the gift he was giving her and how much it violated the very core of the predator he was. Taking pleasure from penetration took time for an Alpha male to adjust to. Some never did. She couldn\u2019t bear for Elijah to regret feeding her. And if she was honest, she would admit she hoped he\u2019d enjoy it enough to want to do it again. To ask her to do it to him.</p><p>Vash licked her dry lips and parted them, her tongue stroking along the vein in a lover\u2019s caress. Twining her arms around his torso, she distracted him with the press of her breasts into his chest. Then she struck, sliding her fangs into the wildly pumping surge of rich, intoxicating blood.</p><p>He cursed and stiffened, then groaned as the rhythmic pul of her mouth was echoed by her sex around his cock. Holding his head motionless with one arm wrapped around his nape, she ran her other hand up and down his rigid back. She withdrew her fangs and licked the wound closed, sucking softly on his skin. Her mouth brushed along his throat, nibbling and kissing. When he relaxed, she struck again in a different place, sinking her fangs deep. Her cheeks hol owed on a long, drawing pul as he began to come.</p><p>He hissed, grinding her hips onto him, spil ing into her.</p><p>Drunk on him, she fel into the memories carried by his blood, selfishly seeking out his thoughts of her\u2014the possessiveness, the pleasure, the pain. In return, she flooded his mind with her own thoughts of him. Making him see how he felt inside her, the fire that burned through her when she looked at him, the deep respect and admiration he inspired in her, and the ache that only his passion could sate.</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d He jolted as she milked him into another climax, his big body shuddering as she came along with him, delicate muscles gripping him in the most intimate of embraces. Raw sounds of pleasure vibrated from his throat against her lips, rough groans of desire, a craving that was never ful y appeased.</p><p>Her hunger quenched, Vash retracted her fangs and sealed the twin punctures, massaging the vein that hammered with his roaring blood. With her hands on his shoulders, she shoved him back, her mouth curving as he sprawled beneath her. He was panting, his eyes bright and hot. Leaning over him, she raked her nails down his chest and lifted her hips, then lowered again, stroking his length with the slick clasp of her body.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the words this time around. She\u2019d had them with Char. She\u2019d had them as an angel. But she didn\u2019t have them now, with him.</p><p>They were bottled up in her throat, burning.</p><p>But the beauty of Elijah was that he didn\u2019t need them. He knew. He accepted her and wanted her the way she was. He grasped that her body could say al the things she couldn\u2019t voice aloud. Her vampire body, which so perfectly connected to the primal sexuality of her lycan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTake what you need,\u201d he said gruffly, understanding. \u201cWhatever you need. And give me everything in return.\u201d</p><p>She caught her bottom lip between her teeth, riding him slow and sure, absorbing the powerful shock of pleasure every time she took him to the hilt. \u201cI need you to come again. I need to feel it inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man,\u201d he pointed out, clearly amused. \u201cThere\u2019s only so often I can do this without recovery time.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved in a slow, delighted smile. \u201cYou\u2019re stil hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stil naked and fucking me.\u201d He cupped her breasts, rol ing and tugging her painful y tight nipples with his forefingers and thumbs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m getting mine watching you get yours. Feeling you squeezing me like a fist. A hot, tight, perfect little fist. An orgasm is a just a bonus when the ride is this good.\u201d</p><p>Vash straightened and ran her splayed hands down his taut pectorals and rippling abs. Pine needles dug into her knees, but she didn\u2019t care. She had him again, right where she needed him\u2014with her, connected to her, with nothing at al between them. No rank, no roles, no half truths or evasions. They were as bared as they would ever be. Committed. He was hers; she could make that claim now. And she was proud to be his.</p><p>\u201cOnce more,\u201d she coaxed, rol ing her hips. \u201cFor me. I want to come again, Elijah, but I can\u2019t without you.\u201d</p><p>Arching up, he wrapped himself around her and rol ed, taking her beneath him. His forearms buffered her shoulders and back from the prickly ground, once again displaying the awareness and consideration that she so admired.</p><p>She was pinned yet cushioned as he took over, sliding in and out, his powerful muscles flexing and contracting against her. His eyes stayed on hers, his searching gaze more intimate than even the erotic flux and flow of his body\u2019s possession of hers.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>Her neck arched as her senses overloaded. She couldn\u2019t see, could barely hear beyond the rushing of blood in her ears.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Vashti,\u201d he purred darkly with his lips to her throat, his breath gusting hotly over her skin. \u201cSay it and I\u2019l come for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she gasped, wrapping her legs around him. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Cleansed and strengthened, Adrian slowly lowered into the backyard with a limp and satiated Lindsay in his arms. For the first time in days, he was thinking clearly, and he was grateful for that when he spotted an unknown car in the driveway. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay lifted her head from his chest. \u201cCan you do that mind-flashy-thingy and put some real clothes on me?\u201d</p><p>He thought of the clothes she\u2019d packed for the trip and wil ed a pair of black pants and an off-the-shoulder T-shirt on her. For himself, he went with slacks and an untucked white dress shirt. He was rol ing up the sleeves as he moved to open the back door for his mate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou forgot my underwear,\u201d she whispered fiercely as they stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>His mouth curved. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Their guest was waiting in the living room, laughing over something shared with his guards. The two lycans stood at attention when he entered the room, but the lovely Asian woman who\u2019d been entertaining them rose to her feet much more leisurely. Dressed in a pinstripe pencil skirt, silk blouse, and Louboutins, Raguel Gadara\u2019s messenger was dressed for her secular life. In her celestial one, she favored worn jeans, a 9mm, and Doc Martens.</p><p>\u201cEvangeline.\u201d Adrian greeted her, clasping her extended hands and sifting through her thoughts via that connection, learning al he needed to know. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cYou say that so smoothly, I could almost believe you.\u201d</p><p>He pivoted to bring Lindsay into the conversation. \u201cLindsay, meet Evangeline Hol is. Eve\u2019s presently overseeing the interior design of the Mondego casino. Eve, Lindsay was briefly the assistant manager of Raguel\u2019s Bel adonna property in Anaheim. Now she\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Eve shook Lindsay\u2019s hand. \u201cCount yourself lucky to have dodged the bul et of working for Gadara.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay frowned, confused by the other woman\u2019s statement because she didn\u2019t yet know that Gadara\u2019s underlings were conscripted rather than indentured like the lycans. Adrian would catch her up later.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you by?\u201d he asked Eve, diverting the conversation from explanations he didn\u2019t want to get into now.</p> <p>She pointed at the tiny biohazard cooler at her feet. \u201cArchangel blood. I watched Gadara draw it and place it inside. He said you\u2019d believe me that he hadn\u2019t tampered with it or made a switch. I figured you\u2019d mind-rape me when you touched me and prove it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so wel .\u201d</p><p>Eve laughed, but her dark gaze was hard. \u201cThere\u2019s some comfort in knowing most angels are predictable.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay looked at the cooler. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Gadara give us the blood when we asked for it yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl,\u201d Eve and Adrian responded simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cHel ,\u201d Lindsay muttered. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn a way it is,\u201d Eve explained. \u201cA game Gadara doesn\u2019t want Adrian to lose, but he doesn\u2019t want Adrian to win without his help. Ambition is the Achil es\u2019 heel of every archangel. In this case, Gadara knew he had the upper hand because it was his blood to give...or not. He just wanted to make sure Adrian knew it, and that Adrian understands he now owes Gadara something for giving it up\u2014it\u2019s always good to have a favor from a seraph in your pocket.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay looked at Adrian. \u201cWel , shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you, neshama,\u201d he teased her. \u201cYou have an entire seraph in your...pocket.\u201d</p><p>She shoved at his shoulder. \u201cWhy not come himself and rub it in?\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s mouth twisted rueful y. \u201cTo put me in my place while insulting Adrian by sending an emissary from the bottom of the totem pole. Two birds, one stone. He\u2019s good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it irritate him,\u201d Adrian murmured, \u201cif he knew how delighted I was instead?\u201d</p><p>Eve shot a deliberate glance at the two lycans. \u201cThere are rumors. I\u2019ve heard a large portion of your workforce has gone on strike. Gadara\u2019s hoping to step in and help you out with that, of course. But if you\u2019re looking to avoid his hefty commission and don\u2019t mind working with grunts under the table, I can get you some referrals. Just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Adrian deciphered the message clearly and was grateful for it. His Sentinels weren\u2019t completely hanging in the wind without his lycan \u201cworkforce.\u201d</p> <p>There was help available, if he decided they needed it. Whether or not he did anything with that knowledge wasn\u2019t as important as possessing it to begin with.</p><p>Eve moved toward the door. \u201cI brought your paper in,\u201d she said, gesturing at the folded newspaper in a plastic bag dotted with morning dew. \u201cAnd you should have someone pul your trash cans off the curb. I figured you\u2019re probably not used to worrying about that at Angels\u2019 Point, but some neighborhoods penalize residents who leave them out after trash day. Mortal lives are a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the newspaper as the door shut behind her. Air-conditioning...newspapers...trash... \u201cSomeone\u2019s been staying here,\u201d Lindsay muttered. \u201cWe lost track of that with Vashti showing up, but she wouldn\u2019t mind the heat, would she? She wouldn\u2019t even think about messing with the AC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would dare use someone else\u2019s place like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not daring,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s desperation. Navajo Lake is only a few hours\u2019 drive away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The compassion in her eyes stirred his soul.</p><p>He could stay and wait them out, but if they feared reprisal, they\u2019d steer clear. They would need reassurance of a different sort.</p><p>Glancing at the two lycans, he said, \u201cBen. Andrew. I\u2019m going to leave you two here. You can deal with the situation. Bring whoever it is back to Angels\u2019 Point, if that\u2019s what they want. If not, let them know this property is going up for sale next week.\u201d</p><p>The two guards were quiet a moment. Then one nodded; the other smiled. \u201cThank you, Adrian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrusting us,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cAnd taking us back,\u201d Andrew added.</p><p>Adrian looked at Lindsay, at a loss for what to say. Her encouraging smile got him back on track. \u201cLet\u2019s pack up and get to the airport. We need to get these samples to Siobh\u00e1n.\u201d</p><p>She reached for his hand and squeezed. He wondered if she knew what that simple gesture meant to him, how much love and support it conveyed, how quickly he\u2019d come to depend on it. On her.</p><p>He\u2019d come to Vegas for blood and was leaving with something far more precious\u2014a deeper connection to the woman who held his heart. In the chaos of his life, facing terrible odds and even more horrifying decisions, Lindsay was his light in the darkness. Shining even when he couldn\u2019t see her.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 creepy,\u201d Raze muttered, crossing his arms as he leaned into the side of Vash\u2019s rental. \u201cQuiet as a damn tomb.\u201d</p><p>Elijah glanced at the vampire and nodded grimly, in accord with the sentiment. His skin was crawling. They\u2019d split up and surrounded the residential subdivision, then worked their way inward, looking for any signs of life. What they\u2019d found was nothing. Nothing at al .</p><p>\u201cWhere are the newspapers?\u201d Vash asked, moving restlessly. \u201cThe mail? The overgrown lawns? You can\u2019t have an entire neighborhood disappear and not leave a trail that someone can fol ow.\u201d</p><p>Syre opened the back of the Explorer and began pul ing out weapons. \u201cHow do you suggest handling this, Vashti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo vamps on vantage point\u2014rooftops, each end of the subdivision. Then three teams: one wil take the homes in the center while the other two come around the outer circle on opposite sides. We pick this place apart home by home. The lycans can do the walk-throughs for occupants, while the vamps work on gathering physical data. There has to be a loose thread to pul somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl right.\u201d He looked at two of the vamps he\u2019d brought with him. \u201cCrash and Lyric, you two are on point. Anything makes a run for it, take it down.\u201d</p><p>The two minions each selected a weapon and moved off, their bodies freshly fortified against the noonday sun by Fal en blood.</p><p>Elijah waited for further instructions, grateful for the dark sunglasses that hid how he watched Vashti. Her hair was restrained in a ponytail, her body encased in her customary black\u2014the pants he\u2019d shoved down her thighs earlier, paired with a leather vest that zipped from navel to cleavage.</p><p>Her creamy skin and bril iant amber eyes captivated him, as everything about her did. His woman. So beautiful and infinitely deadly. A warrior whom other warriors fol owed into battle without question. He adored and valued her, even while she was driving him crazy.</p><p>She divided the remaining five vampires into teams of two, two, and one, then turned to him for guidance on how the four lycans should be divided. He put Luke and Trey with the teams of two vamps, and put Himeko under his watch. She could handle herself, but he\u2019d lived\u2014barely\u2014 through the Las Vegas attack. If they were facing something like that again, he wanted to be the one who had her back.</p><p>He and the other lycans began to undress. He pul ed his shirt over his head and tossed it into the cargo space of the Explorer. Then he toed off his boots and yanked his button fly open.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Vashti snapped, having paused with her katana harness in hand.</p><p>Brows lifting, he looked at her. \u201cArmoring up, like you.\u201d</p><p>The others continued to shed clothes and the vampires resumed the process of strapping weapons to their bodies, but he was keenly aware of their poorly disguised interest in his conversation.</p><p>Vash\u2019s gaze darted from his open fly, to Himeko, who was now in bra and panties, then back to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting naked here.\u201d</p><p>Himeko snorted and unclasped her bra. \u201cNudity is part of what we are. Get used to it, bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Crash said, shooting a glance at her bared breasts. \u201cGreat way to kick off a hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Vash rounded on Himeko. \u201cAnd you. You\u2019ve already seen what you\u2019re going to see of him in your lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Himeko smiled coldly. \u201cThere\u2019l be others. Women with fur instead of fangs.\u201d</p><p>Vash twirled one of her katanas in a graceful arc. \u201cTry me, bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti\u2014\u201d Elijah sighed, knowing tempers were high. The thril of the hunt was part of that serrated edge, but so too were Micah and Rachel\u2019s ghosts. Animosity lurked beneath the untried and tentative truce between vampires and lycans. Keeping that enmity under wraps was a priority now, considering they were about to rely on each other in a possible life-or-death situation.</p><p>\u201cI can get naked, too,\u201d she shot at him. \u201cStart a new trend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same thing and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Her arched brow chal enged him, as did her fingers on the pul of her zipper.</p><p>Shooting her a look that spoke volumes, he rounded the front of the Explorer and shifted, returning a moment later with his jeans between his teeth. He dropped them at her feet.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She picked them up and threw them into the cargo space with the rest of the clothes. Then she strapped on her blades, gave a nod to Syre\u2014who sported a wicked-looking repeating crossbow\u2014and they flowed outward from the vehicles to begin the hunt.</p><p>Elijah wasn\u2019t surprised when Vashti joined him and Himeko, but it was a circumstance that was far from ideal. Keeping an eye on either headstrong woman was tough enough. Having two of them at odds with each other made it dangerous.</p><p>The tension between the three of them was forgotten the moment they entered the first house. The two-story single-family dwel ing was comfortably furnished and welcoming. There were no signs of disturbance. In fact, he could almost think it was a model home, everything being in its proper place...including the family photos on the mantel. He looked at them, noting youthful parents and three children, the smal est being an infant.</p><p>Loping up the stairs, he searched the bedrooms. There, he found signs of life\u2014rumpled beds, children\u2019s toys scattered on the floor, clothes spil ing from hampers. There was a trash can in the baby\u2019s room that had a soiled diaper in it, and a bottle of rotting formula lay half ful in the crib.</p><p>Vash entered the nursery behind him. \u201cThere are messages on the voice mail. Cal s from the dad\u2019s work asking where he\u2019s been. Same with the mom and a carpool she\u2019s got going for the kids. Looks like we\u2019re on day four now.\u201d</p><p>The next several homes were more of the same. By the eighth house, Elijah decided to check the backyard as wel . As with the other homes, Vash joined him after only a few moments. It struck him then that she was hovering.</p><p>He growled at her, but she played it cool. Stil , he read the anxiety in her body language\u2014she was afraid to let him do his job.</p><p>Shifting, he confronted her. \u201cStop smothering me.\u201d</p><p>She scowled and blocked the view from the house with her body. \u201cPut your damn fur back on before Himeko comes out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake. Nudity doesn\u2019t automatical y equate to sex in a lycan\u2019s mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s female. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, they drool al over you when you\u2019re clothed. When you\u2019re like this\u201d\u2014she gestured at his body with an impatient wave of her hand\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re asking to be molested.\u201d</p><p>His nose twitched as he smel ed the first tendrils of her arousal. \u201cAgain? On a hunt? Jesus, you\u2019re going to screw me to death.\u201d</p><p>She flushed and shifted restlessly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me hot and bothered, don\u2019t run around naked!\u201d</p><p>Softened by her obvious embarrassment and understanding how helpless they both were against the pul between them, he said more gently, \u201cI don\u2019t need a bodyguard, Vashti. Go do your thing; let me do mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that as if it\u2019s easy. Those fuckers want you worse than the damn women do! I watched them tear you to pieces once. I won\u2019t do it again. I c-can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVash.\u201d His throat tightened at the pain he saw on her beautiful face. \u201cSweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She glared at him. So fierce and strong, yet fragile. \u201cYou got me into this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mess?\u201d But he knew. And if they\u2019d been anywhere else, he would have kissed her senseless.</p><p>\u201cThis mess!\u201d She waved an impatient hand between them. \u201cYou and me. Us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you? A parrot? Yes, us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a mess?\u201d It was very hard not to smile.</p><p>\u201cWe were last night.\u201d She ran her gaze over him from head to toe and sighed. \u201cBut we\u2019re okay now. When you\u2019re not tel ing me not to worry about you or trying to share your naked body with the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI share my body with no one but you, my crazy vampress. God. I adore you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming!\u201d Vash hissed, stepping closer to shield him. \u201cIf she sees your family jewels, I\u2019m gonna have to kil her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nuts, you know that? Certifiably insane.\u201d And he was crazy, too. About her. He shifted back and spun away from her.</p><p>When Himeko darted out of the house at a ful run, he directed her to scout one side of the yard while he handled the other. He sniffed out a dog buried in the far corner, which was confirmed by a little headstone, but he found nothing out of the ordinary. Himeko, however, whined and began scratching at the dirt.</p><p>He joined her, and they dug through fresh sod to find potting soil covering a layer of quicklime. Three feet down they discovered what was left of a child\u2019s body, identifiable as such only by the size of the bones. They both leaped back in horror.</p><p>\u201cOh man,\u201d Vashti breathed, her hand going to her stomach as the stench broke through the disrupted lime. \u201cFucking wraiths.\u201d</p> <p>Mindless, my ass, Elijah thought grimly. The burial was proof of intel igence and clear, cold calculation. He looked at Vashti, frustrated that they couldn\u2019t converse while he was in his lycan form, a connection that could exist\u2014if they were a mated pair.</p><p>Vash turned away and spoke without raising her voice. \u201cSyre. Raze. Have the lycans check the backyards.\u201d</p><p>He heard the quaver in her words and sensed her disquiet. She was horrified and disturbed by the discovery, shaken. He went to her, brushing gently along her hip in a gesture of comfort.</p><p>She scratched absently behind his ear. \u201cHow many wraiths would it take to wipe out a whole neighborhood? How much time would pass?</p><p>Because if it was more than a few hours, they\u2019d have to be cunning to avoid detection and I\u2019ve only seen one wraith who had any working brain cel s.\u201d</p><p>Raze\u2019s curse from across the neighborhood caused Elijah\u2019s ears to twitch. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a body in the yard. Damn it...it\u2019s a child\u2019s corpse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere as wel ,\u201d Syre said harshly. \u201cNo sign or evidence of the parent\u2014a single mother, I gather, from the mail and photos in the house.\u201d</p><p>Elijah returned to the grave and began to dig deeper, growling at Vash when she tried to assist him. He couldn\u2019t protect her from everything, but this, at least, was a grisly task he could spare her from.</p><p>In the end, he found three bodies, al children.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the adults?\u201d Vashti asked, fol owing him over to the coiled-up water hose, which she turned on to spray him off.</p><p>Raze\u2019s voice crossed the distance between them. \u201cNothing found on the next property. No children in the household. Looks like two males lived here. Neither body is in the yard.\u201d</p><p>Elijah led the way through the house and back out to the street. He was moving on to the next property when Syre spoke. \u201cI saw movement in a window here in my sector. Drapes are drawn, so I can\u2019t see inside.\u201d</p><p>Vash broke into a run. \u201cHold until we get there.\u201d</p><p>Raze met them at the house. Without a word, he led his team to the side-yard gate and they slipped into the back.</p> <p>Staring at the home from the sidewalk, Elijah watched the upper windows and saw the curtains shift softly, as if with a breeze, but he heard neither the hum of an air-conditioning unit nor a fan. He also didn\u2019t hear breathing or movement, which raised his hackles. What the fuck were they dealing with?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vash muttered. \u201cI\u2019d rather smoke \u2019em out than go in. But the flames would bring fire crews, and then we\u2019d have mortals involved.\u201d</p><p>Syre surveyed the exterior. \u201cMy team wil take the upper windows. Your lycans can enter from the bottom floor. Ready?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Vash leaped onto the side of the house and scrambled up like a spider. Syre did the same. Elijah took one side of the house; Luke took the other. Himeko remained on point at the front, while Thomas waited in the rear.</p><p>\u201cOn three,\u201d Raze whispered, his voice drifting on the wind. \u201cOne, two...\u201d</p><p>Elijah lunged through the nearest window, entering the house in a shower of glass. He\u2019d scarcely registered that he\u2019d landed in a smal home office when he slammed into the closet door, unable to gain purchase on carpet slickened by a viscous substance. Shaking off the col ision, he registered what coated the floor\u2014the black, oily residue left behind when wraith bodies decomposed.</p><p>Himeko\u2019s frantic barking spurred him into action. He careened out into the hal way, skidding into the wal and denting it before finding traction in the unsoiled carpet. He leaped into a family room, where Himeko and Thomas were covered in wraiths. With a roar of fury, he lunged into the fray, grabbing a wraith by the neck and snapping it as he tossed the body aside like a dol \u2019s.</p><p>The repetitious report of a pistol cracked through the room as one of the vamps emptied his clip into the writhing bodies ringing the edges of the huddle. Raze waded in through the sliding-glass door, yanking wraiths up by the hair and severing heads with his blade. Elijah was tackled from the side. Fangs bit into his flank. Snarling, he kicked with his hind legs, his claws raking into the thigh of his attacker. The wraith lost its grip and fel away. Elijah turned and crouched to retaliate, aiming for the Navy anchor tattoo that decorated the pale-as-milk flesh over the wraith\u2019s heart... \u201cVashti!\u201d</p><p>Syre\u2019s shout pierced Elijah like a silver bul et. Abandoning his attacker, he bounded up the stairs. He reached the second floor and hit a wal of wraiths, the teeming mass of gray bodies clogging the narrow space. A glint of light on a flashing blade drew his attention to the ceiling, where Vash clung upside down with a one-handed grip. Her free arm slashed a katana at the upraised hands that clawed at her, trying to pul her loose.</p><p>Fear for her made him frantic, sending him scrambling over shoulders and heads to reach her.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, Alpha,\u201d a voice hissed. His rear leg was caught in a vicelike grip, and he was yanked into a room with the sickening crack of breaking bone.</p><p>He howled against the searing pain, his gut churning as the door was kicked shut, blocking him from helping Vash. Favoring the oddly bent limb, he faced his attacker. She tossed back silken strands of crimson hair and set her hands on black leather-clad hips. For a split second, Elijah thought he faced Vashti; then the differences came into focus through the fog of pain. The woman was too lean. Her features harsh and less refined.</p><p>And her eyes were lit with a sick, mad light.</p><p>She withdrew a gun from the holster strapped to her thigh and grinned, revealing wicked fangs. \u201cBye-bye, lover,\u201d she crooned.</p><p>The door crashed in behind her, the paneled particleboard breaking free at the hinge and slamming into the vampress\u2019s back. The pistol went off, the shot going wide. Vash leaped through the decimated door as Elijah charged the lookalike, catching her by the arm and snapping bone in his jaws, making her drop the gun.</p><p>Vash kicked at the wraith who ran into the room behind her, then grabbed the vampress by the hair and yanked her upright. There was a heartbeat of stunned silence as the two women looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Vash barked.</p><p>Laughing, the vampress dug in her heels and leaped out the window, leaving Vash fisting a mass of hair ripped out at the root. Elijah made the jump after their quarry, yelping as his broken limb was jarred by his landing on the lawn. He chased her on three legs, nearly catching her by the ankle the moment before she vaulted over the eight-foot fence that enclosed the backyard.</p><p>Shots rang out. He heard a shout from the rooftops as one of the vamps on point joined the pursuit.</p><p>Unable to make the same jump in his condition, Elijah barreled through the wooden planks, breaking through to the backyard of the house on the other side. In the distance, he heard Vashti shouting after him, but he didn\u2019t slow or look back, driven by the memory of tiny child bones scored by fangs.</p><p>The vampress jumped over a side-yard gate to reach the front yard, and Elijah rammed through that barrier as wel , so close to snaring her that he could almost taste her. His jaws were open and his lips pul ed back in a snarl. So close... She kicked off the ground and landed in the back of a pickup truck idling at the curb. The vehicle took off with squealing tires, choking Elijah with the acrid smoke of burning rubber. From the rooftop, Crash maintained suppressive fire, shattering the windshield with a barrage of bul ets. The vampress gripped the rol bar and ducked, laughing.</p><p>Elijah continued to give chase, despite the added agony of moving from lawn to unforgiving concrete. The truck slowed to round the corner at the end of the street, and he cal ed on reserves of strength to eke out a fraction more speed.</p><p>The vehicle exploded.</p><p>The blast was so violent it sent him hurtling backward. He tumbled across the yard, howling in frustration, his ears ringing. Vashti skidded across the grass on her knees and pul ed him into her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat...? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Syre stared at the shivering minion who lay on the blood and oil-soaked family-room floor. Around him, wraiths who\u2019d survived the melee were staked to the floor with silver-coated blades through their palms. They were far from lucid. Hissing and snapping, they writhed for freedom.</p><p>Vashti appeared at the shattered rear sliding-glass door, supporting the weight of the limping Alpha who\u2019d shifted into human form and donned his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel just happened here?\u201d Syre growled.</p><p>Elijah halted abruptly, causing Vash to stumble and curse. He pointed at the confused but sane minion. \u201cThat fucker bit me. As a wraith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you people?\u201d the minion sobbed. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>Vashti looked at Syre before helping Elijah to a chair. \u201cMy head is going to explode if something doesn\u2019t make sense here real y damn quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are Raze and Crash?\u201d Syre asked, having taken a quick head count.</p><p>\u201cPutting out a car fire on the street before it attracts attention.\u201d She straightened. \u201cDamn it. I wanted that bitch alive.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched in silent inquiry.</p><p>\u201cThe vampress who kil ed Lindsay\u2019s mother,\u201d Elijah explained. He looked at Vash. \u201cThere\u2019s no way her appearance wasn\u2019t deliberately styled to mimic you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cShe had roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hair. The roots were brown; I noticed when I ripped out a chunk of it. And I\u2019m pretty sure her tits were silicone. They were like Princess Leia buns glued to her chest.\u201d</p><p>Restlessness forced Syre into the pacing that was normal y Vashti\u2019s trait. The blood you sent is a breakthrough, Grace had said. I blended it with samples of wraith-tainted blood and there was a short period of reversal.</p><p>Adrian\u2019s blood, filtered through Lindsay and transfused into Elijah, who\u2019d been bitten.</p><p>He pointed at the sobbing man who rocked himself on the floor like a child. \u201cThis minion was a wraith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he took a bite of me, yeah,\u201d the Alpha confirmed. \u201cI remember that anchor tattoo. I was going to rip it off of him with my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember it, too,\u201d Raze said, coming in from the front door. \u201cI saw it in a framed photo in one of the houses we searched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 A.\u201d Vash stared at the wraiths. \u201cThese are the residents? My god...did they eat their own children?\u201d</p><p>The minion began to scream and rip out his hair. Syre knocked him out with a fist to the temple.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta big fucking problem here,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cThat Vashti wannabe was one of yours and she was here, wel aware of what the hel was going on with these wraiths. She was batshit crazy, but stil . She\u2019s been hunting humans for sport for years now. I doubt Lindsay\u2019s mother was her first or last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSyre.\u201d</p><p>Al heads turned to Lyric, who descended from the second floor. \u201cThere are a dozen wraiths upstairs who\u2019ve gone long enough without food that they\u2019re barely capable of blinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was feeding them,\u201d Vash said. \u201cShe infected them, then fed them their own children. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Lyric went on. \u201cYou\u2019l want to see it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Syre gestured for Vashti to precede him in fol owing Lyric upstairs. They ascended quickly, picking over tarlike puddles that marked the end of wraith lives. Lyric led them to the room at the end of the hal , the master bedroom, which had been ravaged. The furniture had been tossed in the corner, opening room for the placement of a table and chairs. Writing on the wal documented the progression of the virus over a period of seventy- two hours. Handheld radios were plugged into their recharging bases. Duffel bags and a suitcase had been shoved against the closed closet doors.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Lyric pointed at the open suitcase. Amid the pile of rumpled clothes was an employee badge.</p><p>Crouching, Syre picked up the rectangular laminated badge and stared at the al -too-familiar face in the photo. His blood turned to ice as his thumb brushed over the MITCHELL AERONAUTICS winged logo.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Vashti asked behind him, unable to see.</p><p>He passed her the badge over his shoulder and riffled through the rest of the contents.</p><p>\u201cPhineas,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>The luggage undoubtedly belonged to Adrian\u2019s original second-in-command, as evidenced by the personal items inside, which included two molted feathers. Syre eyed the robin\u2019s-egg-blue color of the filaments, which so reminded him of the wings he\u2019d once boasted. Each angel\u2019s wings were uniquely colored, leaving no doubt that the feathers he held had once graced Phineas\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah\u2019s voice broke the weighted silence. \u201cThey were experiments,\u201d he said, reading the writing on the wal . \u201cSee how they have them divided up by weight and gender, then again by these letters: A, B, and C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Raze entered the room with what looked like a makeup case in one hand. He set it down on the table and released the catch, revealing a variety of vials.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get that to Grace,\u201d Vash said.</p><p>Syre pushed to his feet. \u201cGrace needs help.\u201d</p> <p>Vash walked to Elijah and handed him Phineas\u2019s ID card. \u201cRaze knows a laboratory scientist in Chicago. I bet she could help us narrow down our choices to the best in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dead end,\u201d Raze said vehemently. \u201cI banged her and left. I doubt she\u2019d be too charitable to my coming around again with my hand out.</p><p>It\u2019d be...messy.\u201d</p><p>Syre didn\u2019t point out that banging and leaving lovers was par for the course with Raze. Instead he said, \u201cGo to her with your dick out. You know how to get what we need out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be another way,\u201d the captain insisted. \u201cWe can put out a cal to the minions. There are bound to be some who have ties we can pul .\u201d</p> <p>The strength of Raze\u2019s protests didn\u2019t escape his notice, but Syre chose not to delve into the reason for it now. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to stumble around in the dark, and a recommendation from someone you know personal y and intimately is a damn sight more responsible than a fucking Google search. See to it.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticced in Raze\u2019s jaw. \u201cYes, Commander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas,\u201d Elijah said softly, his attention on the ID card. He looked up and raked the room with a narrowed, searching gaze. \u201cWhat the hel was that vampress into? Mortals, vampires, Sentinels...nothing was off-limits for her.\u201d</p><p>Syre\u2019s arms crossed. \u201cWhat are the chances that Phineas isn\u2019t dead?\u201d</p><p>Elijah barked out a humorless laugh. \u201cNo way. He and Adrian were like this.\u201d He crossed his fingers, then glanced at the suitcase on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPhineas was coming back from a trip to the Navajo Lake outpost. He stopped in Hurricane, Utah, to feed his lycans and was ambushed by a nest of wraiths. Whoever the hel that Vashti-wannabe was, she must\u2019ve had a setup there, too. And after Phineas was taken out, she grabbed his shit and bailed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps. At this point we can\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The Alpha\u2019s gaze was hard. \u201cBecause it\u2019s more believable that Sentinels and vampires are working together than it is for a group of minions to fal off the deep end.\u201d</p><p>Syre conceded the point. The majority of minions succumbed to madness\u2014mortals weren\u2019t designed to live without their souls.</p><p>A piercing, inhuman scream shattered the moment. Everyone charged downstairs, reaching the first floor as a series of gunshots reverberated through the house.</p><p>Crash stood over the sprawled body of the wraith-turned-minion. His gun was in one hand and his other was pressed over a bloody wound on his biceps. \u201cHe went nuts and lunged for me.\u201d</p><p>The minion who\u2019d briefly recovered lay dead on the floor, his features reverted to the haunted, sunken look of a wraith. Even as they watched, the man disintegrated into an oil slick.</p><p>Rage burned through Syre, igniting a vicious bloodlust. It was quite clear now why Adrian had risked Lindsay the way he had\u2014he couldn\u2019t afford to give up even a drop of his blood, not when al evidence pointed to it being a component of a cure for the Wraith Virus.</p><p>Syre glanced at the Alpha. Lindsay was the key to Adrian, Elijah was the key to Lindsay, and Vashti was the key to Elijah. The means he required to save his people was within his grasp, and he didn\u2019t have any qualms about using it.</p> <p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Adrian exited his private plane first, then held out a hand to assist Lindsay down the short steps.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely cooler here in Ontario.\u201d</p><p>Soon she wouldn\u2019t notice such things. Every day the vampirism in her blood took greater and greater hold, and every day he was relieved to find her soul pure and intact. It seemed Shadoe\u2019s soul had indeed been enough of a sacrifice, leaving Lindsay\u2019s unmarred by the curse of the Fal en.</p><p>Although he had doubts that the Creator paid any attention to him anymore, Adrian stil offered up his gratitude for the miracle of her.</p><p>With his hand at her back, he steered her toward the Mitchel Aeronautics hangar Siobh\u00e1n was using as her home base. They stepped through a slender parting between the massive hangar doors, then headed to the stairs that led down into the subterranean storage areas. The eerie quiet they descended into was very much at odds with his last visit. Then, the screams of the maddened infected minions had been damn near deafening. He\u2019d since had the rooms soundproofed to preserve the sanity of the Sentinels who worked there.</p><p>\u201cCaptain.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face a doorway he\u2019d just passed. \u201cSiobh\u00e1n. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>The petite brunette stepped out with a smile for Lindsay and a quick nod of greeting for him, but her eyes went immediately to the carrier in his hand. \u201cWhat have you brought for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you asked for.\u201d He passed it over.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said, running a hand through her cropped hair, which was stil damp and fresh smel ing from a recent shower. As was her usual, she wore urban camouflage pants with Army-issue jungle boots and a plain black T-shirt. The hard-edged attire did little to toughen her appearance. She was tiny and appeared delicate, a ruse that had blindsided too many of her opponents to count.</p><p>He fol owed her and Lindsay down the hal and into a laboratory outfitted with the best equipment his considerable fortune could buy. Freezers and glass-fronted refrigeration units lined the wal s, while microscopes, notepads, and laptops covered the metal tables in the center.</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n cleared space on the nearest tabletop with a sweep of her hand and set the cooler down. She smiled when she opened it and read the label on the blood bag. \u201cWish I could\u2019ve been there when Raguel gave this up. And you got a sample from Vashti, too! You\u2019l have to tel me al about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, although I expect you have information to share with me as wel .\u201d Adrian pul ed out a metal stool for Lindsay and stood behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others are in the infirmary or out in the field.\u201d The Sentinel moved to the closest refrigerator and put the two bags inside. \u201cI wanted us to have some privacy when I talked to you about my latest discoveries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay reached for his hand and linked her fingers with his.</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n returned and leaned a hip in to the edge of the table. She was flushed and bright eyed, almost glowing. He\u2019d never seen her look so... happy. \u201cI ran tests using the various samples that were sent to me over the last few days. Lycan blood, for the most part, has no effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was one sample that was anomalous. When I tested it, it caused a violent reaction. The virus became unstable very quickly. Had I been testing with a live subject, the subject would have expired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sample was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Alpha\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s hand tightened on his. \u201cElijah\u2019s? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l have to run more tests to be certain, but I believe it\u2019s because the virus was created with his blood or blood similar to it. I\u2019m trying to ascertain whether Elijah has a unique genetic anomaly or if it\u2019s common to Alphas in particular.\u201d Siobh\u00e1n crossed her arms. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t get a hold of Reese to get more samples.\u201d</p><p>Adrian thought back to the last time he\u2019d heard from Reese, the Sentinel in charge of the Alphas. The dominant lycans had been segregated from the others to prevent revolt, and they were used for assignments requiring the utmost stealth, ones in which a lone hunter was the best offense.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him in about three months, but he checks in regularly and reports no trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you scan the reports personal y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I delegate to my second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was Phineas\u2019s job, then Jason\u2019s, and now Damien handles it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI would suggest you speak with Reese directly, Captain. One donor wouldn\u2019t be enough for the size of the outbreak we\u2019re dealing with unless they synthesized the identified protein. They\u2019d need a lot of Alpha blood to pul that off. I\u2019m talking about countless pints of blood and a considerable length of research and development time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cIf there are genetic markers that identify Alphas, why was Elijah placed under observation first? There shouldn\u2019t have been any question as to what he was, if a simple blood test could prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is al news to me,\u201d Adrian said quietly, while inside his thoughts were raging. How could something so vital and elementary have escaped their notice for so long? He was afraid it was impossible, which led to even darker thoughts. Lindsay had been abducted from Angels\u2019 Point by someone with wings and delivered to Syre, who\u2019d Changed her. From that incident, he\u2019d known it was possible that one of his Sentinels had become a saboteur, but this... This spoke of a conspiracy of breadth and far-reaching consequence. \u201cHave you ever been to Alaska, neshama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , we\u2019l be changing that tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Siobh\u00e1n. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve fal en in love with a vampire.\u201d</p><p>As the hotel room door shut behind them, Vash tossed her bag on the bed and shot a worried glance at Elijah\u2019s leg. \u201cHow are you healing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He offered her an easy, heartbreaking smile. \u201cGood as new.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but worry knotted her stomach. Like most lycans, he hated flying, and his discomfort had rubbed her raw over the short flight to West Virginia. She\u2019d barely paid attention to the town of Huntington as she drove through it on the way to their lodging. Her thoughts were firmly on the events of the day and how dependent her equanimity had become on Elijah\u2019s wel -being. Once she\u2019d made up her mind to keep him, everything had changed. She now had something to lose, something she couldn\u2019t bear to lose. What was building between them was too new, too rare, too precious with al its myriad possibilities. The chal enges, the joys\u2014 \u201cVashti.\u201d He came to her, sliding his hands into her hair and cupping her head. \u201cIt was a broken leg. It happens.\u201d</p><p>She caught him by the belt loops and yanked him closer. \u201cI saw you get pul ed into that room and the door shut...I panicked. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that in my life. The sheer terror. I had to fight my way to get to you and every second felt like an hour. And when I got there and saw the gun in her hand, everything froze...I could barely think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...\u201d He pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, damn it, it\u2019s not okay. I don\u2019t want to feel like this. It\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Scary as hel .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound scared,\u201d she accused. \u201cYou don\u2019t act like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fight to keep a lid on it.\u201d His voice was low and soothing. \u201cI knew what you are...who you are...when I took you on. If I tie you down to keep you safe, I\u2019l lose you. And since I can\u2019t lose you, I\u2019m working on dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>That his words so closely mirrored hers was soothing, but it wasn\u2019t an answer. It didn\u2019t fix what was aching inside her chest. \u201cI\u2019m not as strong as you. I don\u2019t want to let you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled against her and she leaned into him, her knees weakening with his tenderness. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve already let someone out of your sight once and you lost him. I can imagine it\u2019s tough to take that leap again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. I\u2019m not supposed to feel this way again. I had my shot. I had Char. It\u2019s not supposed to happen a second time.\u201d</p><p>Pul ing back, Elijah watched her with those verdant hunter\u2019s eyes. Cool and assessing. \u201cWhat\u2019s not supposed to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. This. Us.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut to block out the way he was looking at her. Butterflies were having a field day in her stomach. The anxiety was kil ing her. \u201cShit. Why can\u2019t the sex be enough? Why did al this other stuff have to get in the way?\u201d</p><p>He tilted her head back and sealed his mouth over hers. The first lick of his tongue drove her mad, goaded her to push up onto her tiptoes and capture him with soft suction. His groan rippled through her, inciting the fiercest hunger. Her desire was always smoldering, ready to combust with the slightest provocation.</p><p>Vash took his mouth with savage greed, her tongue stroking deep. Her hands shoved up beneath his shirt, seeking and finding his warm, rough satin skin. Her fingers dug into the muscles bracketing his spine, pul ing him hard against her so that nothing came between them but their clothes.</p><p>His rumbling laugh vibrated against her tender breasts. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely trying to screw me to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she muttered, while kissing along his jaw and throat.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She shoved his shirt up and buried her face in the light dusting of hair on his chest, breathing in the hardworking scent of his skin. Her tongue found the flat disk of a nipple and teased it, worrying it with fluttering strokes.</p><p>\u201cFuck, that feels good,\u201d he said hoarsely, lifting his arms to pul his shirt off.</p><p>Dropping to her knees, she yanked open his fly with frantic fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d He tossed his shirt aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d</p><p>She tugged at his jeans, but he stopped her, catching her by the chin and tilting her face up.</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d His eyes were dark with concern. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna talk. I want you.\u201d</p> <p>He joined her on the floor, kneeling and brushing her hair back from her face. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face a lot of tough situations together. It\u2019s the nature of who we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say.\u201d She smacked his hand away. \u201cThe chances of my dying are slim to none. You\u2019re dying right now. Every minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Elijah sank back onto his heels, completely oblivious to the stunningly sensual sight he presented\u2014bare-chested with his button fly parted just enough to expose the thin, silky line of hair that led to delicious places below. So vital and virile. A potent force of nature. And yet his days on this earth were finite. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you do. How can you?\u201d</p><p>Setting his hands on his knees, he exhaled in a rush. \u201cMated lycans live longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. And you love me. Enough that it\u2019s driving you crazier than you already were to begin with.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Then she pushed to her feet, pul ing herself together with as much dignity as she could muster. They weren\u2019t going to talk about this. Ever. It was bad enough without saying the words. \u201cGo take that shower you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Catching her wrist when she moved to pass him, he stood. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get excited. This place may not have hot water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you love me,\u201d he qualified.</p> <p>\u201cDid I say that? I don\u2019t think I said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d His thumb brushed over the madly throbbing pulse in her wrist. \u201cI won\u2019t say it either. Doesn\u2019t make it less true.\u201d</p><p>The sharpening pain in her chest had her stumbling to the bed. She sat gracelessly, her gaze on the blank television screen.</p><p>\u201cGo shower,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cJoin me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, wondering how she would survive going through this twice. Suffering through the debilitating, devastating pain twice. And she was stunned that she could even equate the two men she loved together\u2014one who was with her for eons alongside one she\u2019d known only a matter of days. How could she feel this way so swiftly? Worse, there was no doubt her affection for Elijah would grow as time passed, becoming even more necessary until she wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe without him.</p><p>He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed her knuckles, then let her go. A moment later, she heard the shower come on in the bathroom. And a moment after that, she heard him singing.</p><p>The pain in her chest turned into a sweet yearning. He had a beautiful tenor, showcased by the choice of song, which she didn\u2019t recognize. But he could\u2019ve sung horribly off-key, for al she cared. It wasn\u2019t his talent that seduced her, but the intimacy of sharing this downtime with him. The gift of seeing him open and unguarded.</p> <p>Mated. Vash shook her head. That word didn\u2019t mean the same thing to a lycan as it did to a vampire. When Charron died, she\u2019d gone on.</p><p>Inarguably altered by the loss, yes, but capable of moving forward al the same. When Elijah mated, he would live until he died of old age or his mate died, whichever came first. He couldn\u2019t survive either circumstance.</p><p>She was stil contemplating that when he emerged from the bathroom, naked and dripping wet. He shook out his hair, spraying her and the rest of the room with droplets of water.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she protested. \u201cWatch it, puppy.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her as he went to the dresser and checked his cel phone. \u201cYou\u2019re doing enough watching for the both of us, cougar. You\u2019re ogling, real y. My ass is burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice ass.\u201d She was startled by the throatiness of her voice. Due to his effect on her, of course. The one she\u2019d been experiencing since she first saw him naked and bleeding in a Utah cave, his luscious body stil vibrating with the threat of imminent violence.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to think about the end. She was going to focus on the here and now, taking everything she could from him, giving everything she had. If his life was going to pass with the swiftness of a dream, she was going to make sure they blazed as bright as the sun so that when the time came, she\u2019d burn out with him.</p><p>She unzipped her vest and said with unmistakable possession, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>He faced her, his eyes dropping to her exposed breasts. A rumbling purr escaped him. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>She beckoned him with a crook of her finger. He came to a stop in front of her, standing between her parted knees, his glistening cock directly at eye level. When he reached for her shoulders to push her back onto the bed, she linked her hands with his and held him back, her tongue darting out to lick the length of his rigid erection.</p><p>\u201cGod...\u201d His head fel back. \u201cI dreamed about your mouth on me that first night in Bryce Canyon.\u201d</p><p>Determined to erase the memory of the last time she\u2019d gone down on him, Vash released his hands and stroked him with her fists. His rough sound of pleasure was as beautiful to her ears as his singing. When his fingers tangled in her hair and began directing her, she gave herself over to him, al owing him to set the pace and depth, enjoying the confidence with which he took what he needed from her. It hadn\u2019t been that way with Char, who\u2019d been reverent with her. Elijah was a much earthier creature. He was both a lycan, with a beast\u2019s base needs, and a man who understood his woman\u2019s need to cede control at times.</p><p>She tightened the ring of her lips and deepened the suction, dizzy with desire and love. The taste of him, so clean and rich and purely male, went to her head. Her sex softened and grew slick, greedy for him. Mouthing the plush head, she moaned when a hard shudder tore through him.</p><p>He gasped, his thighs trembling. \u201cYou suck me so good...You\u2019re so fucking hot...\u201d</p><p>Lifting her head, she released him from her lips and pushed the rigid length between her cleavage. She pressed her arms tightly together, hugging his throbbing erection with the breasts he loved so much.</p><p>\u201cVashti.\u201d The look in his eyes was her reward, the need he revealed so stark and intimate. \u201cYou shred me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she said softly, licking her lips as he gripped her shoulders to keep her stil . He began to thrust slowly, gently, his rhythm not quite even.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Bending his knees, he quickened his pace, his breath sawing from his lungs. His eyes grew bright and feverish, his skin flushed and misted with sweat.</p><p>She felt the tension grip him, watched the tight lacing of muscle on his abdomen flex and contract with every pump of his hips. He was close; she could feel it... \u201cEnough.\u201d He withdrew and flipped her in one economical movement, bending her over the bed and shoving her pants down. With a loose fist in her hair, he pushed into her, gliding through tender, swol en tissues in a smooth, deep slide.</p><p>Her eyes closed on a whimper of delight. She lost herself in the lazy haze of pleasure, the simple beauty of Elijah\u2019s thorough, unhurried tempo.</p><p>Slow and easy. Rol ing his hips with a skil and control that stole her breath. Knowing just how to take her, how deep to thrust, how far to withdraw, how much pressure to exert when he ground himself into her. Her eyes stung with the purity of the connection, both raw and tender. Impossibly intimate.</p><p>He nuzzled her loosened vest off her shoulder and whispered in her ear. \u201cOne day soon, when you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m going to mount you like this. I\u2019m going to ride you while you arch your neck for me. I\u2019m going to mark you with my teeth. Fuck you. Mate with you. Then you\u2019l be mine, Vashti.</p><p>Irrevocably. Every luscious, stubborn, dangerous inch of you. Mine.\u201d</p><p>She shivered into a devastating climax with that promise in her heart. As impossible as it was, it was hers. Just as he was.</p><p>Elijah woke from a deep, healing sleep in the midst of a shift, his body jackknifing up as a man and hitting the carpeted floor as a lycan. He spun about, snarling, looking for the threat that stirred his beast. Vashti\u2019s whimper from the bed pinned him, freezing him in a block of ice.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She gasped, her body shuddering through her nightmare. \u201cPlease. Stop...\u201d</p><p>Ah, God. He whined in torment, his gut churning. Focusing on his heart rate, he wil ed it to slow, forcing his mind to clear so he could shift back into the form that could wake her without scaring her. The form that could hold her close and give her comfort.</p><p>The few moments it took to get himself under control seemed like days. Vashti thrashed naked in their bed, her lush body jerking with remembered pain, and he had no way to fight the demons that plagued her soul. No way to avenge her. Not yet.</p><p>The moment he shifted, he lunged to the bed and caught her up, his arms banding around her as she fought against him in the midst of her dream.</p><p>\u201cVashti,\u201d he said gruffly, his throat tight with anger and grief. \u201cCome back to me, sweetheart. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>She curled into his chest, her silken skin slick with a cold sweat. \u201cElijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I have you.\u201d</p><p>Shuddering violently, she pressed a cold nose to his skin. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...\u201d He rocked her, his lips pressed to the crown of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s al right. It\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, her nails digging into his back as she clutched at him. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, damn it. Al I want is to lie next to you when you rest, to curl up beside you and dream with you. They fucking took that away from me.\u201d</p><p>Tipping her back to see her tear-streaked face, Elijah brushed aside the strands of damp hair that clung to her forehead and cheeks and met her haunted gaze. To see so strong a woman reduced to a terrified creature broke his heart and incited a lethal wrath that had no outlet. He could protect her from outside forces and he would, but the darkness inside her was something he couldn\u2019t reach until she let him. \u201cNot forever. When we\u2019re mated\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to mate, damn it!\u201d She struggled violently out of his arms, like a feral animal, and he released her only so she wouldn\u2019t hurt herself. \u201cI can\u2019t breed, Elijah. I can\u2019t give you cute little fanged pups to trip over after a long day of Alpha\u2019ing packs of lycans who want me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t live forever,\u201d he shot back. \u201cWe\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re al we have. Damned if I\u2019l watch you suffer when I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to help with! It was over a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in your mind, it\u2019s not. Not in your dreams. When we\u2019re mated\u2014\u201d He held up a hand before she opened her mouth. \u201cShut up and listen to me.</p><p>When we\u2019re mated, I\u2019l be able to share those dreams with you. I\u2019l be able to fight off the demons that hurt you. We\u2019l be able to talk to each other, share with each other, without a word.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in horror. \u201cI don\u2019t want you in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had no problems digging into mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different. We were having sex. I wanted you to feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back atcha, sweetheart.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cYou need me in your head. And I need to be in there. It\u2019s kil ing me to see you hurt like this. To smel your fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to stay awake.\u201d Vash began to pace, her wild hair swaying around her nude torso. \u201cI don\u2019t need sleep like you do. I can go without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d He pushed to his feet. \u201cYour body may not need sleep, but your mind does. Your heart does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what they did to me,\u201d she bit out. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to know. You won\u2019t know. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>Elijah crossed his arms. \u201cTry and stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary. We can work around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo deals, sweetheart. Do you think there\u2019s something\u2014 anything\u2014that could make me not want you? Don\u2019t you think I would\u2019ve found that escape route before we passed the point of no return? You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know what was done to you. But I\u2019ve got the gist and a real y twisted, sick, fucked-up imagination. Chances are, what I can picture in my head is worse than reality, but it doesn\u2019t matter either way. It doesn\u2019t change how I feel about you. Nothing can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d She fisted the roots of her hair with both hands. \u201cI won\u2019t risk you finding out the hard way.\u201d</p><p>He caught her when she paced by and made her look at him. \u201cThe only thing that could come between us is infidelity. In that case, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about me walking away because you\u2019d both be dead.\u201d</p><p>Vash stared at him a moment, her eyes bleak; then the corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cAnd you cal me the crazy one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you happy.\u201d He pul ed her close. The icy lump in his stomach melted when her slender arms encircled him. \u201cWhether you like it or not. Whether you fight me or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019l fight you,\u201d she promised, her eyes clear of shadows. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I rol .\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have you any other way.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>\u201cStick close,\u201d Elijah said as Vashti climbed out of the passenger side of their rental, her gaze trained on the massive metal gate that was the entrance to the Huntington lycan outpost. \u201cThey\u2019l know you\u2019re mine the moment they get a whiff of you. I\u2019d be surprised if we don\u2019t face at least one chal enger here. Especial y from whoever\u2019s been running this place since they revolted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slid sunglasses over her golden eyes and rounded the hood. \u201cI\u2019ve got your back, babe. And your fine ass, too.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but look twice, then stare. She was wearing one of the sleek, sleeveless black bodysuits that looked like wet paint applied directly to her skin. Black leather boots covered her from toe to knee and her long, blood red hair hung loosely down her back. For the first time since he\u2019d met her, she wore jewelry: a stunning necklace she\u2019d picked up that morning when she was out fetching him coffee from Starbucks. The fact that she\u2019d thought of his desire for caffeine\u2014a desire she didn\u2019t share\u2014touched him. But the necklace touched him more. It was an elaborate col ar of peridot around her neck, a color she said reminded her of his eyes.</p><p>The nonchalance with which she\u2019d told him about her selection didn\u2019t fool him for a minute. The necklace shook up her usual stark mourning black in an unmistakable way. No one could miss the statement, and she\u2019d chosen to make it with something she associated with him.</p><p>She\u2019d gone on to tel him that her wings had been a similar color, putting a picture in his head of a ruby-haired, sapphire-eyed, peridot-winged angel with pale-as-a-pearl skin. Impossibly gorgeous, he\u2019d thought, wishing he could have seen her that way. Then he\u2019d pul ed her close and kissed her until she went lax in his arms and her dreamy smile revealed her wickedly sharp fangs. The angel she\u2019d been was in the past. It was the vampress who held his heart. The fal en angel with a warrior\u2019s soul. The woman who\u2019d suffered brutality at the hands of demons and been broken only to come back stronger and fiercer than ever.</p> <p>\u201cMicah\u2019s always going to be a problem, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked softly, absently adjusting the fit of her katana scabbards. \u201cOr more accurately, what I did to him and what you did to his widow because of me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny it. There was no point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, El.\u201d Reaching out, she linked her fingers with his. \u201cNot that I did it, because under the circumstances and the information I had to go on, I would do it again. But I\u2019m sorry that it hurt you and that it\u2019s causing you trouble now.\u201d</p><p>The video screen beside the door flickered, and a stern male face appeared. \u201cWho are you? And what do you want?\u201d</p><p>Since the feed was closest to Vashti, she approached it first. \u201cYour Alpha is here to check the place out. A warm welcome is expected. A little brownnosing wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah sighed. \u201cVashti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She strol ed over to him.</p><p>The thirty-foot door slid open smoothly, revealing a party of a half-dozen armed lycans\u2014five males and one female. Vashti looked down at the multitude of red pistol scope laser sights shimmering on her chest. A wicked smile curved her lips, and she bared her fangs.</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d he admonished her before stepping forward. \u201cLower your weapons. She\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a vampire,\u201d the tal , tawny-haired lycan in the middle said with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cCute and observant,\u201d Vash purred. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left the Scooby Snacks back at the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>The lycan\u2019s aim lifted to center mass of her forehead.</p><p>Elijah pul ed the sunglasses off his face. \u201cAh, but clearly his hearing is defective. I may need to put him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I watch?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>The dark-haired lycan next to Trigger-Happy holstered his weapon and came forward. His nostrils twitched, and one brow rose as he looked back and forth between Elijah and Vashti. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Vash\u2019s grin widened. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>The lycan extended his hand to Elijah. \u201cI\u2019m Paul. We weren\u2019t aware there was an Alpha in charge.\u201d</p><p>Vash stepped closer, clearly protective. \u201cWhy send a messenger when he can take care of it himself? Your Alpha takes the hands-on approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a hierarchy here,\u201d Trigger-Happy said tightly. \u201cYou\u2019l respect it, or you can find another outpost to shelter you.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cDefinitely no treats for you.\u201d</p><p>Trigger-Happy took aim.</p><p>In the time it took for Vash to pivot out of the way, Elijah shifted and lunged. He knocked the blond down and ripped his throat out in one fluid movement.</p><p>Gunshots fired around them. Elijah spun in a snarling crouch, prepared to attack again...only to find three of the lycans nursing bleeding trigger hands and one of the males standing with both arms up in the air and his gaze rigidly trained on the ground. Vash held Paul\u2019s pistol in one hand and the back of his neck in the other, her arm straightened so that he was forced to his knees on the ground.</p><p>Elijah shifted forms and walked toward his discarded clothes, admiration and respect for his woman fil ing him in a heated rush.</p><p>Vash glared at the female lycan. \u201cClose your eyes, bitch. No peeking. You see any part of your Alpha but his face and you won\u2019t live to regret it.\u201d</p><p>He pul ed on his jeans first, for Vash\u2019s sake, then used his shirt to wipe the blood from his mouth and chest. \u201cI\u2019m lenient about many things,\u201d he said to the group at large. \u201cBut I won\u2019t tolerate disobedience or threats of any kind against Vashti. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Two of the males shifted forms at the mention of who she was, unable to restrain their agitation. The snarl he shot them had them sitting, if shifting restlessly. \u201cLet Paul get up.\u201d</p><p>Vash released the man, but kept her gaze trained on the others.</p><p>Paul straightened, raking Elijah with a sweeping glance. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a lycan shift so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetcha never seen a lycan who\u2019s nailing a vampress either,\u201d Vash said. \u201cSyre\u2019s second, no less. It\u2019s a whole new world.\u201d</p><p>Elijah arched a brow at her. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tel you to behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from you when I\u2019m not naked.\u201d</p><p>He decided not to give her any more ammunition. \u201cI need access to your data center, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alpha.\u201d Paul gestured through the gate. \u201cI\u2019l show you where it is.\u201d</p><p>Elijah was deep into working on the data when Vash\u2019s cel phone rang. Excusing herself, she stepped out to the hal way and answered, managing a smile when Syre\u2019s face appeared on her iPhone screen.</p><p>\u201cVashti,\u201d he greeted her. \u201cHow are things faring in Huntington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. They\u2019re digging for the goods now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that on your neck?\u201d He frowned. \u201cIs that...jewelry?\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cYeah. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave things smoothed out between you and your lycan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping him.\u201d She figured it was best to get that out of the way.</p><p>Syre\u2019s smile revealed his fangs. \u201cExcel ent.\u201d</p><p>Her fist clenched at her side, her mind\u2019s eye seeing the fork in the road ahead and the decision she\u2019d soon be forced to make between the two most important men in her life.</p><p>\u201cCan you speak privately?\u201d His smooth, soothing voice had the opposite effect, making her hackles rise.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Vash glanced up at one of the lycans on guard duty in the hal way. \u201cNearest soundproofed room?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his thumb down the hal , his gaze cold and hard. \u201cTwo doors down on the right, bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Fido.\u201d</p><p>Once she was inside alone, she cocked her ears and listened for anything other than her own breathing. She kicked the wal s one by one, listening for the tel tale sound of a pocket where a bug could be hidden. When those checks come up clear, she nodded. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m good. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading with Raze to Chicago now to fol ow up with his contact there. Torque is covering for us while we\u2019re in the field.\u201d Syre leaned back in his chair. \u201cAs for your lycan...there\u2019s something you need to know.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat skipped at his tone. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis blood caused a remission in that wraith yesterday for a reason\u2014he\u2019d just drunk filtered Sentinel blood through Lindsay. When Grace tested Lindsay\u2019s blood via the needles and other paraphernalia that you had the presence of mind to retain, she found the effect to be even more pronounced. It\u2019s highly likely that pure, undiluted Sentinel blood\u2014or perhaps al angelic blood\u2014is the key to a cure for the Wraith Virus.\u201d</p><p>She heaved out her breath and nodded grimly.</p><p>\u201cYou suspected that,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cI knew it had to be something major in order for Adrian to let Lindsay come with me.\u201d She ran a hand through her hair and paced, her heels clicking across the tiled floor. \u201cFuckin\u2019 A. This could explain why he took my blood. He probably figures we might stil have similar blood properties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent Grace blood samples from me, Raze, and Salem. We\u2019l see what she turns up. With any luck, this trip to Chicago wil prove fruitful and we\u2019l be able to get her the help she needs to speed things up.\u201d He paused a moment. \u201cAlso, there was an incendiary device found in the wreckage of the pickup truck. It\u2019s possible it was set off by remote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would the person with the remote know to activate it?\u201d Her mind scrambled ahead. \u201cUnless they were watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found pockets of C4 al over the wraith house. It was a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the house go up? If they saw the truck pul out, they definitely saw us in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. Perhaps your double had the remote for the house in the truck. Or the receiver was defective. Salem is leading a team through the property now. Torque is working on tracking the purchase of the C4. Hopeful y we\u2019l have some answers soon.\u201d</p><p>Vash rubbed at the icy lump in her chest. \u201cUntil we\u2019ve got a better handle on this, watch your back in Chicago. And keep an eye on Raze. There\u2019s something between him and that lab tech you\u2019re visiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI caught that. Keep me posted.\u201d</p><p>Syre\u2019s austerely beautiful face faded to black and she blew out her breath in a rush. She turned when the door opened behind her.</p><p>Elijah fil ed the doorway and the fear that had been sliding through her eased its grip.</p><p>He held his hand out to her. \u201cWe\u2019ve found what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>Vash squeezed Elijah\u2019s shoulder as she read the data on the massive van-sized monitor on the wal . \u201cThree lycans,\u201d she said. \u201cThree against Char and Ice. They shouldn\u2019t have been able to win.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, studying her face, wishing he knew who she\u2019d been on the phone with and what they\u2019d told her. Her usual vivacity was subdued, concerning him. \u201cDo you believe the accusation that Charron\u2019s fledgling incited an attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Her troubled gaze met his. \u201cIce was problematic. He was struggling with bloodthirst and he lacked self-control. I was leaning toward putting him down, but Char thought he could turn the kid around. I was so busy with my duties as second that it was hard for me to deny him something that gave him pleasure and kept him occupied.\u201d</p><p>Elijah read between the lines. They hadn\u2019t been equals, not as he and Vash were. \u201cBut Ice survived the attack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly by hours. He\u2019d been burned too badly by the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014while Charron was brutalized.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe attack was especial y vicious. So much so that I thought maybe the demons had gotten to him before I arrived. But the body reeked of lycans, and the disemboweling had been done with lycan teeth.\u201d</p><p>The demons. A chil moved through him. Pul ing her close, he placed his lips to her ear and asked, \u201cHow soon after Char\u2019s death were you attacked?\u201d</p><p>She yanked back. \u201cWho said I was\u2014\u201d Then she scowled. \u201cAn hour. Thereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour...\u201d He crushed her to him, squeezing her so tightly, she gasped and struggled. \u201cI\u2019m going to find a way to raise them from hel and kil them al over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah.\u201d She softened and let him love her, pressing her lips to his jaw. \u201cAlways avenging somebody...except when I get in the way.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the monitor, keeping an arm around her waist. He spoke to the lycan named Samuel who manned the keyboard. \u201cCan you pul up their histories and display them side-by-side?\u201d</p><p>Samuel typed in the necessary commands and Elijah studied the results. \u201cSame month and year of birth for al three,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cAnd they al died the same year,\u201d Vashti murmured. \u201cWithin a few months of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame litter, Samuel?\u201d</p><p>The lycan frowned at the monitor. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many triplet births, but let me pul up their breeding charts...Huh. There aren\u2019t any. That\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can check their blood,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cSend someone to cryostorage to pul their samples.\u201d</p><p>Samuel picked up the phone embedded in the workstation and passed along the order.</p><p>Vash\u2019s fingertips kneaded restlessly into his hip. \u201cWould that be unusual for brothers to hunt together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d His gaze remained on the monitor. \u201cAt a younger age, no. But these were breeding-age males. They should have been spread around among the outposts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWidening the gene pool,\u201d she fil ed in drily. \u201cHow romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains why their information is so similar. Doesn\u2019t explain why they died. Samuel, why isn\u2019t there a notation as to cause of death?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Samuel said, \u201cDepends on the situation at the time and the thoroughness of the tech. Remember, this room was Sentinels-only before the revolt, and most of them don\u2019t give a shit how we die.\u201d</p><p>Elijah pul ed his ringing phone from his pocket to silence it, then noted Stephan\u2019s name and took the cal . \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA few hundred lycans,\u201d his Beta said drily. \u201cI\u2019m back at the warehouse. As the teams move across the country, they\u2019re running across expat lycans and sending them here. Someone needs to be here ful time to process them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god you\u2019ve got initiative.\u201d</p><p>Stephan laughed. \u201cIf I bothered you with every administrative decision, you\u2019d bite my head off. Perhaps literal y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too valuable. I\u2019d find something else to torture you with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, there\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>The sudden gravity in his Beta\u2019s voice set Elijah on alert. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHimeko\u2019s tel ing everyone you\u2019ve mated with Syre\u2019s second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d He watched as Vash stepped in front of him with a frown, her vampiric hearing ensuring that she heard every word. He smoothed the line between her brows with soft strokes of his thumb. \u201cNot yet. She\u2019s stil getting used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cAlpha, I hate to point out the obvious\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires can\u2019t breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the recap.\u201d</p><p>Stephan was not amused. \u201cIt\u2019s my job as your Beta to inform you of concerns in the ranks. Don\u2019t mock me for doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never mock you\u2014I respect you too much. In return, I ask that you don\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019m doing everything I can to the best of my ability. That\u2019s al anyone has a right to know. My personal life is my own. If there\u2019s a problem with that, tel the others to direct their energies to finding the Alpha outpost. Then we can have a democratic election and everyone can have a say.\u201d</p><p>Vashti\u2019s gaze darkened. Not funny, she mouthed.</p> <p>No, it wasn\u2019t. The only way another Alpha could gain control of the packs was by taking Elijah out. They wouldn\u2019t get the respect they needed to lead without that victory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l keep you posted,\u201d Stephan said.</p><p>Elijah kil ed the cal and returned his attention to the monitor. \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d</p><p>The ringing of the phone in the workstation interrupted as if on cue. Samuel answered. \u201cDid you double-check? Wel , check again.\u201d</p><p>Vashti\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cWanna bet the blood\u2019s missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like the odds,\u201d Elijah replied, not surprised when Samuel proved Vash\u2019s hunch correct. \u201cOkay, then, pul up their photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Let me see...Ah, here\u2019s one. Peter Neil.\u201d</p><p>A familiar image popped up on screen and Elijah scowled. \u201cI know him. Worked with him a time or two. His name isn\u2019t Peter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA sibling, maybe?\u201d Vash queried.</p><p>\u201cNo. See the scar on his lip? Same guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he here?\u201d she asked Samuel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Elijah said curtly. \u201cKil ed in a nest raid about twenty years ago. I was there when it happened. Do you have head shots of the others?\u201d</p><p>Whistling, Samuel tapped out another string of keystrokes and another picture popped up. \u201cHere\u2019s Kevin Hayes.\u201d</p><p>Vashti sucked in a deep breath.</p><p>Elijah\u2019s remaining patience thinned dangerously. \u201cWrong photo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one that was shot on intake,\u201d Samuel insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake. That\u2019s Micah McKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKenna, huh? Hang on. Okay, there\u2019s a Micah McKenna in the system. Yeah...you\u2019re right. He came in the same day as Kevin. Maybe the photos got switched around and misfiled. Here\u2019s the one from Micah\u2019s file.\u201d The same photo popped up. \u201cSomeone fucked up.\u201d</p><p>But Elijah\u2019s attention was riveted to the history data that had opened along with the photo. His gaze skimmed through it, finding al the expected information\u2014registered mate, archives of transfers and kil s, breeding chart.</p><p>\u201cHe lied,\u201d Vash said. \u201cI asked him his age and he said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014fifty.\u201d Micah\u2019s official record put him at eighty years old, which made it possible for him to have kil ed Charron. He\u2019d been too young at fifty\u2014 the perfect alibi. \u201cWhere\u2019s the third lycan\u2019s photo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Samuel pul ed it up. \u201cAnthony Wil iams.\u201d</p><p>His fists clenched with recognition. \u201cLook up Trent Parry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl right...Yep, he\u2019s here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , look at that,\u201d Vash muttered. \u201cThe same photo as Anthony.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s entire world tilted to the side, skewed by the realization that the men he\u2019d trusted had betrayed him and every other lycan.</p><p>She began to pace. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking cover-up. They created a paper trail for three imaginary lycans and absolved them of guilt in Char\u2019s death.</p><p>Why, damn it? Why did the Sentinels protect three rabid dogs?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look that warned her to say no more. \u201cSamuel, get me copies of al these files, on both a flash drive and disks. Look up a Charles Tate, too, and throw him in the mix. He\u2019s the one using the alias Peter Neil.\u201d</p><p>Vash stopped directly in front of him. \u201cIs Trent dead like Micah and Charles? Have I been hunting ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrent was with me in Phoenix during the trip when Nikki attacked Adrian and we found Lindsay.\u201d He pressed his lips to her brow and murmured, \u201cYou may have to fight her for him. She wants him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l explain later. For now, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Vash didn\u2019t realize how furious Elijah was until they returned to the hotel and he began shoving things into his bag.</p><p>\u201cElijah.\u201d She reached out to him as he stormed past her.</p><p>\u201cGet your shit. I want you out of here. I don\u2019t trust this place. Don\u2019t trust what\u2019s left of that pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l throw it together if you won\u2019t,\u201d he growled, grabbing toiletries out of the bathroom. \u201cBut you\u2019d better not bitch at me if something gets left behind.\u201d</p><p>When he emerged, she stepped right into his path. \u201cWil you talk to me, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right I\u2019m pissed.\u201d He tossed the things in his hand on the bed and growled. \u201cYou know what Rachel said to me before she incited the rebel ion at Navajo Lake? She said, \u2018It\u2019s al on you.\u2019 Now I have to wonder if I\u2019ve been manipulated in ways I haven\u2019t figured out yet. It\u2019s certain they wanted you and me to kil each other. If we hadn\u2019t fal en into rut the minute we scented each other, one or both of us would be dead. We\u2019d never have spent the time together that led to where we are now, and Syre would be out for someone\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Micah\u2019s the one who planted your blood for me to find?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms, straining the armholes of the T-shirt he\u2019d borrowed after getting blood on his own. \u201cYou kil ed Micah\u2019s partner but kept Micah alive to interrogate. Why not the other way around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a big mouth. Taunting me and being an al -around asshat. It was easy to pick him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made it easy. And I think it\u2019s possible you recognized his scent from Charron\u2019s attack without realizing it. Maybe you even recognized it from Nikki\u2019s abduction. That knowledge might\u2019ve been there in the back of your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Char\u2019s kil ers\u2019 scents ingrained in my memory. I wouldn\u2019t miss that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once had to argue my right to claim a kil because a badly wounded lycan had bled al over the body. It smel ed like her, more so than me, because of the blood. If Micah had access to my blood to frame me, certainly he had access to others\u2019. Considering the trouble involved in creating that paper trail, dumping a couple bags of blood around Charron\u2019s body would be the easy part. And we both know how a disemboweling smel s.</p><p>That could explain why the attack was so vicious\u2014they wanted the stench to cover up their identities.\u201d</p><p>She sank heavily onto the bed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Elijah crouched in front of her. \u201cTo break you. I think they\u2019ve been trying to do that for years. First through Charron\u2019s death, then through me.</p><p>Micah\u2019s the thread there. You can\u2019t tel me that\u2019s coincidence. I won\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She exhaled harshly. \u201cI\u2019m not buying it either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t forget about your double attacking Lindsay\u2019s mother. Lindsay grew up planning on kil ing you her whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve had to know who she was. That she had Shadoe\u2019s soul inside her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Just as they\u2019d know Adrian or Syre would find her, and through them, she\u2019d find you. It explains why she wasn\u2019t kil ed along with her mother.</p><p>In my experience, the minions who go batshit have a liking for children\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s sweeter,\u201d she murmured absently, rubbing at the ache in her chest. To think of Char dying because of her...\u201cI\u2019m not important enough to go to this much trouble for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re important to Syre. Very much so. And so was Phineas to Adrian.\u201d He caught up her cold hands in his. \u201cThis is psychological warfare\u2014 cripple the primaries by taking out their seconds. Micah likely deliberately sacrificed himself for the cause\u2014just as I now suspect Rachel did. They wanted me in a specific headspace to achieve their aims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo put you and the lycans on the high ground? Is that what this is al about? To make you the dominant faction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t explain the doctored files and missing blood; only Sentinels had access to cryostorage and data centers. And your double brings vamps into the mix, too. Why would they want lycans at the top of the food chain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVamps delivered Lindsay to Syre...after she was taken from the Point by a Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. We\u2019ve got the wrong vamps, lycans, and Sentinels involved here. The question isn\u2019t just who\u2019s dirty, but are they dirty together?\u201d</p><p>Pul ing a hand free, Vash cupped his face with it, then told him about the conversation she\u2019d had with Syre.</p><p>He cursed and pushed to his feet. \u201cI have to go back. I have to go back to Adrian.\u201d</p><p>She gained her feet, too. Her heart pounded. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sentinels are wide open. Once it gets out that their blood is the cure, they\u2019l be sitting ducks. They need help. I have to at least attempt an al iance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can take out a hundred vamps a minute, if they wanted to. They never real y needed you.\u201d</p><p>The look he shot her was dark...and decided. \u201cWe need them. For al their faults, they keep the minions in check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinions are dying, El!\u201d But she knew with a sinking heart that she wouldn\u2019t be able to sway him.</p><p>\u201cI need to go back if only because Micah worked so damned hard to force me to leave. There\u2019s a reason for that, and I\u2019m not going to just play along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? I need you. My people need you.\u201d</p><p>Elijah tugged her close and pressed his lips to her brow. He held them there for a long moment, the beat of his heart slightly faster than it should be. \u201cThey\u2019ve got you, sweetheart. You\u2019re a one-woman army.\u201d</p><p>She caught his belt loops, holding on tightly. Her chest and throat burned. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask me to make this choice. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>His hands pushed into her hair, brushing it back from her face. He looked down at her with such tenderness, she could hardly breathe through the pain of it. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to do anything, Vashti. I\u2019m tel ing you what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>She stood frozen as he extricated himself and walked away. She watched him col ect the items from the bed and take his stuff to his bag and her stuff to her bag. Separating them. Dividing them up.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, lycan.\u201d Her fists clenched at her sides. A surge of malicious satisfaction moved through her when he paused in surprise. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me love you, then just fucking walk away. We\u2019re in this. You and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not walking away.\u201d He faced her and crossed his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Vashti. Nothing can change that. If you haven\u2019t figured that out yet, we\u2019ve got bigger problems than the war breathing down our necks.\u201d</p><p>The fist around her heart loosened. \u201cThen what the hel are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetting you be who you need to be. Letting you be the woman I love, even if that means you\u2019re on the other side of the world, on the other side of the line. If I make you go my way, I\u2019l lose you. I know that, because if you try to force me to go yours, you\u2019l lose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live that way, El.\u201d Anxiety slithered through her, making her sick and cold. She began to pace. \u201cWe can\u2019t be apart, working against each other. We have to find a compromise we can live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me what that is,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have to cal Lindsay and tel her the vampire most likely responsible for her mother\u2019s murder is dead, which wil be both a relief and not, because she wanted to do the kil ing herself. Then I\u2019l fol ow that up with the news that I probably got her father kil ed, since I handpicked the team of lycans sent to guard him and one of those team members was Trent. After that, I get to tel Adrian that Syre knows Sentinel blood is the cure and pretty soon more vampires wil know, so now the clock is ticking. In the meantime, Syre\u2019s got rogues infecting his ranks and I\u2019ve got lycans who are deliberately sabotaging my relations with both sides. Where\u2019s the middle ground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwitzerland.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His brow arched. \u201cYou want to run off to Switzerland? That\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019l be Switzerland. You and Lindsay wil form a loop, Syre and I wil form a loop, and you and I wil remain one unit. We\u2019l bridge the gap between the two. Right now, the biggest priority for everyone is the Wraith Virus. If we\u2019re al fighting the same enemy, it makes sense to combine forces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did common sense prevent war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Syre would go to war without me. He would certainly think twice about it if I objected. If you can convince Adrian that the risk to the Sentinels is too great without your support, we might be able to hold them both back. Especial y if they know we\u2019re al being set up. They\u2019re not going to want to play into that any more than you do. It\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Vash came to an abrupt halt, shocked that he\u2019d capitulated so easily. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s messy, complicated, and wil probably come back to bite us in the ass. And the Wraith Virus isn\u2019t real y a lycan problem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact that you seem to be especial y tasty to them,\u201d she interjected.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that, I suppose.\u201d He resumed packing. \u201cBut we\u2019l do our best.\u201d</p> <p>Relief hit her like a Mack truck. That might\u2019ve been why she blurted, \u201cAnd I want to mate with you.\u201d</p><p>Elijah froze, his hand suspended in the process of zipping his duffel closed. \u201cVashti.\u201d</p><p>She spoke in a rush, her heart racing and her palms damp. \u201cI know it\u2019s selfish. If someone\u2019s real y out for my blood and they manage to get to me, I\u2019l take you down with me. I know lycans don\u2019t live long after losing a mate, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He faced her and the look in his eyes nearly leveled her. \u201cI\u2019l go down whether we\u2019re mated or not. I thought you knew. I\u2019m already there, Vashti. I think I\u2019ve been there since you gave me that pep talk in the cave.\u201d</p><p>Vash stumbled straight into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. You\u2019ve fucked up everything.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the sound unknotted the stress and fear inside her. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019l be able to communicate without words, right? We\u2019l have that advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong others.\u201d He brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cWe\u2019l be stronger as a connected unit...and more vulnerable. They\u2019l know how to hurt us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we won\u2019t tel anyone. I\u2019l be your fanged piece on the side and you\u2019l be my boy toy. We\u2019l let those who want to believe that we\u2019re using each other believe it, but we\u2019l know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI can wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than ready. Just try and stop me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She cal ed Syre and told him about what she\u2019d learned of Charron\u2019s attack. While she did so, Elijah cal ed Lindsay and told her he needed to meet with both her and Adrian. Then Vash and El finished packing and headed to the Huntington Jet Center to wait for one of Adrian\u2019s private planes.</p><p>They were finalizing the paperwork for the return of their rental car when an agency employee rushed in with a manila envelope in her hand.</p><p>\u201cMr. Reynolds,\u201d the pretty strawberry-blonde cal ed out, wearing a winsome smile that made Vash take a possessive step closer to her man. \u201cYou left this in the backseat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not mine.\u201d He frowned and soothed Vash by failing to even register the clerk\u2019s attraction to him.</p><p>\u201cIt has your name on it.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the envelope and opened it, withdrawing the contents. Photographs. Shots taken through a paned window, like something a private investigator would snap of subjects unaware they were being surveil ed. Vash recognized the Sentinel in the photos instantly.</p><p>\u201cHelena,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWow. She\u2019s being naughty. With a hunky guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d he identified grimly. \u201cA lycan from the Navajo Lake pack.\u201d</p><p>The import of a Sentinel shagging a lycan slowly sank in. Hel , a Sentinel shagging anything was earthshaking news. \u201cFuckin\u2019 A.\u201d</p><p>He flipped faster, turning the frame-by-frame shots into a mini-motion picture. The couple came together in a passionate embrace, their mouths melding...clothes shedding... Then a masked figure was in the room with them, standing over the bed, his posture so menacing it caused the fine hairs on her arms to rise. The next shot was of the window with the curtains drawn, fol owed by several photos from inside the room, scenes of a carnage so horrifying her stomach knotted\u2014Helena with sightless eyes, her beautiful wings clawed from her back, her lover lying pale and bloodless on the floor with twin punctures in his neck. The time stamp in the lower-right-hand corner of the pictures told her the shots had been taken nearly a month ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she whispered, devastated. \u201cWhere did it come from? What the fuck are we supposed to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Elijah shoved the envelope into his duffel. \u201cSomeone\u2019s sending us a message we\u2019l have to decipher.\u201d</p><p>They swiftly wrapped up their business at the rental counter and headed over to meet their plane. The silence stretched out, comfortable between them even when thick with a clusterfuck of lies and questions.</p><p>Vash linked her fingers with his while they waited in the concourse. \u201cAre you sure about going to Alaska? It\u2019s a long flight, El. Maybe a video conference would be better. Or we can wait until Lindsay and Adrian get back.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cDidn\u2019t I mention that Adrian\u2019s jets have a sleeping cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Heat swept through her, melting her trepidation over the days to come. \u201cNo, I think you forgot that part.\u201d</p><p>He bent toward her and pressed a kiss to her temple. \u201cYou\u2019l be a mated woman when we land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel , then.\u201d She rested her head on his shoulder, al owing herself to savor the precious gift of having someone to lean on. \u201cYou may just learn to like flying after al .\u201d</p><p>Dr. Karin Al ardice was running late, as usual. Grabbing her briefcase off the passenger seat of her sleek black Mercedes AMG, she unfolded from behind the wheel and set one stiletto-heeled foot on the ground.</p><p>The morning was cool, the sun stil hovering low in the sky. In front of her stretched the wide lawn that fil ed the space between her designated parking spot and the entrance to her laboratory. The lush blades of grass stil glistened with dew, and the parking lot around her remained silent and empty. In a few hours she\u2019d be brownnosing one of the most prominent philanthropists in Chicago. A donation of several mil ion would give her a good start, but she knew that was wishful thinking. The best she could hope for was a fund-raising gala, another endless evening of overpriced food and drinks during which she\u2019d grovel en masse with her hand held out.</p><p>As she straightened from the driver\u2019s seat, she was startled to find a man standing by her car. She was briefly confused as to how he\u2019d appeared out of nowhere, then the question fled her mind. Everything she\u2019d been mul ing vanished from thought as she faced the most gorgeous man she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He extended his hand. \u201cDr. Al ardice?\u201d</p><p>Dear god, his voice was as delicious as the rest of him. Throaty and warm, like fine, aged whiskey.</p><p>\u201cYes? I\u2019m Karin Al ardice.\u201d The moment her fingers touched his, a spark of awareness shot up her arm. Shaken by the strength of her physical response, she shut the door and took a quick, deep breath to regain her composure. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so. I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re a preeminent virologist. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very flattering.\u201d She pushed her hair back from her face. \u201cMy primary focus is virology, yes.\u201d</p><p>The soft light of the early-morning gilded him, enhancing the natural sheen of his thick black hair and the beauty of his caramel-hued skin. His eyes were the most unusual shade of amber, quite breathtaking when framed by such thick, dark lashes. His mouth was a voluptuary\u2019s wet dream.</p><p>Firm and sculpted, the lower lip was just ful enough to make her think of sex while the upper was etched with the sharpest edge of sin. He wore a three-piece suit like nobody\u2019s business, and when his mouth curved she lost her breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve recently been made aware of a new viral strain, Dr. Al ardice. I\u2019d real y like your opinion on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She forced her brain to resume functioning. \u201cWel , I\u2019d be happy to take a look, Mr.\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSyre,\u201d he provided. \u201cExcel ent. I was hoping you\u2019d be cooperative.\u201d</p><p>The flash of unnatural y long canine teeth was the last thing she registered before the world went dark. </p> </body></html>"]
