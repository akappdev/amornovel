If you ask me one more time, I will make you stop the limo and shoot you with your own gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. That\u2019s clear thinking, having me stop the car before you shoot me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant, Max. Not mentally defective. Now, at the risk of sounding like a rich and powerful woman with minions to indulge my every whim\u2014shut up and drive. Or raise the glass and annoy Janet.\u201d</p><p>Max pressed his lips together, as if hiding a smile. \u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Sitting in the front passenger seat, Janet shifted onto her hip so she was facing him. While it helped her sort through the paperwork she had in her lap, it also served the purpose of keeping an eye on their very important passenger.</p><p>Savannah Kensington was in her eighth month and had been put on bed rest five weeks ago for pre-eclampsia. Because of that condition, as well as being in her late thirties and having other physical factors that concerned the doctor, she had to go in for regular diagnostics to monitor the baby. Today she had one of those appointments, but she\u2019d called Janet early, before Matt arrived at the office. Janet had to hide her own smile, recalling the conversation.</p><p>\u201cJanet, when Matt gets there, please ask him if he could send the car to the house a couple hours early so I can go for a drive. I was a complete bitch this morning and I know he\u2019s likely to walk in and tell you he\u2019s cancelling his Baton Rouge meeting. If he does that, I swear to God I will lose it. Tell him I called to wish him a good day and to apologize for being cranky. Make it sound as though you suggested the drive, and I\u2019m very happy about it. Reassure him that we women know what we\u2019re doing, the universe is in balance, and we\u2019ll handle things. He can go to his meeting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it just a cover, or would you really like to go for a drive?\u201d Janet asked.</p><p>Though the man was a six-foot four-inch female fantasy, Matt Kensington, head of Kensington and Associates, was overprotective to the nth degree. As well as being his pregnant wife, Savannah was CEO of Tennyson Industries and a remarkably independent and self-contained woman. Sharing some of those same qualities, Janet understood the woman\u2019s state of mind, the frustration Savannah\u2019s weary sigh revealed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s utterly pathetic,\u201d she confided, \u201cbut I would love a drive. Maybe go to one of the parks and sit by the water for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pathetic,\u201d Janet assured her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you meant it. It\u2019s very difficult to get a lie past him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry impossible.\u201d There was a smile in Savannah\u2019s voice now. \u201cI owe all of you an apology. I know he\u2019s been coming to work agitated, and Matt agitated is like dealing with a wounded bear. Much like dealing with me, I expect. The only thing that\u2019s kept this pregnancy from triggering a double homicide is the innocent life we\u2019d be sacrificing.\u201d</p><p>Janet chuckled. \u201cPeter dropped Dana off at the church this morning, so Max may have come in early. I\u2019ll check and see if he\u2019s available.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive him my thanks and my regrets beforehand, since I\u2019m sure to be highly ungracious when he picks me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re men. They like it when beautiful women abuse them.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d disconnected the call, Janet had realized she had some paperwork that needed to go to the airport for signing by their private charter company. She could easily courier it, but with Matt and all the others heading out of New Orleans to go to Baton Rouge today, it was going to be relatively quiet. From Savannah\u2019s tone, she might appreciate having a woman along. Plus, if Max was driving...</p><p>So here she was. Savannah had insisted Max take them out to the airport first, and the women had chatted along the way, Janet bringing Savannah up to date on K&amp;A business matters she would find interesting, and any other tidbits about business district gossip and politics. Max put in a word now and then, but mostly he drove. Even so, Janet was far more aware of him than she knew she should be.</p><p>She could dismiss it as mere sexual attraction, because the former SEAL kept his body in the kind of shape that gave even the most practical woman salacious ideas. But since every one of the five-man K&amp;A executive team, including Matt, had the face and form to turn a woman\u2019s head three hundred and sixty degrees if necessary to secure a proper view, she was usually immune to that. However, there was a steady core to Max, a quiet mystery, that kept drawing her attention. Several vital issues made them incompatible, but even so...there was nothing wrong with thinking about it, was there?</p><p>They stopped at the park for about a half hour. Janet walked Savannah the short distance to a bench and stayed with her while Max relocated the car to the street, eschewing the more remote parking area provided off the road. He obviously had no intention of letting them out of his sight, even though Janet could buzz his cell.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like they all take a class,\u201d Savannah muttered. She waved Janet off once she was settled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go take a stroll? I\u2019m just going to sit here and watch the ducks a bit.\u201d</p><p>While her tone suggested she\u2019d be fine if Janet and Max jumped in the lake and drowned, Janet took no offense. Max had looked a little concerned when Savannah insisted on walking to the bench. Janet had given him a slight shake of her head, stopping him before he tried something admirable but misguided, like offering to carry Savannah, or driving the limo over the green and only stopping when the bumper was within a hair\u2019s breadth of the bench.</p> <p>If the whole world was hovering over her while she felt like an overinflated balloon, Janet expected she\u2019d be just as cranky as Savannah. She chose a bench about twenty-five yards away, making a show of checking her email on her phone. When she glanced over her shoulder toward the car, Max nodded to her, holding eye contact for an intriguingly long moment before shifting it back to his primary charge.</p><p>Janet was amused to find her cheeks warmed from the attention. Yes, definitely something fascinating about the man.</p><p>Savannah was gazing meditatively into space, oblivious to passing joggers and cyclists, the ripple of wind on the lake. Janet knew they didn\u2019t have to worry about her overdoing. No matter how hormonal or frustrated Savannah was, she and Matt were equally protective of their unborn child. Being downwind of the woman, Janet could hear Savannah humming a lullaby, all while keeping her arm curled beneath her belly, holding what would surely be their only biological child, given the difficulty of this pregnancy and Savannah\u2019s age.</p><p>Janet lifted her face to the wind, closing her eyes. She didn\u2019t do enough of this, simply taking a moment to relax. She wondered what it would be like if it was just her and Max, and he was sitting next to her. He\u2019d likely be as quiet as he always was. She imagined reading next to him, his arm along the back of the bench, fingers sliding along her upper arm as he gazed up into the branches of a live oak spread over them. He would be like that tree, a powerful, comforting presence.</p><p>Maybe Max was her midlife crisis. She could do far worse.</p><p>Once back in the car, Savannah said little. She instructed Max to drive around the city, making loops through different districts until it was time to head for the doctor\u2019s. Then she laid her head back on the seat as she studied the passing terrain. Glancing over at Max, Janet noticed him checking his rearview mirror. He\u2019d been doing it even more frequently these past fifteen minutes, and now she realized he wasn\u2019t watching traffic, but Savannah. Taking her legal pad, she scribbled the question, turned it in his direction. Problem?</p><p>He shook his head, checked the mirrors once again. Janet followed his gaze. Savannah\u2019s thick-lashed eyes were half closed. Her long blonde tail of hair fanned out over her shoulder. The woman was stunningly beautiful on a normal day. Despite the changes to her body, pregnancy had enhanced her attraction, making her blue eyes more vivid, the golden hair even softer and thicker. She projected ice princess calm, but it came with a physical delicacy that drew men to her. Her designer maternity wear was a tailored pale-green creation with pleats and slashes forming soft folds from the empire waist. Janet noticed Savannah had her hands on that expanse of cloth, pressing her palms against her stomach here and there. Perhaps she was having cramps or gas pains. She wondered if that was why Max kept checking on her.</p><p>\u201cJust a feeling,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll take you back by the office and then run her home. Maybe hang around a while.\u201d</p><p>Janet debated whether to ask him for more details, but then\u2014unfortunately\u2014she didn\u2019t have to ask.</p><p>There was a sudden indrawn breath from the back, followed by a sharper, startled gasp. When her head snapped around, Janet saw Savannah had gone from a relaxed position to one where she was hunched forward, both arms curled around her belly. \u201cJanet...\u201d</p><p>From Matt, Janet knew Savannah was stoic about pain, barely made a whimper about anything. Now a cry wrenched from her lips, strangled back with the greatest of effort. \u201cOh...Oh God...this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the back,\u201d Max ordered, flipping the console out of Janet\u2019s way. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Janet was already in motion, abandoning her heels so they wouldn\u2019t slow her down as she navigated between the front seats. The moment she was seated next to Savannah in the roomy back area, the limo leaped forward. Max was buzzing the office, using the steering wheel controls to activate his hands-free.</p><p>\u201cRandall, I\u2019m en route to the hospital with Mrs. Kensington.\u201d He glanced at the GPS, and Janet saw the ETA was approximately thirty minutes with traffic. His jaw tightened. \u201cHer ob-gyn needs to be contacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer pager and cell numbers are on my desk, right next to the phone.\u201d Janet jumped in immediately. Max\u2019s gaze caught hers in the mirror. \u201cTell them she\u2019s experiencing constant pain and...\u201d Janet laid her hands over Savannah\u2019s, gripping her stomach. The area was hard. Really hard. Oh God. \u201cHer stomach is rigid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn short, prepare them for an emergency, in case that\u2019s what this is.\u201d Janet was impressed by how calm Max sounded, looked. There was no doubt it was definitely an emergency, but he had the presence of mind to make it seem like anything else was a possibility. She\u2019d never seen Savannah look frightened before. It flipped the same switch for Janet, taking her to a cool place in her head, a place where everything else shut down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMax is going to get us there,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts. Oh God...this doesn\u2019t feel like labor. There\u2019s no...end...to it. Oh God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Hold on to me.\u201d Feeling wetness, Janet looked down, bit back an oath. Blood was dripping down Savannah\u2019s legs. She pulled off her trim suit jacket, balled it up. \u201cOpen your legs, honey. It\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s just press this here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d She changed her mind. Matt Kensington could scent a lie, but his wife\u2019s radar was just as sharp, perhaps even more so in this state. The kid wouldn\u2019t get anything past either one of them. \u201cSavannah, you\u2019re hemorrhaging. Let\u2019s see if we can get that slowed down. Press your legs together, tight. I\u2019m going to lay you down, get your hips propped up. I know it hurts, but try to stay as still as you can.\u201d</p><p>Thank God the limo had backseats like wide couches. Janet had no idea if the change in position would help, but she couldn\u2019t imagine Savannah being upright when blood was dripping out of her would be helpful. As she helped her maneuver, she saw Savannah\u2019s gaze latch on to the front of Janet\u2019s blouse. In changing her grip on the coat between Savannah\u2019s legs, she\u2019d smeared herself with a liberal amount of blood.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Savannah\u2019s jaw firmed. Shuddering with pain, she curled her arms tighter around her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m not losing you, angel. You stay with me. Matt...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandall will call him first thing after the doctor. He\u2019ll be on his way. It\u2019s all right. Women can handle everything, remember? By the time Daddy gets there, the universe will be aligned, everything will be in balance. We\u2019ll be sharing a latt\u00e9 and cooing over your new baby.\u201d God willing.</p> <p>\u201cUnh...\u201d Savannah\u2019s cry wrenched everything inside Janet, but she quelled it, keeping her hands steady over the woman\u2019s. Her stomach was like a stale egg, no sense of movement or life, and she knew Savannah registered it as well. Janet met her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. The baby\u2019s in there fighting. You can\u2019t be scared. You don\u2019t want to scare her.\u201d</p><p>Savannah nodded. She closed her eyes, tears of stress on her face, her lips pressed together tight. She tried to hum a little, like she had when she was on the park bench, and Janet joined her, smoothing her hands over her stomach, very lightly, since everything seemed to be causing Savannah pain.</p><p>As she did that, a part of her stayed aware of other things. The world was flashing by, the limo moving in a zigzag pattern that was remarkably smooth, though constant. Constant movement didn\u2019t happen in New Orleans traffic. When she tuned in to what was happening, she felt like she was perched on a roller coaster car, careening through a minefield.</p><p>Max was maneuvering the limo between cars as if they were orange cones on a professional course. He never touched the horn, knowing New Orleans drivers were cantankerous enough to slam on brakes at such an insult, but Janet suspected he didn\u2019t need the warning signal. All they had to do was look up in their mirror, see that black behemoth bearing down on them with no intent of stopping. If they weren\u2019t fast enough to shift out of the way before he got there, he was already around them. He barely braked at the stoplights, not checking green or red, merely whether he had an access to get through them.</p><p>She\u2019d heard that Max knew combat driving, part of his SEAL training, but she\u2019d had no idea what it meant until now. Though she was a pretty adventurous driver herself, she wondered if it was the better part of valor to keep her full attention on Savannah. The decision was made when he dodged a traffic snarl by roaring up an alley, narrowly missing an officer on horseback. The cop shouted, but Janet would be surprised if he got anything more than two letters of the back plate before Max screeched around the next turn.</p><p>\u201cSo...did Matt make you come with me today?\u201d</p> <p>She looked back down. Savannah had gritted out the words, though she appeared to be concentrating for all she was worth on something deep inside of her. Though she\u2019d never been one comfortable with intimate gestures, intuition had Janet stroking the woman\u2019s hair back, then locking her hand with hers once again, all while keeping the other hand busy pressing the compress between Savannah\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cNo. You gave me the perfect opportunity to make my move with Max. I was just about to jump him in the front seat before you interrupted us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I thought it was my day to jump him. Dana shouldn\u2019t have all the fun.\u201d Savannah gave her a grimace that passed as a smile, then she jacked forward over Janet\u2019s hand \u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, honey. You make any noise that helps.\u201d</p><p>Savannah shook her head, but the moans kept vibrating in her throat. Janet hummed the lullaby, rocking with Savannah, tiny movements that might help mitigate the pain, but not nearly enough.</p><p>\u201cDr. Rosen\u2019s on the other line,\u201d Randall barked through the speakers, because Max had kept the connection open with him. \u201cShe wants to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bleeding badly, and her stomach is still hard. The pain is constant, going on six minutes now.\u201d</p><p>Janet leaned forward to be sure Randall could hear her. The coat was getting heavier, telling Janet blood was soaking it. She could feel it trickling down her arm. When Max\u2019s eyes coursed over her bloody blouse, his expression reflected her own reaction. \u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>She heard garbled voices, Randall communicating with the doctor on another line, then he was back. \u201cMax, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Janet saw the GPS had realized what kind of driver it had. The ETA was now ten minutes out, even though for a normal driver it would be twenty. Max merged onto the interstate, the limo shooting into the middle lane. As he did, the speedometer tipped past a hundred. Janet was aware of the cars flashing by outside, but that wasn\u2019t her concern. Everything was blood and pain, Savannah gasping.</p><p>\u201cAbout eight to ten minutes,\u201d Max responded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Randall began.</p><p>\u201cMatt...\u201d Savannah\u2019s cry of agony blasted through the limo, bringing the security chief up short. Randall\u2019s stomach had probably jumped into his throat, same as Janet\u2019s had.</p><p>\u201cHas Matt been called?\u201d Janet asked sharply, squeezing Savannah\u2019s leg. Hold on, honey...</p><p>\u201cHe was already on his way back. He left the meeting early. He\u2019s about thirty minutes away. Don\u2019t crash into each other in the hospital parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew... Janet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. The man\u2019s omniscient. You know that. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. You just focus on breathing, and getting you and that baby there. Dr. Rosen will make it right. Matt put the best baby doctor on the Eastern seaboard up in a penthouse apartment, just for you. Remember? He\u2019s not going to let anything happen to this child, or to you. Savannah.\u201d</p><p>Janet sharpened her tone, bringing Savannah\u2019s attention back to her. \u201cHe takes care of you. You\u2019re his. He\u2019d expect you to remember that.\u201d</p><p>It was something they never talked about directly, but of course Janet knew that Matt Kensington was a sexual Dominant. All five of the K&amp;A top management team were. Their wives, including Savannah, were strong, fascinating and accomplished women, and every one of them was her respective Master\u2019s submissive soulmate. Now, in this moment, where pain threatened to take away Savannah\u2019s strength and courage, Janet reminded her she\u2019d surrendered herself to Matt Kensington, trusting him utterly.</p><p>Mission accomplished. Savannah\u2019s blue eyes flickered as if Janet had thrown her a lifeline. The pregnant woman was wearing the delicate collar he\u2019d given her, and her fingers went to it now, bloodying the rose quartz and silver. Her eyes closed against the pain, but the words she spoke were fierce.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him down. I won\u2019t let either of them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows that. They both do. We\u2019ve got you. You keep thinking about that, honey.\u201d</p><p>Savannah\u2019s eyes opened once more. Janet saw the strength of character that either impressed or scared the hell out of everyone who met Matt\u2019s wife. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight, Janet, but if something happens, you tell them to save this little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, but a baby needs a mother. You fight, honey. Fight like you\u2019ve never fought before. You survived over thirty years with that brute of a father of yours. This is a piece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always...know...so much. I\u2019m glad Matt...has you.\u201d Savannah\u2019s head jerked back abruptly, her body contorting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here.\u201d Janet clung to her. \u201cYou listen to me. I\u2019m not taking your place, I can damn sure tell you that. Working for him\u2019s bad enough. Doesn\u2019t matter how much money he has or what he can do to a woman with his dick. So you better not go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Savannah was well beyond smiling, but Janet\u2019s resort to the shocking language made her strangle on a chuckle. \u201cCan\u2019t wait...to tell...him you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deny it. Tell him you were delirious.\u201d Glancing up, Janet was relieved to see the hospital sign flash by. The limo skidded to a halt at the emergency entrance. Underlining how serious the situation was, Dr. Rosen was already waiting with a gurney and a small army of medical personnel.</p><p>Before Max had brought the limo to a full halt, the ob-gyn surgeon had her hand on the door handle. Janet backed up, squeezing Savannah\u2019s hand with one last reassurance before the medical staff swarmed into the limo like ants. She found the door behind her open, Max helping her out of the way, his hand on her elbow. He had his eyes fastened on what they were doing, the shocking pool of blood on the seat and floor.</p><p>Seeing it herself, her knees started to wobble. No, she couldn\u2019t do that. She had to listen to what they were saying, do what needed to be done, be ready to tell Matt everything he needed to know when he arrived. There would be paperwork to handle inside, because there always was. Most important, she needed to stay as close to Savannah as she could, as long as they would let her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo with her,\u201d Max said, reading her mind as the medical team got Savannah out of the limo. \u201cI\u2019ll park and come find you. I\u2019ll take care of everything. Go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, following the gurney and Dr. Rosen. His sudden absence felt like an amputation, as if what had happened in the limo had fused them together. Savannah was whisked away, the staff headed for the surgical wing. It left Janet swaying in front of the ER admitting desk. The stout, silver-haired nurse she faced looked like she regularly handled the worst that NOLA could deliver. Now she gave Janet a once-over. \u201cLet\u2019s get the basics, then we\u2019ll get you some scrubs and a sink.\u201d</p><p>Janet glanced down. Things had gone far beyond that initial smear to her blouse. She was soaked in Savannah\u2019s blood. On her clothes, her hands and arms. It was probably even smeared on her face. Oh God, if Matt...</p> <p>\u201cJanet.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. Damn the man\u2019s timing. Giving the nurse a look she hoped conveyed the possible need for a second gurney, she turned to face Matt as he came through the emergency doors. Had he conjured a winged horse to get here right on Max\u2019s heels? It wouldn\u2019t surprise her if he had. Matt Kensington\u2019s abilities exceeded that of a mortal man\u2019s. Most of the time.</p><p>His piercing gaze took in her appearance. In the next moment, Matt Kensington turned pale as a ghost, his face gripped with an anguish and fear that tore her heart from its framework.</p><p>Once, a long time ago, Matt Kensington had stood between Janet and the loss of her soul. She\u2019d do everything she could to return the favor now. Fight like a tiger, honey. Fight for him, because he needs you so much more than you realize. And we all need him.</p><p>Or maybe Savannah did realize it. The way she\u2019d looked at Janet, her gaze practically boring into her. I\u2019m glad Matt has you.</p> <p>Closing the distance between them, she put her hands on Matt\u2019s forearms, despite the blood she transferred to his white shirt. He\u2019d shed his jacket and tie in the car. In that uncertain moment before she spoke, when he didn\u2019t yet know what had happened, she thought she might be holding him up.</p><p>\u201cThey took her to surgery. The uterus wall detached, Matt. They have to operate now to save her and the baby.\u201d</p><p>In certain situations, time really had no meaning. It was simply one task after another, lined up to keep the cold knot of fear at bay, the knowledge that everything might be brought to a screeching halt by a doctor\u2019s somber face, the resigned gaze. By the time she and Matt were in the surgery waiting room, Max had joined them. With barely a glance, Max understood what she needed. He sat down with Matt, beginning to relay additional details in that direct way that helped her usually unflappable boss. Information. Men always thought it could help solve things, change them.</p><p>Max had pressed her cell phone into her hand, along with her hands-free earpiece. When he did, he\u2019d tightened his fingers on her briefly. She kept him and Matt in her sight but out of hearing range as she started her list of calls. Matt hadn\u2019t given her any guidance, but then he rarely had to do so for any situation. She wouldn\u2019t be seeking any for this one. Now that the initial shock was wearing off, he was practically vibrating with suppressed fury and frustration. Savannah and his child were behind a closed door somewhere, going through an indescribable trauma, yet he couldn\u2019t help them, couldn\u2019t be at their side.</p><p>Her first call was the most important, yet the one she hoped would be least necessary. \u201cYes, may I speak to Reverend Dana? Thanks... Dana, this is Janet. Savannah\u2019s in surgery. Something went wrong.\u201d When her voice quavered, she stopped herself, forced it to calm before continuing. \u201cYou need to come right away. Matt may need you. I\u2019ll have Randall send a car. Call Jon and have him come straight to the hospital as well.\u201d</p><p>Dana would call all of them, all four of Matt\u2019s executive team and their wives, not just Jon. However, if the worst happened, Dana and Jon were the ones Matt would need most. The worst simply couldn\u2019t happen, however. Janet refused to accept that. She thought of Savannah\u2019s jaw firming, the determination in the pain-racked features. She would fight. No matter her pain, no matter her exhaustion, angels would have to drag Savannah Kensington\u2019s soul screaming from that room to take her away from the child and husband she loved so much.</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d She turned to see an orderly, a gentle black giant with the brown eyes of a deer, standing by her. He held a set of scrubs and a pair of disposable booties. It was the first time she realized she was walking around in her stockings.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a size small to me,\u201d he said kindly, indicating the scrubs, \u201cbut I brought a medium as well, just in case.\u201d</p><p>He directed her to the bathroom, fortunately placed right across from the waiting room. Max acknowledged her gesture, letting him know where she\u2019d be, then she disappeared behind the wooden door.</p><p>She knew it was a mistake, but after she closed the door, she turned and looked at herself in the mirror. With the next breath, she was somewhere else entirely.</p><p>Another bathroom, very different from this sterile environment. There\u2019d been a gilt-edged mirror, gold fixtures, a marble floor and countertops, but blood didn\u2019t care about such things. She\u2019d had it in her hair but hadn\u2019t remembered when it had gotten there. It had also splattered across her face. She remembered that. That was what happened when you hit an artery. She\u2019d stood in the bathroom, holding the knife and meat cleaver in her hands. For endless moments, she\u2019d simply stared at them. The rage that had kept her going, made her incapable of stopping, was draining from her like blood itself. Her legs ached, an incomprehensible irony...and vindication.</p><p>No. Stop it. That\u2019s over and done. No time for that shit right now.</p><p>\u201cJanet.\u201d</p><p>She came back to the present like she\u2019d been shot, with a jerk and wide, staring eyes. Max was standing right behind her. She hadn\u2019t locked the bathroom door. She\u2019d pulled off the shirt, was standing there in her lace bra and her skirt, her stockings. The blood had soaked through the thin blouse, so she had a stain on one of the bra cups. Fortunately, he\u2019d closed the door behind them so passersby couldn\u2019t see her. Or Matt.</p> <p>\u201cMatt...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas just got here. He\u2019s with him. Apparently the meeting finished earlier than expected. They\u2019re all headed back into New Orleans now.\u201d</p><p>She was still gripping the sink, and the blood had created pale pink rivulets on the white tile. \u201cOkay. All right.\u201d</p><p>Picking up one of the washcloths the orderly had given her with the scrubs, Max ran it under a stream of warm water. He gave her a look, making sure she was okay with it, then rubbed the cloth over her shoulders, down her sternum, over the tops of her breasts, her upper abdomen. He took away the blood, left warm, clean dampness behind. Balling up the blouse, he jammed it in the biohazard can, no question that she could ever wear it again. She had her hair in a twist on her head, but some pieces had come down. He moved them out of his way to run the cloth over her neck. Then he rinsed out the cloth, picked up a clean one and did it all over again, covering the same terrain.</p><p>She stared at his face throughout. No thoughts in her head, though she should be thinking of a hundred details. His face wasn\u2019t expressionless, not exactly. It was like staring at one of those old concrete statues tucked in the corner of a garden. Something that had been there forever, seen everything come and go, and still it stood, just as strong. \u201cYou did good,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cSo did you. You could be a combat nurse.\u201d Those steady gray eyes held hers in a lock as intimate as a physical embrace. \u201cYou with me now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He picked up the scrub top, offered it to her. If she didn\u2019t pull it together, he\u2019d probably help her take off the skirt, dress her in the drawstring pants like a child. She cleared her throat, resisting the urge to let him do just that. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ll be out in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d But before he turned away, he did something remarkable. He put his arms around her. Despite her surprised stiffness, he closed the step between them to hold her close. The contact with his body sent a current through her, waking up frozen nerve endings. As he cupped the back of her head in one large palm, his heat and strength surrounded her. She once again remembered the way he\u2019d navigated through that traffic, never showing panic or lack of control. Neither had she. He was right. They\u2019d both done damn good.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, after something like that, human touch helps ground you, brings back your focus.\u201d He spoke against her hair.</p><p>It did. \u201cIt does,\u201d she said into his chest. \u201cThank you, Max.\u201d</p><p>As she expected, all four of his team came, with their wives or significant others. She leaned against the wall, watching the way they formed a protective circle around Matt, supporting him. All of them waiting.</p><p>Jon Forte sat in a chair at Matt\u2019s back, a deliberate choice, Janet was sure. Though in business Jon was Matt\u2019s engineering genius, with a secondary but no less significant talent for finance, that wasn\u2019t the reason she\u2019d felt it was as imperative for him to be here as Dana. The other men, more traditional Southern males, routinely teased Jon for his philosophical studies of ancient texts and the advanced yoga practice that gave his leanly muscled form a tensile strength, but their respect for his sincere and solid spiritual core was obvious in difficult situations like this.</p><p>Rachel, Jon\u2019s wife, had just brought another round of coffee from the cafeteria. After she distributed it, she took a seat next to Jon, her hazel eyes serious. Because Rachel\u2019s blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail, Janet clearly saw the strain in her face they were all feeling. There were so many connections in this room...that had to mean something, didn\u2019t it? A sense that things happened for a reason, that truly bad things couldn\u2019t happen when bonds were this strong and fated?</p><p>For instance... Rachel was a physical therapist, but it was her second job, that of yoga instructor, that had brought her across Jon\u2019s path. When he learned about the PT, that had connected her to Dana. Dana was an Army veteran who\u2019d needed Rachel\u2019s skills. Peter Winston, Matt\u2019s operations manager and a former National Guard captain who\u2019d served two tours in the Middle East, was her husband. He\u2019d retired to care for Dana when she came back from Iraq so severely injured she lost her sight and most of her hearing. Fortunately, cochlear implant surgery had helped her regain much of the latter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Janet shifted her gaze to Peter, his powerful body squeezed into a chair next to Dana. Since Max was Dana\u2019s primary driver, the men often teased the big man about how similar he was to Max in build and coloring, with his storm-gray eyes and dark-blond hair. Nobody was teasing anyone right now, however.</p><p>Thinking about the men\u2019s similarities, she turned her head to locate Max. He was standing at the corner of the waiting room, ready to help. He met her gaze briefly as she turned, then Janet\u2019s attention was pulled to more pressing matters.</p><p>\u201cFuck this.\u201d Matt surged up from the seat and moved toward the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m going to her.\u201d</p> <p>Peter was already in motion, but it was Lucas who was closest and intercepted him, shifting a step ahead of Matt.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, man. You know that. She\u2019s in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs me. They need me.\u201d But the emotions beneath the rage said the words Matt was too much of a traditional, stoic male to say. I need them.</p><p>\u201cI know that. But you don\u2019t want to distract them from what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re doing everything they can for her, and you don\u2019t want them to spare a single second from that, right?\u201d</p><p>Lucas, the voice of calm reason, Matt\u2019s CFO and best friend since college. As an amateur cyclist who regular biked to work, the gray-eyed, sandy-haired, athletic male took his share of ribbing over stretchy shorts and compressed testicles, but his success in the sport reflected the focus and calm thinking he exercised now. He knew Matt so well...they all knew one another so well. The bonds they\u2019d formed, through laughter and tears, were unbreakable. Janet\u2019s fervent hope was the former, or something in a similar positive vein, would prevail by the end of this day.</p> <p>She saw Cassandra, Lucas\u2019 wife, link hands with Rachel. The way their fingers tightly intertwined reflected the anguish they felt for Matt, the worry for Savannah. They were all so used to Matt being in total command of himself and everything around him, the undercurrent of agony in his voice twisted something in all of them. Including Janet.</p><p>Ben joined Lucas now, on the opposite side of Matt, a subtly strategic move in case he bolted anyway, but Janet could tell her boss knew Lucas was right. He was simply a man of action. The waiting was killing him. And Ben knew it.</p><p>\u201cTell you what. Let Marcie go stake out the emergency room and see if she can get somebody going in and out to tell her anything. Best if you stay here, though, in case someone from admin needs anything from you, or if the doctor slips out a different door and she misses her.\u201d</p><p>Ben was legal muscle for K&amp;A. With his devilish good looks\u2014green eyes, dark hair and silver tongue\u2014he was quite capable of convincing anyone of anything, but Janet understood why he was sending Marcie. Marcie, Cass\u2019 younger sister, worked in corporate investigations for Savannah\u2019s company, and no one was better at convincing people to inadvertently give up confidential information. And the attractive blonde with chocolate-brown eyes was only twenty-three, with a fresh-faced beauty and deceptive innocence that only enhanced that ability.</p><p>When Matt gave a grudging nod, rubbing a hand over his face, Ben glanced toward Marcie. No words needed to be exchanged for her to understand her task, and not just because she was just that intuitive. She and Ben had been an item for less than a couple months, but with such a bonded intensity that they all expected an engagement announcement any day now. She disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>Connections, bonds, fate. Janet repeated the thought to herself. The five men had supported one another through loss and gain, as well as when each man found the woman of his dreams. Those shared experiences, as well as the traits they had in common, like sexual Dominance, had made their relationship far beyond that of simple friendship. It was an unconditional brotherhood. As Janet looked around at the women, seeing faces that reflected a fear of the worst but also a complete commitment to support Matt and their men, whatever the outcome, she knew the women had become part of that inner circle as well.</p> <p>She thought of Savannah, the grip of her hands, the fear in her eyes. Whatever happened, Matt would have these people. His link to them would help him survive. But Janet knew what kind of road that was, and she wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.</p><p>Marcie returned with a report that Savannah was holding her own, but that the outcome for mother or child was still in the balance. Janet could tell Marcie wished she had better news, but she delivered it with painful honesty, knowing Matt wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less.</p><p>He nodded, taking a silent seat in his chair once again, staring straight ahead. Ben touched Marcie\u2019s face, gave her a reassuring nod and the girl returned to Dana\u2019s side. The vigil resumed.</p><p>In some ways, Janet knew the news made things worse for Matt, but now he\u2019d lapsed into a raptor-like stillness, staring at something beyond all of them. Just waiting. For the next hour, less than a dozen words were exchanged.</p><p>Finally, Dr. Rosen arrived in the waiting room.</p><p>She looked exhausted. Yet when Matt pushed up from his seat and faced her with the fixed expression of a man locked in stone, she gripped his hands and told him the thing he most needed to hear. \u201cThey\u2019re both fine.\u201d</p><p>Lucas put his hand on Matt\u2019s shoulder as a hard shudder ran through the man\u2019s large body, the stone cracking. The doctor proceeded to explain Matt had a healthy, six-pound baby girl, and that his wife, when she woke from her surgery, would want to see him first thing.</p><p>But Janet had been right. This would be their only birth child. They had to remove Savannah\u2019s uterus, a full hysterectomy, but otherwise she was going to make a complete recovery. Amid the tears and congratulations, Dr. Rosen added, \u201cWhoever your driver is, Mr. Kensington, he saved your daughter\u2019s life, and very likely your wife\u2019s. Ten minutes later, and we\u2019d have lost both of them.\u201d</p> <p>Janet turned toward the entrance to the waiting room. Max had remained at that far wall like a soldier on watch duty, prepared for anything, but now he was gone. When she peered around the corner, she saw him striding down the hall toward the elevators. Mission accomplished, right? Though in a far less intense context, it was the same when she planned a major event for K&amp;A. She didn\u2019t usually stay for the event itself, only long enough to confirm she\u2019d exceeded every expectation Matt had for it. For people like her and Max, having accomplished their mission was the victory. They didn\u2019t need to stand around for the parade.</p><p>However, when Max reached the stairs, he stopped and looked back, as if knowing she was standing there. A muscle flexed in his jaw, and he lifted a hand, acknowledging her. Then the fingers curled and his face changed. The flash of regret told her he\u2019d hoped to escape when he had the chance. A blink later, Matt touched her shoulder, passing her to move down the hall toward his employee.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear what her boss said to Max, because his voice was low, and got lower. She saw him gesturing, then Matt\u2019s hands fell to his sides, conveying a helpless inability to express what was beyond words. Max\u2019s expression transformed, reflecting the empathy a strong man felt when another strong man faltered. He stepped forward, putting his arms around Matt\u2019s broad shoulders. It was a good thing they were a like height.</p><p>Janet had to slide down the wall, her eyes filling with tears. Her legs simply gave way at the unlikely sight of Matt Kensington, the most indomitable man she knew, weeping. Max\u2019s face had that aged granite look as he held Matt. But his gray eyes shifted, locked with hers. Throughout the next few memorable moments, he didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Neither did she.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Six months later</p><p>\u201cRandall, is Max in yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She paused by the security desk, arching a brow. The head of K&amp;A security pressed a button on his console, calling up the needed camera angle on the top covered level of the parking deck. \u201cHe\u2019s not on until noon, but most mornings, this is where you\u2019ll find him. He won\u2019t mind doing anything you need, as long as you don\u2019t mind he\u2019s not in uniform. Want me to buzz him? He\u2019s wearing his pager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to stretch my legs. I\u2019ll go to him.\u201d</p><p>Randall nodded, waited until she was a safe distance down the hall, then murmured, \u201cAnd fucking fantastic legs they are. Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Janet paused at the elevator, a good fifty feet away, and glanced back at him, a glint in her eye. Randall cleared his throat, paid close attention to his monitors and didn\u2019t let out a breath until he heard the elevators close. Jim, the desk guard, gave him a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave man. Mr. Kensington says she can hear through concrete walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I added the \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019?\u201d Randall responded wryly.</p><p>\u201cShould we give Max a heads-up she\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>Randall shook his head. \u201cThe moment she steps into the parking-deck elevator, he\u2019ll hear it engage. He\u2019ll be tracking where it stops.\u201d</p><p>Jim studied the video dubiously. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. He can tell you how many bugs have scurried across the parking deck in the past half hour, and give you their current coordinates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince she can hear through walls, sounds like they\u2019re made for each other.\u201d</p><p>Randall pursed his lips. Imagining Janet Albright, Matt Kensington\u2019s terrifying admin, and Max Ackerman, his head limo driver, as a couple wasn\u2019t as unlikely a vision as he\u2019d expected. In fact, it might be a mighty interesting combination. \u2019Course, an explosion was interesting\u2014if you were outside the blast zone.</p><p>Janet stepped off the parking elevator, careful not to snag her heels on its metal threshold, and headed toward the back corner of the parking deck. Her glossy brown pumps made a crisp echo on the concrete. Glancing over the wall at the New Orleans business district, she drew in the faintly smoky air, pleased to detect the cool scent of fall beneath the city smells. But as she made the turn toward that back corner, other scenery captured her attention.</p><p>Randall had said Max wouldn\u2019t mind running her errand as long as she didn\u2019t mind he wasn\u2019t in uniform. She wasn\u2019t sure there was a red-blooded woman alive who would mind that. He looked handsome in his various uniforms, everything from the traditional chauffeur\u2019s suit to the more informal black dress jeans and crisp black placket shirt with the embroidered K&amp;A insignia. However, in the blue jeans and dark-blue T-shirt he wore now, he was pure sex. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had his muscled arms crossed over his broad chest, his back braced against his windshield in his reclined position on the hood of his battered Ford Ranger pickup. The jeans were classic Wranglers, worn down to that soft cling that drew the female eye to all the right points of groin, thighs and ass. Despite the covered parking deck, he wore sunglasses, which made it impossible to determine if his eyes were open, but she knew they were. She suspected they\u2019d opened as soon as she stepped off the elevator.</p><p>Max had been working for K&amp;A for over six years but had taken over management of the fleet after less than two years with the company. He oversaw maintenance of the vehicles and management of the rotating staff of eight drivers. One of his important secondary duties was being Dana\u2019s driver, taking her to and from her job as assistant pastor at one of the local churches. Peter and Max looked enough alike that the other men teased Peter, telling him he\u2019d provided his wife a surrogate for the frequent times he had to be out of the country, dealing with their Central American plant operations.</p><p>The physical features of the two men were remarkably similar, dark-blond hair and gray eyes, both over six feet and possessing a large-boned build wrapped in a lot of military-trained muscle. However, to Janet\u2019s way of thinking, their respective personalities gave each man a unique stamp. They both had the discipline and strong moral code of many servicemen, but there was a silent core to Max, seemingly impenetrable. When he met her gaze, she felt pulled into that silence, and it wasn\u2019t a bad place to be. A gray, overcast day, no break in the cloud cover, somber but comforting, like a blanket being wrapped around the earth.</p> <p>She\u2019d dreamed a lot about those eyes in the past six months. They\u2019d gotten in the pleasant habit of interrupting her occasional nightmares, driving them away with their tails tucked between their legs.</p><p>The limo he usually drove was parked in its spot along the back wall, pristine and gleaming, the way he made sure all vehicles in the fleet were kept by the team he supervised. Though his older-model pickup truck had seen some fender benders, it was equally clean and polished. His sturdy, thick-tread work shoes were crossed at the ankle but projected over the edge of the hood, not making contact with the paint. He not only took good care of what he was paid to maintain, but his own belongings as well, no matter their age or condition. A woman noticed such things.</p><p>Music was wafting out of the truck window, and the selection surprised her. I\u2019ll Never Find Another You by the Seekers. The poignant, innocent sound of it made her think of waltzing across the concrete with him, her hand curled on his neck, a faint smile in her heart.</p><p>Ever since Savannah had given birth to sweet Angelica, the idle fascination Janet had with the limo driver had grown far stronger. The man had been positively heroic, getting Savannah to the hospital under trying circumstances. It would have made any woman\u2019s heart trip faster. But Janet knew he\u2019d intrigued her for quite a while before that. That day, as now, she reminded herself she\u2019d kept her distance for several intelligent reasons.</p><p>Yet here she was, seeking him out for something any of the other on-duty drivers would be happy to do for her. It told her she\u2019d reached some kind of decision in her mind. It was an intuitive thing, not fully formed, which wasn\u2019t the same as being impulsive or rash. She\u2019d mulled it over for well beyond those six months, yet recently realized the reason she couldn\u2019t get a clear sense of her intent with Max was because she needed more information to sift. So this was a planned direction, even if the road ahead was murky.</p> <p>Matt had told her Max was a former Navy SEAL. After looking up considerably more specific information on it, she\u2019d learned that meant he\u2019d left the SEALs before reaching the twenty-year retirement mark. Even so, she wasn\u2019t sure if the term \u201cformer\u201d or \u201cretired\u201d truly applied to a SEAL. The quick reflexes and cool nerve he\u2019d demonstrated the day they had to get Savannah to the hospital had underscored it. It was also why she knew his eyes were open behind those glasses, though he hadn\u2019t yet moved. Not until she turned with purpose in his direction. Then he slid off the hood in one powerful motion, taking off the glasses and hooking them in his shirt. She waved at him with the folder she carried.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t come to me. I\u2019m coming to you.\u201d</p><p>She issued it as a command, and he simply nodded. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d But he still took a couple steps toward her, showing he wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable waiting for her to do all the work to get to him. She really needed to sit in on hiring interviews one of these days. She was fairly certain Matt Kensington had the HR department subject all male applicants to a super-secret chivalry test handed down since Lancelot\u2019s days.</p><p>\u201cWere you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a short nap, ma\u2019am.\u201d He nodded at the folder. \u201cDo you need me to take that somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Though it had been her excuse for coming to him, she decided then and there she would send the documents to the bank with Wade later today, when he took Matt to his lunch meeting. She didn\u2019t dissemble when it suited no purpose. \u201cMax, do you dance?\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t expecting that. She experienced a small spurt of satisfaction at the flicker of surprise, and amusement when it turned to wariness. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a break. May I join you?\u201d She nodded to the hood of the truck. \u201cYou made that look very comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she visualized using his body the way he\u2019d used that truck, leaning back against his chest, her body ensconced in the cradle of his thighs, her hand caressing one as she put her head back on his shoulder and they gazed at the rectangular panorama of the city. He\u2019d be warm, she was sure, a good contrast to the touch of cool air wafting over the business district. She wouldn\u2019t miss the sweater she\u2019d left on her chair.</p><p>There was a reason she connected so well with the K&amp;A men. She herself was a sexual Dominant, one who regularly enjoyed playing Mistress to willing submissives at Club Progeny. As such, she was direct with men, in or outside a club. Her senses were tuned to evaluate how they responded to the unexpected. Max glanced at the hood of his truck, then at her pale-pink silk suit, his gaze lingering on her stocking-clad legs revealed by the just-above-the-knee hem. The short slit in the back offered a glimpse of her thigh, which she knew was what had caught Randall\u2019s eye. She dressed for business, but she also thoroughly enjoyed being an attractive middle-aged woman. She had no problem highlighting her better features within the tasteful boundaries of professionalism.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a boost,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll need to take off my shoes once I\u2019m there so they don\u2019t scratch your truck. Of course, you still haven\u2019t said whether you mind ten minutes of company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep up, ma\u2019am.\u201d He had a little bit of a Texas drawl, just like Matt. It was entrancing. \u201cWhy did you want to know if I dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI teach a ballet class for teenagers at the community center. We don\u2019t have any male dancers at the moment, and the girls want to learn some basic lifts. When a dancer first starts learning lifts, confidence in the strength of your lifter helps you focus on your form. You seem more than capable of lifting teenage girls. But it does require some grace and agility, which is why I asked about the dancing.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a critical look. \u201cYou move well, though, so even if you don\u2019t have any dance training, I think it will still work. If you\u2019re willing, it pays nothing, and it will take up a night of your time. Given your looks, I\u2019m sure it will also gain you the slavish adoration of a dozen underage girls. While I promise not to give them your social networking links, I can\u2019t guarantee they won\u2019t find them anyhow. A fourteen-year-old has ways of ferreting out information the CIA only wishes they knew.\u201d</p> <p>Putting the folder on the hood, she held out her hands. \u201cWant to prove you can lift something heavier than a teenager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I see something that is, I\u2019ll do that, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cCharm serves a man well, Max.\u201d She kept her arms out. She knew he couldn\u2019t let her stand that way for long without it becoming awkward or embarrassing for her, at least to his way of thinking. Sure enough, within a blink, he stepped forward to close the distance between them. When his hands settled on her waist, he met her gaze. If he\u2019d wanted to keep it more impersonal, he wouldn\u2019t have done that, so that alone gave her another intriguing piece of information about where this might go.</p><p>First intentional physical contact was a critical sensation, where she logged her own reaction as much as his. Heat swept out from where his hands closed over her waist. She felt the strength in his restrained power, saw the biceps flex as he tightened the grip and prepared to lift her. Then he stopped himself. \u201cHold on a moment.\u201d Releasing her to open the truck\u2019s door, he twisted his upper torso to reach behind the front seat. He came back with a rolled-up quilt in a brown-and-green camouflage pattern. He untied the straps, folded it into a rectangular cushion and put it on the hood where he\u2019d been about to place her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clean enough for me, but not that.\u201d He nodded to the pastel color of her suit. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get anything on it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think there was a speck of dust on the truck, but she appreciated the consideration. Now he lifted her. She\u2019d expected his display of easy strength, but her reaction when it swept through all her nerve endings startled her. During that effortless suspension, short as it was, she was catapulted to a memory of lights, a crowd\u2019s breathless attention as she bounded lightly across the stage, leaping into the capable hands of her partner, who lifted her high above his head.</p><p>Jorge had given her that moment. She couldn\u2019t deny that gift. He\u2019d also been the one to take it all away.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, realized she\u2019d simply gone away, too much like that night in the hospital bathroom. Her hands were gripping his on her waist, nails digging into his skin. He\u2019d put her on the truck hood, on the quilt. His hard abdomen was pressed against her knees as he held on to her, obviously not wanting to let her go until he was sure she was all right. Maybe for other reasons too, but it was a little too soon for that. She wasn\u2019t given to fanciful romanticizing. Then she thought about how she\u2019d imagined lying inside his embrace on top of the truck and realized he\u2019d already taken her down that road. Men didn\u2019t usually do that to her. Not anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. You did that very well. In fact, now I\u2019m not sure the girls will be able to focus on their form at all. You\u2019ll make them think they\u2019re swans, about to give flight. Which is actually what it feels like, when it\u2019s done right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dance too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Now I teach.\u201d She gave his hands a functional pat, a signal to let her go. They reflexively tightened, a brief squeeze, then slipped away, leaving her tingling. \u201cThank you. Please remove my shoes. You take very good care of this truck. I don\u2019t want to cause any scratches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s had its share of those.\u201d He paused. Wondering if he would kneel to take off her shoes, she played with that fantasy, but of course the truck was too high to make that necessary, and he wasn\u2019t that type of man. She already knew that much about him, one of the intelligent reasons she hadn\u2019t pursued anything with him. She liked her men submissive, and limited to a club setting. At least, she had, until Max started visiting her waking thoughts as much as he did her dreams.</p><p>He slipped off one of her pumps, his fingers sliding along her arch. She quelled her visible reaction to the arrow of sensation that went right up her inner thigh, but she savored it behind a neutral expression. When he touched the other arch the same way, she was sure he was testing her reaction, because he looked up at her, meeting her gaze once again. Setting the shoes carefully by the front tire, he leaned on the hood next to her, propping his elbow by her hip. He laced his fingers together, but his knuckles were a tempting distance from the modest section of thigh her seated position revealed.</p><p>When she glanced down at that small space, a weighted pause drew out between them, inundated with sexual awareness. She\u2019d introduced it by requesting a personal favor, suggesting physical contact, both of which encouraged a new level of intimacy between them. Now she waited to see what he would do with those signals. Studying her leg, his head bent so she could gaze upon the dark-blond strands across his crown, Max loosened his fingers. He allowed one to slide along her stocking, to the hem of the skirt and just under it, encountering the lace top of her thigh high. He stayed within that short range, his finger going still as he lifted his head to meet her gaze.</p><p>Nothing so sexy as a man who didn\u2019t doubt himself. She thought of the cameras, but where he was, his broad shoulders were blocking the lens. To Randall or anyone watching, Max was leaning against the truck, talking to her. Perhaps they were closer than the usual personal space boundary, but he\u2019d just lifted her onto the hood.</p><p>She had no doubt he\u2019d shifted into this position to ensure their privacy. It made her ache for more contact than just that casual fingertip. As a general rule, she wasn\u2019t impulsive when it came to desires. She might be guided by intuition, but it was disciplined and directed to enhance her own pleasure and that of the man she was controlling. However, this time her intuition was taking her down a path where things were far less calculated. \u201cYou always call me \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019,\u201d she said. His finger might be motionless, but since it was still beneath her skirt, resting on the lace top of her stocking, her leg was in danger of catching on fire. \u201cWhenever I tell you to call me Janet, you just nod and say, \u2018Yes ma\u2019am. Janet\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>His expression was somber. Though his attention returned to her leg, it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d lowered his gaze, not the way she was used to a man doing around her in a sexual situation. It was as if he was absorbing everything happening beneath and around his touch, sensing the simmer of her blood, the delicate ruffled shape of her clit swelling to ripe reaction. She thought of his mouth there and nearly shuddered.</p><p>\u201cJust the other day,\u201d she continued, \u201cI overheard you leaving Ben\u2019s office. Alice asked you something and you said, \u2018No problem. See you later, Alice\u2019. You call Alice by her name, Max. Yet you call me ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prefer ma\u2019am. You like it when men call you that.\u201d His gaze lifted then, and there was a heat in those gray irises. \u201cYour eyes get more focused, like now. It reminds me of a hawk. I like it. I think that\u2019s why you and Matt get along so well. You\u2019re both birds of prey.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWill you join me for the ballet class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext Thursday, seven to nine.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d She should meet him there, keep things on a controlled footing. Letting him drive might be relinquishing too much, sending the wrong message, but it took more than one detail to upset her balance of power. \u201cI\u2019d also like you to consider coming to Club Progeny one night, as my guest.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, taking his hand away to hook his thumb in his jeans pocket. He braced his other palm on the truck hood. A polite withdrawal. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about that world.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow. Matt, Lucas, Jon, Ben and Peter regularly took their women to Club Progeny, as well as Club Surreal in Baton Rouge. Despite her religious vocation, Dana was the most hardcore submissive of all the wives, and would be until Ben and Marcie decided to marry, since Marcie even eclipsed Dana in that department. Rachel was a close runner-up to Dana. Savannah and Cassandra were softer in that regard, but still very much in tune with their respective husbands\u2019 Dominant sides.</p><p>\u201cGiven the places you\u2019ve taken Matt and the others after hours, it doesn\u2019t say much about your eye for detail.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at his firm mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s seeing a world and knowing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you interested in an inside look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much. Except when you talk about it.\u201d His gaze slid over her, then back up to her face. \u201cI might like to see how you see it. But I don\u2019t do so well with getting more personal with people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could start with coffee,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nice coffee shop on Progeny\u2019s viewing deck. It even has a separate entrance and exit for those who want to observe but not participate. Street clothes only allowed. It\u2019s like being outside an aquarium, where you get to watch all the exotic life swim around.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cBut you already know that. Lucas says you\u2019ve hung out there some nights, watching the public sessions, until they\u2019re ready to go home.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t ask the obvious, if she\u2019d been checking up on him by fishing for information from Lucas. He just waited her out, probably to see what other information she\u2019d volunteer. He wasn\u2019t a nervous talker. That silent core, she reminded herself. It impressed her. As a result, she was willing to give him an idea of where her interest in him had been taking her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading about Navy SEALs. One thing that caught my interest was a description of what it was like to be down range, on a mission, in enemy territory. The SEAL who wrote the article said it was like being on a different plane, everything high intensity, hyper alert, every detail mattering.\u201d She glanced down at her leg, recalling for them both that single touch, his close attention to it.</p><p>\u201cIt made me wonder if you like watching the public sessions because a Dom and sub are exploring that intense immersion in detail. Their mission is this one focused goal, a goal the Dom always has to keep in sight, yet the journey to that goal is indescribable. The immersion itself is a drug, something you miss when you no longer have it. No matter how brutal or bloody it can be, how it tears you open or pushes you past your boundaries, you always want to go back for more.\u201d</p><p>She had his full attention now. Interestingly, that was all she had. Everything else had closed up, reminding her of a coiled snake, so close his fangs could reach her if he chose to strike. She could vividly imagine what it would be like if Max struck. Passion was a form of controlled violence, and she expected Max did controlled violence very well, if the quick shift from gray cloud to molten steel in his piercing gaze was any indication. Though he hadn\u2019t moved, he felt much closer, the way something did when it became far more dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you tried it, since you like watching?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lifted a hand toward her face. She intercepted it, a simple lift of her hand. When she pressed her knuckles against his palm, her long nails gleaming, she didn\u2019t push it away, just held enough pressure against it to keep him from touching her face. He let the hand stay there though, hovering near her lips, her lifted chin.</p><p>\u201cYou want to play it out this way?\u201d His voice was a rumble.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>He closed his hand, put it back down on the truck hood next to her leg. \u201cI\u2019m not the Master type. I\u2019m protective enough, but I couldn\u2019t tie up a woman or strike her. Even spanking. It\u2019s not how I roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve psychologically dominated every woman you\u2019ve been with. Just taken her over with that alpha vibe and made her surrender. You\u2019ve got the conqueror in you. Of course, sometimes you find that in a sub as well.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at that. \u201cI definitely couldn\u2019t be on the other side, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of us could be on either side. And you\u2019d be infinitely fascinating either way.\u201d She closed her hand over his thick wrist, the one attached to his braced hand. \u201cNotice when I touch you like this, everything between us gets still, focused, intent. What am I about to do? What are you reading from me, and me from you? There\u2019s an intensity to it. You\u2019re trusting me to care for you, watch your back, no matter what. And I\u2019m trusting you to do the same for me. Because whichever one is holding the reins, we both hold one another\u2019s souls, even if it\u2019s just for a short space of time.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his gaze, locked with hers. It recalled the night at the hospital, when he was holding Matt, yet the two of them couldn\u2019t look away from each other. That was really what she\u2019d been unable to forget or dismiss, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>He put his other hand over hers, fingers sliding over her knuckles, a lingering caress. Then he squeezed it, stepped back, taking both his hands away. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come in sometime when I\u2019m bringing Matt or one of the others. Just see if you\u2019re there and go from that point. It feels like it needs to be that way. More unplanned.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLess controlled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d She detected a hint of challenge in his tone, and met it with a cool gaze.</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d She glanced at her shoes, bemused when he immediately understood her desire. He retrieved them, sliding them back on her feet, his fingers once again sending those lovely ribbons of sensation spiraling around her calves and inner thighs.</p> <p>When she put her hands on his shoulders, she indulged the desire to slide her fingertips from the broad span up closer to his neck. His grip on her waist increased, his thumbs caressing her hip bones beneath the skirt, which sent a definite arrow of reaction between her legs. Her nipples tightened beneath the lacy bra. This man would be a thorough, overwhelming lover. That wasn\u2019t usually what she was seeking, but maybe her tastes were evolving.</p><p>\u201cI still have your shoes,\u201d he said as he put her on her feet. \u201cFrom that night at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>There were only a few inches between them, and he hadn\u2019t let her go. With the truck behind her, she was pleasantly enclosed between two very masculine, large objects. Lifting a brow, she slipped out of that narrow crevice and tapped him with the folder she retrieved from the truck hood. She wondered what he\u2019d do if she swatted him on his very fine ass with it, and expected he might swat her back. It almost made her laugh. Then she registered his words.</p><p>She pivoted to face him again. The intensity of his expression made her feel like she was flush against him. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to get them back to me in six months?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me for them.\u201d</p> <p>They studied one another. \u201cMax, I want my shoes.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cThere it is. That female hawk look.\u201d</p><p>She understood what he meant. She knew the feeling when it took her over, that sense of command, exercised over a male eager to experience her power. She didn\u2019t feel that eagerness from Max. More like intrigued curiosity, another type of raptor perched on a different branch, watching her with abiding interest.</p><p>He moved to the limo, opening the front door. Oblivious to what viewing the stretch and bend of that powerful body could do to her, he leaned across the seat, withdrew her shoes from a side compartment. She noticed he\u2019d wrapped them in a towel to protect them, and he took that off now, bringing her the dainty pumps, the sheen of the white-gold insoles a contrast to the polished outside walnut color. The shoes had ankle straps, but he carried them under the arches, rather than letting them dangle.</p><p>When he brought them to her, she closed her hands over the straps, pinching the back of the shoes between forefinger and thumb. As his hand slid away from the soles, her arches tingled, remarkably. What did the man wear? He had a scent like sea water and cotton, plus that musky heat that was distinctly male. Looking up at him, she saw he was staying put, less than a foot between the rise and fall of her breasts and his chest.</p><p>He lifted his hand, but this time she didn\u2019t stop him. He didn\u2019t reach toward her face. He slid beneath her bent arm and pressed his palm against her back, just below her shoulder blade. As if he was about to begin a proper ballroom waltz. She was always aware of her body\u2019s movements, particularly in relation to the give and take of a man\u2019s, and the way he eased them together was like clouds, a drift that seemed effortless.</p> <p>As he bent toward her, he kept his eyes open. So did she. When he put his mouth on hers, she saw the flicker in the gray, a reaction to how her lips parted, releasing a soft sigh into his mouth. He held the contact there, a bare touch, then he drew back, pressing his lips together.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if that gloss tastes the way it smells. Like honeysuckle. It does. There was a honeysuckle bush behind the house where I grew up.\u201d</p><p>She imagined him plucking a blossom, drawing out the threadlike inner stem, bringing that single drop of honey to his lips. Her body responded in the same manner. She felt the tiny blot of cream dampening her panties.</p><p>\u201cI have other flavors as well. But honeysuckle is my favorite.\u201d Turning, she moved back toward the elevators, making sure she kept her steps efficient and even as always, the sound of the heels against the concrete just as crisp. She\u2019d had twelve-hour rehearsals that required less effort than such nonchalance took.</p><p>She lifted the shoes out to her side, not turning. \u201cYou better not have stretched them out. And I hope you wore them with proper stockings.\u201d</p><p>At the elevators, she looked over her shoulder to see him leaning against the truck, watching her, one foot hooked around his ankle. The position made the most of every inch of his hard, powerful body.</p><p>His gaze sparked with humor. \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>With grim amusement, Max noticed he let out a breath after the elevator door closed. \u201cThat woman\u2019s a handful and a half,\u201d he muttered, but of course that just piqued the interest of his overachiever side. A side that embraced the SEAL maxims of be better than your best and the only easy day was yesterday.</p><p>Actually, he expected she was two handfuls. Two very nice handfuls.</p><p>Before the day in the limo with Mrs. Kensington, he\u2019d known pretty much the same things about Janet that most of the K&amp;A workforce did, though his study of it might have been a little bit more in-depth. He was a good listener, and he\u2019d kept his ears peeled for details about her. She was Matt Kensington\u2019s terrifying administrative assistant who demonstrated cool efficiency and an exemplary work ethic that made all their lives easier. To his recollection, the woman had never once screwed up a detail, and Max found that intriguing. Matt Kensington trusted her implicitly, and he didn\u2019t do that with anyone, really. Max had seen him check Lucas\u2019 numbers or Ben\u2019s legal work, but Janet could be riding in the limo, put a stack of papers in front of him, and he\u2019d sign them with a cursory glance.</p><p>When Max was hired, Matt had taken him around the office to introduce him. Though he and Matt had a personal connection, the HR guy could have done the task, and Max wouldn\u2019t have felt slighted. Instead, it kind of flustered him, the CEO himself doing the intros. It had earned him a second look from a lot of people. But it was Janet\u2019s second look he\u2019d remembered.</p><p>She had a way of examining a person as if she was noticing a lot more than most people did. He\u2019d been around enough special ops guys to recognize someone who evaluated strengths and weaknesses right off, cataloging a man\u2019s abilities. He\u2019d taken a good look back, no sense denying that. She\u2019d been wearing a pretty butter-yellow suit combo, with silky white stockings covering a pair of excellent legs. Under her thin blouse, he could see the lace of a camisole top. She was small-boned, small-breasted, but all well proportioned.</p><p>In his time working this close to the executive level, no one had ever mentioned she was a dancer. But on that very first day, he thought of a ballerina, because that was what she looked like, the way she kept her dark hair pulled up on her head, the fine lines of her hands and body. How she moved.</p><p>He remembered what she\u2019d said to him today. \u201cNow I teach.\u201d When he\u2019d put her up on the hood, taken off her shoes, her toes had fallen naturally into a graceful point as she crossed her ankles.</p><p>Her face intrigued him. She was a handsome woman, her facial features not delicate enough to be called pretty. Cheekbones and nose cut in sharp planes, brown eyes direct. The way she kept her mouth glossed in that tempting sheen disguised the thinness of her lips, but that thinness fit her face, like the slim, elegant lines of her dark brows. It was the force of her personality beneath that radiated her confident sexuality, the unmistakable aura of a woman who regularly donned the clothes of a Mistress and indulged that side of herself at Club Progeny.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her at it a couple times, though not close up, because she tended to choose a corner of the public floor at a distance from that coffee shop she\u2019d mentioned. She\u2019d restrain a man with nothing but commands or nominal restraints, but he\u2019d stay locked in the proscribed position as she took a whip to him, wielding it with skill. He\u2019d noticed she didn\u2019t wear the high break-neck heels a lot of the women did. During a break in her sessions, sometimes she\u2019d sit down, zip open her modestly heeled boots to rub her calves, as if she had cramps there. He\u2019d imagined doing that for her, bringing ease to her expression as he enjoyed the feel of her toned limbs beneath his fingertips. He supposed whatever troubles she had with her legs might be the reason she no longer danced.</p><p>Be that as it may, it didn\u2019t explain her attention toward him. She was smart enough to know he wasn\u2019t interested in being dominated by anyone, let alone by a woman. Of course, maybe the reason she was interested was as inexplicable as the fact he returned the favor, in spades. Even before the terrible day with Savannah, he\u2019d thought about her more than he should. She\u2019d been featured in some pretty outstanding fantasies during his early morning post-workout shower. In his mind, he put her up against the wall, thrusting into her from behind. In reality he pressed his forehead hard against his fist, closed against the slick tile, his other hand working himself to jetting climax beneath the pummeling spray.</p><p>Despite that, he\u2019d kept his distance, knowing he couldn\u2019t give her what she wanted. She gave him a few appraising glances now and then, but he chalked that up to the fact that women noticed a guy who kept military fit. Didn\u2019t mean they were compatible enough for more than a one-night stand.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t something he made a habit of doing, and he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t inflict it on a coworker. Particularly one so close to Matt Kensington. He\u2019d never do anything to cause Matt problems. Beyond that, he couldn\u2019t see Janet as the impulsive, regret-it-like-hell-the-next-day, one-night-stand type. Outside her sessions in Club Progeny, she didn\u2019t seem to date or indulge in any kind of relationships. Inside Club Progeny there were far more stringent, clear-cut rules for those things. Manageable. Maybe that\u2019s why she kept it there.</p><p>His impression was that she didn\u2019t offer her body or her heart freely. She took pleasure, offering a fair, intense and often affectionate-in-the-aftermath exchange with her chosen subs, but vulnerability didn\u2019t appear to be part of that offering. Her armor was lovely to experience, to touch, but that was as far as the men got. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Going over all this in his head, he wryly concluded he\u2019d done more intel gathering on her than he\u2019d admitted to himself, and the rate of it had increased since that day in the limo. She\u2019d probably chastised herself for her meltdown in the hospital restroom, but that would have been unjustified. When it counted, she\u2019d been as firmly in control as she was at command central\u2014what the staff called her desk, set smack in the middle of the top floor between all five executive offices. She\u2019d kept Savannah focused, moving them forward toward a common goal. As far as how she\u2019d been with him, they\u2019d clicked together as seamlessly that day as SEAL members who\u2019d trained together. That didn\u2019t happen unless there was a solid connection there.</p><p>He recalled her standing in the bathroom, the imprint of the blood on her skin, her bra. When something triggered a memory that took over everything else, he knew what that looked like on a person\u2019s face. She\u2019d been staring in the mirror, but her eyes had been a million memories away, a whimper stuck in her throat, her fingers clutching the sink to keep herself from being whirled down the rabbit hole, back to whatever awful thing all that blood had summoned to her mind.</p><p>As he\u2019d washed it off her, he\u2019d noticed the softness of her skin, how firm her body was beneath it. Not too firm though. The woman was in good shape, but her ass had a nice roundness to it. He liked that about women in their forties, when only the most fanatical workouts in the gym could keep the curves at bay. She was a few years older than him, but not enough to be a cause for concern for either of them. Women were more worried about that than men, anyhow.</p> <p>When he\u2019d lifted her up onto the hood, he\u2019d wanted to keep his hands on her. He\u2019d wanted to see if she closed her eyes when she kissed, if the sharpness of her face softened, if the rigid, straight line of her body would become more curved, melt into his. She hadn\u2019t closed her eyes, and her body hadn\u2019t softened, but the lips had, and he\u2019d felt her quiver under his touch. The day he\u2019d held her in the bathroom, she hadn\u2019t relaxed either, but today he\u2019d felt the hint of what it would be like if she fitted herself to a man\u2019s angles and curves, let him palm that sweet ass and pull her closer, against a cock that was more than eager to show her pleasure.</p><p>Was he ready for such a step? It\u2019d been awhile for him. Yeah, he\u2019d indulged the occasional sexual release with the right woman in the right moment, all fun and games, no harm, no foul, but this wouldn\u2019t be in the same realm, he was sure of that.</p><p>What he was contemplating might go so bad, the mission should be aborted before it even started. It seemed like they were both interested enough to give it a try though, so he\u2019d take responsibility. If it went sour, he\u2019d be the one who\u2019d leave. It was clear she had a family here. Max viewed them that way as well, but he could maintain that without the work itself, whereas he perceived she needed that structure to stay connected. He\u2019d back off, move on, if needed. He wouldn\u2019t shit where she lived, so to speak. Or if he did, he\u2019d clean it up by clearing out.</p><p>He had a weird urge to seek Matt\u2019s permission to court his secretary, but he saw no graceful way to do that. Plus, Janet would likely jam her stapler up his ass if he tried. Wondering if K&amp;A\u2019s generous benefit package covered such an injury, he grinned.</p><p>Friday night. There was no doubt in Janet\u2019s mind about going to Club Progeny. Her body had been on turbocharge since her visit with Max in the garage earlier in the week. That faint brush of lips across her mouth had stuck with her, as powerful as if he\u2019d lifted her up against a wall and fucked her brainless, so she needed some perspective, some balance. It was like they were engaging in a rumba, everything powerfully suggestive, filled with overwhelming potential, but still confined within the careful boundaries of the dance.</p> <p>He was being just as cautious as she was, which meant they both understood the consequences of taking it into uncharted territory. She hadn\u2019t realized a man who evaluated things so thoroughly beforehand could be so damn sexy. She guessed it was because of the barely restrained passion behind it. A powerful warrior more than ready for the heat and passion of the battle, but he was going to make damn sure he had it won before he even stepped on to that ground. Brawn and intelligence\u2014how could a woman resist?</p><p>Tonight would be helpful to clear her mind, figure out a counter strategy that would be an adventure for both of them. She had no doubt the ballet class would provide an intriguing neutral ground for them, full of more pleasurable innuendo. So far her interactions with him had been like the slow consumption of a flawless chocolate mousse, made perfect by the defined, precisely spaced experience of its taste and texture.</p><p>Pulling into the club parking lot in her red classic Mustang, she was intrigued to see Max\u2019s truck. She could hardly mistake it, because there were very few older Ford Rangers maintained in such pristine condition. As she circled closer to it, her lower extremities coiled up in anticipation.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll come in sometime...Just see if you\u2019re there.</p><p>Getting out of her car, she locked it, shouldering her garment bag and makeup case. Once inside the club, she didn\u2019t look around. She showed her membership card and went straight to the women\u2019s changing area. She had a different goal tonight. If Max was in the coffee shop and happened to see her, that was fine, but it was too soon to engage. In fact, maybe she should use a private room tonight. She needed to focus, balance. But that was weak. Finding her focus in a public arena was a challenge, requiring discipline, and she liked to stay sharp.</p><p>Slicking her hair back with sculpting clay, she made sure her topknot was secure. She\u2019d chosen a pencil skirt that zipped up the side, the zipper starting at the top of the high slit. A tight black blouse went over the skirt, the blouse sheer enough to show the black bra beneath it. She pulled on tight boots that etched out her calves like a second skin, as well as a pair of elbow-length gloves that had the same supple fit. She took a look at herself from all angles before locking up her personal belongings. Carrying the bag of items she might desire to use on her chosen sub, she headed out to the public floor.</p> <p>She remembered the first time Matt had brought her to this type of club. After what she\u2019d been through, she thought he was insane for thinking such a place would intrigue her. She\u2019d been tense, only her trust and respect for him keeping her sitting on the bar stool rather than heading back out to the parking lot. Then he\u2019d told her to close her eyes.</p><p>Listen, Janet. Really listen.</p><p>She knew what it sounded like, the thud of objects hitting flesh. Fists, belt...baseball bat. It made the bones in her face ache. I broke my doll, but see...I have the power and money to put her back together, make her beautiful again. That\u2019s why I know you\u2019re mine, querida, my sweet ballerina.</p><p>Matt had brought her back from that with another touch, repeating his gentle admonishment. \u201cHear the differences.\u201d</p><p>And finally, she had. With a Dom and sub, there was a rhythm to it, one that was wholly absent when the striking was done in violence. That kind of beating was more chaotic, like white noise. This was like a mesmerizing piano concerto, the rise and fall of emotion, of action and reaction. It made her open her eyes. She\u2019d rested her attention on a Mistress flogging a male who was on his elbows and knees before her. When she bent to lay a kiss on the reddened expanse of one quivering buttock, he\u2019d begged her to let him press his lips to her shoe.</p><p>What seemed an act of humiliation on its face had been anything but. Janet had registered the absorbed look on the Domme\u2019s face, the adoration on the sub\u2019s. She felt a sudden desire to be standing in that Domme\u2019s shoes, to prove...what wielding power should be. To feel what it could be like to wield such power. She hadn\u2019t had much luck in getting close to men since Jorge, but maybe this way, she could. Within prescribed boundaries, holding the reins, she could find something her body still ached to have. The arousing, respectful touch of a man. Maybe she wasn\u2019t ready for passion\u2014it was too close to violence\u2014but this she could have.</p><p>That feeling brought her back again and again to this environment. A sense of being safe, of being at home. Max or no Max, she could anticipate what the night would bring like a kid at a carnival, no worries that any of the monsters would follow her home.</p><p>She saw several of her regulars here, occasional playmates. Harris came to her with a smile, dropping to a knee before looking up at her with pleased affection. \u201cMay I serve you tonight, Mistress?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in the mood to be harsh, Harris. Over your limits. Maybe another night. Who would you suggest?\u201d</p><p>He covered his disappointment with a respectful nod, glanced toward the floor. \u201cThor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sub with the name Thor?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDoes he know how that sounds?\u201d</p><p>Harris gave her a grin. \u201cLike a slave needing punishment for getting above his station. You said you were in the mood to be harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d She touched his hair in fond acknowledgment. \u201cSend him to me, and I\u2019ll look forward to taking you in hand another night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always eager to serve you, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>As Thor came toward her, she studied him critically. She\u2019d seen the brawny male before. He was pleasing to the eye, well-muscled and clean shaven, with dirty-blond hair trimmed in a military cut. She hadn\u2019t played with him directly, but had seen he straddled a good balance. Not too willing to please, because he sought a Mistress with a firm hand, but once he found one, he accommodated what both Mistress and sub were seeking. That level of subtle cooperation was something she enjoyed. His powerful form, height and breadth reminded her just enough of someone else. Yet he was different enough she wouldn\u2019t get confused, depriving him of his just due by getting lost in her head. The sessions were about an equal give and take, and she was a fair Mistress.</p><p>Of course, fair or not, no matter who she chose tonight, a great deal of her energy was going to be driven by the memory of another man\u2019s hands, his mouth. Well, if the sub got a pleasurable ride from her frustrated desire, she expected he wouldn\u2019t complain. Such was the nature of her restricted interactions in the club. They knew what they could expect from her\u2014and what they couldn\u2019t. Until a few days ago in a garage parking deck, she would have said that was enough for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was when she looked up and saw Max. He was sitting by the rail in the coffee area, and he had his eyes on her, his face in that expressionless mode that fascinated her, because of all she sensed behind it.</p><p>In that moment, she changed her mind about the private room. \u201cThor, please secure Room Six for us. I don\u2019t think anyone is using it. Wait for me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d</p> <p>As she crossed the floor to the narrow catwalk that passed directly beneath the coffee area, Max\u2019s eyes never left her. She felt like he noticed everything, how the snug clothes fit over her breasts and thighs, hips and legs, how she moved in them. That regard made her stride become more pendulous and provocative. When his gaze sharpened on her, she wet her lips.</p><p>He was wearing a white dress shirt and black slacks. Ben had had an afternoon meeting that required more formal attire from his driver, but she was surprised Max hadn\u2019t changed before coming here. He\u2019d shed coat and tie though.</p><p>She stopped below where he was sitting. He\u2019d scraped back the chair as she approached, and amused her now by sitting down on the floor by the chair, letting his legs dangle over the wall. She pressed her upper body against his calf, gripping his knee to stretch up and be heard over the club\u2019s boisterous noise. Accommodating her, he leaned down, his fingers settling high on her rib cage, the other hand braced on the rail by his head. His ear was now close to her lips and she indulged herself, nuzzling the short dark-blond hair behind it, smelling that sea salt smell.</p><p>\u201cWaiting on one of the guys?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head, gestured at the table. \u201cCoffee\u2019s good here. Just got off work. Dinner deal with Ben and the Michigan steel plant folks. He got them hammered, had them agreeing to all sorts of things that\u2019ll put their company in Matt\u2019s portfolio before Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d she said, already imagining the research workload on her and Alice\u2019s desks on Monday.</p><p>Max tangled his fingers with hers, lifting her hand to examine the sleek fit of the glove, his thumb rubbing the thin fabric over her palm. \u201cI dropped them off at their hotel. Figured I\u2019d stop here before I went home.\u201d</p><p>So there were no restrictions to dictate his reasons for being here tonight. She was tempted to drop Thor, try to coax Max to take his place, but she had a code of conduct when it came to her subs. Plus she knew Max wouldn\u2019t do it. But he was here, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a private room tonight, but you\u2019re welcome to come watch. Thor\u2019s a public player. He won\u2019t mind. Room Six.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll be here with my coffee. Why don\u2019t you come join me when you\u2019re finished?\u201d</p><p>A standoff. She withdrew her fingers and stepped back. \u201cIf you get done before I return, don\u2019t stay up past your bedtime on my account. My invitation stands.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, rising to his feet and taking his seat again. When she reached the archway that led to the private rooms, she glanced back to see him sipping his coffee, still watching her. Being the center of his focus could unsettle a woman, for certain. In a lovely way.</p><p>Room Six had mirrors on one wall, a bench and steel frame in the center of the room that provided various restraint options, and several comfortable chairs along the non-mirrored wall. Those were for a Master or Mistress to rest or view their sub from a detached position during a session, or to hold that same sub during aftercare to ground them with a soothing touch. A small closet bathroom ensured that comfort breaks or hygiene needs wouldn\u2019t disturb the flow of the scene with a trip back to the public restroom or locker area. There were erotic photographs on the wall, stark black-and-whites against dark-red paint.</p><p>The room was functional yet atmospheric in a direct, unpretentious way she liked. Thor was kneeling by the bench. He still wore his clothes, a white T-shirt and jeans. He hadn\u2019t assumed she wanted him naked, but he had set out lubricants, restraint options and other tools to save her time. She appreciated a man who anticipated without second-guessing her. Picking up a riding crop, she tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cTake off the shirt.\u201d</p><p>He complied, revealing a tattoo of a mermaid in the embrace of a dragon on his back, though it looked like the mermaid had the dragon fully under her control. She traced it with the whip. \u201cBeautiful work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>She stepped to the wall, entered her membership number in the panel there, and called up his profile to be sure she knew everything she needed to know. \u201cYour safe word is Zeus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>A mythology fan, for certain. She liked him though. He was confident, strong, accepting of his craving for submission, yet he didn\u2019t seem like the type to follow a Mistress around like a puppy, pouting if he didn\u2019t get enough attention. She was somewhat surprised he wasn\u2019t already taken tonight, but there were always far more unattached subs on the floor than Dommes. It was a powerful woman\u2019s paradise, unless she was looking for something in particular. Or someone.</p> <p>\u201cStand up. Keep your eyes down.\u201d</p><p>When he complied, she circled him, trailing her gloved hand over his shoulders, then his chest. She wondered if she\u2019d told him to keep his eyes down to test his manners, or if she\u2019d known not seeing gray eyes focused on her might disrupt her concentration.</p><p>Getting into a scene was a process, requiring the right energy. She stopped herself, thinking it through. If she couldn\u2019t give a hundred percent tonight, the best thing was to cut Thor loose with a straightforward apology, not give him half-assed attention. He deserved better than that.</p><p>Before she could make that decision, there was a light rap on the door.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Her fingertips stopped on Thor\u2019s pectoral. His back was to the door, and with him between her and the entrance, she was mostly screened by him. \u201cEnter,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Max stepped inside, his attention touching on the half-naked man not more than a few feet in front of him. She shifted, met his gaze. He held on to that enigmatic expression but looked pointedly toward the wall that had the three chairs lined up along it. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThor, your profile says you enjoy being watched, by men or women. A friend of mine is going to observe tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d When Max moved into Thor\u2019s line of sight, Janet noted the visible hitch in her submissive\u2019s gaze as he registered just how virile and appealing a man had joined them. Her twinge of possessive irritation surprised her, but she kept it out of her voice. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cEyes back down. He\u2019s here to look at you. You don\u2019t have my permission to look at him.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s expression, and the direction of his gaze, said he had no interest in looking at Thor at all. There was only one person in the room holding his attention. It made her far more intrigued by the scene that would play out here than she\u2019d been a moment ago, charging the energy in the room tenfold. From the increased tension in Thor\u2019s body, the arousal swelling against the fit of his jeans, he\u2019d picked up on her increased response as well. He was well-tuned to a Mistress\u2019s desires.</p><p>Max seemed capable of stoking those desires by doing nothing more than taking a seat in one of the chairs, stretching one arm out along the top of the other two. He crossed his ankle over his opposite knee, settling back.</p><p>Janet put her back to him, but she wasn\u2019t ignoring him. Everything inside her steadied, helping her find the center that had eluded her before he\u2019d come into the room. \u201cThor, remove all your clothes. Take your time with it. Make me notice your ass.\u201d</p><p>The large man pivoted so his back was to her. As he began to unbuckle his belt, she savored the tightening of the denim over the superb buttocks before the jeans loosened and he pushed them off his hips. He wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear, so the jeans clung to the curves. He removed them with an inadvertently sinuous effort that made her want to heat her palms against the firm flesh, score him with a sharp bite of her nails.</p><p>He\u2019d removed his shoes, so once he got the pants to his ankles, he bent, all that muscle shifting and rippling as he pulled the legs free. His feet were far enough apart she saw the heavy weight of his testicles swinging free.</p><p>\u201cKnuckles on the floor, head down. Eyes closed. Straighten your legs, but don\u2019t lock your knees.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed. Stepping up behind him, she ran her hand over his ass, and down, closing her fingers on his balls, her grip tight enough that he grunted. He more than filled her hand, suggesting the size of the erection in the front. She stroked him, letting the crop she held slide along the inside of his thigh, tease the back of his knee. When she reversed it in a deft one-handed move, she pushed against that bend in his leg with the handle, taking him down to one knee.</p><p>\u201cForehead to the floor, baby,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She sat down sidesaddle upon the arch of his back as he did that. It put him in a pose similar to Rodin\u2019s Thinking Man. Laying the crop on her lap, she stroked his thick hair with one hand, running her gloved palm over his buttocks with the other. In this position, she could turn her head and look at Max easily, so she lifted her gaze in that direction.</p><p>The look on his face made her part her lips. His gray eyes were the color of an impending storm. She wondered if he\u2019d even looked at the other man. Everything in his expression said he was noting every infinitesimal detail of her reaction to mastering the male sub. The concentration evident in her glittering eyes, the tension of her facial muscles. Beneath her black lace bra, her breasts were full and aching, the thong beneath her pencil skirt already wet. Delicious tingles of heat kissed her throat, her jaw line.</p><p>She wished Max was wearing jeans. They were unforgiving, such that a man had to reach into them, straighten himself when he became erect, or else he\u2019d be bent at an impossible angle. Slacks like he was wearing now gave way before that pressure. His cock would be stretched up along his lower abdomen, below the hold of his belt. If he had been wearing jeans, would he have adjusted himself in front of her? From the riveting power of his gaze on hers, the sexual heat pumping from him, she thought he would. She had no idea what to call this, but it made her want to take Thor on the trip of his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rising, she turned away from Max again. \u201cThor, make the proper adjustments to the bench and lie face down on it. Guide your cock into the spacer that\u2019s one size short of comfortable and then grip the handholds.\u201d</p><p>The bench was broken into a long and short piece, the long piece for the upper torso, the short piece for the pelvis, with adjustments for different body lengths and heights. It essentially supported the torso while a sub was on hands and knees. Thor made those adjustments now, and as he did, she noticed he was rigid, his cock slit already wet with semen. Good. He was enjoying what was happening in this room as well. No matter her attention to Max, Thor was her first priority while under her command. She believed in doing a job well. And thoroughly.</p><p>As he laid himself down, he guided his cock between the opening of the long and short piece. There was a rectangular stainless steel frame there with different hole sizes that slid along a track. He didn\u2019t cheat his Mistress. He centered the hole that was a size too small for his already turgid cock, working it through carefully. When he made it all the way through, he was flat on his stomach on the bench, his knees and hands on the floor. His testicles were pressed against the lower piece of the bench, his cock captured and pointing toward the floor. From her view behind him, his testicles were an intriguing, vulnerable nest of flesh on the bench\u2019s vinyl surface. He locked his large hands around the handles provided beneath the bench.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as you are concerned, your wrists are manacled to that bench, your thighs tied down, a strap over your shoulders and forehead. You are glued to that bench. Tell me you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>She never tied them down, not in a way they couldn\u2019t easily escape. Thor was far physically stronger than she was, but it was her will and his desires that held him helpless. She inhaled that aphrodisiac, the energy swirling between her and him. The power emanating from the man watching was a solid, pulsing wall at her back.</p><p>She\u2019d hung her toy bag by the sink. Now she returned her crop to it and withdrew her paddle, a half-inch thick oak rectangle with three holes cut into it to add a sharp bite to the sting.</p><p>Setting it aside, she slipped the buttons of her fitted blouse, sliding it off with a roll of her shoulders. She sensed Max shifting, but she didn\u2019t look at him now. She eased the side zipper of her skirt up, all the way past the curve of her hip, and then unhooked it. The fishnets she wore tonight shimmered with tiny sparkles. A garter of sleek vinyl held them up. While her black thong would reveal a toned ass, her upper thighs weren\u2019t perfect. Middle age and a job where she sat on her ass in front of a computer made that unattainable. Men liked soft strong thighs, though, ones that could lock around their shoulders. She could hold a man to her pussy until he ate her out to her satisfaction. Those soft thighs could also lock around his hips as he pounded into her.</p> <p>It had been quite awhile since she\u2019d indulged that fantasy in reality. She was imagining it quite vividly right now, but not with Thor.</p><p>She pulled her strap-on from the bag. It was a glossy black rubber dildo, six inches in length and thick, curved to ensure good contact with the most responsive areas. She buckled it over the thong, adjusting the clit stimulator to its proper place. As she did that, she slid her fingers over her mound, teasing herself with her own touch. Thor\u2019s left cheek was pressed to the bench, so he could see what she was doing. Though she maintained an indifferent tilt of her head, her body angled away from him, she watched him in her peripheral vision to catch the involuntary flex of his hips as his cock jerked, expelling another drop of fluid. She heard the needy sound in his throat.</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t look toward Max at all, the sense of being near a dangerous animal on a breakable tether had increased exponentially. She reveled in the attention of the two men, picking up on the growing electricity arcing between all three of them.</p><p>Pulling out two condoms and a blindfold, she crossed the room to Thor, enjoying the weight of the dildo pressing against her clit as the phallus moved in a lifelike way with her stride. In the mirrors, she saw the female sway of her hips, a provocative contrast. Max was motionless, a dark potent blur outside her range of vision. When she reached Thor, she swung her leg over his buttocks again, rubbing herself against the seam between, the movement similar to the way she\u2019d thrust into him. The phallus curved up over his back. He pressed down in reaction, a groan breaking from him.</p><p>Tearing open one of the condoms with her teeth, she lay down on his back so she could reach beneath him, wrap her fingers around his shaft. As she explored the shape and weight of him at her leisure, she made a sound of reproof that kept him still. When he was quivering like a restrained stallion, she stretched the condom on him. Then she did the same to the dildo, making sure the lubrication on the outside was adequate for what she desired. Taking off one glove, she reached behind her, traced the dimple between Thor\u2019s buttocks and went lower to tease his rim, pushing into the puckered entrance to confirm he\u2019d already oiled himself up. She drew a playful circle between his shoulder blades with that slick substance, then rose, putting her glove on again, working it up her arm, past the elbow. She loved the close fit, the supple feel of it.</p><p>She always loved the pacing of a session. She could take her time, run her hands up her arms, feel how the tight fabric molded them. She could enjoy her own body, knowing Thor was watching her, suffering, lusting. The greater his anticipation, the more explosive his reaction would be, the more violent his climax. He would give her everything for one touch.</p> <p>When she rose, she was well aware of what she looked like, one hip cocked as she displayed herself in the strap-on, black thong, matching bra, garters and knee-high boots. She wore a delicate silver chain with an onyx pendant and matching earrings, her dark hair in the slick bun. The heavy blush along her cheekbones would increase their severity, the piercing intensity of her dark eyes. She\u2019d chosen an almost black lipstick that had a hint of rose color. She imagined what it would be like to fuck Thor senseless and then, as his sides were still heaving with exertion, straddle Max\u2019s lap, grip his face, and kiss him with a vampire\u2019s hunger with her rose-black lips.</p><p>A nice visual. As much as she hoped she was tormenting him by not looking at him, she knew the effort not to look his way was only driving her own hunger higher. And Thor would reap the benefits of that.</p><p>Moving behind Thor, she put her hands on either buttock, one finger at a time, so he felt the press of each of the ten digits. \u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a butch mood,\u201d she purred. \u201cI want to fuck you hard and fast, like a man would. If you don\u2019t please me, I\u2019m going to give you a sound thrashing with my paddle, make you sore inside and out. Think you can handle it?\u201d She trailed her fingers up his spine, leaning forward as she did so, such that the strap-on pressed between his buttocks. She gave him her full weight, savoring the flex and shift of his body beneath her as her breasts mashed against his back. She gripped his nape, holding his head to the bench, a reminder of the power she held over him.</p><p>\u201cAnything, Mistress. I\u2019m all yours. Fuck me hard. Please.\u201d He corrected himself quickly enough, but her lips curved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t apologize. Instead, his body quivered under hers, a much more pleasing response. He was enough of a man that he would forget himself in a moment of lust and make demands, enough of a sub that he relished the idea of being punished for it.</p><p>She was lying full along his back, her legs draped on either side of his hips. Now at last, she turned her head to look at Max, tilting her chin down, since he was to her left and somewhat behind her. He still bore that same hard-to-fathom expression, but the gray irises remained iron and fire. Stretching her arms back, she cupped her buttocks, arched her back and sat up using only her stomach muscles. She rolled her body in a lithe wave, rubbing the dildo against Thor\u2019s crack and making his fingers tighten on the handholds.</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes followed her every movement like the flow of water over her skin. He hadn\u2019t moved by so much as an inch since she\u2019d taken off her shirt. His hand was still curved loosely over the second chair. She found that incredibly erotic. Had he been a sniper with the SEALs, such that he\u2019d had to sit motionless, waiting on a target to materialize, while staying intensely alert the whole time? If so, she had a feeling she was seeing that skill in action now.</p> <p>She slid back off Thor, standing between his spread thighs. Now she removed the other glove, loosening the fingers then capturing the middle one in her mouth to tug it all the way off. She slid the garment along the small of Thor\u2019s back, dropped it there. Then she did the same with the other. Putting both hands on his fine ass, she fitted the head of the dildo to his rear entrance. That tight opening convulsed, anticipating her.</p><p>His profile said he was highly experienced with ass fucking, but given that this was her first time with him, she wouldn\u2019t slam into him first thing, as she might with Harris, whose ass was much more familiar. She preferred hands-on verification. The delicate tissues of the ass could be torn as easily in a man built like a brickhouse as one made out of straw. She was a female wolf that preferred to keep either type of house intact. As she eased in, the sphincter muscles released immediately. She pushed in to the hilt, and let out a sigh of pleasure. Thor didn\u2019t exaggerate his abilities, and she\u2019d reward him for that. Pulling back out, now she let go, slamming back into him.</p><p>Thor let out a fervent curse, but she was just getting started. She wanted the fast and quick hits on her clit, those tiny explosions of sensations that would keep her working Thor hard but wouldn\u2019t spiral her toward climax too fast. It also gave her enough headspace to keep in touch with everything happening with Thor, how often he swore under his breath, the clutch of his powerful hands on the steel handles beneath the bench. The lift and drop of his hips, the trembling of his thighs. He was biting down on the corner of the vinyl, his gaze rolling wildly toward her, hungry and fierce. He wanted to see her come. That would never do.</p><p>Slowing her pace enough to accommodate her intent, she pulled free the blindfold she\u2019d tucked beneath her garter. Elongating her upper torso enough to put it over his eyes, she made sure it was secure. \u201cJust feel me,\u201d she whispered, taking a sharp bite of his earlobe. \u201cFeel me fucking you and know you\u2019re helpless. I am going to make you come, keep you completely under my control, and you\u2019re not going to want to be anywhere else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. Yes...Mistress. Oh...fuck.\u201d She\u2019d straightened again, and now started rocking in and out in a sawing motion that had him nearly foaming at the mouth. Okay, getting close now, but she wasn\u2019t yet ready for him to come. The energy was swirling hot and tight around her, so she closed her eyes, slowed it down once more. In deep, work the tip of the dildo in a rubbing, pressurized motion that made him cry out, then withdraw, leaving him shuddering on that cusp as she stroked his channel, dug her nails into his ass.</p><p>When the hand touched her shoulder, she didn\u2019t jump. Not for a moment had she forgotten Max\u2019s presence. It was what made her so demanding, so involved in her session with Thor. Those watching gray eyes, witnessing what she could do to a man. How she could summon him to her will.</p><p>His touch didn\u2019t startle her, but that didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d expected this, or knew what he\u2019d do next. As she kept up the pumping rhythm with her hips, Max put his body against the back of hers. She\u2019d wanted to see his erect cock, pressing against the fabric of his slacks. Now she got to feel it, the heated steel of him through the faint scratchiness of the wool fabric against her bare buttocks. He shifted forward, so her movements into Thor became smaller, deeper. The man under her command cried out, bucking at the sensation. It also rubbed the clit stimulator over her in shorter, more intense movements.</p><p>Max put his lips on her shoulder. In that position, he\u2019d be gazing down at her breasts, the strapless bra allowing them a lot of give and wobble, despite their small size. His left hand slid over her shoulder, fingers wrapping around her breast. As he held the bra cup, he traced the bare upper curve. His teeth pressed into her shoulder and she breathed a moan of her own as he brushed her nipple with his thumb.</p><p>She was still moving inside Thor, but she\u2019d once again slowed her rhythm, inflicting pleasurable agony on her captive while Max explored her body, making her aware of nerve endings she\u2019d never known could be so sensitive. He sucked on her skin, nipped it, moved up under her ear to breathe on her there, sending tendrils of heated air down her spine. He pushed his hips against her ass again, rotated so he was rubbing his turgid cock over her buttocks, pressing in between them.</p><p>As she leaned forward over Thor, she did a similar provocative circle with her hips, working the dildo in creative ways inside her sub as she teased Max\u2019s cock. That steel organ pressed the wet crotch of the thong and the strap of the dildo into her folds. Max captured her buttocks, his fingers almost bruising.</p><p>\u201cMistress...I\u2019m so close...may I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Another few seconds. Or you\u2019ll get more of that paddle than you\u2019re going to want.\u201d</p><p>She was proud of her ability to talk, but when Max tugged at the thong and dildo straps words deserted her. He found his way past them, two fingers sinking into the wet heat of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cFucking honey,\u201d he muttered, just as Thor cried out again.</p><p>Max moved with her in perfect sync, fingers sliding in and out as she fucked Thor to the very edge. Then Max put his mouth on the other side of her neck, cruising along the artery, delicate tongue touches, followed by a heated, open-mouthed, sucking kiss where his teeth latched on to her once again.</p><p>\u201cCome now,\u201d she gasped to Thor. \u201cCome, baby.\u201d</p><p>The powerful sub let go with a pleasing roar worthy of a thunder god. In some distant place in her mind she knew that meant she\u2019d done what she was supposed to do, but she was still spiraling up and up, worked by Max\u2019s fingers, the simple touch of his mouth on her throat. He kept the weight of his body against her so Thor\u2019s cries intensified, because she kept plowing him in those deep, short strokes. Her legs shook, her body shuddering as the clit stimulator hit her just right, the rhythm Max setting inexorable. Thor\u2019s ass kept rising up to meet her, increasing the force of their threefold impact.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Max shook his head, his dark-blond hair brushing the back of her neck. \u201cCome for me, baby,\u201d he murmured into her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re driving me fucking crazy. Trust me with it.\u201d</p><p>It was a plea and a command, and she couldn\u2019t deny either. Her clit hardened, her pussy rippling tight around Max\u2019s fingers as her body went over that precipice. She arched, thrusting forward with her hips as she dropped her head back against his shoulder. It pushed her breast farther into his large hand, and when he pinched the nipple, she gave a strangled cry, her nails scoring Thor\u2019s back. He reared up against her in spasmodic aftershock as she shoved in even deeper, her body going rigid, caught up in the pleasurable waves.</p><p>She wanted those slacks out of the way, wanted to feel the heated steel of Max\u2019s bare cock against her flesh. Though this wasn\u2019t the moment for that, he at least kept moving with her, that additional sensation driving her to full, mostly satisfied repletion. When she came to a slow halt, Thor\u2019s chest was expanding like a bellows, his mouth beneath the blindfold alternating between tight and slack, his body shuddering, fingers clamped on those handles. She\u2019d pushed him hard, and he would need care to ground him. The problem was, she might need it as well. Holy God. She really hadn\u2019t expected that. Not just what Max had done, but how she\u2019d reacted to him.</p><p>Max kept his arm around her, his mouth at her ear. \u201cAll done with him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded, and he backed off, but he took her with him. He eased her out of Thor\u2019s ass with surprising gentleness. He loosened the dildo straps as she swayed with a pleasurable dizziness in his arm span. Setting the strap-on aside, he picked her up, put her on the chair he\u2019d vacated. One robe hung on the back of the door, part of the room\u2019s standard supplies. Max plucked it off its hook now, slipping it around her shoulders before he squatted before her, touching her knee. \u201cTell me what to do for him,\u201d he said.</p><p>She blinked at him. She wasn\u2019t a woman to be swept off her feet, but her body was still vibrating from that orgasm, as well as how smoothly and capably he\u2019d lifted her to move her less than three feet. She let her gaze glide down his body, to the obvious, mouthwatering arousal that looked like a heavy lifting job. \u201cIt\u2019s what I want to do to you that should be discussed.\u201d</p><p>The gray eyes were heavy-lidded, the pupils large and black. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there. I want to help you with this.\u201d</p><p>She considered it. She also wasn\u2019t the type of woman who turned her aftercare responsibilities over to another, but she wasn\u2019t in the habit of being this weak-kneed by the end of a session. \u201cUsually I\u2019d have him crawl over here and bring me to climax with his mouth, as soon as he felt steady enough to do so. But I think you\u2019ve taken that away from him.\u201d Her gaze shifted to Thor\u2019s still twitching body. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be okay with that this time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI expect so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can do for him what you just did for me\u2014get him to a sitting position, get him warm\u2014I can take over at that point. Touch helps ground them, but I expect that\u2019s not really your thing.\u201d</p><p>Max put a hand on her knee, gave it a light squeeze. When he rose, going to Thor, he touched the man\u2019s back, letting him know it wasn\u2019t her before he gripped his flank and shoulder to help him push up. She opened her mouth in warning, but Max was already ahead of her. He\u2019d tightened his hand on Thor, slowing him down and murmuring. Thor nodded, fumbling between his legs to guide his now-flaccid cock out of the ring, preventing tender flesh from being snagged.</p><p>\u201cTake off his blindfold,\u201d she murmured and Max nodded, pulling it free. He steadied Thor until her captive could straddle the bench in a seated position, facing Janet. Whether deliberate or not, it gave her the pleasure of seeing the naked, dazed sub in all his aftermath glory, the damp cock resting on the slick upholstery of the bench, his broad chest still expanding as he caught his breath. When Max stretched out to get him a bottle of water from the convenience bar provided for that purpose, Thor swayed, but Max gripped his shoulder with the opposite hand, holding him. As he came back, he straddled the bench behind Thor, bringing the man back against his chest, snug inside the line of his thighs. Max\u2019s arms were draped comfortably around Thor as he opened the water and offered it, supporting Thor\u2019s hand. Thor kept his head turned to the outside of Max\u2019s shoulder, stealing looks at Janet.</p><p>She\u2019d recovered enough she was sitting up straight, her knees together, legs demurely folded like a debutante, but she was watching him closely. His eyes were getting more focused. Max was stroking his hair, a hand lying on his hip, keeping him upright. She got no gay vibes from Max at all, yet he was remarkably comfortable handling a naked man, cosseting him in this way. She\u2019d always assumed he just watched the public sessions the way anyone did, with a voyeur\u2019s surface interest, but he seemed quite familiar with the warning signs important for proper aftercare of a sub.</p><p>Underscoring it, when Thor turned his head inward, nuzzling against Max\u2019s throat, Max kindly but firmly drew out of his range, gripping Thor\u2019s jaw to turn his attention back toward Janet. \u201cI don\u2019t go that way, man,\u201d he said. \u201cJust here to provide you a prop and take care of you for the Mistress.\u201d</p><p>Thor accepted that easily enough. After all, he\u2019d come to her for a physical experience. The emotional, intense as it was, was intended to be as temporal as the session itself. Janet rose, moving to her clothes. Under the gaze of both men, she put her skirt back on, following it with her blouse, straightening it tidily. She could have gone into the bathroom and dried the slickness between her legs with a towel, but she wasn\u2019t yet in the mood to do that. She was still feeling Max\u2019s fingers there. When she met his gaze, she saw a flicker that made her wonder if he\u2019d read her mind again.</p><p>Thor shifted with a grunt and glanced back at Max. Her sub for the evening had recovered enough there was a spark of challenge in his eyes. \u201cReact that way again, dude, and I\u2019ll start doubting the whole \u2018I don\u2019t go that way\u2019 thing,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Max snorted, shoved the other man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI think you\u2019re good.\u201d Rising from the bench, he nodded to Janet. \u201cHe\u2019s all yours. If you don\u2019t need me for anything else, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ll see you at the coffee shop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And just like that, he slipped from the room.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>She finished up with Thor, thanked him and cut him loose. Even though she had no further plans for club play tonight, she didn\u2019t change back into her street clothes yet. She did retrieve them though, putting them in her carry-on before wandering back out to the floor. She found Max in the same spot at the coffee place. As she came to him, she saw his eyes covering the intimate areas he\u2019d touched. Her neck was still throbbing, and she thought it might be bruised blue and red tomorrow from the force of that hot, demanding mouth.</p> <p>By the time she arrived on the catwalk below him, the spot where they\u2019d spoken before her session with Thor, he\u2019d stood up. Leaning over the rail, he reached down, took her bag. She was already raising her arms, so he caught her beneath them, brought her up to stand on the lip of the coffee house floor. Then he put his arm around her waist, scooped her up beneath her knees and lifted her, guiding her legs over the rail and down to the opposite side.</p><p>The coffee house manager gave her a quick once-over, but Janet knew her clothes weren\u2019t too outrageous to fail the street-clothes-only requirement of this part of the club. She also recognized Janet as a regular, nodding in friendly acknowledgement.</p><p>Max pulled out her chair for her, helped her scoot it up before taking his own seat, aligning his feet on the outside of hers under the small table. When the waitress came, Janet ordered a black coffee and a croissant. Then she folded her arms on the table, fixing her gaze upon him. She\u2019d left the top three buttons of the blouse open, her breasts on a shelf-like display with her arms crossed under them. His attention naturally went to that, but then fastened on her pendant. Reaching out, he toyed with it, but she closed her hand on his wrist, drawing his eyes back to her face.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know how to take care of Thor?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, hooking a shoulder on the back of the chair. His thighs were casually splayed, his other hand lying loosely on the table. Did the man realize he oozed testosterone?</p> <p>\u201cDuring BUD/S, you\u2019re cold. A lot. The boat work, surf torture. If you and your team come out on top during the boat exercises, you might get rewarded with a few minutes on the beach, not having to be in the water. We sit like me and Thor did, folded into each other, back to chest, to share warmth. It\u2019s a way of grounding and settling as well. Physical contact like that with another human being when you\u2019re going through a lot of stress, it\u2019s pretty basic.\u201d</p><p>The words echoed those he\u2019d spoken at the hospital that night. Sometimes, after something like that, human touch helps ground you, brings back your focus.</p><p>\u201cSurf torture?\u201d Her brow lifted.</p><p>\u201cThe instructors have us link arms and lie in the surf for about fifteen-minute stretches. It\u2019s fifty-some-degree water. You start thinking Hell is polar caps, not a fire pit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds a little inhumane.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s not just to torture us, though there are times you think so. On missions, they know we\u2019ll be in some pretty cold waters. Traveling in SDVs\u2014SEAL delivery vehicles\u2014especially the underwater ones, sucks rocks. By the time you get out, you feel colder than an ice cube.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned forward, tapping her knuckles, then stayed there, his finger resting on top of one of hers.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tie them down?\u201d he asked. \u201cMost of the Mistresses I\u2019ve watched seem to prefer that.\u201d</p><p>She knew what it was to be tied down, unable to escape while the blows came. Rationally, she knew this was different, but the first time she\u2019d tried to tie up a sub, pushing her own boundaries, the blood had come back, the thud of blows, the straps cutting into her flesh as she screamed and tried to get away...</p><p>A moment later, she realized her croissant and coffee were there. He pushed the plate toward her. \u201cMaybe eat a little. You look pale,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cIs this a game to you, Max?\u201d she said, staring at the food. Her gaze snapped back up to him.</p><p>His brow creased. \u201cNo ma\u2019am. I\u2019m just figuring out the terrain. Determining where the land mines are.\u201d</p><p>She tucked her hands around the coffee, warming them. \u201cCall me by my name, Max. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanet.\u201d</p> <p>He brought his chair closer to hers, which kept her between the rail and his body. She didn\u2019t feel trapped though. Instead, she was enclosed, a blanket on a cold night. He slid an arm around her waist, threading it between the chair and her body, and his palm wrapped below her hip, his fingers curving over her ass as he brought her up toward his mouth, his head bending to her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him. She met him halfway, and dove headfirst into the sensation. He met her, fire for fire. She wasn\u2019t on the chair anymore. He\u2019d hooked his other hand under her knee, turned and pulled her onto his lap, her buttocks pressed solidly down on his erection as he pushed his fingers into her hair, gripped hard, the sculpting clay not a deterrent. Their mouths stretched and strained, tongues lashing, wet lips rubbing together. She clutched his shoulders, the warmth of the coffee that had lingered in her palms replaced by the solid heat of his body. She wished she hadn\u2019t worn this pencil skirt that kept her from straddling him, though she knew they were pushing the boundaries even now, probably back under the scrutiny of the coffee house manager.</p><p>As if Max figured it out at the same moment she did, his grip tightened, but to pull her back, even if only a few inches. \u201cTime to get out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you under me. Those gorgeous legs wrapped around me. I want to taste your cunt.\u201d</p><p>Her breath shuddered out, her fingers tracing his lips. He licked them, drawing in one to suck on it, hard, give it a sharp bite. The need pulsing from him was pure animal. No rules, no patience to talk about who was in charge. Unlike what most outsiders thought of it, BDSM gave civilized rules to uncivilized behavior. Right now, the pure instinct that predated it drove them both.</p><p>Rising, he dropped bills on the table, picked up her bag. He offered his hand, but when she put hers out, he closed his fingers around her wrist, drew her up to him, against his side, and they moved toward the exit that way. His hand dropped to her hip, then lower. The man enjoyed fondling an ass, and had no compunction about doing it in front of others, though in all fairness, he wasn\u2019t exactly in a place that disapproved of blatant sexual expression. He seemed fascinated with the tightness of the skirt, fingers following the way the fabric hugged and curved under her buttocks. He stroked, explored, interrupting himself only to open the door and guide her through it, so they exited to the parking area.</p><p>The parking lot lights were a light sheen on the truck\u2019s flank. His hand was back to doing that distracting pattern across her sensitive buttocks. But two could play it that way. When they reached the truck, she put her hands on his chest, pressing him up against his door. As she leaned into him, he dropped the bag and shifted his grip to her hips, bringing her even closer to him. He bent for another kiss she was sure would cause her brain to explode, but she tilted her head down, denying him. Those provocative lips slid across her temple instead.</p><p>Her hand moved up his chest to the base of his throat, then to his jaw, curving around it before she tightened, digging her nails into his neck enough to make him understand the wordless demand. As he turned his jaw away from her, he took it an extra step, understanding her desire. He laid his head back against the window glass, exposing his throat fully to her.</p><p>Power and pleasure flooded her, and she put her mouth on that strong column, suckling and biting it as he\u2019d done her, wanting to leave those same marks on him. In answer, he gripped her ass in a two-handed hold so aggressive her boot heels left the pavement. The skirt was too tight, too stiff a fabric to give way before his sizeable erection, let it push into that valley between her thighs where she could feel that sweet pressure against her clit. Now she wished she had changed into her street clothes. But she took what the moment could offer her.</p><p>She yanked at the dress shirt, not caring when buttons came loose. Such a properly dressed gentleman, he had the thin white cotton T-shirt beneath, and she clawed at it as well, pulling it loose from his waistband, bringing the hem up to his throat. He kept his hands on her hips, letting her do as she wished, inflaming her further. He was restraining himself. Catering to her needs, her wishes. Her nature. Yet she could feel the power and response building in him, stoked by her actions. Eventually, it would be too much. He\u2019d tear loose of his self-imposed control and sweep them both away.</p><p>It was an unspoken give-and-take, an intuitive power exchange so erotic because of the lack of defined boundaries and words, its unpredictability. She felt as free as a wild animal in truth. She could desire and demand anything from Max. He was strong enough to handle it, and her, and still make her feel safe. At least in this moment.</p><p>Hard muscled flesh. Manna straight from heaven. She put her mouth on his pectoral and went right for sensitive places, closing her teeth delicately around his nipple, her tongue swirling around it. He was silent, but his body was a full orchestra, arched into that latch point, abdomen muscles taut beneath her other hand, her thumb caught beneath his waistband as her fingers splayed across the defined ridges. His heart beat rapidly beneath her other hand, pressed against his chest. The hand he had on her hip gripped hard, and he\u2019d brought the other up to cup her head.</p><p>Normally she\u2019d have snapped out an order to keep both hands down, but what he was doing, fingers digging in then stroking, moving down to grasp her nape, felt too good. He was following the line of her neck to her shoulder, a motion that sent tingles of sensation down her spine to her tailbone, and from there into the deep crevices of her body, creating a bittersweet yearning.</p><p>She ran her tongue along the crease between pectoral and upper abdomen. This man\u2019s body was sheer fucking perfection, developed to fight, to serve. And all hers at the moment.</p><p>She noticed he\u2019d managed to catch hold of the skirt zipper and ease it up way past mid-thigh. The breeze touched her skin, replaced by the solid heat of his hand, sliding up the back of her thigh to cup her ass, bared by the black thong. She bit down on the nipple, and he pinched her in reply, his other arm circling her waist to band her closer to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me.

I got a little carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d The security guard\u2019s stern tone eased, the man recognizing he wasn\u2019t going to be dealing with a belligerent guest. \u201cCan\u2019t blame you a bit. The two of you were hot enough to make me think about waking the wife up when I get home tonight.\u201d</p><p>Max chuckled, pressing a kiss on the top of Janet\u2019s head, an idle caress as the man moved away. She straightened, pushing away from his grip, though her fingers stayed latched on his T-shirt. He put his hands on her elbows, keeping her in his grasp as well.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to slow this down. Time for me to call it a night.\u201d She met his gaze squarely, though saying the words, removing her hands from his body, was like pulling frozen hands away from a warm fire. \u201cWill you walk me to my car?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Giving his T-shirt a casual tug downward so it covered his rock-hard abs but leaving his shirt open\u2014no choice, given that she expected several of the buttons were under the cars around them\u2014he fished his keys out of his pocket and shifted to unlock his vehicle. Pulling open the door, he picked up her bag, put it in the back and then extended a hand. \u201cGet in the truck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe mating call of the Southern male,\u201d she said lightly, but her pulse had leaped at the command. His gaze had fastened on it, making her think of his mouth there once more. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a place where you can look up at the stars while I put my mouth between your legs.\u201d</p><p>They held gazes for a long moment, then Janet lifted a shoulder. \u201cMore sure of the terrain now? No land mines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reward balances the risk.\u201d</p><p>She sidled back up to him, pressing thigh to thigh deliberately. When she reached up, stroked through his hair, he obligingly brought his head down, put his lips on her shoulder, held them there while a single, hard shudder ran through her. He wasn\u2019t a Dominant. He was simply...overwhelming. Different. Unclassifiable. She should go home. It was time to evaluate where she was going with this. Where he was taking her.</p><p>He rubbed his lips along that bare stretch of skin between blouse collar and throat, making her fingers curl deeper into his scalp. \u201cJanet. Truck. Now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Tarzan,\u201d she whispered, a smile flirting in her heart, on her lips. He put his hands on her waist, lifted her into the truck. He\u2019d made it an order but waited for her consent before proceeding. He was the oddest mix of things.</p><p>He\u2019d lifted her into the driver\u2019s side. The seat was a long cushion, no console, the gear shift on the hump between the floorboards. It reminded her of an old farm truck, and when she scooted over so he could get in, turn over the ignition, the powerful roar of the engine enhanced the impression. She hadn\u2019t moved any farther than necessary to get her legs over the gears, and he pleased her immensely when, once he put the truck in gear, he settled one arm over her so she could lean against him. It helped with talking over that engine noise as well. She propped her chin on his shoulder to speak into his ear as they pulled out into traffic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Texan, aren\u2019t you, Southern male?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, amused, and when he lifted his hand from the wheel to shift, she was already on it, smoothly changing gears as he worked the clutch. Her Mustang was a straight drive as well, a dying breed. The light in his eyes said he appreciated her ability to coordinate with him. And she appreciated that he didn\u2019t indulge in any adolescent comments about her ability to handle a stick. \u201cYes ma\u2019am. I thought you knew everything about everyone at K&amp;A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrary to rumor, I don\u2019t routinely scour personnel records. I rely on intel from office gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have gone with the personnel records. You would have known I left my last job because they objected to my side hobby. Taking women out into the swamps to cut up their bodies for the gators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to do the watching the stars thing before the murder thing?\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened around her, fingers sliding under her buttock to take a firm grip. \u201cCount on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell then. That will give me time to think about my escape plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you\u2019ll be thinking much.\u201d</p><p>She laughed then, a throaty, sultry sound that drew his gray eyes to her in a way that sobered her. She traced his mouth with her nails as he turned his attention back to the road. \u201cHow did you know something was going to go wrong? That day with Savannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a gut feeling. You develop it in the field. A tickling sense that something\u2019s not quite right.\u201d He shrugged but then gave her an intent look. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want to think about right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want...right now?\u201d She felt the give of the light layer of hair beneath his T-shirt as she trailed her fingertips down his sternum. His chest hair was dark blond, like what was on his head. She wanted to see all of it, not just what was visible from the scoop-necked collar.</p><p>Keeping one hand on the wheel and his eyes on the road, he nevertheless lifted his arm from around her shoulders and reached across her to the zipper of the skirt. He pulled it up a few inches from the slit, but he needed a second hand or her help to get it higher. She put her hand over his.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, Max.\u201d</p><p>He gave her that glance again, then he made a turn on to a service road. \u201cI want you to put your fingers inside yourself. I want to taste you while I\u2019m driving.\u201d His gaze went to her face, then higher. \u201cAnd I wish you didn\u2019t have that stuff on your hair. I think about your hair all the time. What it would feel like, all soft on my chest, my stomach.\u201d</p><p>She could follow that track in her mind, see herself going down on him, opening up her mouth and sucking on his cock. She fantasized about tying him up while she did it, watching every muscle fighting his bonds. No, she never tied up her subs like that, but fantasizing was a safe indulgence. Though with Max she wondered if she\u2019d be tempted to cross the line into reality, see if he could keep her mind out of the clutches of the past.</p><p>Lifting her hips off the seat, she worked the zipper up so she could put her fingers beneath the pencil skirt. Nudging the thong aside was easy enough. He slowed the vehicle to turn down another road. She helped him shift to lower gear, and they bumped down a dirt road. He\u2019d opened the window and she could smell the water, hear the nighttime wildlife. Fortunately, it was almost cold tonight, meaning the bugs wouldn\u2019t eat them, and the stars would be bright in the sky. Such thoughts didn\u2019t help her coordination.</p><p>Her pussy was soaking wet, no surprise there. Her fingers went in easy and deep, with a quiet sucking noise that she wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard, but when she glanced up and saw he\u2019d brought the truck to a halt, those intense eyes glittering in the darkness, she suspected he had. She pulled her fingers free, brought them up between them. They\u2019d stopped in front of a dock and what looked like someone\u2019s private boat access. One dim light on a pole illuminated a small gravel parking area.</p><p>Curling his fingers around her wrist, Max sucked in her two fingers, glistening with her honey. She stretched out the other fingers, stroking the five o\u2019clock shadow, the cleft in his chin. Superman\u2019s chin, a strong block that went with the strong face and powerful body. A man with a chin like that invariably lived up to it, a genetic indicator of character, courage. She noticed things like that, how often the physical feature appeared on police chiefs, career military men. The man who worked two jobs to support his wife and children. The lone homeless guy who dove into an ice-cold river to pull kids out of a car that had spun off the road.</p><p>Max took his time, stroking each finger with his tongue, caressing her palm with his thumb, holding her in that firm grip that did all sorts of things to her lower belly. He seemed to understand the complicated mix inside a Domme\u2014at least this particular one. How the exploration of that intimate interplay of restraint and power could tease her senses, especially if approached with the delicate precision that he\u2019d thus far demonstrated.</p><p>Squeezing her hand, he opened the truck door, then reached behind his seat, withdrawing a duffle bag and a thick blanket. \u201cStay there a minute.\u201d</p><p>Moving to the back of the truck, she felt the dip as he stepped onto the wheel well and did something, probably arranging things for her comfort. For their pleasure. She slid behind the wheel, turned so she had her boots propped outside the truck on the running board, and gazed out at the dock. There was a bass boat tied up there.</p><p>\u201cWhose property is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend\u2019s. He\u2019s in Afghanistan right now. I take his boat out sometimes, keep it maintained.\u201d</p><p>Max jumped out of the back of the truck, came back to her. He leaned against the open door, studying her with those intent eyes that made the crisp night much warmer. \u201cWhy were you going to leave me?\u201d he asked. \u201cAt the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl. I don\u2019t like to rush. Or take a step down the wrong path. This is a little like a roller coaster. Once you go over the crest of the hill, there\u2019s no turning back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also nothing like the thrill of that ride.\u201d He caught a lock of her hair between two fingers, massaged it between his knuckles. \u201cWhat is that stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpting clay. It holds the hair in place, gives me a more severe, scary look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you need to be more scary. Even Matt Kensington won\u2019t cross you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem all that scared.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cDo you want me to be? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the rush for you. You just like things done right, and you don\u2019t tolerate sloppy work. Carelessness. Or inappropriate behavior. Just like him. You look at something and know how it\u2019s supposed to look or act, how the picture is supposed to be framed. Structure, the way you do it, is how it\u2019s supposed to be. You know it, and you don\u2019t have patience for those who don\u2019t get that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reaching behind the seat, he unzipped her bag. As he leaned over her knee, she put her hands on his waist to feel the way his body moved, a simple pleasure. He came back with her street clothes, her casual skirt and cotton shirt. To her amusement, he\u2019d left the panties and bra in the bag but retrieved her socks and canvas sneakers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go take a walk on the dock,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put those on? They\u2019ll be more comfortable.\u201d At her quizzical look, he added, \u201cControl, right?\u201d</p><p>He was a rather remarkable person, all in all. When she glanced around, he touched her face. \u201cYou\u2019re safe here. It\u2019s private. And I\u2019ll know if anyone\u2019s coming long before it\u2019s an issue. All right?\u201d</p> <p>At her nod, he squeezed her knee and left her, headed down to the dock. Janet watched him, a tall, broad-shouldered man with a casually powerful stride. His head turned this way and that as he took in his surroundings. She noticed how deliberate he was in his movements, as if aware of the placement of each foot, the angle of his body, his position in relation to everything around him, including her.</p><p>Janet slid out of the blouse and shelf bra, pulling on the cotton stretch T-shirt. Without a bra, her nipples and small breasts were blatantly obvious, but she decided to indulge his less-than-subtle attempt to influence her clothing choices. She ditched the pencil skirt and put on the less restrictive one. She removed boots and stockings but left off the canvas sneakers and socks for the moment. She put all the rest neatly back in her bag.</p><p>Seeing her hair brush, she smiled. Unpinning her hair, she tossed it forward, running the brush through her dark tresses as they unraveled to their full length. The brush broke the hold of the sculpting product, making her hair soft again. As she straightened, she tested it, running her fingers through the strands, imagining Max doing the same.</p><p>When she looked for him, she found him sitting on the rail of the dock, watching her now. Putting the brush back into her bag, she braced herself on the running board to put her other bare foot on the wheel well. Then she swung herself over into the back of the truck. He\u2019d unrolled some type of cushioned mat there, covering it with a blanket, then put the camo quilt on top of that. There was even a serviceable travel pillow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the first time you\u2019ve entertained a woman in the back of your truck,\u201d she called out, taking a cross-legged seat on her bed, as dignified as an empress.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to that prior experience, I\u2019ve learned that women do not like lying on the steel slats of a truck bed, nor do they care for being naked when they\u2019re cold.\u201d As he came back toward her, she watched the lithe, sexual promise of his body like the gift it was. \u201cA man\u2019s lovemaking skills,\u201d he continued solemnly, \u201cas extensive as they might be, have no hope of impressing his female companion if her basic needs are not met. It\u2019s not really fair, but that\u2019s the other thing I\u2019ve learned. Women don\u2019t really care about fairness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. It\u2019s highly overrated.\u201d Janet couldn\u2019t suppress her smile as he leaned his elbows on the side of the truck bed. When he touched her hair, a look of deep pleasure capturing his features, she was ridiculously pleased with her decision to brush out the sculpting clay.</p><p>\u201cLie back for me,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI want to see you. Pull your skirt up to your waist, let me see your beautiful legs. And everything else.\u201d</p><p>She reached out, tugged at his T-shirt. \u201cOnly if you get rid of this. Every woman in the office wants to see you shirtless.\u201d</p><p>He grunted dubiously at that. \u201cThis better not show up on YouTube.\u201d</p><p>She would have smiled again, but that energy was returning, swirling around them, drawing things tighter. He shrugged out of the shirt she\u2019d ripped open, then pulled the T-shirt over his head.</p> <p>Oh my. She\u2019d been right. The way he moved, the obvious power he held, was mapped on the body. All smooth, rolling muscle, the gleaming dark-blond chest hair arrowing down between the sectioned stomach muscles. The angled muscles from hip to groin became even more noticeable when he pulled off the shirt, because his upper body lifted, dropping the slacks lower for a vital, pleasurable moment. He had a couple scars, she noticed. And a tattoo. She shifted to her knees, curling one hand on the edge of the truck so she could touch his muscled arm with the other, a demand to let her see.</p><p>He lifted his arm, revealing another amazing stretch of layered muscle and a soft patch of curling underarm hair. The tattoo was inked vertically on the stretch of rib cage under his right arm. Three skulls held on a trident. The top prong of the trident went through the crown of the middle skull, whereas the two side ones came out through the skulls\u2019 eye sockets, their position angled accordingly. Brothers in Hell wound in a spiral along the trident\u2019s handle.</p><p>She trailed her fingers over it. \u201cA SEAL thing?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and she saw the shadows in his gaze. A brooding darkness, but one that enhanced this moment, sharpened it toward his intent as his gaze slid down her throat, lingering on her breasts, delineated so provocatively in the T-shirt. \u201cCome here,\u201d he rumbled in that husky tone. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>She was already up against the truck side, but understanding, she rose off her heels, standing on her knees. He snaked his arm around her, palming her ass to hold her in place as he closed his other hand over her right breast. Squeezing it firmly and pressing his thumb beneath the nipple, he tilted it up as he closed his mouth over it, through the shirt. Janet gripped his shoulder hard, her other set of fingers clinging to the side of the truck to give her an anchor as he suckled her hard, almost as hard as he had her throat. He knew she liked to feel the demand, no tentative brushes of lips or tongue. She liked to devour, so she wanted to be devoured.</p><p>He released her abruptly but held on to her hand as he put his foot on the wheel well and joined her in the back. Kneeling on the bed he\u2019d made them, he caught her about the waist again, but this time to put her on her back, settling himself between her legs, his muscled shoulders and back beneath her grasping fingers as he cupped her breasts in both hands and got down to the business of suckling, biting, licking and generally driving her insane. She writhed beneath the press of his body. With her skirt rucked up to her waist, she discovered his washboard stomach provided sweet friction to her clit.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come from this, and then I want you to come with my tongue in your pussy,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you insist...\u201d</p> <p>When he chuckled, the vibration against her nipple made her cry out. It wasn\u2019t a lighthearted laugh, but the sound of an incubus, knowing exactly how to pleasure her and where, dragging her down into the sensual darkness with him.</p><p>He gripped her thigh, encouraging her to wrap her legs around his body, rest her crossed heels on his ass, which flexed with his movements against her. \u201cIt\u2019s all about your pleasure, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>The whisper fired her blood. She raked her fingernails over his shoulders, tightened her legs on him, working her clit against him at her own pace. Meanwhile, he teased and nursed her breasts, squeezing and kneading, making the nerves ripple and ache, scream for more, sending out floods of sensation that drove pulses at all her erogenous points, and even beyond that, creating new ones. The track where she worked herself against his lower abdomen had become slick with her juices. If she lay on his stomach later, she\u2019d smell herself on him, a feral marking.</p><p>He opened the slacks, shoved them and the briefs beneath off his hips enough she could feel the rise of his bare ass beneath her calves, but more than that, she could now rub her pussy all the way to his groin area. She didn\u2019t feel the blunt stab of his cock, so she knew he must be keeping it pressed downward, out of the way for this part. She expected it was somewhat uncomfortable. The fact he was suffering for her just made her hotter.</p><p>Then he began doing something with his tongue, a quick lashing thing, alternated with the squeezes of his hands. When he followed with a deep sucking, punctuated by hungry murmurs in his throat, she was lost. She climaxed, a short, deeply intense wave, where she ground herself against him, crying out her pleasure to the night, all those stars becoming like shooting stars because of her glazed vision.</p><p>He kept suckling and squeezing, though she could tell his buttocks were pumping in rhythm with her, as if they were fucking in truth. But he didn\u2019t push that agenda. He kept to the mission he\u2019d described, waiting until she was shuddering with aftershocks to slide down her body, push his arms under her thighs, cup her buttocks in his two large hands, and put his mouth fully over her exposed cunt.</p><p>She screamed, the aftershocks pulsing against his lips. The tissues were so sensitive, but he slowed way down, making tender, slow licks along the labia, soft nuzzles on her clit that made her shudder. He was going for the slow build, so slow it was like a simple teasing aftermath, except his hands remained firm on her, his body taut with the desire he kept in check as he gave her pleasure, ramped up her desire again.</p><p>She wanted him in her arms, wanted to explore every inch of him, take his cock in her mouth, make him lose his mind as he was making her lose hers, but for now, this was also what she wanted.</p><p>All about your pleasure, Mistress. So much of what she did as a Domme was calculated, holding the reins, watching the sub get more and more aroused while she figured out what slight adjustments would affect his reactions. It was an aphrodisiac all its own, but this... This was somehow a different form of service, where she had to calculate nothing, not worry about the reins at all. He knew what she wanted from him.</p><p>When she had a brain to think about it, she would be considering this carefully, but she had to give him his due. He\u2019d said she wouldn\u2019t be able to think much, and he was delivering on that promise.</p><p>Shuddering, she stared up at the stars, floating in a lull between the climax of a moment ago and the one he was taking her toward now. Her heels rested high on his back, and her hands, now that he was between her legs, had caught hold of the netting at the top of the truck. She assumed it was to keep things from sliding around. It helped her bear down against his mouth, a very pleasurable feeling. Looking down her body, she found he had amazingly thick dark-blond lashes, fanning his cheeks. He stayed intent on his task, rough stubble abrading the tender insides of her thighs in a way she loved. She hoped the redness would be there tomorrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d never thought about wanting to be marked by a man. Or even about owning him. She owned her subs, commanded them, at the club, but outside, she was Janet. She stood alone, confident in that solitary strength and power. She told herself this was want, not need, but she couldn\u2019t deny the sharpness of the one was such she could easily mistake it for the other.</p><p>He pushed his tongue deep inside, stroked her silken tissues while suckling her clit on the outside, then started lashing that tiny bud of swollen flesh, a concentrated flogging that had her rising up to his mouth. His hands were strong on her legs, her hips, the muscles taut along his shoulders and back. She let go of the netting to reach down and grip his short hair, hold him to her, tug, convey her desires. He growled in response.</p><p>She arched back as he did something else that changed the waves of sensation, making it a spiral, then a staccato pressure, then a slow glide. She was moaning, and it didn\u2019t matter, she didn\u2019t want to rein back her response. She wanted him to know how much pleasure he was giving her.</p> <p>His fingers bit into her buttocks, beginning to knead, press the cheeks together, massaging the sensitive area in between with the pressure, and that arrowed right down into her pussy. Her legs tightened on those broad shoulders, and she imagined what he must look like from a view above, his ass likely moving in that instinctive coital rhythm with hers, even though their joining point wasn\u2019t cock and pussy, but his mouth between her legs, his hands clamped on her body, so she twisted and writhed within the span of his glorious hands.</p><p>Another rolling wave of sensation, and she felt the crash coming. She lifted up to meet it, her arms spread wide, clinging to the net again, her breasts lifted up with the arch of her body. She caught a glimpse of him looking, taking in the sight of her, and when he thrust deep with his tongue, pulled even harder on her clit, she knew he was monitoring everything, how close she was. When to take her that last step and then cut the lines, let her fly.</p><p>This time it was twice as intense, and not short at all. She cried out, long, moaning wails as the orgasm gripped her. Her fingers gripped the netting so fiercely it cut into her flesh. She could feel everywhere he touched her, mouth, fingers, his shoulders against the inside of her thighs. She wanted him on top of her, wanted to feel him.</p><p>The climax was ebbing, and she let go of the netting, clawed at his shoulders, telling him. He slid up her body and met her mouth with an impact that pushed her head back, his fingers framing her face, delving into her hair, elbows planted on either side of her shoulders, holding her down with the length of his body. Her hips jerked, still reacting to the climax, rubbing against him. The change in position had let his cock stretch into its intended upright stiff position, and the thick, rigid weight of it was against her abdomen. With his slacks and briefs pulled partly off, it would be a simple thing, that one last step.</p><p>But he merely kissed her. All that sweet need in her met the raw demand in him, their bodies melded together, quivering, held in a powerful stasis. When he at last lifted his head, his face was all harsh planes, eyes dark slashes in the night. She lifted a hand to him, and he closed his own around her wrist, pushing it back to the truck bed, holding it with her pulse battering against his palm. \u201cLet go of me, Max,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He took his time thinking about it, nuzzling her throat, rubbing his jaw against her hair. But then he released her, and she put her arm around his broad back, tracing the lines of muscle. He worked his way back down her body, gentle kisses that brought her back to earth as if she were borne on the wings of butterflies. She turned her head to the foam mat, eyes closed, merely feeling.</p><p>He kissed his way down her thighs, then put his mouth on her cunt, cleaned her, slow licks and teasing kisses, small sips to take away the fluids from her climax. She made soft sighs in response, and then he was kissing his way down the inside of the opposite thigh.</p><p>When he reached her ankles, he straightened onto his knees to adjust his slacks and the boxers beneath. He brought them both back up to his waist but left the slacks unhooked. Then he settled onto his heels and ran his hands up her calves. Learning her curves, enjoying her body but giving her enjoyment as well. His strong hands caressed areas many men forgot to tease and seduce as much as their more preferred parts of a woman. He ran his touch all the way up her legs, covering knees and thighs, then came back down to do the same thing all over again, starting at the arches of her feet.</p><p>Max grounded her and sent her floating at once. Eventually he unfastened the skirt so he could slide his hands unencumbered from her hips to her rib cage under her thin cotton shirt, give her the sensation of that same, strong rubbing glide, both a caress and a massage.</p><p>The cool night air was starting to seep into her skin, but he anticipated that as well. Bracketing her rib cage with both hands, he slid her up and worked the camo quilt out from under her, sandwiching her between that and the covered padded roll beneath. He joined her under it, pulling her close so she could wrap around his heat, lay her head on his chest. He stayed propped up against the netting, stroking her hair.</p><p>Her hand rested on his abdomen. When she let it ease downward, wanting to touch the sizeable erection available through the unhooked front of his slacks, he closed his fingers over hers, bringing them back up to his mouth. She tilted her head to look at him.</p> <p>\u201cMax, I want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let it be this tonight. Let it be all about you.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow at him, tapped his lips with her nail. \u201cMe touching you is about me. I did say I want to touch you. Should I make it a command?\u201d</p><p>His gaze kindled, reminding her that he was still a very aroused male who\u2019d not yet been sated. Not by a long shot. \u201cGive it a try,\u201d he encouraged, his voice low. \u201cIt\u2019ll make me harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up while I touch you,\u201d she said. Though he bit her finger, he let her hand go.</p><p>Sliding back down that same terrain, she was aware of his heated breath on the back of her neck as she bent her head to her desired task. The advantage of slacks was the same thing that had made them a disadvantage at the club, when she wanted a better look at his reaction. The fabric had enough give that it wasn\u2019t difficult to get her hand back beneath them. She worked her hand under his boxer briefs, not content to settle for merely feeling the shape of him through cloth. \u201cUnzip them the rest of the way,\u201d she said shortly, not willing to remove her other hand from where it curved behind his lower back.</p><p>He reached down, complied, and she helped, holding the fabric taut with two fingers as the teeth parted over the impressive mound. As she pushed her hand all the way beneath the briefs, his fingers caressed her forearm, then withdrew. When she closed her grip around that steel heat, his thigh muscles flexed, his heart ramping up its beat beneath her ear. She\u2019d handled a man\u2019s cock plenty of times before, but the first time could be as potent as a first kiss, if approached in the right frame of mind. She hadn\u2019t put any thought or preparation into it. She\u2019d just wanted to touch him, and as a result it was like having a hunger sated\u2014or discovered\u2014to grip him now.</p><p>Glancing up, she saw him watching her. Under her gaze, he deliberately stretched out a long arm, hooked his free hand in the netting. His other hand remained against her back. When she twisted her head, giving it a look, then glanced back at him pointedly, he didn\u2019t immediately respond, obviously weighing what he might do.</p> <p>\u201cMax,\u201d she purred. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>He moved the other hand then, both sets of fingers now hooked in the net, letting her do as she would. She kept her eyes on him as she slid her grip up to the head of his cock, rubbing her thumb across his wet slit. She wanted to taste that fluid and she did, lifting the finger to her mouth. His jaw got tighter, his eyes hot.</p><p>\u201cAll about me,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhy is that, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know a better way to be sure I get a second date?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, though there was a bite to it, a showing of her teeth, that conveyed she wasn\u2019t relaxing the terms of the moment. She liked seeing him restrained by her words, though still free to pounce. She preferred to be a lion tamer, letting the deadly animal make his own choices, held back only by her wits and words. She liked the thrill of being caught between his hunger for her, his own natural instincts, and a thin veneer of control, so blended he couldn\u2019t tell what was hers and his.</p><p>\u201cIs it that difficult to get a second date with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. You haven\u2019t had one date in the time I\u2019ve known you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m a very private person who doesn\u2019t let anyone know my personal business.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, just looked at her. She hadn\u2019t denied it, so it confirmed what he already knew. A very smart lion indeed. It hadn\u2019t been just in the time he\u2019d known her though. It had been far, far longer. In that time, nothing had ever been offered to her that would give her more than what the club sessions and her own vibrator could.</p><p>She used the point of her wrist to hold the slacks down so she could see her fist, wrapped firmly around his base. His cock jutted well above her grip, showing he was a good length and thickness. No woman would have to ask if he was all the way in when he was seated inside her. The flesh between her legs, still sensitive and moist, rippled at the thought. She loosened her grip enough to slide up, bringing some of that velvet skin with her, rubbing her thumb along the sensitive area beneath the head, and his breath drew in.</p><p>She knew how to get a man off, for certain. Now she entertained herself with a few slow pumps up and down, dragging her palm over the skin, not holding it too tightly, teasing the corona with her nails, giving him the sharp tip of her thumb nail in the slit once, making him quiver. She\u2019d like to see him naked, see the veins in those well-muscled thighs become more prominent as he resisted movement.</p><p>Turning her attention to his face, she shifted farther forward so she was still resting on her hip, still holding him, but her breasts were pressed against his chest, nipples prominent through the thin fabric of her cotton shirt so he\u2019d feel their tautness against his own flesh. She was close enough to be kissed, but she held there, that small space between them as she constricted her grip, did another firm glide upward, downward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His breath rasped out, fingers digging into the netting, which made his biceps bunch, the muscles of his stomach get even more rigid. \u201cSo,\u201d she purred. \u201cSince it\u2019s all about me, if I decided I have all I want for tonight, would you go home and jack off to Internet porn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He bit his bottom lip, dropping his head back against the truck\u2019s rear windshield, just above the netting. It exposed his throat\u2014not deliberately this time, but that didn\u2019t make it any less inviting. She restrained herself though, wanting his answer. Another tease of the ridged head with her nails, a sharper scrape this time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be lying there in the dark, fantasizing only about you. Thinking of your mouth on my cock. Your cunt closing around it. Sitting on top of me, while I held your breasts, still in that shirt. I love the way that looks, no bra.\u201d He groaned as she tightened her grip. \u201cI\u2019d bite your nipples through the cloth when you came again.\u201d</p> <p>God, this was like a drug. It always was, but in this different environment, with this different man, it was the contrast between a one-drink buzz and a much stronger proof. Perhaps not a substance manufactured by man, but natural, uncut arousal, emotions mixing with the physical to make it even more addictive.</p><p>\u201cBut what if I don\u2019t want you to come like that? What if I want you to keep your hands away from yourself, give me that pleasure when I decide I want it?\u201d</p><p>He brought his chin down. She\u2019d shifted close enough now it followed the line of her nose. When she adjusted so they were eye to eye, she bit his lip but drew back before it became a kiss, leaving that tempting flesh swollen from the pressure she\u2019d put on it. The look in those gray eyes now was unmistakable. The lion was deciding if it was time to leap. She was on the fence herself, not sure if she wanted him to take her down, or rein himself back at her command. Both options had an appeal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say...\u201d He closed that inch, too quick for her to withdraw, and caught her lip in a sharp nip. Then he leaned back with a challenging, heavy-lidded look, holding on to the truck webbing with strong fists. \u201cWhen can I pick you up for that second date?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>Janet sat on the roof of the K&amp;A building, her lunch open next to her, untouched. The potted ferns surrounding her waved in the breeze. A trio of tiny bells, hung from a stake in the soil of one of the plants, chimed softly. From this height, she could see the Mississippi, the boat traffic coming and going. This little spot was all hers. She\u2019d discovered it during her first year at K&amp;A, when she\u2019d brought some maintenance men up here for roof repairs. Over time, she\u2019d designed her own space, importing a couple of lounge chairs, an umbrella for shade, the plants.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t care for company at lunch, she came here. If it was an early spring or fall day, when the weather was irresistible, she might forward her phone and bring her laptop up here to work a couple hours. If Matt decided a contract needed another minor revision after the hard copies had already been sent out and filed, or rescheduled a meeting at the last minute that involved twenty people in four different countries, she\u2019d come up here for five minutes. He probably had no idea how many times her ability to do that had saved his life.</p><p>Today, however, she wasn\u2019t seeking solitude to avoid homicide. She had a lot on her mind. She also wanted to finish a task she didn\u2019t particularly care to explain to anyone.</p><p>Adjusting her reading glasses, she focused on the shirt in her lap. She kept a button jar in her desk, stocked with buttons that would match what was on most men\u2019s dress shirts. She\u2019d found several that could replace the ones on Max\u2019s shirt, the ones that had been lost in the Progeny parking lot. Wetting the thread with her lips, she peered through the glasses to thread the needle and then tied it off, shaking out the shirt over her knees. Up here by herself, she could do the girly thing, put it to her face and inhale his scent. She\u2019d kept it neatly folded in a bag under her desk all morning, yet had barely resisted the urge to take it into the bathroom and do just that, several times. She shook her head at herself.</p><p>He could have tried to fuck her. Demanded to do so. But he hadn\u2019t. On one level, he\u2019d served her almost like a sub, bringing her pleasure, giving her release multiple times. But usually in a session, her focus was on putting a sub through his paces, getting him so wound up, he\u2019d beg for anything, including the right to come. Max had been so hard that it had been difficult for him to get his trousers fastened again, to position himself behind the wheel when it was time to take her back to her car, but he hadn\u2019t demanded anything from her. Moving slow, letting her hold on to control. Yet she wasn\u2019t really controlling anything, was she?</p><p>He\u2019d assured her at the dock that no one would come up on him unawares, and she\u2019d believed him without question. When he dropped her off, walked her to her car, he\u2019d taken her keys, opened her door for her. She\u2019d noted his visual sweep of the interior, making sure she was the only occupant of the car. Gestures like that, as automatic to him as breathing, inspired a woman\u2019s instinctive trust. She knew the dangers of that, but she\u2019d learned those dangers from a much different kind of man. Since then, she\u2019d grown up, gotten better judgment, though having confidence in it had been a hard-won battle. When one made such a series of terrible, horrifying mistakes, it took years to believe in oneself again. She\u2019d made it, and she wondered if a man like Max was the prize for such a journey.</p> <p>Before he\u2019d let her get into her car, he\u2019d slid an arm around her waist, his fingers stroking her backside through the thin skirt. She hadn\u2019t ever put on the panties. Though he didn\u2019t linger, it was obvious he desired strongly to do so. The cock pressed against her hip was still more than ready to serve her. He put his mouth to her ear.</p><p>\u201cNext time you put your hands on yourself, think of me, Mistress. I\u2019ll be thinking of you. And suffering like hell, because I won\u2019t be touching what\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t figure him out, and that would keep her going back for more. Neither Dom nor sub, yet elements of both that conflicted with and complemented her own skill set. So what did that leave?</p><p>Despite the bright sunlight, Janet shivered. The nip was still in the air, because the sun kept coming and going. She\u2019d known that before she came up, but she\u2019d left her sweater downstairs. It proved her level of distraction.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t set a second date with him. Not just to torment him, but to give her some time to think. However, today was Thursday, the day he was going to come with her to the ballet school. There she\u2019d be, supervising a bevy of hormonal teenage girls, who\u2019d be thinking the same things she was thinking about him. Only whereas he was beyond their reach, he was solidly under her fingertips, everything offered.</p><p>The access door to the roof opened with a metallic squeak. It irritated her mildly, but she expected it was one of the maintenance workers who sometimes came up to tweak one of the heating and air units. On the rare occasions their visits coincided with her lunch time, they didn\u2019t usually speak to her beyond a cordial greeting.</p><p>When she looked up, anticipating such an exchange, she was surprised to see her boss.</p><p>Matt Kensington\u2019s height and breadth spoke of his father\u2019s military and football background, but the dark hair and eyes, the rugged beauty of his face, were a combination of his father\u2019s Texas roots and his mother\u2019s Italian ones. His full name was Matthew Lord Kensington. Occasionally a business rival would make the cutting joke that Matt preferred to go by Lord Kensington. The joke wasn\u2019t made too often, however, probably because the honorific fit him so well no one could argue with it. The sheer authority that emanated from him said it wouldn\u2019t matter his era or circumstances of birth, he\u2019d always end up leading men. Not from fear or intimidation\u2014though he was quite capable of those traits\u2014but out of respect for his leadership abilities.</p> <p>He asked for a hundred and twenty percent from those who worked for him, and he gave a hundred and thirty percent of his own effort to lead by example. He had the prescience of a demigod and an uncanny ability to see a situation in full spectrum, even while he tracked details like a medieval monk working on an illustrated manuscript. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, the four men most loyal to him augmented his strength with equally impressive capabilities of their own.</p><p>Her lips curved in a rueful smile at the small but significant evidence of his capabilities. He\u2019d brought her sweater. As he reached her, he shook it out, swept it around her shoulders, snugging it up around her collarbone. As he did, he touched her cheek in an affectionate caress and then lowered himself into a sideways seated position on the lounge chair across from her. As he opted to stretch his long legs out beside her crossed ankles, rather than staying flatfooted and having his knees up to his chin in the low lounge chair, she made a mental note to bring a chair up here more suitable for him. He\u2019d never come up before, but she wasn\u2019t surprised he knew about the spot, or that he\u2019d known to find her here.</p><p>If she had a chair up here that could accommodate a larger man, perhaps another man, one of a similar size, might one day join her.</p><p>\u201cDid you need me for something?\u201d Automatically, she checked to make sure her phone was still on forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, the universe is spinning adequately without either of us today.\u201d In a surprise move, Matt turned so he was stretched out on the lounge, adjusting the back so he was only slightly reclined, his feet braced on either side of it. He lifted his face to the sun as it re-emerged, closing his eyes. \u201cNice day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She bent her head back to the shirt, focused on the button she was sewing. \u201cHow many times have you visited Angelica\u2019s webcam today? Or do you just keep it on full time now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve managed to limit myself to ten minutes every hour. Our nanny probably feels like she\u2019s under a microscope, but I just want to see her play with her fingers and toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope Katherine is doing her job, not playing with her fingers and toes. Or any other part of her anatomy.\u201d</p><p>Matt snorted, didn\u2019t reply to that. He kept his eyes closed, one set of fingers casually resting on his thigh, the other holding the frame of the lounge by his head. He\u2019d left his jacket below, so he had the sleeves of his white shirt rolled up. Pulling the needle through the similar shirt in her lap, Janet smiled, remembering the week Savannah had returned to work. It had taken awhile, Savannah needing to recuperate from the C-section and hysterectomy, and then on top of that she\u2019d opted to stay home several months with Angelica, coordinating her workload with her executive staff from the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After several days of catching up at her office, Savannah had come by Matt\u2019s on the way to a lunch meeting. While the couple was talking in his office, Janet had overheard Matt teasing his wife. He was trying his best to convince her to turn on the webcam in her office, so he could watch her throughout the day, just like he did Angelica.</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, I don\u2019t have four minions to run every aspect of my company,\u201d Savannah retorted. \u201cAnd I refuse to indulge your twisted fantasies.\u201d There\u2019d been laughter in her voice, however.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m trying to indulge your twisted fantasies,\u201d Matt suggested.</p> <p>\u201cYou just want access to proprietary information, and even offering to striptease for me in front of your computer isn\u2019t going to work. Now, if you have Lucas do a striptease, I might consider it.\u201d</p><p>Janet had glanced up to see Matt drawing his wife between his long legs where he had his hips braced on the edge of his desk. Savannah kept her arms stubbornly crossed until he snagged her wrist, pulling her all the way to him.</p><p>Always anticipating her boss\u2019s needs, Janet had pressed the button beneath her desk that closed the double doors with a silent whoosh of air. He only had ten minutes before his next meeting, and Savannah was just making a brief stop, but there were things other than sex that required privacy between a bonded couple. The tender way he drew her to him, the soft, knowing look in Savannah\u2019s eyes, despite her teasing, told Janet it was one of those times. Matt had almost lost his wife and child a few months ago, and he was still coming to terms with that, figuring out how once again to hold on tight out of love, not fear. A person had to risk freedom with the one he loved, to enrich the relationship with the qualities that came with standing alone as well as together.</p><p>She mulled on that. \u201cMatt, did you know Max before he came to work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor about a year or so, though most of our contact was as part of my interactions with other friends I have in the service. One of them sent him my way when Max left the SEALs.\u201d</p> <p>She tied off the one button, snipped the threads with her small scissors. One down, three to go. Matt\u2019s eyes had opened, and he was studying what she was doing. She kept her attention on the shirt. She was not going to blush. She was not a blusher, even if there were very few reasons a man\u2019s shirt could have several buttons missing. Matt had seen her at the club, knew her Domme tendencies. For all he knew, she\u2019d ripped the shirt off a sub as part of a session. That would make sense. But the tender, intimate act of sewing the buttons back on for said sub, when she could order him to do it and inspect it the next week as part of the ongoing game?</p><p>Not so much.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when SEALs go through training, they do uniform inspection. If a shoe isn\u2019t shined properly, or a button is loose, they lose points. Which means that every one of them knows how to sew a button on a shirt, probably as well as my tailor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting factoid,\u201d she said, not faltering over her sewing in the slightest. \u201cWhy did he leave the SEALs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not going to tell you that.\u201d Matt straightened and turned, bringing his feet back to one side of the lounge again. He leaned forward, toyed with the button she\u2019d sewn. \u201cTight and even. Maybe I should have you do my mending.\u201d</p><p>She swatted at his hand, making him draw back. \u201cRight after I stab you in the eye with this needle.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned, a devastating expression that could dribble a woman\u2019s heart in her chest like a manic basketball. Fortunately, she took daily inoculations against the charms of the K&amp;A men. But Matt could affect her for reasons far beyond female hormones, and he proved it now, sobering.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been distracted this week,\u201d her boss said, no censure in his tone. He understood her work ethic, her personal pride in perfection. He wasn\u2019t here to chastise her for sloppy work, because she hadn\u2019t done any. He just knew her.</p><p>\u201cSomewhat.\u201d She nodded, pulling on the thread. \u201cI\u2019m working it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he treating you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably better than I deserve.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. The jerk of reaction caused her to prick herself with the needle. Why had she said that?</p><p>As a drop of blood welled up from her forefinger, Matt picked up her hand, put it in his mouth. He sucked the blood away with a swirl of his tongue, then put his thumb over the tiny wound, his other fingers resting on her wrist, holding her in place. Most men, she\u2019d pull away if they held her restrained like this, but not Matt.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t have. Because nothing is further from the truth.\u201d His dark eyes held hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not true.\u201d She straightened her back, but she let her hand stay in his grip. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than.\u201d But his expression stayed serious. \u201cHe has some significant demons of his own, Janet. The difference is, he was trained up front to deal with them, and you had to learn on the back end. You both handle them damn well. They don\u2019t rule your lives. But like yours, his are still there. If he\u2019s vulnerable, if he lets his guard down, they can attack.\u201d</p><p>His expression became more thoughtful. \u201cThroughout my life, because of my father and the contacts that continued after his death, I\u2019ve been exposed to people in various branches of the military. SEALs are a unique breed. They\u2019re trained to keep everything close. They don\u2019t share with outsiders, not only because most of what they do and endure is classified, but because it\u2019s part of who and what they are. Keep that in mind.</p><p>\u201cOn a different note,\u201d he glanced at her, \u201ca SEAL would make a hell of a Dom or sub, one because they\u2019re ambidextrous in a sense\u2014trained to lead and follow. Also because they\u2019re machines, the way they process details. As a sub, he\u2019d notice everything about a Mistress; how she feels, what she wants. He\u2019s not anticipating; he\u2019s actually in the now, watching the details, while another part of his brain is planning how to handle it. When the guy in charge tells you what to do, you stop what you\u2019re doing and do it, so he\u2019s immediately responsive.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was obvious, and why she got several different vibes from Max\u2014Dom, sub and something that was neither.</p><p>Matt lifted his thumb, verified the blood had clotted and there wasn\u2019t anything that could get on Max\u2019s shirt. She thought of her boss\u2019s warm mouth on her skin. Her immunity to the K&amp;A men\u2019s considerable sexual potency notwithstanding, her body was vibrating, every nerve ending now alive, because the touch of Matt\u2019s mouth had reminded her of Max\u2019s, between her legs. \u201cThat was a little unsanitary,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cThe best treatments usually are.\u201d Matt gave her a wink, another brief touch on her cheek. \u201cI better head out for my one o\u2019clock. And yes, I opened the documents you sent me on my tablet, and they\u2019re all there. I have what I need, thanks to my infallible admin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that at Christmas bonus time. The Mustang needs new tires, and I want to get her special rims.\u201d</p><p>Matt chuckled. \u201cThose rims can come out of the exorbitant-but-worth-every-penny salary I pay you, but if she needs new tires, charge it through my expense account. And you\u2019ll still get that Christmas bonus.\u201d He moved toward the access door but paused with his hand on the latch. The look he gave her reminded Janet why very few crossed Matt Kensington.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cut yourself down like that again, Janet. I won\u2019t tolerate anyone treating you badly, and that includes yourself.\u201d</p><p>Max took the overpass walkway from the parking deck to the main building, then hit the stairs. He was between tasks and figured he\u2019d do a pass by Janet\u2019s desk to see if she needed to go by her house before the dance class, so he could adjust his departure times accordingly. He\u2019d be picking Dana up at the church at four, giving him plenty of time to get her home and swing back by, since Janet rarely left at five, due to projects Matt and the guys had had in process these past few months.</p><p>Since their night at the dock, he hadn\u2019t seen much of the woman who\u2019d been uppermost in his thoughts. When he left her at her car at the club, she\u2019d pushed his dress shirt off his shoulders, tucked it into the Mustang without explanation. He\u2019d had all sorts of fantasies about her wearing it, only those one or two remaining buttons holding it closed over her bare body. She\u2019d felt superb under his exploration, firm and soft in all the right places, arching up into his touch.</p><p>Because the limo drivers often doubled up as security during slow times, he had the same access to K&amp;A as Randall. As a result, Max had come by her desk early that next day, before anyone else arrived. Only the dim security light had illuminated her command central area, and Matt and the other guys\u2019 offices were all locked up.</p><p>It felt right, leaving her a token. Nothing extraordinary, just a four-piece box of handmade truffles from a local chocolatier, and a handful of wildflowers from the dock area. He\u2019d threaded them into the vase of white and yellow roses on her desk. The executive level always had fresh flowers, part of the ambiance, and he was pleased to see the ones he left complimented the roses. Would she notice? Thinking of how carefully she\u2019d watched his every reaction the previous night, he expected she would.</p><p>That same day, she\u2019d sent him a text. Chocolate and flowers? Still angling for that second date?</p><p>Always. Name the time and place, baby.</p><p>He\u2019d added the teasing endearment on purpose and was rewarded with an emoticon in return, the one with the tongue stuck out. It kept him grinning, but true to what he\u2019d expect of a woman of her nature, that had been their last interaction that week. He\u2019d deduced she was going to hold off taking it any further until after the ballet class, both to torture him and to keep things slow, in control. That was all right. Of all people, he understood the value of timing, planning, strategy. It gave him time to plan his own.</p><p>As he stepped off the elevator, he detected a hint of tension in the air and found the source of it quickly enough. Janet was standing behind her desk, her fingertips resting on top of a stack of folders, her steely gaze fixed on Ben O\u2019Callahan, who was shrugging into his suit jacket with an impatient motion. Max recalled today\u2019s schedule, the details mapped in his head like a desk calendar. Wade was dropping him at Jackson Square for a lunch meet with the lawyers from Bally, Winslow and Martin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about that,\u201d Ben said, a hard edge to his tone. \u201cI need to change my five p.m. appointment today to a different date. Jenkins and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already spoke to Mr. Jenkins about that. He said he can meet you in the morning, and I moved your nine a.m. with Ellen Watkins to ten a.m. She said that worked better for her anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we handle it tonight, it keeps the workload for tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly the same.\u201d Janet\u2019s jaw was set, though she didn\u2019t emanate any temper. Simple inflexibility, like a brick wall. \u201cThe decisions you made tonight wouldn\u2019t be typed up until tomorrow anyhow, and I\u2019ll make sure the paralegals put it top priority so it\u2019s all done before the end of the workday.\u201d She held out a handful of slips to him. \u201cHere are your messages, none of which interfere with your five o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Ben approached her desk, eyes narrowed. Max wanted to take a few more steps into the area, be the knife to cut the tension, but he checked himself with effort. It would be foolish to defend Janet from a mere verbal assault, and one that came from a difficult man she handled regularly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t authorize you to do any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. Aren\u2019t you glad I\u2019m here to anticipate your needs?\u201d Janet arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I decided I wanted my meet with Jenkins right back where the hell I wanted it?\u201d Ben asked in a deceptively pleasant tone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s probably made other plans by now, being just as busy and important a person as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You\u2019ll tell Matt if I skip my bloody five o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She held his gaze. \u201cAre you asking me to do so?\u201d</p><p>The lawyer pressed his lips together, the clash of wills going on for another ten seconds. Max reconsidered his idea of moving into the room, because for a moment Ben did in fact look like he might reach across and choke her. But Janet had that stapler close to hand. She\u2019d brain him with it in a heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ben plucked the pink message slips from her hand, \u201care Satan\u2019s Mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlattery will get you everywhere.\u201d She gave him that ice-cool look, but her hand closed on his, squeezed briefly. \u201cGo to the five o\u2019clock, Ben.\u201d</p> <p>That gesture evaporated the tension between them. The rueful twist of Ben\u2019s lips said that, whatever had happened, he knew she was right. His Irish temper was hot, but brief, and he didn\u2019t usually let himself off the hook for it, which he proved now. \u201cSorry, Janet.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tapped his wrist. \u201cGive Nancy Adams a call on your way. She\u2019s the message on top. She just wants to know the projected filing date, and she\u2019s not a talker. If you know the date, I could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it. I need to charm her a bit for what I\u2019m going to want from her in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, lesser miracles than you and charm have been known to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. Tell Satan to send up some demons to give you a hand, so you can get out of here on time.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a suitably disdainful look in answer to that, and then he was headed to the elevators, shouldering his laptop bag as he went through the message notes.</p><p>Max noted the slight tension leave Janet\u2019s shoulders as Ben left her area. Then she noticed him and her gaze cleared, a smile curving her lips that warmed him from head to toe.</p><p>He sidled into the room, leaned against the corner by her printer table. Ben didn\u2019t take a limo to that five o\u2019clock meeting, but his attitude toward it, and how regularly it occurred, made it pretty clear what it was, to a discreet staff that paid attention. It was a therapy session.</p> <p>Ben was the most streetwise of the group, with a volatile Irish temper yet a fierce loyalty to all of them. Marcie, Cass\u2019 little sister, had been in love with him since her teens and just this year had gone to great lengths to prove he and she were meant to be together. Her stubbornness had convinced him. However, earlier in the year, when Marcie had come back into Ben\u2019s life, the man had been struggling with some nasty issues from his past, trying to drown them in alcohol.</p><p>Max had had a ringside seat when Ben\u2019s past and present had collided, and had witnessed the collateral damage it had caused. But the result was Ben was now getting help and seemed to be doing better. Of course, Max had buddies who\u2019d had to get treatment for PTSD, and knew no man enjoyed the serious mind probing needed to get back on track, let alone one used to being in authority. Ben was the most hardcore sexual Dominant of all of the executive team, with serious control issues. Max wondered if his therapist took Valium before their sessions.</p><p>He liked a lot of things about Ben and wished him well, but he couldn\u2019t deny the knot of tension that had risen in his chest at the exchange between him and Janet. If Ben had reached across that desk in any way Max interpreted as a threat, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to put him on the ground. Hard. He wasn\u2019t going to let anyone touch her.</p><p>Okay, maybe he needed to step back, get his emotions under control. Anger and passion had their place, but not in executing a mission goal. He still hadn\u2019t really decided what his mission goal was with Janet, but the strategy had to be carefully thought out, not driven by reckless emotion. Then he thought about how she\u2019d climaxed, crying out to the stars. Maybe reckless emotion had its place as well.</p><p>When he approached the desk, he couldn\u2019t help reaching out, touching the hand resting on the files. She had thin hands, elegant, but the knuckles were a little prominent due to the thinness. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Ben and I regularly lock horns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a little less good-natured than I\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think they\u2019re hitting some particularly rough areas in his sessions right now.\u201d</p><p>He appreciated that she didn\u2019t bother pretending he didn\u2019t know Ben was in therapy, even as he was impressed that she recognized how in tune he was with the comings and goings of his main charges. He supposed they shared that trait.</p><p>\u201cI keep it marked on all their calendars,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhich he doesn\u2019t know, but as a result, no one makes any meetings for him during that time, just like when Dana was doing physical therapy and Peter was going with her. They watch out for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you watch out for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what Satan\u2019s Mistress does,\u201d she said.</p><p>When she sat down at the desk, smoothing her skirt beneath her hips, he realized it had flustered her a little. He knew Ben didn\u2019t intimidate her, so that suggested something in Ben\u2019s struggle had resonated with her. He didn\u2019t comment on it, simply filed it away as he let her choose which way to go to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided teenage girls terrify you and you\u2019re here to back out of the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, teenage girls terrify me, but no, I\u2019m not here to back out.\u201d He smiled at that. \u201cI wanted to know if you need to go to your house beforehand.\u201d</p><p>She considered him with a bemused look that instantly made him wary. \u201cHow early can you take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive o\u2019clock. I need to run Dana home. You\u2019ve been pretty slammed here though. I don\u2019t mind waiting around if you need to work later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I told Matt I\u2019d be leaving on time today. There\u2019s something I want you to do beforehand, at my house. And no, I\u2019m not going to tell you what it is.\u201d</p><p>Okay, wary moved right into alarm, but he covered it with a shrug. \u201cWhatever you need.\u201d</p><p>She gave him that thoughtful look again. \u201cDo you live here, Max? You never seem to leave.\u201d</p><p>He made a vague grunt. \u201cI go get food. I never miss a meal. And I expect you know my home address already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it on my stalker board at home. I\u2019ll show it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d He let his gaze drift over her face, pause on her lips as he recalled their last kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a different gloss today.\u201d A different scent.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her look challenged him to try to find out what it was in exactly the same way he had last time. Matt\u2019s door was open. The man was sitting at his desk twenty feet away, on a call, but he had a clear shot of Janet\u2019s desk.</p><p>Max thought about meeting her challenge anyway, but they both knew he wouldn\u2019t take it further than that. That was part of the charge. But he better head back to the elevator, or his typical male reaction to such a challenge would become way too obvious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at five, ma\u2019am. Looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Her snort followed him to the elevator. When he stopped there and looked back, she was giving him a thorough appraisal. She didn\u2019t look away when he noticed, not embarrassed to be caught looking. From the direction of her glance, the way it shifted upward at her own leisurely pace, he had a pretty good idea she\u2019d been studying his ass. He was wearing slacks and the K&amp;A dark embroidered placket shirt, no sports coat over it at the moment. When he lifted a brow, she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sexual harassment,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Despite the distance, she offered a seductive smile and picked up her pen. \u201cReport me,\u201d she mouthed, and gave him a wink.</p><p>He grinned all the way back to the parking deck.</p><p>Matt decided to leave with Janet, as he was meeting Savannah in the French Quarter for an early dinner with Peter and Dana. They\u2019d all been working long hours, so Max could tell Janet was pleased they were taking some time as couples. However, since Matt walked out with her when Max pulled the limo out to the front, there was no immediate one-on-one time.</p><p>Max kept an eye on her in the mirror, but she was still in full work mode, switching out papers with Matt for him to sign, their heads bent together as Matt showed her certain things he needed adjusted. He wanted them by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. With the dance class tonight, Max wondered when she would get any sleep. But she didn\u2019t seem concerned at all, merely agreeing it would be done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Matt exited the limo at Jackson Square, he gave Max a nod. \u201cTake care of her.\u201d Those dark, hawklike eyes held his a moment, then Kensington turned and was striding across the street, a tall, powerful man who always drew attention. He crossed in front of one of the carriages, gave the dappled horse harnessed to it a fond pat on the nose before he cut through the park.</p><p>\u201cHome, James,\u201d Janet said from the back. Max glanced up at her amused face in the rearview, then pulled away from the curb. \u201cI notice you didn\u2019t ask for my address,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s on my stalker board.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. I figured that was you outside my house this week, scratching on my windows. I\u2019ll leave some Windex out there so you can make yourself useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you need a gardener to cut back branches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I prefer to do it myself. I like yard work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I can come help you do it this weekend. I\u2019m pretty handy with pruners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Bringing me to screaming orgasm in the back of your pickup is one thing. Helping me with yard work is moving way too fast. I\u2019m feeling smothered. We may need to back off this relationship for a while.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cYou want to come sit up here? It might save your life, because I keep looking in the mirror to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m ordering you to stop looking at me.\u201d She slid out of his view then. A moment later, she was leaning against the seat directly behind him, her voice so close her breath touched his ear. \u201cJust drive, Max.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hand around the side of the seat and found the open collar of his placket shirt, her thumb caressing the light layer of hair there. He was taught to focus on more than one thing at once, so he didn\u2019t have to tell her to stop to get her home safely. Not unless her hand dropped to his cock, in which case they might have a real problem. They didn\u2019t really cover cock teasing in combination with combat driving.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist covering her hand, though, interlacing his fingers with hers. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you a lot this week. Missed you.\u201d</p><p>She was silent a moment, her fingers going still beneath his touch. He sensed a pressure against the seat, almost as if she\u2019d rested her cheek against it. \u201cI don\u2019t really do easy when it comes to relationships, Max. I prefer chess to checkers. Is that going to be a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ma\u2019am. Not so far.\u201d To his way of thinking, learning the way his opponent played the game was to anticipate and get out ahead of them, make them play the game on his terms. He sensed some of that between them, but something else too. Something that was more like checkers and chess mixed. He stroked her fingers. She was very responsive, every inch of her skin so aware of contact. He felt her concentration on that one stimulation. It made him want to touch a whole lot more of her.</p> <p>Her Garden District house was built in the eighteen hundreds. It was a two-story with floor-to-ceiling front windows, large black shutters and an elaborate wrought iron railing on the second story. The front porch was flanked with a lush potted garden. He noted what she\u2019d mentioned, that some of the surrounding vegetation and trees were growing a little wild, but in an appealing way. On the side of the house, vines twisted around the light post, which threw illumination along a cobbled garden path. She told him it led to a screened gazebo and porch in back. Two big concrete pineapples on either side of the front walkway welcomed visitors.</p><p>It was a nice place, and though Max was sure Matt Kensington paid her well, this type of home was beyond a secretary\u2019s salary. Perhaps an inheritance? For all that he knew about her at work, he realized there was little he knew of her outside it. She didn\u2019t speak with an accent. No Southern or Texas drawl, no Midwest flavoring. She spoke with precise, perfect English, like someone raised with a strict, disciplined education. Whether intended or not, it fed into the Domme side of her, making it easy to imagine her as a stern schoolmistress or haughty queen. From what he\u2019d seen of her performance with Thor, that was just an element of the whole, genuine package. She was a woman who enjoyed control over a man, and could make him enjoy it as well, even if it wasn\u2019t necessarily a part of his nature as it was with Thor.</p><p>She pointed him to an alley to park the limo, and chose to walk with him rather than have him drop her off in front. She took him up to the house through a back cut-through, so he saw the garden space she\u2019d created in her small backyard. It was obvious that, when in season, fresh vegetables and herbs grew in pleasant disarray next to more carefully designed flower beds and shrub groupings. In addition to the gazebo and porch, there was a screened pavilion in the yard so she could enjoy her garden at ground level without being eaten by the bugs. The porch had a saltwater spa she explained converted to a hot tub in the colder months. It was nine feet by six feet, a rectangular small pool.</p><p>She took him past it to the back door. Handing him the keys, she let him open the door. He stepped in, taking stock of their surroundings, then gestured to her to step in and lead the way.</p><p>Janet gave him a curious glance but said nothing. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d seen her making note of his personal security detail training, but she was apparently like him, filing it away rather than bringing it up. At least not until it would be useful to their interactions.</p><p>Her interior layout was what he expected. Quality furniture choices, a little eclectic, but they worked together. She added touches of color with flowers and pillows as women did, but kept the walls a simple, clean white, accenting them with pictures. Over the sofa in the living area was a large oil painting of a ballerina. Her back was to the viewer, but she was stretched out on the floor of a dance studio, a bevy of milling ballerinas behind her in their gauzy white skirts. She was on her hip, one leg pointed and bent over the other, her back arched and hand gracefully lifted behind her head.</p><p>A matching painting on the adjacent corner showed a ballerina leaping in the air, that white flowing skirt making her look like a bird in flight. The leotard she wore was cut low between her small breasts, accenting the slim grace of her body. Her face was to the camera, but his attention returned to the one that wasn\u2019t. It was the central feature of the room as one came into it, meaning it had the most significance to her.</p><p>The space was comfortable, a haven for the woman who lived here. He could imagine she did some entertaining, but likely small groups of intimates. She wouldn\u2019t invite strangers or business acquaintances here. He\u2019d bet money on it.</p> <p>\u201cFollow me upstairs.\u201d She touched his arm, moved up the steps, her fingers trailing the banister. She had her hair twisted on her nape, accentuating the delicate ears, the slender bones of her neck. It reminded him of the ballerina in the painting. His gaze followed its desired track down the trim lines of her suit where it nipped her waist, clung to the swell of her hips and ass, accented those gorgeous legs. She had on a slip beneath the skirt. He could see the edge of lace through the modest slit, a strange vulnerability that made his heart tighten. She\u2019d stepped out of the shoes before she went up, and carried the low-heeled pumps in her hand.</p><p>He put his hand on the banister and followed her.</p><p>She turned the corner and vanished. When he reached the top of the wooden steps, he saw there was a side table in the hallway, holding a vase of flowers. Two small paintings flanked them, probably bought from the art district. They were New Orleans Blue Dog paintings, one where replicas of the dog lined a railroad track, and the other showing four images of him in a grid pattern. The whimsy of it reflected the woman herself. Controlled beauty with touches of the unpredictable, hints of the chaotic passion she could display as well. He was willing to put a lot of effort into making that last one happen again.</p><p>There was one photograph on the table as well. A young woman who looked like Janet, likely a sister. She had a soft prettiness that Janet did not, but Max saw it as a difference, not a shortcoming. Janet made up for it with her mesmerizing charisma. They shared a love of dance, because in the posed shot, the photo\u2019s subject reached for the ceiling, leg stretched out behind her, neck arched as she cast her gaze toward the stage. She wore the gauzy long skirt, her upper body clad in a brief top of satin and glitter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Nelle,\u201d Janet said, something odd in her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s not part of this.\u201d</p><p>When Max looked toward her, she was leaning against the doorframe of a room at the end of the hall, and she had something in her hands, a black piece of cloth with strings trailing from it. He decided to leave that peculiar statement alone, for now. He came toward her. Through the open doors he passed, he saw a guest bedroom, an extra bath and what appeared to be her home office. The rail followed the hallway, open to the foyer below.</p><p>\u201cStop there,\u201d she said, when he was about three feet from her. He would far prefer to close the distance between them, because he could feel her intent need and wanted to taste it, but he complied. There was a tranquility to the house he liked, a hushed presence that suggested it was a good space, a place guests would feel welcome, when she chose to make them so. What was swirling between them in the hall had a biting edge of the unknown, of risk and danger, but the kind that engaged his senses, sharpened them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing my homework,\u201d she said, \u201cand learning more about your training. What they\u2019ll share online of course. The one that intrigued me was \u2018ditch and don\u2019. Do you remember it?\u201d</p><p>Where a SEAL was required to ditch his gear underwater and then put it back on, all without surfacing. If even a strap was out of place, he had to redo it until he got it right. Guys who made it through Hell Week sometimes didn\u2019t make it through the water phase, discovering they couldn\u2019t handle that sense of drowning, of lungs burning and still having to think, to stay focused on the task, the mission.</p><p>\u201cI remember it.\u201d</p><p>While she threaded the black fabric, some kind of satin, through her fingers, he noticed she\u2019d changed her nail polish to a deep burgundy. It matched what was on her lips beneath that gloss. Strawberry. That was this week\u2019s scent. Not a sickly sweet teenager\u2019s gloss. Just a faint fragrance that made him imagine her biting into the fruit, licking the juice from her lips, the red deepening the color of her tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come up with an exercise somewhat like that. I want you to help dress me for my class.\u201d Now she lifted the piece of fabric. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear this blindfold, so you have to do it all by touch and intelligence.\u201d</p><p>He extended his hand. \u201cLet me see the mask.\u201d</p><p>She put it in his palm, her fingers whispering over it as she withdrew. It would cover his face fully, a hole for his mouth and nose, and lace down the back curve of his skull to ensure that he was fully blinded, no chance of cheating and catching a glimpse. He grimaced. A SEAL wasn\u2019t above cheating if needed to achieve the objective, because the point was winning. A fair fight, while an exciting challenge, always made that more difficult. He had a more important concern, however.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s laced up, I can\u2019t get it off fast.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from the doorway then. Even in her bare feet, she was as much a temptress as Medusa, making a man want to look at her, no matter the consequences. She put her hand on his wrist, moving the hand holding the mask out of her way to press against him. He\u2019d donned his jacket for the ride, and now she slid her arm under it. Her fingers caressed the nine millimeter in the shoulder holster, then slid down his rib cage, to the pocket of his khakis. Dipping in there, she stroked his upper thigh and came back with a folded knife. He caught hold of her wrist as she brought it up between them, anticipating when she depressed the spring and the blade snapped out, wicked sharp, between them.</p><p>\u201cYou could cut the laces pretty quickly with this, but there won\u2019t be a need. This is just you and me. No threat, no danger. You\u2019ll be giving up control to me, obeying my will, performing this task to my satisfaction. Much like you did for your instructors. Giving them everything to earn their pleasure, their respect.\u201d</p><p>Imagining his hard-edged BUD/S instructors as Dominatrices, complete with boots and corsets, was an image he didn\u2019t necessarily want planted in his head, but it did loosen some of the tightness in his chest. He saw a smile flirting around her lips, a reassurance with the demand.</p><p>\u201cI want something in return.\u201d He folded the knife, returned it to his pocket. She kept one hand light on his chest, her other hooked on his belt. She was so close, but he could feel that dense energy between them, a wall she wasn\u2019t yet ready to let down. It was intense, being this close to her and yet feeling held back by her will alone. He could shove through it, but he knew which doors were to be kicked down and which ones worked better with a knock.</p> <p>She cocked her head. Waited, those dark eyes a seductress\u2019s tool.</p><p>\u201cI want you to let your hair down. I want to see it before you blind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamson and Delilah.\u201d But she hesitated at the thought, glanced up at him. \u201cI won\u2019t betray you, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He touched her hair. \u201cI\u2019ve often thought there was more to that story. I think she loved him, and they forced her to betray him, or tricked her into it. It probably destroyed her as much as it did him, in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be tricked or forced. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not you. And not me either.\u201d He gave her a significant look, and her lips curved in response. It made him want to bite her bottom lip. Instead, he waited, his fingers tightening on the satin face mask as she reached up, drew out the clips that held her hair. It tumbled down, a lovely set of waves and curls, all the way to her waist. He threaded his fingers through it, drew part of it over her right shoulder. He brought it to his face, nuzzling it with his lips. Her fingers tightened on his belt, and her head dipped, her crown brushing against his cheek, a gesture of intimate affection. Taking a deep breath, he resisted every urge he had to kick that door down, and gripped the hand at his belt, transferring the mask to her other one. Then he stepped back. \u201cWill you leave it down?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cAt least until we go to class. I need it out of the way for that.\u201d</p><p>He was tall and she wasn\u2019t, so it didn\u2019t take much thinking to decide what to do to make it easier for her to put the mask on him. But he well understood the significance of him doing so.</p><p>He dropped to his knees.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The expression on her face was overwhelming, overpowering. Sometimes, like this, he felt as if he was standing inside her. Her reaction to his willingness to surrender was something that stopped his mind, made him accept\u2014at least in this moment\u2014that there were things they drew out of one another that couldn\u2019t be defined, classified. Things he hadn\u2019t considered ever giving to a woman. For her part, she\u2019d taken the time and care to research a significant aspect of who he was, tied her own desires to things familiar to him, challenges he\u2019d met. It was diabolical, unexpected...and entirely impossible for him to resist.</p><p>She moved behind him. In bare feet, she had the walk of a ballerina, leading with a pointed toe, an arched foot, as if she was treading across the stage to begin a performance, and he expected she was. As she stepped over his bent legs, the toe of the non-leading foot slid across his calf, an intentional caress. She put the mask on his face, leaning forward to ensure the placement of the nose and mouth holes. The fabric stretched, allowing adjustment. Her hair fell onto his shoulder as she bent over him, and he lifted his hand to stroke a thick strand of it, drawing it out straight.</p><p>She was lacing the back of the mask. As it tightened over his forehead, the bridge of his nose, around the corners of his mouth, it reminded him of the hood of a diving suit. He had a picture of himself in one of those, without the diving mask that usually went over it. His sister had told him it looked like the coif a knight wore beneath his mail.</p><p>That shit had no place here. He\u2019d intended to release Janet\u2019s hair, let it ease back into its natural wave. Instead, at the thought, his grip tightened.</p> <p>Janet\u2019s hand overlapped his, held. \u201cPut your hand at your side,\u201d she said unobtrusively. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. This will make you feel things, Max. It always does.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d question how she could tell things had taken an odd turn for him, but he expected it was the same way snipers did it. He\u2019d done some of that in Iraq. He wasn\u2019t the best at it, not his go-to skill, but every SEAL knew how to perform adequately at five hundred yards. He\u2019d watched and improved from the guys who had a natural talent for it, and quickly discovered an exceptional sniper was about more than marksmanship. From hundreds of yards away, they would gauge the intent of a potential enemy from his body language alone, determining if he was carrying a bomb on the back of his bicycle or just pedaling groceries home to the family. Every movement meant something.</p><p>He put his hands at his sides, focused on how she felt, her hands working along the back of his skull, her leg pressing against his side. When she was done, she spread her fingers over his face, let them whisper over his blindfolded eyes, his cheeks, tease his lips. He kissed them, brushing his mouth over her polished nails. She lingered there, let him keep nuzzling her knuckles, take nips of her flesh. She pressed her body closer against his back, telegraphing her elevated response. The mask was like a second skin, the thin barrier and the removal of his sight ironically increasing his sensitivity to her lightest touch on his face.</p><p>\u201cOn your feet. I\u2019ll guide you into the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t let him see the bedroom, so he was entering unfamiliar terrain. It had her scent though, that female mix of the things she wore. Lotions, lip gloss. He also smelled apples. She\u2019d taken his hand as he got to his feet, and stayed at his side, her other hand on the small of his back, their bodies overlapping to get through the door. She remained that close as they entered the room, likely to keep him from running into anything. He was reminded of the one or two ballet productions he\u2019d seen in his life, where partnered dancers crossed the stage in such a way. One technically guiding the steps of the other, one to lead, one to follow, but that could reverse in a heartbeat, if the dance required something different. SEALs could both lead and follow, adapting to change as needed.</p><p>She guided his hand to a carved wooden post. \u201cThis is my bed. The clothes I wear to class are lying on it. You must dress me in each piece, and get it exactly right. When you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll remove the mask. Unlike your instructors, I won\u2019t be timing you, but you will get points for style.\u201d</p><p>The comment came with a faint trace of humor and sexual tension. It made the room seem warmer, closer. Having no ability to see increased his focus on her voice all the more, but in a way it was no different than when he had her in the back of the limo with Matt or one of the other men. Max listened to the rise and fall of her voice, the emotions knitted into every sentence. Humor, exasperation, admonishment. Her intelligence and insight during serious discussions. It was how he\u2019d figured out she had no accent, no tell that placed her in a particular part of the country.</p><p>There was a riveting quality to her voice as well. Until now, he hadn\u2019t been able to clearly define what it was, but here it was unleashed and obvious. A sharp sexual confidence, capable of drawing a man to her like the laces drawing the mask tight against his face. It was also potent enough to keep a man at arms\u2019 length when needed. I can give you your fantasies, but only on my terms, was what that voice said. And only if you beg. Something about that voice made a man want to beg, sure that what she offered would be worth it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask him to beg, but he suspected that was because she sought something different from him. Maybe they were both in uncharted territory.</p><p>\u201cDo I have the pleasure of undressing you first?\u201d he asked, turning in her direction.</p><p>\u201cIt will be difficult to dress me without doing so,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cYou may begin.\u201d</p><p>First he explored the bed, finding the clothes. He identified each piece by recalling her pictures downstairs, as well as any movies or TV shows where there\u2019d been ballet classes. They wore the things that were like one-piece swimsuits, but with sleeves. A leotard. He recognized that by the stretchy fabric, intrigued in a typical male way by the snaps at the crotch. The next thing took more time to identify. He lifted it, sifting it through his fingers. The silky fabric felt like an apron, with long string ties. Then he found the slit in the waistband and realized the ties would thread through, forming a short wraparound skirt. The next item gave him a chuckle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven women have trouble putting these on themselves,\u201d he complained amiably. It was a pair of filmy tights. He found no underwear or bra. \u201cAre questions allowed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a couple, and only if I think they\u2019re relevant. So ask wisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wear panties or bra under these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Modesty panels are built into the leotard, and I\u2019m too small-breasted for the support to be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour breasts look just fine to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says the blindfolded man. Thank you, but I wasn\u2019t criticizing myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Forgot I was dealing with a miracle\u2014a woman happy with her body. Glad we share that opinion.\u201d It was a truth he hadn\u2019t considered before. In the time he\u2019d known her, he\u2019d never seen or heard her demonstrate self-deprecating behavior about weight, age, hair. She put herself together well and had a straightforward confidence about that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let it go this time.\u201d</p> <p>He found a pair of worn canvas slippers that he expected were ballet shoes, given the feel of the soles, and the elastic bands over the top of the foot to hold the shoe on. Running his hands all the way up to a plethora of pillows, he found nothing else, but was thorough about it, moving to the end and then working his way around the bed to the other side. She\u2019d moved out of range, for she was no longer at the end of the bed, but he could sense her presence in the room easily enough. Her scent, the slight catch of her breath, was to his left, so she was by the door.</p><p>He noticed she had a king-sized bed, a lot of mattress for one woman, and it was impossible not to imagine sharing it with her. Did she ever invite that kind of intimacy with a man? Not likely, since her sex life seemed confined to the club. Until now. What would it be like to wake up draped over her, her soft ass against his groin first thing in the morning, that perfect small breast cupped in his hand?</p><p>When he reached the bottom of the quilted spread on this side, he hit something small. Jewelry. He caught the ball-shaped earrings, perhaps pearls, before his big fingers sent them popping off the cover like grasshoppers.</p><p>\u201cWoman, you are evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I would have loved to see you on your elbows and knees, hunting for my earrings.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p> <p>There was a necklace, a chain with a charm on it. The charm was too small for him to discern the shape. He wouldn\u2019t waste a question on that, since he\u2019d find out once the mask was removed. Of course, now that he knew he had to get her into tights, he had a feeling it might never be removed.</p><p>He went someplace in his head he usually preferred not to go. He thought about dressing Amanda for church. Okay, tights had that toe seam, and a tag in the back, like underwear. Unless his diabolical tormentor had removed it. Thank God, they didn\u2019t come with the seam up the back of the leg like the nylons Marcie preferred to wear. She worked for Savannah\u2019s company, Tennyson Industries, but whenever she came to the office to meet Ben for lunch, that provocative look could make any man with a pulse walk into walls.</p><p>\u201cI said no time limit, but our time is not unlimited.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. Circling the bed, using the posts for guides, he moved toward her voice. She was standing approximately three paces from the bed, but she stopped him at two, her hand grazing his chest to bring him to a halt. His brow creased beneath the mask at her silence. Was she just studying him? \u201cI wanted to be sure I knew what and where everything was before I undressed you,\u201d he explained his thoroughness. \u201cDidn\u2019t want you to stand there being cold. The necklace and earrings were a good trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d find them.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that gave him a clue. There was an odd note in her voice that made him reach out. She lifted her arm again, but this time he wasn\u2019t put off, following her wrist down to her elbow, then to her upper arm, closing the distance between them. He fingered her earlobe, locating the gold teardrops he remembered she was wearing, then moved down her throat, to the simple strand of pearls. He wouldn\u2019t remove the earrings until he was ready to insert the others, using them as a guide.</p><p>\u201cThe necklace, it has meaning, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, and he let it be. Instead, he put his hands to her waist, unbuttoned the suit jacket she wore. It was a pretty thing that weighed almost nothing. As he slipped it off her shoulders, feeling the welcome silk of her skin since she wore a sleeveless shell, a wave of that strawberry smell, mixed with some vanilla, reached his nose.</p> <p>\u201cAre you wearing that perfume between your legs? Because I\u2019d love to taste it there.\u201d</p><p>She put her fingers on his lips, an admonishment, but he felt the promising quiver in her fingertips. \u201cNo more talking, sailor. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that.\u201d Her body shifted under his hands, her arms lifting so he could pull the shell from her waistband, take it over her head. Her breasts, the weight of them pressing against the lacy cups of her bra, brushed his shirt front. He imagined the stretch of her body, the tilt of her rib cage. He couldn\u2019t wait to watch her dance. He couldn\u2019t wait to do a lot of things.</p><p>Putting his arm around her waist, holding her there with a palm on her ass, he bent to drop a kiss between the cleft of her breasts. To avoid rebuke, he multitasked, unhooking her bra at the same time. The straps tumbled down her shoulders, sliding over his knuckles where he\u2019d moved his hands to her upper arms. He took the opportunity to press a more insistent kiss on the rise of her right breast. He knew the nipple would be pearling up into a tight point, so close to his mouth. Before she could reprove him, he backed toward the bed, keeping his arm around her waist so she moved with him. He laid the bra on the bed, then felt for the side zipper of her skirt. A whisper of cloth, and the lined garment fell to her feet. Dropping to one knee, he put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. Just step out of it.\u201d</p><p>When she did, he folded the skirt and set it on the bra. He followed her leg up to her thigh, then prayed for restraint as he found she was wearing lacy thigh highs. The bloody woman was standing before him in a scrap of underwear, no bra and thigh-high stockings. Everything in him wanted to pull out his knife, slice off the mask. His cock was already hard and he was sure quite visible against the hold of his khakis. Her fingers slid over his shoulder, along the side of his neck, those lethal nails scraping, conveying her need. He wasn\u2019t the only one affected. His blind state was arousing her as well, her breath becoming more erratic.</p><p>If he stood up now, captured her mouth in his, would she call it game over, let him take her on that king-sized bed, plow into her wet folds, get lost in it with him? But this was part of it, wasn\u2019t it? For as impatient as he was now, what would it be like when he had his task completed, mission accomplished, proving he could do as she desired? He would be nearly insane with lust, her body would be willing and wet. Even so, he already anticipated she would make them wait until after her class. Because that was the game for her. Denial and teasing, until the power of it would overwhelm them both. It could result in a quick violent fuck, but he expected once drawn out to a certain point, such mutual arousal would reach a level where the culmination would slow down, having become too excruciatingly powerful to rush. Like this.</p><p>When she worked men at the club, there was a clean line to the power exchange, everything resting in her hands, her shaping the sub\u2019s reaction like a sculptor. At the end of a session, he could tell she was satisfied by her work of art, yet she was still separate from it, washing the clay from her hands before she returned to the real world. She was testing different waters with him. At the end of their night, there would be no separation. He was going to make damn sure of it.</p><p>He wanted to inspire lingering feelings. When she was at work, he wanted her fingers to still on her keyboard as she thought of his mouth, his touch, the way he thought of hers, the maze behind her dark eyes. Instead of being washed off, the clay would dry on their skin, making them both part of the sculpture.</p><p>He knew she had concerns about that kind of closeness. When it was managed well, fear guided a man or woman, helped him or her make wise choices. She was a woman who managed her fear quite well in that regard, but he still sensed it there. He wanted to bring her to the point she understood he didn\u2019t have to be a sculpture at all, but a living, breathing part of her own soul.</p><p>Wow. That was unexpected. He stopped, taking a breath. She was right. Wearing the blindfold took the mind into some unlikely places.</p><p>Hooking the top of one stocking, he slid it down her gorgeous leg, taking advantage to liberally caress the length of it. He pressed a kiss on the inside of her thigh, right where the lace had held the stocking fast. She gripped his shoulder as she shifted her feet, let him pull the nylon free. \u201cYour coat.\u201d Her voice was strained. \u201cI want it off.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, shrugged free of it. She took it from him, turning away but staying within touching distance. He realized she was draping it over something behind her, probably a chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you keep the gun. In case you feel the need to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips together at that, merely removing the other stocking the way he had the first. Only this time, with her back to him, he had the pleasure of letting his thumbs slide down the tender crevice of her knee. She held on to the chair to balance as he pulled it free.</p><p>He held both delicate pieces in one hand as he rose. Her buttocks brushed the front of his slacks. With his greater height, he let the stockings slide along her shoulder, the side of her throat, then down her back. As she stayed still, her body vibrating with sensation he could feel, he trailed the fabric down her arm, to her wrist. When he began to wind it around that slim target, she tensed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t move away. Her hand balled into a fist beneath his hold, the wrist flexing. Though he couldn\u2019t see her face, he felt that tension that had emanated so strongly from her twice. In the hospital and then again at the club.</p><p>Someone had hurt this woman. Hurt her badly, violently. And though it was ironic that it called up related feelings inside him, a fierce desire to visit on her attacker threefold whatever had been done to her, he had the self-awareness, and the understanding of her state of mind, to yoke it back so it couldn\u2019t interfere with this moment. Any more than it was already doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said again, her fingers flexing against the light hold of the nylon. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of this.\u201d</p><p>The same thing she\u2019d said about the picture in the hallway. Her boundaries were bold black marks in the sand. Despite himself, a twinge of resentment caught him. It was all right to blindfold and impede his senses, but not to restrain her? But then he remembered Thor. As tough a Mistress as she appeared to be, she didn\u2019t bind him. He\u2019d never seen her bind anyone, except in a symbolic way. A light wrap or easy-to-break cuffs. The illusion of restraint. Of course, she was so good at this, that was really all she needed, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>When he did another wrap around her wrist, her tension increased proportionately. \u201cMax,\u201d she said more sharply.</p> <p>He pressed closer, slid his arm around her waist, fingers drifting to the waistband of her panties. He took his palm in a slow, easy glide over her mound, resting his fingers on her upper thigh. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m braver than you are, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>The honorific came easily to his lips. She stilled as he spoke it, her focus now on something else. He shifted, slid his hand down her other arm in a reassurance before drawing it behind her. She quivered harder as he put the two wrists together with a simple twist tie. It wasn\u2019t tight at all. She could get out of it in a blink, far quicker and more easily than he could free himself of the mask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just for a moment. I want to imagine you tied like this, even if I can\u2019t see you. Your shoulders drawn back, your breasts thrust out. The flush on your cheeks, your hair falling over your body, dressed only in your panties. And I want to do this.\u201d</p><p>Kneeling behind her, he put his hands on her hips. He bent over those tied hands and put his lips on them, kissing her palms and curling fingers. He cruised over her ass, tongue teasing the seam between her cheeks through the silk as she shuddered. He went lower, explored that sweet crevice where the buttocks and thighs met, revealed by the high rise of the undergarment. When he nuzzled the sensitive intersection point, his tongue pressing briefly against the perineum, she let out a soft noise. Then he drew back, his thumb caressing the crotch of her panties before he hooked his fingers in the sides and took the last garment to her ankles.</p><p>He kissed the backs of her knees, her upper thighs, moving around her so he was on his knees before her. He kept his hands on her hips and lifted his face, nostrils flaring and all senses tuned for her reaction. Her focus was fully on him, he could feel the heat of it, and she was tight as a drum beneath his hands, as if she\u2019d turned all that quivering energy inward.</p> <p>When he straightened, standing on his knees instead of resting on his heels, he caught her loose hair in his hands, twisted it. \u201cKiss me, Mistress,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI need your mouth.\u201d</p><p>The heat and wetness of it was enough to make him groan with pleasure, especially when she let out a matching, more feminine sound. Reaching behind her, he untwisted the nylons from her hands and then banded his arms around her hips as she cupped his face, holding on to him tightly as the kiss deepened. He broke it to move down to her breasts, finding her through the curtain of hair to cup those pretty curves and tease them with the heat of his mouth. She brought him to a halt by pressing against his shoulders and stepping back, her breath ragged.</p><p>\u201cMy clothes, Max. Dress me.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was determined, even if it wasn\u2019t entirely steady. She\u2019d reclaimed the reins. He got back on his feet, with reluctance and some physical difficulty. She noticed the latter, her clever, firm fingers cupping him through his slacks. At her purring sound of approval, he growled. A warning that he could only be pushed so far, especially since, on his knees, he\u2019d clearly scented how hot and willing her body was at this point.</p><p>When he turned back to the bed, he almost made the mistake of going for the leotard first. Realizing his error just as he had his hand on the garment, he switched to the tights instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the chair, Max.\u201d</p> <p>He knew she\u2019d shifted away from him, had heard the give of the cushion, the faint creak of the wood, and followed the sound, touching her knee, the arm of the chair. He knelt at her feet, working one leg of the tights up into a folded circle in his hand. As he did it, he was hit by an unexpected vision, and the flood of emotions that accompanied it.</p><p>Child-sized black patent shoes, the strap buckle a tiny pewter flower. You put the tights on first, silly. Amanda teasing him, an imperious four-year-old then. She\u2019d asked if she could wear her pink dress to church.</p><p>He closed his eyes beneath the blindfold and clutched the tights hard enough he was glad they weren\u2019t as thin as the nylons. Else he\u2019d rip right through them. \u201cCan you speak to me while I do this part?\u201d</p><p>He needed to hear a woman\u2019s voice to remind him where he was, what he was doing. Janet\u2019s voice especially. He knew how to manage this kind of memory invasion, but this one was a little stronger than he usually handled in mixed company. He didn\u2019t want his shit to fuck things up.</p><p>Given how attentive she\u2019d been when she was putting the blindfold on him, he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that she understood and acquiesced without any coy games or challenging questions. He guessed he\u2019d overestimated how much he could scramble her brain with his physical prowess. Of course the woman\u2019s self-discipline was legendary. He\u2019d have to work on that. Though at the moment, he was grateful for her ability to recover her composure quickly.</p><p>Her fingers slid through his hair. \u201cMatt\u2019s noticed us. He talked to me about you.\u201d</p><p>Max grunted, figuring out the toe seam and working it over her foot. She had trim toenails, expected for a woman he\u2019d yet to see without stockings on her legs. \u201cYeah. He gave me a \u2018look\u2019 when he left the car tonight. If that\u2019s a hint of what Angelica\u2019s dates are in for, she\u2019ll be lucky if anyone will be brave enough to ask her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet a SEAL would be brave enough.\u201d She tugged his hair.</p> <p>\u201cSEALs aren\u2019t scared of anything,\u201d he agreed, and smiled when she chuckled at him. He noticed her second toe had a swollen joint to it, and there was an unevenness along the outside edge of her big toe, like a scar. When his fingers passed firmly over her arch, he sensed an indrawn breath, a sound of pleasure, and he took an extra moment to massage there, some of his tension easing when she purred, no other word for it.</p><p>\u201cOh...God, you\u2019re good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this why you don\u2019t wear spiky heels like Alice? Because you have bad feet?\u201d</p><p>He detected a hesitation, as if he\u2019d touched on the edges of something more important. \u201cIt\u2019s very impolite to say that to a woman,\u201d she said at last. \u201cBut yes. Years of ballet dancing gives many of us foot problems. Which makes what you\u2019re doing feel...so...damn...good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at that as well. Knowing just when to call me that so it works for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a quick study.\u201d Reluctantly, he stopped with the foot massage but figured he\u2019d give her a more thorough one, of both feet, after her class. He worked the tights up to her knee, then got the other foot started and up to the same level. Curling an arm around her waist once again, he brought her to her feet. She was completely naked except for that one garment at her knees, and it was a unique experience, to be blindfolded, somewhat at her mercy, even though he was the one fully dressed. She was an artist at what she did, explaining why she had a strong following at the club. But none of those males had ever been here now, in her home. He\u2019d bet on that too.</p><p>He worked the tights up her thighs, thought again how few women would be confident enough to let a man be this intimate with their bodies. He had to put his hand inside the tights, find the cotton crotch panel to be sure it was aligned correctly, which gave him the opportunity to brush his knuckles along her labia, feel the moisture there.</p><p>Her hand settled on his shirt sleeve, gripping, her forehead briefly pressed to his shoulder as he rose to finish the task, sliding the tights all the way up over her hips. Then he necessarily\u2014and pleasurably\u2014had to run his hands down her body, under and over, to make sure everything was straight and in place, which put him on his heels as he touched her feet, double-checked the toe seams. Perfectly straight, following the bump of her toenails. His instructors would be proud, though he could only imagine their expressions if they knew how he was applying his \u201cditch-and-don\u201d skill.</p><p>Next came the leotard, which was easier, and had the added bonus of requiring him to feel his way around her breasts to be sure the modesty panel was aligned properly. He rubbed his thumb over her nipple, kneaded the breasts until she gave him another breathless admonishment. As well as a gratifyingly reluctant reminder they needed to leave soon to be on time for the class.</p><p>That just left the skirt, slippers and jewelry. The first two were quickly done. He worked the earrings in behind the ones he removed, then it was time to do the necklace. She turned for him, putting her buttocks against his hard groin. If she rotated her hips on him, he\u2019d have purred a little himself, but the way she kind of melted back into him, from shoulder blades to the firm ass, was intimate in a different, more moving way, especially when she turned her face so her cheek pressed against his biceps.</p><p>She lifted her chin as he guided the necklace around her neck. After he fastened it, he put his arms around her waist to hold her still. Kissing her throat, he nuzzled her beautiful hair again. \u201cDid I pass, Instructor J?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. She\u2019d tucked her head at an angle that suggested her eyes were closed, one of them pressed into the crease between his shoulder and chest. She\u2019d gone somewhere else, taken there by this moment. He tightened his hold around her. \u201cJanet. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He stayed silent then, just holding her, letting her deal with whatever had gripped her, making sure she could use the strength of his body and arms to get her through it. She\u2019d become tense all of a sudden, as if fighting something, and he turned her around to press a kiss on her brow, her eye, her nose, finally brushing her lips. Her hands clutched his arms, and she drew a deep breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice normal and even. \u201cYou passed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cA good beginning for learning lifts is what we rather inelegantly call the fish dive, though if you\u2019ve ever watched a school of fish dive, there\u2019s nothing inelegant about it. They swoop fearlessly toward the ocean floor, with unconscious grace.\u201d</p> <p>Max sat at the back of the class. The community center\u2019s room for the dance lessons had a wall of mirrors that sported a long bar for warm-ups. The wooden floor was worn shiny and smooth by the many feet that had pounded, tapped, scuffed or tripped across it. Janet had said it was used for everything from Pilates to yoga to Zumba.</p><p>As she\u2019d predicted, he\u2019d been treated to a lot of shy looks and giggles. He expected she was fully aware that such behavior was pretty intimidating to a man, especially when he was the lone male among a pack of teenage girls. Eventually she took pity on him, however, calling the class to order with a commanding tap of a cane. The girls responded with the same mixture of terror and respect that Janet generally inspired at K&amp;A.</p><p>They\u2019d done warm-ups, and Janet had groups of three show her how they were doing on combinations they\u2019d learned in previous classes, correcting where necessary with a tap of the cane or demonstration. She was sparse with praise, but as such, a simple nod or lack of correction was enough to make a girl glow. When she showed them a step or movement, the skill she possessed was evident. He thought of the picture of the soaring ballet dancer over her couch. Had she once been able to do that? If so, not any more. As the dance class progressed, the cane she used to tap time or point for correction became a prop for subtle leaning as well. He\u2019d definitely be sure to give her that foot massage tonight.</p><p>Thinking about it, he realized even her sheerest stockings had a glimmer to them, the kind of thing that would hide scars. When he\u2019d put on her tights, he hadn\u2019t done a thorough exploration of her skin, much as he\u2019d desired to do so. The problem could be joint pain or those foot problems she\u2019d mentioned, but he felt a desire to find out. He was starting to have a desire to find out everything about her.</p><p>Bringing his attention back to the class, he found Janet had moved on to the routine they were putting together for a Christmas recital. By the time the dancers were in the last thirty minutes of the two-hour class, they were sweating, but not a one of them slacked off. He didn\u2019t think they would dare. At one point, a student had forgotten to turn off her cell phone. When it chirped from the tote bag hung on the back wall, the offending student had practically flown over there to silence it beneath Janet\u2019s withering look. \u201cSo sorry, Madame, so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He found that curious, how they all called her that. He didn\u2019t know enough about ballet to know if it was a typical address for a teacher or not, but it suited her quite well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard tonight.\u201d Janet stood at the front of the class now, continuing her discussion of the lift. \u201cOnce we combine with the male class to bring together our recital routine, several of you will be chosen to perform the \u2018fish dive\u2019. As such, we\u2019re going to spend the last thirty minutes introducing you to it.\u201d</p><p>There were excited murmurs, the girls catching hands to squeeze and express their pleasure with the idea. Janet gave them precisely ten seconds to settle down, then quelled any further reaction with her look. \u201cYou\u2019ve all noticed I\u2019ve brought a friend tonight. He\u2019s here to help teach the lift, given that he is far better equipped to lift you than I am.\u201d</p><p>When she glanced back at Max, her lips quivered as the girls giggled. Max did his best not to humiliate himself with a damn blush. The woman was a sadist.</p><p>\u201cThe first hurdle you must overcome with lifts is your fear of falling. You must have utter confidence in your partner. If you cannot have that, you must overcome that regardless and be like the fish, diving fearlessly, concentrating on the execution of the move itself, stepping outside of yourself. However, tonight I want the confidence portion to be an irrelevant issue, so you can focus on the form.\u201d Her gaze swept over them. \u201cAs you know, your well-being is always my primary concern.\u201d</p><p>Despite her strict demeanor, tiny smiles appeared on several girls\u2019 faces, some reflecting adoration. It told Max they trusted their teacher, believed in her regard for them. She had that effect on people.</p> <p>\u201cMax will keep you safe. He has my complete confidence.\u201d Her gaze touched him briefly, then moved back to her class. \u201cTo assure you of that, he\u2019s going to demonstrate the lift with me first. Since I am a heavy old broad, this will prove to you how easy lifting each of you will be for him.\u201d</p><p>The girls laughed, making faces, and Janet allowed them a small, tight smile. Max shook his head at her but rose, coming to the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cHe should be wearing proper attire, but being that he is male and therefore entirely stubborn, we shall have to deal with him in this.\u201d Janet cast a disparaging look at the jeans and T-shirt he\u2019d donned from the bag of spare clothes he kept in his trunk.</p><p>\u201cThe only attire you had available were tights,\u201d he muttered. The girls tittered and Janet\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d She set aside her stick and came to stand before him. \u201cTo start, you will be in arabesque en pointe. No toe shoes tonight though. The ball of the foot will be sufficient. There\u2019s enough to think about without making it that complex.\u201d She assumed the proper position and nodded without looking at Max. He bent his knee to give added support to the move, just as she\u2019d instructed him during their warm-up before the class arrived.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s putting his arm around my waist, just below my rib cage. His right arm goes over and around the right thigh, just above the knee. Now he will dip me toward the ground, arms in this position.\u201d</p><p>As she demonstrated, reaching out with graceful arms and fingertips, Max lifted her and dipped her to the floor. The girls oohed softly, and he could see the more ambitious ones already imagining themselves in the same position.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bend the straight leg and touch your toes to your right knee,\u201d Janet continued from her suspended pose. \u201cThis is the parallel pass\u00e9. Be sure and use your core muscles to pull you upright.\u201d She passed her fingers over her upper and lower abdomen, drawing their eyes to that. It seemed like second nature to her to be held nearly upside down, feet nowhere near the ground. \u201cAs always, I expect to see clean lines. The arch of your back curves you in toward your partner. The moment you are dancing with another, there should be a romance to the bodies working together. It\u2019s what your audience wants to see, and it will draw them into the movement, win their hearts.\u201d</p> <p>When she stopped instructing to show the move, arching back into Max, she looked up at him. Though he knew their sexual intimacy helped, he felt what she was describing, her body fitted into the angles of his, conveying her trust in his hold. As he glanced at the mirror, their position reminded him of the melded sculpture idea that had crossed his mind earlier. It gave him a far greater appreciation for ballet choreography, as well as the strength it required. He felt a brief quiver beneath his hold now, telling him she couldn\u2019t hold this pose indefinitely. But her ease and skill in demonstrating it suggested that, at one time, she could have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll exit the lift by straightening the left leg when he begins to dip you down again. Finish in arabesque en pointe as you started. And there we are. Yes, Tasha, we may begin with you.\u201d</p><p>For the next thirty minutes, he took each girl through the lift, with Janet circling them, using taps of the stick to encourage a lifting of the body here, a straightening of the leg there. From having a teenage sister, he knew how, when it mattered, they could go from an apparent complete lack of focus, giggling and chattering, to this. Though most fluttered and blushed a little if they met his gaze, once they started working on the lift, all of them focused on Janet\u2019s instruction.</p><p>Thinking of the repetitive activities his instructors had inflicted on him in BUD/S to teach focus and attention to detail, he realized Janet\u2019s pre-class clothing exercise might have been to determine if he had the attention span to do this. He had to follow the same form, over and over, and adjust as needed. He felt almost as proud as her students when Janet only had to correct his form twice.</p><p>By the end of class, he also had a much keener respect for the strength and balance of a male ballet dancer. He\u2019d had the stamina to get through, but he knew it would take someone with his level of fitness to lift and hold twelve different girls in the prescribed position multiple times over thirty minutes. A few of those guys might have what it took to get through BUD/S. Despite the tights.</p><p>Over the last fifteen minutes of class, parents started arriving. The way they tiptoed in, lining up against the back wall to watch, immediately checking their cell phones to ensure they were off, it was obvious Janet didn\u2019t limit her severe chastising on proper behavior to her students alone.</p><p>The last student had hung back until the end. During the class, he\u2019d noted she worked as hard, perhaps harder, than everyone else, though she didn\u2019t have the same aptitude for it. She was a year or so younger, maybe twelve, and though she wasn\u2019t precisely overweight, she was suffering from the baby fat that could be normal for girls in their early teens. She was hesitant when they got started, but by the time they\u2019d been through the lift several times, she had it, and she positively glowed when he high-fived her. Amanda smiled like that, when she was unexpectedly pleased by something.</p><p>\u201cMadame, I felt like a feather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like one. Good form. You\u2019ve been working on your lines, and it shows.\u201d Janet put a brief hand on her red hair. \u201cAll right, class, that\u2019s it for tonight. Practice your recital moves and the new moves I\u2019ve taught you, with the exception of this one. Until we\u2019ve performed it a few times here, I do not want you enlisting a male friend to help you work on this elsewhere. Mr. Ackerman received thorough instruction from me. Anyone doing a lift must have similar instruction or they could injure you. They could also injure themselves if they haven\u2019t warmed up properly. I know many of you have a great deal of initiative\u2014it\u2019s why you are in this advanced class\u2014but I want to hear each of you promise me not to practice this move outside of class.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She waited until each girl said, \u201cYes, Madame,\u201d to her directly, then she nodded. \u201cVery well. Get your things, and I will see you in two weeks. As usual, I will be here for the next thirty minutes if there\u2019s anything you need to discuss with me or any other movements you wish me to repeat. To the rest of you, good night.\u201d</p><p>As several of the girls lingered, obviously wanting to ask her further questions, he touched her arm. \u201cJanet, I\u2019ll just hang out in the corner. No rush at all.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but one of the girls fixed him with a reproving look. \u201cEveryone calls her Madame while in class. We all agreed.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cMy apologies. I obviously need more thorough instruction. I\u2019ll just be over here in the corner if you need me, Madame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Ackerman.\u201d The look she flashed him said she\u2019d be more than happy to give him that instruction, and that she might make him pay dearly for teasing her. He hid his grin as he returned to his chair.</p><p>As he took a seat, the one girl who hadn\u2019t blushed and fluttered when he did the lift with her sat down in the chair next to him. Since the chairs were all pushed together, her hip was brushing his. She met his gaze with a bold stare and inviting smile. Tasha was obviously one of Janet\u2019s top students, the first to step forward for the lift and when Janet required proof of their practice earlier in the class. She also had the feline smile and brazen confidence of a barfly. Unfortunately, she had the dangerous looks to go with it. She had jewel-blue eyes and long black hair, which she\u2019d now unbraided and was stroking her fingers through, letting it pour in a silken curtain over her shoulders. Since she was all of fourteen years old, any intelligent man would steer clear, recognizing pure trouble when he saw it.</p><p>Tasha\u2019s parent apparently had not yet arrived for her. Since his chair was at the end, and there was fortunately another foot of wall space, he scooted his chair out, removing the physical contact between them. Her gaze faltered somewhat, and he glimpsed the uncertain child beneath the wannabe siren. Then the feline smile returned. \u201cI enjoyed our lift together,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re very strong.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t weigh that much.\u201d</p> <p>Those lips curved farther. She wore too much lipstick. He wondered if he was getting too old, since he found himself wanting to get a napkin and wipe it off, tell her to stop trying to be something she wasn\u2019t. The fact she was a kid, on that awkward cusp of learning to be a young woman, gave him patience. Though her next words eroded that considerably.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that about Debbie. I\u2019m not sure why Madame lets her stay in this class. It\u2019s for serious dancers, and she\u2019s obviously not serious if she\u2019s carrying around that flab.\u201d</p><p>The little bitch was fourteen, he reminded himself, and fixed her with a considering look. \u201cYou know, Tasha, when I was training in the military, seventy percent of my class didn\u2019t make it to graduation. Most of them quit during the first four weeks. And a bunch of those were guys who looked the part, who were absolutely sure in the beginning they had everything it took to make it. Then, when they were faced with the reality of it, they found they didn\u2019t have the commitment for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>Her brow creased. \u201cSo? A lot of guys are all talk, no action.\u201d Her gaze swept him. \u201cAre you one of those? Because you look like you could do a lot.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. He didn\u2019t want to know how she\u2019d learned to be this brash, but he decided if Matt needed a full security detail on Angelica when she hit puberty, he\u2019d take the job. SEALs were trained to do the impossible, after all.</p><p>\u201cThe ones who made it were the kind of guys who knew what it was to be knocked down. They knew winning is about a refusal to fail. Until you\u2019ve been pushed down over and over, and you still get up and dance and give it one hundred percent, don\u2019t talk to me about being serious. I\u2019ll bet Debbie is here every week, even knowing a lot of you don\u2019t think she should be. She practices the steps and works hard for Madame. Which means she\u2019s stronger under fire than someone whose natural talent has kept them untested. So if I was putting money on it, I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s here for graduation, whereas the first time someone sets you back on your heels, you\u2019ll run to Daddy or Mommy to have them fix it for you.\u201d</p> <p>Wow, he hadn\u2019t expected to go there. Tasha paled. It was actually an improvement over the little-girl-pretending-to-be-a-seasoned-slut routine, but Max cursed himself as she got up and fled. Well, if she didn\u2019t come back next week, he\u2019d proved his point.</p><p>\u201cAh fuck, Ackerman. Don\u2019t be such an asshole.\u201d He would have left it alone if it was fully deserved, but he knew his own shit had driven his mouth, so after a few minutes, he got up and followed her. Several other girls were in the process of heading out, but once they cleared, it left the waiting room deserted, except for Tasha. She stood at the window, staring out at the parking lot, holding her tote bag on her shoulder. It had one of those boy bands printed on it, and a Hello Kitty key chain hung from the strap. He was an idiot.</p><p>When he tugged on the strap, she pressed her lips together, crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a sister,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd she was like Debbie. She tried really hard to do everything well. Some things she did great, and others she didn\u2019t. You\u2019re the best dancer in the class, Tasha. Debbie may not be a prima ballerina, but I expect she\u2019ll succeed at something else in life, because she doesn\u2019t quit just because it gets hard. That\u2019s the kind of person a smart girl would want as a friend. You seem pretty smart to me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted. \u201cYou just treated me like I was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can be smart and still act stupid occasionally. We all do it. It\u2019s part of growing up.\u201d</p><p>She slanted him a glance. \u201cYou\u2019re already grown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never stop growing up, Tasha. If we\u2019re smart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmart enough to know we\u2019re dumb.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYeah. See?\u201d</p><p>She shifted to a hip, tossed back her hair. \u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on it.\u201d Quickly realizing his error when her gaze lit up with calculation, he nodded toward the classroom. \u201cMadame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her lips did a pretty pout of disappointment, but then she shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s a really good teacher. Strict, but fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can be scary, but don\u2019t let that put you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>A pair of headlights turned into the parking lot, and she adjusted the bag more securely. \u201cThat\u2019s my mom. Will you be back next lesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It will depend if Janet...Madame, needs me to help out with more lifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you\u2019ll be back. You\u2019re really hot, even if you\u2019re old.\u201d She gave him a cheeky grin and then darted out the door, hair rippling in the draft.</p><p>Some days more than others, he thought. Watching her cross the parking lot, things hurt in his chest. He wanted to grab hold of her, tell her not to treat herself so cheaply, not to let the fact that Daddy wasn\u2019t paying her enough attention drive her into looking for a surrogate. He\u2019d also tell her not to mistake sex and acting like an adult for the love and acceptance she truly needed.</p><p>Hell. He really wasn\u2019t sure how Matt was going to do it. He\u2019d be a wreck.</p><p>Turning, he discovered he wasn\u2019t alone. The rest of the class had left, because Janet had turned off the lights behind her, only the emergency lights casting a dim light over the wood floor of the main room. She leaned in the doorway, twirling her stick idly, her other arm crossed over her breasts, fingers clasping her biceps.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was in the running to be your girlfriend,\u201d she noted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t informed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI panicked,\u201d he admitted baldly, and won a chuckle. \u201cI was afraid she was going to leap on me like cake, then and there.\u201d</p><p>Her expression became more serious. \u201cYou had a sister? You were talking about her in the past tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I still have her. She\u2019s just...she\u2019s different now.\u201d He debated, not sure whether to open that door, then decided it didn\u2019t hurt to open it a crack. It was already hurting, after all. \u201cSomething happened to her a few years ago, and she has brain damage. She\u2019s in a private facility outside New Orleans. I visit her twice a week.\u201d</p><p>Janet\u2019s expression reflected simple compassion. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Is she why you left the SEALs?\u201d</p><p>That empty place in his gut, a reminder of what was no longer a part of his life, gripped him. \u201cYeah. She needed me. I\u2019m her only family. The only family who can take care of her, be here for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet her sometime. If that would be okay.\u201d</p><p>It surprised him, such that he didn\u2019t say anything right away. She cocked her head. \u201cThat is, if you weren\u2019t just using me as your beard to put Tasha off. I assume you are working on making me your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that depends a lot on whether you\u2019re considering making me...\u201d He hitched over \u201cyour boyfriend\u201d because it sounded a little juvenile, but beyond that, it didn\u2019t quite fit. She filled in the missing word though.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d She pushed away from the doorframe, turned away. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see about that. Lock the door, would you? And turn off the foyer light. We\u2019ll take the back exit out.\u201d</p><p>When she disappeared so abruptly back into the classroom, his brow creased. He wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d done something wrong, but as he complied with her direction and then followed her, he saw she was simply tired. She was leaning on the stick while pushing a stack of yoga mats closer to the wall. As she moved away from them, he noted she was walking stiffly.</p><p>\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll see about that\u2019,\u201d he repeated her words. \u201cShould I treat it as an audition then?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It brought her to a halt. When she turned toward him, her weariness translated to her expression, her tone of voice. It was more than being tired. Something he\u2019d said or done had hit a nerve.</p><p>\u201cNo, Max. My audition days are long over. You be what you are and I\u2019ll be what I am. It\u2019s not likely to work in the long run, but I don\u2019t count on things for the long run. We\u2019ve already proven we can be very satisfying to one another in the short term, until the differences become obstacles instead of attractions.\u201d She fixed him with a direct look, her back straightening. \u201cWhen that happens, you won\u2019t have to think about a different job or worry about any awkwardness. We\u2019ll end it as adults, and friends, with no harm on either side. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreeing to something beforehand and its reality are often very different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue. If we have our doubts, on either side, we should probably stop right now and let this be it.\u201d</p><p>Though she was only fifteen feet away, it was suddenly as if she was behind her desk at work, as remote in that position as she\u2019d been up until six months ago. He could tell she meant it. If he said stop now, that would be it, and tomorrow he had no doubt she\u2019d act as she\u2019d always acted with him, before that day she\u2019d sought him out on the parking deck and sat on the hood of his truck.</p><p>She flipped the switch with such calm, it told him two things. One, he\u2019d barely scratched the surface of who she actually was, what she felt about things, and two, a woman with armor that thick had a lot going on below the surface. She\u2019d said a dancer had to have utter confidence in her partner to do lifts properly. He wondered if she applied the same yardstick to opening up in her relationships.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of having a partner in ballet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTo allow the ballerina to have a greater reach on certain moves,\u201d she said automatically. \u201cThe ability to float across the stage, rather than merely move across it. To exceed what she can do alone.\u201d She arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019re a very clever man, Max. But it doesn\u2019t answer the question I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask a question. You made a statement. But if it is a question, maybe you\u2019re the one who needs to answer it.\u201d He crossed the floor, closed that distance so he was standing in front of her. \u201cIf we do this, I want it to be awkward. I want you to get so deep into me that, if it ends, I\u2019ll feel like something has been ripped from my chest. I want to be forced to leave K&amp;A because I couldn\u2019t handle being this close to your scent, your heat, and not touch you, think about kissing you or making love to you.\u201d He cupped her face, running his thumb along her jaw. \u201cIf you figure out how to put a collar and leash on me, Mistress, I\u2019d rather you choke me with it than take it off.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse was rabbiting under his touch, her eyes burning, her mouth soft in a way that made her seem vulnerable and yet untouchable at once. He didn\u2019t give a fuck about her shields right now. Instead, he took the stick from her hand, dropping it to the floor. Thinking about it a bated moment, he dropped his grip to her hips, compelling her to turn so her back was to him. She tilted her head, keeping her gaze on his, trying to gauge his intent. There was a quivering stillness to her. Putting his mouth close to her temple, he directed her attention to the posters over the mirror. \u201cLet\u2019s do that one.\u201d</p><p>It was a Latin dance setting, but he\u2019d already figured out there was a lot of crossover in types of dance, and he saw echoes of ballet form in the lift pictured. The man was raising his partner all the way over his head, and she was arched toward the sky, one leg extended, one bent, arms in a graceful position like tree branches over her head. His part of things seemed pretty simple, but he put his hands exactly where they were in the picture. Janet was ready for him. Despite her tiredness, she bounced into the lift like a bird taking flight.</p><p>He had to adjust his stance, figure out the weight distribution. There was a harrowing moment where he nearly had to bring her back to the ground and re-try, but in the end he got it. He found the right groove and locked in, holding her up there for a good ten seconds. In the mirror, he could see her head was back, eyes closed, a look of near peace on her face, as if she was a bird in flight in truth.</p><p>When he at last lowered her to his shoulder, her body was curved back against his, her shoulder blades high against his chest, her buttocks pressed to his abdomen. As he took her down farther, her arm hooked around his neck and shoulder, the other hand catching in his shirt and the waistband of his jeans. He held her there with one arm, her feet just above the floor, him bearing all her weight. She wasn\u2019t a \u201cheavy old broad\u201d at all\u2014far from it.</p><p>He tugged the leotard off the lowered shoulder, baring the round, pale curve beneath. He cupped it, thumbing the nipple slowly, watching her reaction in the mirror. She had her gaze fixed on his hand, and when he shifted his support so he could cup her pussy fully beneath the skirt, she let out an erratic breath, dropping her head back on his shoulder. He swung her body up into the cradle of his arms.</p> <p>She turned her face toward his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He intended to snag a yoga mat from the stack in the corner, bring it back to the center of the floor, but she stopped him before he could head that way.</p><p>\u201cI want to feel the floor beneath me.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he lowered her to it. She stretched out on her back, lifting her arms above her head, sliding her fingers along the cracks of the wood. \u201cWhere I first learned to dance, I knew every groove in the floor, every worn and polished place, every sanded-down knot. I can still smell the pine. After a dance class, if you laid your cheek on the floor, you could see the scuff marks our shoes had left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I was Debbie. I had the passion, the love for it, but I was only good enough to be one of the company, not the star. That was all right though. Since I was good enough to do that, I got to dance on a stage, in front of an audience.\u201d</p><p>Since he knelt above her, he saw her come out of the past, sharpening on the present. \u201cI want my stick.\u201d</p><p>He retrieved it, laid it next to her. Then he eased the leotard down to her waist, exposing both breasts to his gaze. Untying the wraparound skirt, he removed it and the leotard fully. The shoes and tights followed. He took his time and she watched him closely throughout. Though her lips tightened, she didn\u2019t stop him.</p> <p>He sat back on his heels. Now, without him wearing a blindfold, without her covering her legs with hosiery, he saw them. Two circular scars on each limb. At some point in her life, they\u2019d both been broken, compound fractures. The age of the scars seemed similar, suggesting they\u2019d happened at the same time.</p><p>He understood her enough not to ask, not tonight. Like his sister\u2019s story, that was territory they\u2019d have to learn at a careful pace. But he bent, pressed his lips to one of the scars and earned a tremble. She feathered her fingers through his hair. When he lifted his head, he had the pleasure of sweeping his gaze up a lovely female form clad only in her jewelry. The pendant was a charm, a tiny ballet dancer.</p><p>He shed his T-shirt. He\u2019d never thought too much about his body from an aesthetic viewpoint. It was a tool, a weapon to keep honed, but he found he responded strongly to how much she appreciated it. Her avid gaze said she wanted to touch, so he came down to her, closing his eyes as those demanding fingers caressed and scraped his upper torso. They lowered to the jeans, tugged on the belt. As he was unbuckling it, she dipped into his back pocket to retrieve his wallet.</p><p>Bemused, he sat back on his heels, watched her open it. She flipped past his commercial license, his concealed carry permit, his single credit card. Then she dug into the interior pocket and retrieved a condom, giving him a sultry look she did much better than Tasha\u2014the benefit of true experience. \u201cAlways prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. There are a couple more in my coat.\u201d He nodded toward where he\u2019d left it hung on a hook on the wall.</p><p>\u201cHmm. And ambitious. When was the last time you had sex, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so long ago that I don\u2019t need that.\u201d He regretted having to say it, but though it had been infrequent, there\u2019d been the occasional hookup with other lonely people. Always protected, but he wouldn\u2019t risk Janet for the possibility of error.</p><p>She handed the wallet back to him with a reserved expression that made him wonder if he needed to make up for lost ground, but then she dispelled that concern. \u201cGet tested, and you won\u2019t need to use it while you\u2019re with me. My tubes were tied long ago, and sex...\u201d She paused. This time, he wondered if her imperious look covered something more vulnerable. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the first in quite a while,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m honored. Mistress.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the jeans to his thighs. She didn\u2019t object to him not taking everything off, her eyes dark and lips parted, eager. Though urgency beat between them like a bass rhythm, things had slowed down as well. He lowered himself down onto her, and her legs slid around his hips, heels caressing the backs of his knees beneath the jeans. She put her hands on his chest like bird wings, spreading her fingers wide and making him feel like she was learning him, tugging his chest hair, tracing the shallow indentations between ribs as she worked her way downward.</p><p>He took care of the necessary evil of the condom, but he was going to do as she\u2019d said. He wanted to feel her without that barrier. When he guided himself to her wet cunt, he led with two knuckles, rubbing against the labia, feeling the slick give before he moved his hand out of the way and pushed inward, lifting his gaze to focus on her face.</p><p>She was staring at him. In that hushed silence, his gradual progression into her body, he felt something indescribable. With every inch he sank into her, it was as if he\u2019d found something he\u2019d lost. She\u2019d unclipped her hair and it waved around her face, softening it. It gave him a momentary pause, her parted lips, the yearning expression. Then he was all the way in and her eyes closed, her body lifting up toward him in reaction.</p><p>He caught the back of her head, bracing his weight with his other hand as she moaned softly against his lips. The feminine noise set him on fire, the hushed moment giving way to something more edgy and dark, needy. He parted her mouth with his own and plundered, taking over with tongue and teeth. He lifted his hips, partially withdrawing, but only to increase the friction, push into her harder. This time when his eyes opened, hers did as well, and he saw the challenge in her gaze. He dove back into that kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached for the stick, sliding it across his upper thighs to grasp the other end, notching the length of it into the crease between his buttocks and thighs. When she tightened her grip on it, he surged back into her, plunging deeper, harder, feeling the insistent pressure of the bar as it pushed against his ass, urging him on.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she muttered against his ear, taking a sharp bite. He caught his fingers in her hair, tightening enough to pull on the scalp, and her nails dug into his flanks. He plunged forward again as she met him, impact for impact. Pressing his mouth against her temple, he pinned her down with his body, working himself in her like a man determined to stake his claim. He had no idea when the need to possess her had taken root in him, but now it was here in full, raging glory.</p><p>He kept kissing her even as he thrust and she urged him on with the pressure on that stick, but then her mouth broke away. \u201cStop,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Complying with such an outrageous request was like sawing back on the reins of an eight-horse stagecoach heading full tilt toward a cliff. He was enough in tune with her that he managed it, however, pushing his body up off her with one arm, breathing heavy, everything tight with lust. When she lifted a hand to his face, he sucked on her fingers, kissed them, nipped.</p><p>\u201cAfter you went down on me in your truck, did you jack off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He adjusted deeper, not a thrust, but a response of its own. When she swallowed, he locked on to that reaction. Did it again.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said, a bare whisper of reproof. \u201cHave you given yourself relief since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He could tell that surprised her, because he wasn\u2019t what she was used to having, and she\u2019d expected him to act according to his nature, not hers. But just because he wasn\u2019t a sub didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t understand what she wanted, needed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to come until I was inside you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I commanded you to pull out now, tonight, before that happened? What if I don\u2019t want you to come inside me until there\u2019s no condom between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re a sadist.\u201d His cock pulsed inside her, rebelling against the idea quite adamantly. A quiver ran up his arms when she slid her hand over one of them. The edge of the stick now followed the back of his thigh, to his knee, his calf. She tapped him there, lightly, then harder, making him flex in reaction.</p><p>She let it roll away with a clatter, replacing it with her hand on his ass, her nails scraping him. \u201cI\u2019m imagining you being flogged while you\u2019re inside of me,\u201d she whispered, her pupils dominating her dark eyes. \u201cA Mistress is standing behind you, striking on every thrust, the strands of the cat sliding off your gorgeous back and ass. It would be a barbed cat, but I know you wouldn\u2019t even feel it, Max. You\u2019d only feel my cunt, squeezing down on your cock. You wouldn\u2019t notice the people watching, everyone in the dungeon coming to watch this magnificent, muscular male animal fucking his Mistress.\u201d</p><p>He dropped back down on her, elbows on either side of her face, his fingers curling into her hair to hold her. He worked his hips in deeper, earning a parting of those glossed lips, a tiny, shuddering breath. \u201cDoes that idea excite you?\u201d he rumbled, teasing between them with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou know it does. The question is, does it excite you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Because while you were talking about it, your pussy rippled around my cock and your nipples got tighter, harder. I want to see you fucking mindless, Janet. If being a Mistress gets you there, sends you flying, I\u2019ll take that trip with you. But it\u2019s you, everything about you, that gets me hard.\u201d He paused, locking gazes with her. \u201cAnd if it keeps you from doing it with other men. Fair warning, I\u2019m moving into that zone. I\u2019m not the sharing kind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to see me mindless? Then pull out of me and take that thing off. I want to see you jack off over me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, moved his mouth down to her throat. \u201cNo. I want you too damn much like this.\u201d</p><p>Janet let out a cry as he covered her breast with his lips, pulling on the nipple hard, even as he thrust into her again, underscoring the point. He could take over a woman\u2019s senses. He was good at it, could overwhelm her, take her flying, and he wanted her helpless, screaming his name and raking his back with her nails.</p><p>That had been the goal with every woman he\u2019d ever had beneath him. Giving them both what they wanted. At least for that one moment.</p><p>As that thought sunk in, he let go of the nipple, but gave it a teasing lick before he lifted his upper body once more, bracing his other hand on her hip. Her skin was flushed, breath rapid, but her eyes hadn\u2019t changed focus. She wouldn\u2019t fight him. She understood that this was a give-and-take game between them, not the prescribed boundaries she had at the club. But his expanding knowledge of how her mind worked in moments like these, what she might truly want, was a potent form of self-restraint.</p><p>Still, he had his own desires, and he wasn\u2019t yet ready to withdraw. Sliding a hand beneath her waist, he put a palm on her buttock and brought them into a sitting position, her straddling his lap and him still inside her. It changed the angle and thrust, winning him another gratifying gasp, a lovely shudder through her toned body, but he forced himself to focus, cupping her face.</p><p>\u201cHow about a compromise? You want to use that stick on me, I can tell. How about you do your worst with it, and then you can sit me down on my sore ass in one of these straight chairs, and ride me until you climax.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy Mistress says she wants me to come inside her without a rubber.\u201d He lifted a shoulder, gave her a tight smile. \u201cSounds like I won\u2019t be coming tonight then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you do anyway? If you can\u2019t hold back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she gets to dish out another punishment sometime in the future. That\u2019d be a win-win for her.\u201d</p><p>Janet managed a wry chuckle, but when he tightened his arm around her waist, holding them even closer together, her face folded into a more serious expression. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders, pressing her face into the side of his where he couldn\u2019t see her face. Brow creasing, he cupped her skull, holding her with cock throbbing but heart tilting at the sudden desperate measure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rare combination, Max,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re caring for me, even as you offer to serve me. Protector and servant both. You\u2019re a new experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his temple. \u201cYou\u2019re also the first man who\u2019s ever called me that as an endearment instead of an honorific. I can tell the difference, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was, I would have told you. I\u2019m not shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that.\u201d Turning his head, he caught her lips, drawing them both into a slow, spiraling kiss, working himself inside her until she was making those lovely feminine noises of distressed pleasure. Her arms were locked around his shoulders still, their hearts thundering together. When she pushed him away at last, hands flat against his chest, her eyes were sparking with fire and challenge.</p><p>\u201cDeal. I\u2019m getting up now.\u201d</p><p>While they\u2019d been kissing, she\u2019d folded her legs beneath her, so he had to let go of her hips before she could lift off him. As she started to push herself up, he saw the grimace she tried hard to cover. He put his hands back on her waist, taking over so he lifted her onto her feet. She nodded with aplomb, then pointed to one of the straight wooden chairs along the wall. \u201cGet rid of the condom and take that chair to the center of the room.\u201d</p><p>Janet was shaken and energized at once. She hadn\u2019t been kidding. He was such a curious mix, and a very arousing one. She\u2019d barely had the willpower to stop them. Actually, during that last kiss, the desire to let them both go over had been so strong she almost hadn\u2019t. Except the Mistress in her loved the power of denial, for herself as much as her sub. Yet Max wasn\u2019t her sub. At the moment, she\u2019d call him a woman\u2019s deepest fantasy. He\u2019d understood her need enough to resist that overwhelming compulsion to completion as well.</p><p>Though a Domme loved a sub, many of her sisters in that nature loved the idea of teaching a strong, non-submissive, alpha male the pleasures of surrender. It was a treasure rarely discovered, let alone offered, as Max had offered it.</p><p>He\u2019d placed the chair in the center of the room as she requested. Now she retrieved the stick she\u2019d released. It wasn\u2019t flexible, not appropriate for what she wanted, but he\u2019d correctly recognized her desire to leave marks on him.</p><p>\u201cTake off the rest of your clothes. Then lean over the back of the chair until your stomach touches it. Grab hold of the seat with both hands. Spread your legs shoulder width.\u201d</p><p>She circled him, response from her pussy trickling down her legs, not only from him being inside her but from the vision he gave her as he worked off his shoes, shucked off jeans and briefs. He was utterly mouthwatering. She saw more scars, nicks and remnants of serious injuries, but nothing that marred the sheer beauty of a male body honed to warrior fitness. She\u2019d have to join him on one of his workouts, see what he did to stay looking like this. She had a feeling she\u2019d likely need a golf cart or boat to keep up.</p><p>When he complied with her order, spreading his legs, she moved behind him, licking her lips at the heavy testicle sac, the curve of the aroused cock that disappeared to brush his belly. She could see it when she shifted to view his profile. Very nice. His buttocks were taut, begging for teeth, strap, tongue.</p><p>She dipped to pull the belt from his jeans. When she moved close enough to trail her fingers down his spine, he lowered his head, that attractive quiver going through him again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if it gets to be too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to go through interrogation training, including waterboarding. Do your worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe physical isn\u2019t what can get to be too much.\u201d Not for someone like him. When her meaning sunk in, he nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cI could beat your ass all night long.\u201d</p><p>He gave a half chuckle. \u201cIs it crazy that I understood that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But don\u2019t talk anymore until I say so. Feel.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled the stick over his ass a few times, let him feel that. She thought about sliding it vertically between his buttocks, making him tighten those luscious cheeks and hold on to it while she strapped him, but in the end she put it aside. She liked keeping it simple. Plus, if the muscles stayed loose, the nerves were more sensitive. She rolled her shoulder, let the belt dangle from her hand then folded it over, tucking both ends into her palm.</p><p>The first several strikes were to get him used to the feeling, but then she started ramping it up. She loved the red prints left by the strap, loved knowing he\u2019d put the belt back on tonight but never look at it the same way again. He shifted and flexed from the blows, but otherwise held still. When he started lifting to them, she knew he was responding to her obvious arousal, the way she passed her hand over his tortured flanks, cupping his balls and squeezing, pressing her thumb deeper between his ass cheeks, against his rim, teasing him there so he jerked. But he didn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t warn her against that part of him, an intriguing potential.</p><p>He was right. He had an enormous capacity for discomfort, but she saw the body language change as he got deeper into his head, letting go of whatever analysis he was doing of what was happening between her and him. Lust started rising up, hot and hard, his cock getting stiffer, the tip getting glossy with thick fluid. The rippling of his back and ass muscles made her hungrier and hungrier, and she started hitting harder and faster, ignoring the ache in her arm and back, shifting on her tired feet, willing to go on until they were stumps.</p><p>When she circled him, he lifted his head to look at her. She was completely naked, sauntering around him with the brazen sensuality of a siren. She stopped in front of him, cupping her own breast, idly fondling it as she considered him.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019ll suck on that for you, Mistress.\u201d</p> <p>She allowed it, coming close enough her knees brushed his knuckles, locked on the edge of the chair seat. Then his mouth was on her nipple, his hands remaining in that restrained position, his ass available for more punishment. She was glad she\u2019d had him take off the condom, because the floor was marked with the drip of his pre-come.</p><p>Her cunt clenched hard at the skillful touch of his mouth and she tested herself, giving him the other one as well, until both nipples were glistening and plum-colored, tight points. Then she drew back enough to pivot. Cognizant of the lion in the cage once again, she slowly bent, arching her back in a sensual tease, lifting her ass in front of his face. \u201cMy pussy, Max.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d gauged her distance so he had to reach for it. He chose a devastating tactic to bring her closer though. He lifted his head, nuzzled between her buttocks to tease her rim with his tongue, sending a wild spiral of sensation through her that made her drip on the floor. She arched her back farther, and his tongue slid down over her slick labia, teeth nipping at her clit. The rocket of response through her cunt was so strong she knew she\u2019d come in no time, so she stepped away and straightened, giving him only a taste.</p><p>She made a tsking noise, pointed at where her arousal had dripped on the floor. \u201cYou should have caught those drops. What a mess you\u2019re making.\u201d She sauntered around behind him once more, prepared to punish him properly for his carelessness. He watched her in his peripheral vision, and she shivered at the glitter in those gray eyes, the promise and threat of when he\u2019d no longer restrain himself, no matter the strength of her will.</p><p>Thwack, thwack. Again and again, as her body shuddered as if he were thrusting into her with each blow, his ass lifting and falling in the rhythm as if he were imagining the same. When she won a grunt from him, she changed tactics, landing several stripes in a diagonal line from shoulder blade to rib cage, like flogging a gladiator before he entered the ring. That change in stroke brought his head up, and his fingers dug into the chair, making it creak.</p><p>He was powerful, could turn and take her to the ground in a moment. A weak, crazy part of her wanted to taunt him, tell him to take her down, fuck her the way they both wanted to do it, without a condom, hard, visceral, a branding of her cunt with his seed. She\u2019d never been a Mistress who\u2019d wanted a possessive sub, the very idea a turnoff. It made her think of her unexpected thoughts about owning him, that night at the club. She liked the idea of him considering her his far too much. And that was new, scary territory for her. Because she\u2019d been a man\u2019s possession before.</p> <p>She pushed away the darkness before it could rise up and interfere with this. It was time to go a different route. He hadn\u2019t flinched, hadn\u2019t once done anything that would shield himself. She heard both of them breathing, rasping for air for different reasons.</p><p>\u201cTurn the chair away from me and sit in it,\u201d she commanded. \u201cPut your hands behind you, hold on to the lowest rung in the back.\u201d</p><p>She watched him do it, how he had to fold his elbows almost into a box position since it was a small chair and he had long arms. Though his ass had to be sore, he didn\u2019t hesitate to press those choice buttocks into the wooden seat. He didn\u2019t look back at her, obviously realizing that was part of it. A form of blindfolding, following her commands without sight.</p><p>After retrieving another condom from his coat, she moved around to his front. He carried three, a man with confidence...and stamina. She held the belt in her other hand. His chest expanded and contracted, eyes molten steel, lips tight. Her gaze moved down to his cock, thick and hard.</p><p>\u201cFuck...Janet...\u201d He muttered it. He had his attention on her face, which she was sure showed her keen pleasure at his display. Opening the condom, she bent forward, slid the thin latex down over him. His eyes closed, all those muscles bunching in impressive restraint. Then she put her hand on his shoulder, steadying herself to straddle him. A more reverent oath tore from his lips as she positioned herself, slid down on him slowly, clutching her muscles on him as she descended.</p><p>When she got to the hilt, her cunt started quivering. She was so stirred up it would take very little to drive her to climax, and what she was clasping inside her wasn\u2019t little at all. Nothing about this man was small, inside or out. She slid the belt over his shoulders, put the tongue through the buckle and tightened that noose briefly around his throat, keeping three fingers between it and his windpipe as she held on to it, used it to rise and fall on him, a slow, torturous movement that caused both of them to shudder. She moaned, her pussy convulsing on him. Damn, she didn\u2019t want to go so fast, but it was going to happen. Her thighs trembled, her legs running out of strength, though if arousal alone was needed, it could carry her through a triathlon.</p><p>\u201cGame over, Mistress.\u201d Letting go of the chair, he cinched his arm around her, pushed her down hard on his cock, making it pleasure and pain both, stretching and filling her. She continued to hold on to that belt, but he gave her his strength, thrusting deeper into her, increasing the power of the movements, which pounded her clit against him. The undertow started to drag her out, her body flushing. He was close as well, she could tell, but she remembered his vow. She wanted him to break it, wanted the chance to punish him again, but she also wanted to feel his seed spurt inside of her. She wanted it all. Wanted everything from him, wanted to do everything to him.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, baby,\u201d he muttered. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>Had he sensed that as well? It didn\u2019t surprise her at all, but as he worked himself up inside her, she clutched his shoulders and took the leap, arching back to scream, the room echoing with her passion as her cunt milked his cock, trying to force the issue. Every muscle stood out on his upper body as he resisted it, as he gave her every pleasure and held back his own.</p><p>Let me punish you again, Max. Give us both that pleasure. It was so fervent a thought, it was almost a prayer, a plea, and then that prayer was answered.</p><p>He went over with a roar, thrusting up into her so powerfully she had to cling to the belt and trust him to hold her. With brutal, blissful finality, they drove one another home.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>She liked tormenting a guy, that was for sure. After that pretty fucking incredible night, Janet made it clear she\u2019d be the one who initiated another date. She\u2019d said no texts, no flowers, no chocolates, no temptations. He\u2019d grinned at that, but he\u2019d decided to respect her need to hold the reins. He had some intel gathering to do after all, a big part of which was why, two days later, he was standing inside the kitchen of a tiny house in a crappy New Orleans neighborhood. One about a step up from where he himself lived.</p><p>\u201cDale, where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back here, Ack Ack.\u201d</p><p>The response came from somewhere at the back of the house, so Max moved through the four-room box of less than eight hundred square feet, discovering the voice had filtered through the back screen door. The man he sought was standing in the open doorway of a potting shed, which took up most of his postage-stamp backyard.</p><p>Dale gave him a look. \u201cFucking pathetic. You\u2019ve been ten feet under water at o-dead-hundred in the middle of the night, found a single boat in a marina overflowing with them and yet you can\u2019t find one crip hanging out on his own property?</p><p>\u201cIt was a warning, bro. Can\u2019t believe you leave your door standing open in this shitty neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA SEAL looks to get a workout where he can. The bastards just won\u2019t cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably know a guy who plays with flowers and looks like a brick shithouse is a fucked-up mother with an assault rifle under his mattress.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d come to see Dale before he started the rest of his day, so it was barely past sunrise. Dale didn\u2019t seem surprised he was here, but then it was that way with them. Even when they were no longer in active service, SEALs often anticipated one another. Dale had been one of Max\u2019s BUD/S instructors and then later his MCPO, Master Chief Petty Officer.</p><p>Despite the house being barely more than a matchbox size, it was clean and neat, well tended. As he\u2019d driven down the street, Max had seen improvements in the houses around Dale\u2019s, evidence of the assistance he was providing to his neighbors, building some community pride. Flower boxes with Dale\u2019s carpentry style hung on porch rails, and there was less garbage in the yards. A whole gaggle of kids had been playing in Dale\u2019s front yard, waiting for the school bus. It didn\u2019t matter whether it was in a questionable NOLA neighborhood or in Iraq, kids gravitated toward those they knew could keep them safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he\u2019d gotten out of his truck, a little girl had shown Max her knockoff brand Barbie doll, dirty and scraped up. The doll wore a homemade dress made of a paper napkin colored with crayon. Pretty creative on the kid\u2019s part. Where there was a will, there was a way. Two young boys had been playing some form of baseball with a stick and rocks. Max hoped they didn\u2019t brain her by accident.</p><p>\u201cYou running a daycare now?\u201d</p><p>Dale snorted. As Max came to the doorway of the shed, leaned on it, the man looked up from his task, sharpening a set of pruning shears. Dale\u2019s workbench was built so he didn\u2019t have his back to the door. More evidence of why Max had made sure to call out when he entered the house. Dale would verify it was him regardless before pulling out the Glock he had strapped beneath the bench, but they both understood the courtesies.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re good kids. They help me with small jobs here and there, and it gives them a little cash. Need some coffee?\u201d Dale nodded to the pot brewing in the corner. His weathered face creased in a smile when he noted the case of beer Max had brought. \u201cWe can chase it with the beer later, if you stay that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Max put the case on a clear spot and picked up a mug hanging from the pegboard. As usual, Dale had a few projects going. He was building another flower box, repairing an old transistor radio and had a stack of magazines waiting to be read.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been around much these days,\u201d Dale observed, handing over his own coffee to be topped off.</p><p>Max shrugged. \u201cBeen busy. K&amp;A\u2019s had a lot happening lately. Amanda had a few bad days, so I\u2019ve been seeing her a little more often. Twice a week instead of once. She\u2019s getting back to an even keel though. I also drove down to Houston and hooked up with Donny to take Jenny and Gayle and her kids to the Gulf for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Lewis or Charlie get a text from the neighbors, telling them their wives were stepping out with two good-looking young guys?\u201d</p> <p>Max grinned. \u201cWithin twenty-four hours. They\u2019ve got a good community watch in Gayle\u2019s neighborhood. Charlie sent me a note, said I better have satisfied his wife, because she was a demanding wildcat in bed. I told him he didn\u2019t need to come back. After having me, she considered him superfluous.\u201d</p><p>Dale chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m sure he had some choice words for that. They okay?\u201d Setting aside the shears, he slid his left hip on to another stool, braced his right foot. He kept his salt-and-pepper hair that had once been black cropped military short, which emphasized the strong planes of his face, the deep-set eyes and rock-hard jawline. He was in his late forties, the grooves of his face carved by water, wind and a whole lot of other things. Dale was a retired SEAL, having served his twenty-year stint. His direct blue-green gaze said he had all his shit together, and then some.</p><p>He\u2019d made the shift to the stool smoothly enough, but Max knew there was no leg from the knee down on the left foot. His prosthesis was good enough that only someone looking for it would detect a difference in his more casual movements.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re okay.\u201d Max sobered. \u201cGayle knows the drill, and has figured out how to cope with the months alone. Jenny\u2019s having a harder time. She\u2019s pregnant with her first. Lew got called down range right after they found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat always sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Max sipped the coffee. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s been rotating through when they can to help out, and there\u2019s a core group of six wives in that area that meet regularly. Gayle\u2019s pulled her into it, a support group.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheir own Seal Team Six,\u201d Dale noted, his lips curving. \u201cGayle will take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s about seven months along and doing well, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after your experience with Savannah Kensington, you\u2019re hyperalert about it. Nothing wrong with that. As long as Jenny doesn\u2019t tell Lewis the guys are stalking her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they can be detected in the bushes outside her house or while shadowing her at the grocery store, they deserve to be busted.\u201d Max tapped his mug to Dale\u2019s. \u201cAs you said, you get your practice where you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know when you\u2019ll be called to serve.\u201d Dale gave him a considering look. \u201cI know you love me, but I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re here for another reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill a Master Chief,\u201d Max snorted. \u201cEven if you won\u2019t let me call you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know my place in this world. The other can be like a drug, you miss it so much. But if you slip and call me that every once in a while, it doesn\u2019t hurt my feelings. Ack Ack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Max\u2019s lips twisted at the nickname his fellow operators had given him. He knew all about that feeling Dale was referencing. It was something hard to explain to others, how much he missed those days. Days spent freezing cold, tired, on edge. Adrenaline cycling through his veins like coke, even as his core stayed dead calm, focused, doing everything necessary to flush out, hunt or bring down the target. But Dale got it. \u201cThanks, Master Chief.\u201d</p> <p>A grim smile touched Dale\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting involved with a woman. And she\u2019s a Domme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Dale took a swallow of his coffee. The guys sometimes called him \u201cMerman\u201d. With his odd blue-green eyes, the name fit, but the real reason was because of several missions where circumstances had forced him to deepwater dive in his rebreather gear, well beyond its twenty-five-foot rating. And he\u2019d survived.</p><p>He and Max shared the distinction of having graduated BUD/S at one of the youngest ages allowed, seventeen, though of course Dale was a decade or so ahead of Max when he got there. He\u2019d served with Dale on missions and trusted him entirely, and Dale returned the favor, but Dale was right. It was more than the desire to visit with him that brought Max here today.</p><p>Dale was a sexual Dominant, a Master in the same vein as Matt Kensington and his executive team. Dale occasionally used his membership at Club Progeny, but most of the time he hung his whip, so to speak, at a smaller, nonprofit membership club in the area. Though Max had never had the opportunity to see him operate in that capacity, he expected Dale brought a psychological intensity to his sexual Mastery that Janet would appreciate greatly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no one\u2019s boy toy, Max.\u201d Dale gave him a serious look. \u201cAre you trying to convince yourself you are, just to get what\u2019s behind her whip and boots? That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see me in collar and leash?\u201d Max asked, arching a brow.</p><p>Dale snorted. \u201cYeah right. Sorry, man. I had to ask. There are a few mistresses out there who are convinced every guy wants to be Dominated, and if a guy says he doesn\u2019t, he just hasn\u2019t met the right Domme to do it. That\u2019s not the case, any more than every woman I meet wants to be my sex slave, more\u2019s the pity. However, those kinds of Mistresses can be pretty convincing, especially when her target is thinking with his dick. Which, admit it, happens to the best of us.\u201d</p><p>Max inclined his head. \u201cShe\u2019s more than that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d Dale sat back with his coffee. \u201cSo what do you need from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her work out with subs at Progeny, and she\u2019s pretty tough, has her hands firmly on the reins. But with us, it\u2019s more of a give and take, like we\u2019re figuring out how to dance with one another. With each meet, it gets more complicated. Like starting with the waltz and moving into the tango. Without giving specific details\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease God don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Max grinned. \u201cShe does make me feel like doing things I normally wouldn\u2019t consider doing with a woman. It\u2019s the way she gets lost in it, aroused by it...it\u2019s fucking mesmerizing.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cSo, sight unseen, and given there are a lot of variables, does it ever work, if it\u2019s in the blood of one, but not the other?\u201d</p><p>Dale considered the question. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen, yes. But it\u2019s different for every pair and\u2014I won\u2019t lie to you\u2014often it\u2019s only a short-term success. Some crash and burn when they approach it for the long haul, because if she eventually needs you to go deep, and you can\u2019t do that, that might be a problem. Unless her reasons for going deep are mixed with other factors, things you can satisfy without that dive. This isn\u2019t a linear thing. It\u2019s more like a maze, and we all find different paths. You\u2019ll be able to find the answer for yourself, good or bad. Just keep all your senses open and follow your instincts. What do they tell you about your chances with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt pays to be a winner, right?\u201d Max gave the maxim from BUD/S training with a serious expression. \u201cIf I want her, I make it work. I don\u2019t accept defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoo-yah. Unless she puts out a restraining order on you.\u201d</p><p>Max snorted. \u201cIf I became that much of a problem, she wouldn\u2019t want the cops involved. She\u2019d handle it herself, with extreme prejudice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already liking her. Bring her around sometime.\u201d Dale set aside the coffee, rubbed his knee. When Max glanced at it, he shrugged it off. \u201cDamn humidity. Works it up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be better off in a less tropical climate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but who\u2019d watch after your dumb ass, kid?\u201d Dale kicked him lightly with the shoe covering the prosthesis. Though he looked amused, Max felt a twist of guilt, knowing that there was some truth to it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay around here, Master Chief. I can clean my own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say you couldn\u2019t?\u201d Dale asked, pleasantly enough, though Max recognized the don\u2019t-bullshit-me-unless-you-want-to-do-a-thousand-pushups edge to the tone that had made him a scary and effective SEAL trainer. \u201cI have plenty to keep me here. Swing sets to build, flower boxes to make. I\u2019m also watching after Eddie\u2019s dad and his dogs, over at the junkyard.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled, though his gut twisted, remembering the day they\u2019d lost Eddie. How they\u2019d brought his personal shit home to Ed Sr. \u201cIs he still doing good?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, but the cancer\u2019s catching up to him. He doesn\u2019t give a damn. Keeps a cigar clamped in his teeth like a Rottweiler with a bone practically twenty-four hours a day and says it just means he\u2019ll get to see his boy and wife all the sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know where Eddie got his stubbornness.\u201d</p><p>And his bravery. He\u2019d thrown himself on a grenade to save three other team members.</p> <p>Dale shifted, bringing them back to the present. \u201cAs far as this woman goes, do I know her, or do you prefer to keep her anonymous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have seen her, though she usually wears a mask on the public floor.\u201d Max hesitated, but it wasn\u2019t due to concerns about Dale\u2019s discretion. He was anticipating his reaction, which meant he was being chicken shit. \u201cShe\u2019s my boss\u2019s secretary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitting where you work, Ack Ack. Problematic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve already run through worst-case scenarios. I\u2019ll be the one to clear out if it goes sour. I won\u2019t let that be an uncomfortable place for her. I know I tend to be protective, but...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s a tough woman, but K&amp;A, the club, the life she has here, it\u2019s been carefully constructed and reinforced. I see Matt watching me a little bit closer these days, and not just because he\u2019s a protective son of a bitch when it comes to the women he considers part of his world. It\u2019s like he has intel about her he can\u2019t share, and he\u2019s gauging whether I\u2019ll be able to handle it when I figure it out. And I think I\u2019ve already figured out a piece of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, preparing for the unknown is something you\u2019re trained to do. Sounds like you\u2019re already pretty deep with this woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot fully. Still playing in shallow waters, a couple quick trips to the deep end. But I\u2019m ready to go deeper. I want to go deeper.\u201d Max met the other man\u2019s gaze. \u201cShe calms something inside me, even as she also stirs it all up. I didn\u2019t expect that to happen, not with Amanda and everything else, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s going to be significant, wherever this goes.\u201d</p><p>Dale pursed his lips. \u201cOkay then. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not getting any alarm flags from what you\u2019ve told me. If you need me, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Max rose, his mind already resting easier from the simple reassurance. \u201cHave to head to work, but I\u2019ll come back this weekend. Help you build that swing set before the gangbangers run off with the lumber you have stacked out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Tell Matt he can\u2019t hide behind his wife\u2019s pregnancy anymore. I expect him back for poker third Thursday. He better bring a healthy wad of cash.\u201d</p><p>Max grinned. \u201cCut the man some slack. He\u2019s got two demanding women in his life now. And God knows, one is more than enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen Savannah. If ever she gets too demanding, I\u2019ll be in the front of the long line to pick up that slack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019ll lose that other leg.\u201d Max waited a minute, saw Dale\u2019s blue-green eyes sharpen. The Master Chief knew what he wanted to ask. Max always asked about it. But Dale still waited for him to voice the question.</p><p>\u201cThe other thing...anything new on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have told you first thing if there was any verified intel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Roger that.\u201d Max lifted a shoulder. \u201cJust got a funny itch lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight want to get that cleared up before you and your lady get more involved. They don\u2019t tend to appreciate that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck me. Respectfully.\u201d But it was an absent comment as Max lingered in the doorway. Dale cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cYou heard anything from the teens at Dana\u2019s church?\u201d</p><p>Max volunteered regularly there, helping out in the soup kitchen and with maintenance. It had been a natural evolution from his job as Dana\u2019s primary driver, but it was also a strategic position to form bonds with the kids who inhabited that rough area. Dale\u2019s neighborhood rubbed edges with it.</p> <p>\u201cNothing yet, but if he ever surfaces and comes back, I\u2019m feeling pretty sure they\u2019ll be the ones to find out about it first and let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The other guys are keeping track of things in Mexico and Colombia. He\u2019s been buried deep for all these years. He\u2019s either piss-scared of you, acquired a new identity better than we can detect, or he\u2019s dead. Drug dealing doesn\u2019t lend itself to longevity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Max nodded. \u201cThanks, Dale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your head and ass down.\u201d The man opened the case of beer and threw him one. \u201cTake this for a snack later. It\u2019s New Orleans, after all.\u201d</p><p>They parted amicably enough, but Max could feel Dale watching him cross the backyard. Fucking intuition could be contagious among those who\u2019d served together, and he\u2019d probably just raised Dale\u2019s antennae. He\u2019d meant what he said though. He appreciated Dale helping him with intel, but that\u2019s where he wanted his Master Chief\u2019s involvement to end. When he finally paid this debt, it would be his ass alone on the line.</p><p>As Max held the door for Dana, ensuring she was comfortably situated in the limo, his phone beeped. Closing the door and moving up to the driver\u2019s door, he called up the message.</p><p>Since you passed the first evolution, I have another for you. If you\u2019re not planning to DOR yet, come to my house after work today. There will be pizza. -J</p><p>For some reason, a T-shirt logo spoofing the Star Wars movies came to mind\u2014 Come to the Dark Side. We have cookies.</p><p>Max shook his head at the note. An evolution referred to an event in the SEAL training schedule. He needed to get her away from the Internet. That thought led to a pleasing idea, one he mulled over as he took a seat behind the wheel. Dana shifted onto the padded seat behind him, curling her fingers into the shoulder of his coat, playing with the hair at his nape. \u201cAre you sexting while on official K&amp;A business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when are you official K&amp;A business? You\u2019re the punishment for my many sins.\u201d He flicked at her nose with a finger and she wrinkled it at him, swatting his fingers away.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear you and Janet are seeing one another.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be surprised. He wasn\u2019t sure anything happened at K&amp;A without the five-man team mysteriously and instantly knowing about it, which in turn meant their wives knew about it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just using me for sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fully support that. I just wish I could see video.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDo you ever behave?\u201d When she gave him a smug smile he caught in the rearview mirror, he pulled into traffic. \u201cSo how did things go today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty good. We\u2019re set for Tuesday\u2019s spaghetti dinner, and the revival at the end of the month should be a great event for the community. Reverend Morris is still doing cartwheels over the fact the Godspeed Players will be performing for it.\u201d</p><p>When he braked at a stop light, she brushed her knuckles along his cheek. It was an unexpectedly tender gesture that drew his gaze back to her. As she usually did when she wasn\u2019t at home, she wore sunglasses that concealed her obvious blindness, but the bemused curve of her lips gave him an indication of her mood.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to be happy, Max. You do realize that, right?\u201d</p><p>That was a loaded question, one that twisted things deep in his gut. His mother had deserved happiness. Amanda had deserved it. Who decided who deserved what? Maybe it was just all a big game to that faceless deity.</p><p>A SEAL was trained not to fail. If he experienced a setback, he figured out how to turn it into a win. He never quit. But how did you turn your mother\u2019s brutal murder and a gang rape that left your sister brain-damaged into a win? He\u2019d been halfway across the world, playing the hero, thinking home would always be there. In the course of one bloody afternoon, home was gone forever.</p><p>The bitterness, the grief, broke him. He couldn\u2019t go back to being a Navy SEAL because of Amanda, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. During those first horrible months, he\u2019d no longer been fit for duty. Though fellow SEALs like Dale tried to get him back on track, he pushed them away with a vicious anger. It was Matt Kensington who broke through, by proving to him that it wasn\u2019t his fury poisoning him\u2014it was his fear.</p><p>Maybe Dale had spoken to Matt, instigated the job offer. However it happened, Max needed employment in the area and Matt Kensington offered him the limo job. At first it had been simple, straightforward\u2014just get the guys in their fancy suits to meetings with other guys in fancy suits. No problem. Then one day Matt told him he was going to have a new responsibility, chauffeuring Peter Winston\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Dana was a decorated Iraq veteran who\u2019d been blinded, scarred and had her hearing nearly destroyed by a bomb stuffed in a plastic soda bottle. Cochlear implants had improved the hearing and Peter\u2019s unlimited financial resources had fixed a lot of the scarring, but that didn\u2019t matter. Max hadn\u2019t wanted the job. He didn\u2019t want to be in a situation where he had to protect someone that vulnerable. Not now, not ever again.</p><p>With Dana\u2019s slim hand on his shoulder now, Max remembered the first day he took her to her church. Peter had helped her into the car, so the first time Max actually touched his new charge was on the curb in front of the building.</p><p>When he opened the limo door for her, a shaking had started deep in his belly and moved out to his arm, affecting the hand he extended to her. The episode came on him so suddenly, his body was drenched with sweat in a blink.</p><p>He was about to jerk back, close the door in her face, try to pull his shit together. Hell, forget that, he was going to radio Wade and tell him they needed to send over another driver. He\u2019d just lean on the door until his replacement got there, no matter how much she beat on the window. Before he could do anything as absurd as that, Dana had reached out, looking for his hand. Her fingertips brushed his thigh, an intimate touch that might have sent another woman recoiling with a stammered apology. Instead her palm flattened on him, registering how he was shaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the next blink, she\u2019d slipped out of the car. He caught her arm by reflex, keeping her inside the shelter of the door and his body. To anyone looking, he would look like the protective one, but his hand was clammy, fucking trembling. She gripped his upper arms, her fingers surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first time\u2019s the hardest. I had awful panic attacks when I started walking around with just my cane. In zero to ten seconds, I looked like I\u2019d come out of a gym, my clothes just soaked.\u201d Her fingers plucked at his shirt sleeve, registering the way it stuck to his skin.</p><p>Despite that, she clasped that arm, turning him away from the car, guiding them both out of the track of the door before she nudged it closed with her hip. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you a bit for freaking out over a church social. They can be terrifying. You just stick close to me whenever you see one of those church ladies coming your way. I\u2019ll tell them you\u2019re my boy toy on the side when Peter\u2019s too busy for me, and that\u2019ll keep them from matching you up to their daughters and granddaughters. Unless you see Vivien LeCheau coming toward us. You can\u2019t miss her. She\u2019s a cross between a cougar and a viper. If she\u2019s coming at us, get square behind me. I\u2019ll put one of May Clark\u2019s potato salad spoons in places the sun don\u2019t shine.\u201d</p> <p>She knew it wasn\u2019t the social that had him acting like a pathetic idiot, but of course the teasing helped. He would have cut his own throat if she\u2019d coddled him.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Miss Vivien look like?\u201d he managed. \u201cHot cougar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, you better watch yourself. That kind of temptation comes with bad day-after consequences. Glenn Close and her boiled rabbit look like Cinderella and her house mice in comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d Dana had tucked her fingers into his elbow, setting him into position to lead her up the church walk. The top of her head barely reached his shoulder. He kept looking in all directions, as if he was escorting POTUS himself in the middle of an L.A. gang fight. He couldn\u2019t do this. He fucking couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cJust one step at a time.\u201d She tightened her grip on his tense biceps. \u201cOne breath at a time, one step at a time, and then you\u2019re moving forward.\u201d</p><p>But never away. He was always afraid he was moving in a circle, right back to the beginning.</p><p>Coming back to the present, he felt the old surge of resentment, bitterness. Did being deserving really mean anything?</p><p>Though he held it back, Dana picked up on his mood. The woman could pluck things out of one touch and silence that most people couldn\u2019t if they were given a ten-page action report.</p><p>\u201cSome wounds don\u2019t heal fast, or at all. But you learn to manage them as things go on. You\u2019re managing, Max. Is she good for you? I\u2019d think she would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ll be good for her too. You don\u2019t have to turn your back on the past as much as figure out what place it needs to hold in your life so the present can come in, give you a future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou use that in your sermon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just thought it up right now, but I\u2019ll jot it down for future ones.\u201d She flicked his neck. \u201cWiseass frogman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumbass supply grunt.\u201d</p><p>God help him, but he loved Dana as if she was his own sister. A sister who often flirted outrageously with him and took way too many opportunities to grope him. She was the type of submissive who sought punishment. He didn\u2019t like to call it bratting, because it made the reasons she did it sound petty. It was clear she had a need to assert her independence as a fierce affirmation that her injuries hadn\u2019t defeated her. Peter\u2019s punishments were the balance, the safety net that evened it all out.</p><p>He guessed he had internalized more about the BDSM world than he\u2019d thought. He\u2019d picked up a lot just by being a witness to how the K&amp;A men and their wives experienced it. Thinking about his behavior with Janet, those complex exchanges with her Mistress side, he wondered for the first time if he was seeking answers to some of his own needs within her desire to Dominate.</p><p>He\u2019d indicated something like that to Dale, hadn\u2019t he? It had a different feel and flavor to it, for sure, but when he and Janet were playing their intense, complicated games, things stilled in his head and heart, eased in his gut. Things he\u2019d gotten so used to feeling and enduring, they\u2019d become a chronic kind of emotional pain.</p><p>Because of that, and so many other things, he found himself looking forward to tonight.</p> <p>He parked his truck in the alley alongside Janet\u2019s house. It was raining, the sky a white-gray cloud cover hiding the sun. Humidity percentages had fallen, such that it was cool enough for a light jacket, a ward against the dampness. The rain was the gentle, constant kind, though, encouraging a couple to stay in bed for a lazy afternoon of lovemaking and watching old movies. With that in mind, he\u2019d brought a small grocery sack of options for her to consider. He\u2019d debated whether to bring flowers and settled for a single rose, something unique he\u2019d picked up from the florist. The petals were a swirl of vanilla-white and dark-red color. He expected she\u2019d appreciate the irony.</p><p>He was starting toward the front door when his phone buzzed with a text. Come around back, Max. I\u2019m on the porch.</p><p>He let himself through the privacy fence, circled to the back stairs. The walkway flagstones were slick and dark with rain. Hearing a change in the tempo and density of the water, a smile curved his lips. She had the hot tub bubbling.</p><p>Imagining the things that could be done there had his blood simmering as well. When he opened the screen door to find her already in it, that reaction intensified. She had one arm stretched along the edge of the tub, the other bent to hold a wineglass. With her shoulders and the rise of her breasts exposed, it was obvious what he could discern through the concealing froth of bubbles was bare skin. The pair of robes hanging on a screen nearby confirmed it. All her lovely dark hair was piled on her head, damp tendrils curling on her neck. She wore the ballerina charm she\u2019d worn the other night, the one she\u2019d seemed hesitant about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had an evolution start quite like this,\u201d he said, reminding them both of her earlier text. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot more inspiring than boat drills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. What\u2019s in the grocery bag?\u201d</p><p>He placed it on the sidebar. \u201cGourmet hot chocolate, if you want to keep it simple. Whiskey, sugar, milk and honey, if you\u2019d like something stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hot toddy. What a perfect idea for a rainy day.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out an envelope, held it up, then set it on her sidebar. \u201cMy test results. All clear.\u201d</p><p>In the blink it took her to digest the significance, her expression became something different. Her lips parted, doing that subtle little moistening gesture that made his cock harden. She nodded demurely, however, extending her hand for the rose.</p><p>As he placed it in her grasp, he covered her fingers with his, sliding them down to caress her wrist. He wanted to cup her jaw, kiss her with all the hunger the envelope unleashed between them, but something held him back, as if that chain only ran out so far before it pulled him up short. It was a correct instinct, for she drew her hand away to bring the flower to her nose. Toying with it, she considered him.</p><p>\u201cDuring your training, you have to prove you can swim a certain number of meters without taking a breath. You also have to descend to a prescribed depth without gear, and then come back up, swimming no faster than the bubbles you\u2019re blowing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Else you\u2019ll get the bends.\u201d He sat down on the edge of the hot tub, trailing his fingers in the water. It was toasty warm, the moistness on her neck a result of the steam where it hit the cooler air. \u201cDid you have a good day, Mistress?\u201d</p><p>Her expression flickered. \u201cYes,\u201d she said after a pause. \u201cMostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Mostly. As in I mostly thought about you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved in a small smile. \u201cYou\u2019re good at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you, I work at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Because what I want you to do will likely require some effort.\u201d She brushed the rose over her cheek, dragging it along her throat as she closed her eyes, lifted her chin to experience the petals along her skin. It made him hunger to put his mouth on the same track, taste the rose-scented flesh.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go down on me under the water, Max.\u201d She fixed him with her dark gaze. \u201cYou get to surface three times. But before you need a fourth time, I expect you to make me come.\u201d</p><p>He rose from the edge of the pool, shed his jacket. \u201cWhat kind of dive gear do you want me to wear?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled, appreciating him. \u201cNothing more than the dolphins wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was as well hung as a dolphin, I\u2019d go naked as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of providing reassurances about the obvious, but you need have no concerns in that department, Max.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Stripping off his shirt, he tugged his belt loose, opened his jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask what happens if you don\u2019t do it in three tries,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need to. Failure\u2019s not an option. But if it did happen, I\u2019d just try, try and try again, however long it took me to succeed. Or until I run out of breath and die, captured between your lovely thighs.\u201d Glancing at the sidebar again, he picked up one of the bottled waters there and leaned across the hot tub to place it on the ledge next to her shoulder. \u201cTo hydrate yourself, Mistress. You\u2019re going to be losing bodily fluids.\u201d</p><p>She caught him, tangling her fingers in his chest hair. Max closed his eyes, caught in the sensation as she teased a nipple, then brushed her knuckles down his sternum. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to feel your hands since our last date,\u201d he said, opening his eyes to stare into hers. \u201cI was about to break protocol and take the initiative. Ask you out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realized I have a protocol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. Right now, you want to be the one calling the shots, saying when we\u2019ll get together. You also don\u2019t really like to be touched unless you give permission, but there are certain moments when your body language tells me it\u2019s okay.\u201d Proving the point, he touched her temple, traced one finger down her cheek bone, moving over for a brief touch of her moist lips. She was motionless, her left hand resting on his chest while he did that, those intriguing eyes watching his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a little studying of my own,\u201d he added. \u201cBeing a SEAL is a way of living, 24/7. You don\u2019t switch it off when you\u2019re back from a mission, and it doesn\u2019t even really turn off when you leave the Navy. From what I can tell, that\u2019s the kind of Domme you are as well. You breathe it, feel it, know it in your blood. I\u2019ve watched folks at the club, and it\u2019s not like that for everyone. But you\u2019re also not really the boots and whip kind of Domme, though those boots you wore with Thor that night, the ones that fit like a second skin, were pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at the purse of her lips, her arch look. \u201cYou have a psychological mastery thing going that everyone near you feels, from a club submissive to the UPS guy who drops off packages at your desk. You don\u2019t have the desire to exercise it in the conventional ways. What you do at the club seems more like a gym workout to me. It\u2019s not the end goal. You\u2019re using it to stay in shape for rock climbing, a run on the beach, a dangerous mission.\u201d His gaze held hers. \u201cYou prefer places where the scenery and what you encounter might not be what you expect, so you have the challenge of adapting. But you haven\u2019t really found anyone that works for that, someone compatible with it. Someone willing to take risks, but who will also take care with your heart. Someone who won\u2019t turn on you.\u201d</p><p>He saw the change in her expression, the thing that told him he\u2019d knocked on a door she hadn\u2019t expected him to find. Whether she\u2019d open it or not was up to her. But he\u2019d told her he knew that door was there.</p><p>It was time to ease back, turn his attention to the test she\u2019d given him. Just like BUD/S, he expected he had to pass it to proceed to the next evolution, God help him. If she\u2019d somehow gotten her hands on the whole BUD/S training manual, she\u2019d be putting him through her version of interrogation torture and live fire combat training next.</p><p>Rising, he toed off his shoes, pushed the jeans and boxers off, got rid of the socks. He was already erect, no help for that with a beautiful naked woman so close, but her reassurance about his size made him feel pretty good on that score. His typical male reaction to that would probably make her laugh, but he didn\u2019t tell her right now. Their conversation had woven a sexual tension between them, given her a pensive look his intuition told him not to disrupt. He wanted to keep her focused on the humming needs of her own body, the obvious visible desires of his.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Janet broke the seal on the bottle, took a sip of water as she watched him. His analysis of her as a Domme was on the mark, though she herself couldn\u2019t have said she was seeking something like him until he showed up on her radar. Her gaze coursed over the exceptional musculature of his upper body, the jutting power of his cock. The heated water swirling over her skin was just an extension of the arousal between her legs.</p><p>\u201cThree times,\u201d she reminded him softly.</p><p>He stepped over the wall. The water came to his waist, because she\u2019d let the pool fill to its maximum height. The spa had three levels of benches built into the side, and she was on the most elevated one. He should be able to get down on his knees below the water line, reach her with his mouth by bending to an approximate forty-five-degree angle. She\u2019d given it a lot of thought.</p><p>Putting the bottle of water aside, she settled herself, sliding her arms along the ledge of the hot tub, curving her fingers into the handholds provided for entering and exiting the pool. They were also designed for tying a man\u2019s wrists to them. Though she\u2019d never brought a man here, she was a woman who planned for future contingencies.</p><p>He dropped to his knees, an act that never failed to elevate her heart rate. In the water, it was a drifting motion, an anchor settling. It was clear this was a familiar element for him.</p><p>\u201cDo you swim to keep in shape?\u201d she asked, thinking about her earlier thoughts of keeping up with his workout by boat.</p><p>\u201cWhen the water\u2019s warm.\u201d Humor creased the lines around his eyes. \u201cYou spend so much time in freezing temperatures, both in training and on missions, you never go into cold water unless it\u2019s a mandate. Fair warning\u2014if the power goes out during a hurricane, I won\u2019t take a shower until I can get a hot one. I\u2019ll smell like a junkyard dog first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a note to chain you out in the backyard, something I\u2019d only do to a man, not a dog.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at that, then his gaze intensified. \u201cSpread your legs for me, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>It was a clever combination, serving her will and yet issuing it like a command, the challenge unmistakable. She tilted her head. \u201cI expect you to give me a good reason to open them, sailor.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparked in answer, and then he sank below the surface. His fingers slid over her thighs, and then his mouth was on her knees, tongue tracing the seam, up, up, up... She could be a steel bitch when needed, but she wasn\u2019t going to make the task impossible. Plus his tongue felt so good, sliding along with the swirl of warm water he stirred. She let her legs part. His hands slipped beneath her knees, caressing the backs before he hooked his fingers under her thighs. Janet\u2019s head fell back on the ledge, her breasts rising to the cool touch of the air as his mouth found her pussy, the silk of his hair brushing her upper thighs. He teased her labia, tongue dipping inside her for a long, strong lick of her channel, gathering her cream. He dragged his tongue up to her clit, the pressure sending arrows of sensation shooting all along the insides of her thighs, her lower abdomen.</p><p>The water made everything soft, pliant, aiding his intent, but the man had obvious skill in this area. Lucas, the K&amp;A CFO, was reputed to have legendary oral skills, and Janet had heard enough to know he\u2019d coached the other four men, such that all their wives gained the benefit. Now she wondered if he was conducting classes for the rest of the K&amp;A male personnel. She couldn\u2019t think of a better use for company time.</p><p>Of course, with Max, she expected he simply excelled at everything he undertook. Or practiced it religiously until he did. She gripped the handles harder, her heels resting on his upper back, her legs on his shoulders as his head worked between her thighs. With her eyes closed, her mind lost in blissful sensation, she imagined his tongue replaced by his cock, the water sloshing over the edges as he drove into her. He wouldn\u2019t have to wear a condom tonight. He\u2019d brought test results, presented them in a matter-of-fact way, but with a direct look full of erotic potential.</p><p>He suckled her clit, plunged his tongue into her cunt again, rotating it around, then stroked the top of the vaginal channel, coming back out to the clit again. She groaned at the stimulation, a needy female response, and his fingers tightened on her legs, as if he\u2019d registered the vibration through the water.</p><p>How long had he been under there? How long could the man hold his breath while swimming underwater? Or when doing something perhaps less physically exerting but requiring even more mental concentration? His large hands gripped her thighs, thumbs pressed on the inside, keeping her open for him. His shoulders held her up, so she was floating free beneath the water, only her handholds above the surface keeping her in place. The buoyancy was an amazing feeling as her body undulated in response to his stimulation.</p><p>\u201cMax...\u201d She let herself say his name while he was under water. \u201cMax. Oh...\u201d A guttural sound wrenched from her throat as he did something else, a pinch to her clit, then his tongue worked all around it, pushing against it, making it throb. Then he was pulling back from her, his hands sliding along her legs, a reluctant withdrawal. It added to her arousal, his obvious wish to stay where he was, no matter the needs of his lungs.</p> <p>He surfaced right in front of her breasts, his aroused attention covering both before she let go of one handhold to grip his nape, cover his mouth with her own. She captured his exhalation, taking his breath into her body and giving him back the same, her lips teasing, her tongue tangling with his. When he lifted his head, it was to brush a kiss on the top of her breast, draw several breaths, then he submerged again, leaving her bemused and wanting more of his nearness.</p><p>He took up right where he left off, and she was impressed by his lack of apparent urgency. He was accomplishing a mission, but it was the type of mission that couldn\u2019t be achieved by racing a clock, no matter the critical time factor involved. She lost herself in it, the only thing grounding her to reality being an awareness of how her ankles rested on his lower back. She made sure they were loose enough he could easily get free of her if he needed to surface. Otherwise she had no concerns, immersed in those lovely whirlpools of feeling he had swirling up from her core.</p><p>The heat of the water bubbled against her skin, his body pressed up between her thighs. She dropped her head back to the concrete again and drops of water rolled into her mouth. She wanted to wrap her lips around his cock, suck and suck and suck until it convulsed and gave her his seed. But she wanted his seed in her body. She could have both, could have it all. A man who could do this would be more than capable of serving her several different ways in the same night. Three condoms that first time, right?</p><p>She was gasping, working herself in rhythm against his mouth, those spirals getting tighter, closer. His fingers dug into her, shoulders pushing her up so he could change his angle. As he did that, he broke the water\u2019s surface for only the key moment to draw a breath, so quick she nearly missed it, her eyes opening briefly to register his second breath before she was lost in hazy arousal once again.</p><p>\u201cOh God...\u201d she breathed. \u201cOooohhh...fuck.\u201d She wasn\u2019t one to curse, but she wasn\u2019t sure it was a curse, more like a need to say the word that she desired to do with him, her deepest need at the moment. To fuck and be fucked, by this man. It wasn\u2019t an ugly word, not when spoken like this. It was the word that fit the primitive needs of her body, mind and soul, her heart pounding like a crescendo of tribal drums.</p><p>That intense ripple, the precursor to a dense wave, caused her pussy to clench, her hips to thrust up. As the feeling spread out, his mouth worked her with the steady constancy she usually associated with a vibrator, only this had the added benefit of being flesh and blood, an insistent, demanding male, wanting to give her pleasure even as he took the triumph of pulling it from her, a delicious mix. She thrashed like a caught mermaid in his grip. Her screams vibrated against the wall, the water, such that she could feel the reverberation against her flesh, and knew he could as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had chimes hung from the ceiling, ones that had been making their bell noises from the light breeze stirred by the rainfall. That music joined the flashing lights in her vision, the smell of the rain, the heated water, the dampness of her own skin, to carry her spinning on a sensory experience unlike any other she\u2019d had. It was lovely, intense, mind-numbing, and she wanted it to go on forever.</p><p>His hands spasmed on her body, and she had a sudden awareness of other issues. Pulling herself back to reality was a struggle, but she managed it, letting go of both handholds to take a full seat on the underwater bench and catch his shoulders, tugging on him urgently.</p><p>He surfaced with a large breath, chest heaving, eyes closed. She realized he\u2019d likely needed his third breath when she began to orgasm. He\u2019d chosen not to break her moment, letting her ride it to the end. Until she brought him up.</p> <p>She guided him to the bench next to her, shifting in the water so she was resting on his knee. As she pushed his hair back from his face, it reassured her that his arm went around her waist, holding her there, fingers closing over her hip. Despite his being out of breath, the look he gave her when his eyes opened won a smile from her.</p><p>\u201cThree breaths, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she said, trying to sound cool and unaffected, \u201cI meant you could surface three times before you finished the job. Not that your third time had to be at the very end.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her, then gave a half chuckle. \u201cWell, my instructors said that nothing fucks you up like not following direction. On the other hand, that means I exceeded expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHooyah,\u201d she responded, and he laughed outright, though he started coughing. She slipped an arm around his back and rubbed, moving more fully on to his lap. As she did, she realized her nearly drowning him hadn\u2019t diminished his own lust at all. His cock was a substantial weight against her leg. Her pussy, still caught in delicious aftershocks, contracted in reaction once more. She wanted to straddle him then and there, let him spend himself as his reward for a job well done, but an out-of-breath man having a climax in hot water was a sure recipe for unconsciousness. Since he was easily two hundred pounds of heavy muscle, there was no way she could drag him out if needed. \u201cSafety first\u201d could be a pain in the ass.</p> <p>Smiling a little at the thought, she kept stroking his hair away from his face. When he decided to put his head down on her breasts, she allowed it, closing her eyes as he began to nuzzle her with his lips, his hand coming up to cup the left curve, stroke.</p><p>She rested her temple against his crown, letting the languorous aftermath of her climax take her over. \u201cWhat kind of date were you going to suggest?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhen you were thinking about breaking protocol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamping.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, blinked at him. \u201cYou want to take me camping, where there\u2019s no indoor plumbing, no place to plug in my hair dryer, no mirror or light for my makeup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to rely on me to tell you you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d He settled back farther into his seat, holding her even more firmly. Catching a tendril of her hair, he let it slide between thumb and forefinger, then released it to spring back into a damp curl. His gray eyes passed along her throat, down her breasts, to the rest of her beneath the water. \u201cEasy enough.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him. \u201cIf I ever agree to do such an unlikely thing, I\u2019ll demand quid pro quo. You\u2019ll have to do something you\u2019re not entirely sure you want to do.\u201d</p> <p>When he didn\u2019t immediately agree, she raised a brow. \u201cA Navy SEAL is worried about what one woman can inflict upon him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. We abhor situations without proper intelligence.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head at him, she leaned in, curling her fingers in his hair to hold him still as she put her mouth on his throat. She nipped at the pulsing artery, tracing his windpipe with her tongue. His hands closed over her back, her thigh, tugging her forward in an obvious desire to have her straddle him. It matched her own desire, and even though she knew they wouldn\u2019t finish here, she moved over him, locking gazes as he positioned himself at her opening, fingers digging into her as he slowly slid her onto his length. She was tight, tissues slick and yet also sensitive from the climax, but he moved slow, working into her, cupping the side of her neck as she gripped his shoulders, letting out a murmur as he pushed into her.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re heaven,\u201d he said with reverence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d she said, a command she reinforced by digging her nails into his shoulders. She wanted to hold his climax out of reach, and not just because she wanted to exert control over him.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of you,\u201d he said, reading her mind. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d To prove it, he lodged himself deeper, his jaw set with a look of male determination that sent butterflies fluttering through her chest. And Janet Albright wasn\u2019t a fluttery person in any way.</p><p>\u201cI know. Take care of me by serving me at my pleasure. When I demand it. For now, just feel.\u201d She tightened her muscles on his delicious length and savored the torment she gave him, making him stay still. His fingers would leave bruises on her fair flesh. He groaned, thighs twitching beneath hers. \u201cI could make you come like this,\u201d she purred. \u201cMilking you with my pussy, not allowing you to move until you couldn\u2019t help yourself. You\u2019re so very disciplined. It tempts me to do all sorts of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d He gave a desperate half laugh, but then, when she did it again, he gripped her nape, ran his thumb along her jaw, giving her a decidedly more dangerous look. \u201cWhen I have you under me, I will fuck you unconscious, Mistress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d She caught his thumb in her mouth, bit down, sucked on it as she worked her muscles on him again. His breath caught in his throat, even as his eyes got more feral. She was pushing the wild animal to the forefront, and loving every moment of it. \u201cWhat if I fuck you to unconsciousness first?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s other hand curved around her buttock, fingers teasing the seam. His mood changed, the edgy game they were playing becoming something else as he looked at her. His eyes were moving over her face as if seeing her for the first time. \u201cLet me come inside you, Mistress,\u201d he said. \u201cI want that. And so do you.\u201d</p><p>He brought her to his lips, starting the kiss slow and devastating, his fingers burying in her hair, mouth opening farther to seal over her lips, tongue working against hers. Her pussy clenched again, but this time in reaction to his emotional seduction. He cinched his arm around her waist, where no movement at their joining point was possible for either, just that deep penetration, her muscles working against his length, her clit pressed against his hard abdomen, breasts high on his chest. He kept his attention on her mouth, a never-ending kiss where he teased her lips, tongue and the insides of her mouth to the point the nerves were vibrating like a second erogenous zone, hungry to keep him there, filling her, connected to her.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his shoulders, squeezed down with everything she had, pushed against his hold so he knew she wanted to move. Three strokes and his hands convulsed on her. She would figure out how to get him out of the spa if he fainted, but now she had a feeling it would take far more than that to overcome this powerful man. He was moving forward and taking her with him.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mistress.\u201d He held her tight, working her clit against his body as he reacted to her lift and fall with his own thrusts. \u201cFuck...\u201d</p><p>It was a hard, short climax for her, so intense it gave her a series of shuddering waves that prolonged his own. When he released with a groan, she reveled in the feel of his seed searing inside of her. The water would take away any sticky moisture when they finally parted and left the pool. Yet what was inside of her would trickle onto her wet thighs. She might let him lick himself off her flesh. Or maybe she\u2019d let it stay there, a reminder of what he\u2019d given her.</p><p>They finished together, wrapped around one another, breathing hard. He had his face pressed to her throat, her arms still around him, and Janet felt a sense of restful peace she hadn\u2019t felt in so long. Just holding and being held, the world revolving around them.</p><p>Gradually, she became aware of the patter of the rain on the tin roof again, saw the dripping waterfall of it off the eaves. She expected it was a good thing it was raining; else her neighbors on the other side of the privacy fence might have gotten an earful.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out and go inside,\u201d she said at length, feeling her fingers pruning. \u201cWe can lie on the couch and turn on the fire logs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I agree to this camping idea, where would we be going? For all I know, you might be ferrying me to some fringe survivalist camp where you and other ex-military types are plotting to take over the government.\u201d</p><p>Max chuckled, making her head bounce against his chest. Janet was running her wicked fingernails through his chest hair, teasing his nipple, following the curves and planes of him down to his rib cage, his bare hip, then back up again. She\u2019d wanted him lying on her wide sofa, with her body comfortably draped over him, so that was where they were, lazy as a pair of cats next to the flickering fire logs.</p><p>The delivery pizza had been polished off, mostly by him, though Janet had talked herself into three slices. The empty box was under the coffee table. Two empty glasses topside still had the dregs of the hot toddy he\u2019d made them. She dipped a finger in his, tasting the residual sugar and honey, then put that sweetness against his flesh to lick it off. The intimacy stirred him as much the touch. He curved his fingers in her hair, tugged a little, responding to the tease.</p><p>\u201cYou can hardly blame me for trying to enlist you in our cause,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you whip giggling interns into ninja assassins in less than six weeks. But since you were whining about indoor plumbing and hair dryers, you may not be as tough as I told them you were.\u201d</p><p>She pinched him for that, and he fended her off by grasping her wrist. When she gave him that look that said she wanted to do as she pleased, he waited a charged beat before opening his fingers slowly, letting her go. Still holding his gaze, she pinched him again, hard. The sharp edge of her nails left little burning bites along his flesh that made him struggle to stay still. She put her mouth over them, soothing the pain with her tongue and stirring up other parts. Then she got quiet again, laying her head on his chest once more. He stroked her hair again, liking the feel of that, as well as how she lay between his thighs, her body pressed against his cock, which was proving it was capable of whatever she might demand from him next. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to go up to your bed, where there are warm blankets and my feet aren\u2019t hanging off the end of the couch?\u201d He had to stay mindful of the side table beneath his heels, where a trio of delicate ceramic flowers were arranged. If she became any more aggressive with her nails and teeth, he might react as if a doctor had hit his knee with a rubber hammer and send one of them shattering against her headboard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say yes, but I don\u2019t have the energy to get up.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, levering himself into an upright position and shifting her so he had her supported in his arms. He stood up then, taking her with him. \u201cNo need for that, Mistress. All you need is me.\u201d</p> <p>She made a noncommittal noise but crooked her arm around his neck, adjusting so she was deeper in the cradle he provided. It said a great deal about the size of her personality that, until he held her like this, it wasn\u2019t obvious how petite she really was. Small-boned, light frame. He thought about those leg fractures and tightened his arms around her, but the way he might hold an egg. Firm and protective, but not crushing.</p><p>He took the stairs slow. Halfway up, she touched his face, guided it toward hers for a kiss. He stopped there, holding her securely, even as he was caught by the power of her simple touch. With every gesture, it seemed as if she gave him everything. He\u2019d had an impression that Dommes withheld a great deal, but inside the world she spun, nothing was further from the truth. She made things in his heart swell up, made him want to say unlikely things to her. He thought of the times he\u2019d seen her take a sub to the point he was fervently kissing her shoe, telling her of his love, his devotion to her, but that was the endorphin rush, the mindless drive of lust. This heated kiss on her staircase in a suspended moment of time was something different.</p><p>At least for him.</p><p>The thought was an uncomfortable one. When he lifted his head, she touched his mouth, but she didn\u2019t say anything right away, her dark eyes studying him. He wasn\u2019t sure if that helped or added to his concern. \u201cTake me to my bed, Max,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>He\u2019d only had a brief impression of her bedroom last time, since he\u2019d been blindfolded most of the time he\u2019d been in it. The mahogany tester bed gave him pause, then a wry smile. It looked like it belonged to a queen. The half panel arched over it was lined with velvet, and the headboard had leaf and heart patterns carved into the dark wood. The bed was piled high with thick comforters and pillows, and he could well imagine Her Majesty sleeping, a petite but formidable coil beneath it, her servants coming to wake her in the morning. The wardrobe and dresser matched the bed, but she\u2019d softened the severe furniture with watercolors of Victorian scenes, well-dressed couples strolling in the park, picnicking in a meadow.</p> <p>Letting her feet down by her bed, he pulled back the covers. As he did, her fingers slipped off his shoulder down to his chest. She liked to tug on his chest hair, give him that tiny pain. As she walked up the steps affixed to the base of the bed and stretched out on the mattress, she released her hair. The thick coil of it wound sinuously over the pillow. Her hand slipped to her breast, molding the curve, thumb tracing her nipple before she parted her thighs, put the other hand there. His chest tightened along with his cock, seeing the slumberous desire in her eyes. She was tired, but she wanted him. Again.</p><p>He had no idea what time it was. It must be late, given that he\u2019d come after work, but time had stopped for him once he\u2019d crossed her threshold. Maybe she was as much sorceress as queen. He wondered that Ulysses had ever wanted to leave Circe\u2019s island. Of course, there was the matter of his men being turned to pigs...</p><p>When he shared that with her, her sinful mouth curved. \u201cNot to mention his wife and child waiting at home. He loved them too dearly to be derailed for long, even by a sorceress\u2019s deceptive charms. He was an honorable man.\u201d</p><p>The shadow through her gaze was unexpected, and he put his hip on the bed, his hand on her face. \u201cYou are the best of both worlds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe integrity and loyalty of Penelope, the seductive power of Circe.\u201d</p><p>He meant it, but he knew he only had the faith of wishful thinking. He had no true understanding of what was going on in her head, how he really differed from the others, except for location. When he leaned down toward her lips, she put a hand on his chest, stopping him. \u201cWhat is it, Max?\u201d</p><p>Her voice wasn\u2019t the appeal of an insecure woman, but a tone he often heard at the office, as she fixed some luckless person with a direct stare that could command truth out of Pinocchio.</p> <p>\u201cMe, being a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>She considered that, her touch sliding along his neck, fingers tracing his collarbone. \u201cYou broke this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell her the where, who, what or why, but how was okay. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get out of a blast zone fast enough, timing got fucked. Thrown about fifty feet, landed on something harder than me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a game, you and I, but it\u2019s an honest game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Propping himself on an elbow, he traced a line down her sternum to her upper abdomen, stopping just above her mound to curve his fingers over her hip bone. \u201cYou demand honesty from every sub you\u2019ve driven to his knees, every one of them who\u2019s begged you for more. A couple times you\u2019ve been close enough to me at the club I saw it in your eyes, how you feel when he declares his devotion to you, his desire to serve your every need. It\u2019s a game you both understand. At the end of the night, he puts on his clothes, goes back into the world, and that\u2019s that. He knows the emotions he expresses to you in that room don\u2019t translate to anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not at the club.\u201d</p><p>When he lifted his attention to her face, it was clear she would say nothing else, give him no more than that. Leaning in, he brushed his lips over hers, pressing there a long moment before sliding out of the bed. He pulled the covers over her to her waist, making sure she\u2019d be warm. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to head home.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, bending her legs beneath the blankets to link her hands over them. As he moved to the doorway, he remembered his clothes were still by the hot tub. He should have brought them in, because they were probably going to be damp from the humid air. He wondered if she was going to try to stop him. She didn\u2019t. He went down the hallway, past the picture of the young dancer she\u2019d called Nelle, and headed for the steps. Damn it.</p> <p>Going out to the porch, he found his clothes, put them on. As he strapped his watch to his wrist, his mind was rotating. He knew what he wanted, needed. In time, maybe she\u2019d offer that, but he\u2019d forced her hand just now, looking for more of a response. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was the right play, but that was the deal. Certain things couldn\u2019t be a game for him at all, honest or not. Even so, an ache was growing in his chest, suggesting he was about to close a door that he\u2019d be a fool to shut.</p><p>Earlier, she\u2019d trimmed the rose he gave her, put it in a glass on her kitchen table. It made him hurt, seeing that single rose, the swirl of dark-blood and vanilla colors.</p><p>He fished out his keys, held them. Shaking his head, he put them back in his pocket, pivoted and headed back into the house. Things were silent. He passed the couch where they\u2019d had their hot toddies, dozed. The blanket he\u2019d draped over her was still rumpled from where it had folded around her. He took the stairs two at a time, paused where he\u2019d kissed her. During that embrace, he\u2019d thought about her generosity, a thought he knew was at odds with his behavior now.</p><p>Now he went up the rest of the stairs, moved down the hall to the bedroom doorway. She\u2019d moved. She was sitting in a chair by the window, her knees pulled up to her chest and feet curved over the seat edge. She\u2019d donned a robe. Her head rested against the cushion, her fingertips tracing designs on the glass. The window overlooked the driveway and his truck, so she\u2019d been waiting to watch him drive away. She hadn\u2019t intended to come after him. He wasn\u2019t sure how to react to that, but then she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been involved with anyone outside a club, Max. Not since my twenties.\u201d When she turned her gaze to him, he realized she looked tired. She also didn\u2019t look apologetic, but then he wouldn\u2019t have expected that. She lifted her chin. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can give you right now.\u201d</p><p>There was a chair across from the one where she sat, and he took it, leaning forward and propping his elbows on his knees, making a steeple of his fingers as he studied her. She\u2019d left her hair down, and it curved around her face, the dark, hard-to-read eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe picture in the hallway,\u201d he said. \u201cThe girl you called Nelle. That girl is you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Whatever she\u2019d been expecting, it hadn\u2019t been that. He saw the flicker of shock in her gaze, quickly masked, telling him she\u2019d learned to conceal any reactions related to that, but then anger replaced it.</p><p>\u201cIf you think to leverage my emotions by striking at a vulnerable spot, you can go to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Damn it, no.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d brought her legs down and stood, obviously intending to exit the chair and probably the room. He caught her wrist, holding her in place. \u201cThe only reason I brought it up, the only reason, is what you just said. I see things about you, Janet. I notice things. Things I have absolutely no right to know, so if you don\u2019t want to share them, that\u2019s fine. I just wanted to prove that you can trust me. That if this is all new to you, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. We\u2019ll stumble along together, but wherever I can, I\u2019ll make sure the footing is sure for you.\u201d</p><p>She gave his hand a pointed glance, telling him she wanted him to let go. Since she\u2019d said he was her first relationship outside a club, he expected it wouldn\u2019t surprise her that he wasn\u2019t always going to be an obedient lapdog. He tugged her closer, putting his hands on her hips, looking up at her. \u201cLet me do something?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wary look but nodded. He eased her on to his lap, cradling her in his arms as he settled back in the wing-backed chair. She allowed it, though she was stiff. \u201cI wanted to know I was different,\u201d he said. \u201cThat I wasn\u2019t a series of snapshots you delete when you\u2019re done looking at them. This feels different to me, and if it\u2019s not different for you, I needed to know that sooner than later, to minimize the damage to us both.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d As she looked up at him, her hair brushed against his shirt front. \u201cYour delivery and timing sucked though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No argument on that.\u201d</p><p>They sat that way silently for a while. He didn\u2019t feel like she needed him to say anything further, and he\u2019d wait for her cues to see where she wanted to take this next. He hoped it was back to bed, but he accepted that ship may have sailed tonight. For his part, he could make do with this. Just having her willing to be in his arms. The tension in her body seemed to be growing though. He was thinking of a way to alleviate it when she spoke.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d</p><p>He touched the ballerina charm where it rested on her sternum. \u201cFor one thing, you\u2019re both wearing this.\u201d</p><p>She put her fingers over it. \u201cMy mother gave it to me after my first recital. But that\u2019s not how you guessed. I could have loaned out the necklace.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but with a gentle hand, he opened the robe, spreading it to expose her right breast. His target was beyond it, below her armpit. He touched the faint brown mark, a permanent imprint on her fair skin. \u201cIt would be unusual for you and a sibling to have the same birthmark, in the same location. But more than that, when your face softened, right before I was inside you the first time, you became her again.\u201d Tracing the planes of her face, he caressed the sculpted lines. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying your face a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She moistened her lips. \u201cI see that.\u201d Her face did that softening thing then, but she looked away, out the window. Whatever thoughts she was thinking made it harden once again. He adjusted her robe so it was mostly closed, though the neckline framed the curves in an attractive way.</p> <p>\u201cJanelle. That was my name then. The last name\u2019s not important, save that it\u2019s no longer the one I have now. When I was twenty, I was good enough to be in a ballet company, but not good enough to ever break out and be the star. But I had an excellent grasp on technique, and I was good at helping the stronger dancers improve. However, at that point, I still had dreams of being center stage. Like so many women in so many different situations, I ignored the truth and instead believed a man who said he could make my dreams come true.\u201d</p><p>There was no bitterness in her tone, just a matter-of-fact sympathy, as if she viewed herself at that time as a separate person. \u201cHis name was Jorge Mendes. He was in the audience when we performed in Mexico City. To my eyes, he seemed like an important man, with expensive cars and an aura of power an impressionable girl mistook for something real. He flattered me, told me I had an abundance of talent, and if I was willing to stay behind when the company traveled back to the States, he could get me a couple bookings where I would be the headline dancer. It was time for the company to take a summer hiatus, so it made sense, even though friends of mine told me not to do it. I thought they were jealous.\u201d</p><p>Cold fingers touched his vitals. Her words could unlock a part of him that would take him to another memory, one that would pull his mind away when Janet obviously needed him a hundred percent present. So he steeled himself, resolved not to let that happen. This wasn\u2019t Amanda in his arms, not his mother.</p><p>\u201cThe drug cartels run Mexico. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not news to you.\u201d</p><p>Though he shook his head, confirming it, she didn\u2019t register his response. Her gaze was on that window, the raindrops slipping down it. \u201cHe was upper middle management in one of them, I guess. I never saw an organization chart.\u201d Her lip curled. \u201cThe moment the company left Mexico, I became his possession. To his credit, I did dance in a few performances with a substandard company. My classical training made me shine, a swan among the ducks. At first I overlooked it, delighted to be the one soaring across the stage, hearing the crowds gasping at the more dramatic moments. I was at last the prima ballerina.</p><p>\u201cIt only took a few reviews from respected critics for me to realize I hadn\u2019t achieved greatness. I\u2019d simply denied the limits of my talent. When I accepted that, I knew my career would go further as part of my old company than as a prima ballerina in Mexico City. I told Jorge I wanted to leave. My fascination with him was dimming in the light of reality, and I was starting to notice things. I knew by then he wasn\u2019t the kind of businessman he\u2019d told me he was when we met. When I told him I was leaving, that was the first time he beat me.\u201d</p> <p>Max put his lips on her shoulder, brushed it with his jaw. Her skin was cool, and he adjusted the robe so she was more covered. She tilted her head to him, pressing her cheek to his temple. Closing his eyes, he held that connection, but the images she planted in his brain unfurled an old, deadly rage inside him.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do things in half measures. He beat me so severely that first time he broke ribs, but he limited it to what wouldn\u2019t show. I was his little china doll, his ballerina on the music box, and he wanted to show me off. I escaped twice, and he caught me both times. He had people everywhere. The third time, he had to make an example of me, because his men knew I was running. This lowly puta had defied their boss. He used a baseball bat on my face and legs.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn him to hell. Max touched her face, brought her eyes back to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. But you made a valid point. I can trust you.\u201d</p><p>Because of the type of person she was, never saying what she didn\u2019t mean, the impact of the simple statement on him was tremendous.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d He cupped her jaw, ran fingers over it. \u201cWith anything, Janet. Now, tomorrow, forever. No matter what happens with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Matt seems to attract that type of man. Like Arthur and the knights who flocked to his table. Though I think Arthur might be too moderate for Matt.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cYeah. Matt\u2019s more like a savage Celt king. I can see him drinking the blood of his enemies with no problem at all.\u201d</p> <p>He was rewarded with a faint smile, then she returned her attention to the window. \u201cJorge put me back together. Imported a European plastic surgeon, paid to have my face reconstructed. My legs were set and healed, but he left those scars untouched, because he wanted me to have a permanent reminder of who owned me. It ended my dance career, of course. There are rods in both my legs. No shock absorbers.\u201d</p><p>He heard the quaver in her voice, even as she firmed her chin, lifted it. Her hands were gripped together in her lap now, her back rigid where it rested against his arm, as if she\u2019d donned armor against what she was telling him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d touch my face and tell me that he\u2019d re-created me, just like God teaching Lilith to be Eve, obedient to her Adam.\u201d Her lip curled again. \u201cI think it challenged and aroused him as much as it angered him, that he could never get me to submit to him without a fight. Except for the time he used the bat, he always had to tie me up when he beat me, because I fought him so hard.\u201d</p><p>Which was why she didn\u2019t tie her subs down, not so they couldn\u2019t get away. He thought of the night he\u2019d asked her about it, the shadows that rose in her eyes. Murder hazed his vision again.</p><p>\u201cI would never cower from him like the house staff did, but I got smart. Except in private, I became the dutiful show pony, a credit to his household. And then one day I met Matt Kensington.\u201d</p><p>She needed a break after that. She rose from his lap and they went downstairs. This time Max fixed them both a straight whisky in shot glasses from her wet bar. She tossed it back and her eyes didn\u2019t even water, though he knew how the stuff burned a trail.</p><p>\u201cJorge and he didn\u2019t do business together, of course. It was a chance meeting. Jorge was having dinner with his associates, and Matt was at a table nearby. He was so young then, in his twenties like me, but when I first met his eyes, I got caught by that still, raptor look he has. A man in control of things around him. Very different from the illusion of control Jorge had. His was based on a deceptive mix of charm, lies, fear. Matt\u2019s was based on intelligence, a keen grasp of the details and his unfailing sense of right and wrong, moral versus immoral. Concepts he never confuses with legal or illegal.\u201d</p><p>Max felt a vibration on that thread, another thing that connected him and Janet. Matt hadn\u2019t had a hand in that \u201cmoral versus legal\u201d part of Max\u2019s life, but Max knew the K&amp;A CEO was fully aware of it. It hadn\u2019t stopped him from hiring Max as a driver. In fact, it was possible it might have influenced Matt\u2019s hiring decision.</p><p>She pushed the glass toward him. \u201cAnother.\u201d</p><p>He poured it, and she downed it the same way she\u2019d done the first. \u201cAs long as I stayed in his line of sight, Jorge didn\u2019t care if I sat at the table with him and his dealers while they talked business. I could feel Matt watching me when I moved to the bar, drank my cocktail, stared out into the night.</p><p>\u201cAfter the baseball-bat incident, there were a lot of times I kept my mind blank, because to think was to go mad. I was always watching, though, waiting. Jorge thought my increased interest in his life and business was evidence that I\u2019d accepted his ownership, but I knew my next escape attempt had to work. If it didn\u2019t, he\u2019d kill me for sure. At that point, I was ready for that. I would have preferred it to staying with him any longer, but I really didn\u2019t want to give him that satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, stared at Max. \u201cI never gave Jorge any real power over me. Even now, I think of him in a detached way, the way I\u2019d think of a piece of furniture. To give him more than that would give him a piece of that power, and I refuse to do that. He beat me up because he was stronger than me physically, not emotionally. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. When she tapped the glass, he didn\u2019t suggest she slow down. He\u2019d seen things that a whole bottle of whisky wouldn\u2019t even dent, and he had a feeling the worst part of her story was to come, if her desire for the liquid fortification was any indication. Even now, however, her back stayed straight, her hand steady and gaze direct. What would it be like, standing inside Janet\u2019s mind and heart, seeing the tides of emotions she\u2019d learned to mask and rein back to be the formidable woman she was? He\u2019d caught glimpses of them, moments he knew were rare gifts. She had a softer side, but not what he\u2019d call a vulnerable one. The Domme side of her was too overwhelming to permit that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she\u2019d said, she hadn\u2019t given Jorge power over her, a drug dealer who\u2019d nearly beaten her to death. Her will was far beyond a mere physical thing.</p><p>She took a swallow of the whisky, put it down. \u201cWhen Matt came up to the bar to refresh his drink order, he put his business card down in front of him. He was close enough I could see it, and he\u2019d written his cell number on it in large print. He never looked at me, but he spoke. \u2018Memorize it, and if you ever need a friend, call me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhen it was all over, later, I asked him what had made him do that. He said as he watched me that night, he saw certain things in my body language, my expressions, which told him I was in trouble. I was standing on a ledge where I was willing to be free or die, which likely meant I would end up dead. He knew Jorge\u2019s connections, knew better than to speak to me directly or give me something Jorge would find on me later. Matt has that canniness to him, you know.\u201d</p> <p>When Max nodded, confirming it, Janet\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cMatt said he figured if he\u2019d read me wrong, I\u2019d simply see him as a crazy person and forget the number. Or tell my cartel boyfriend this gringo was hitting on me, and they\u2019d dump his body in the trash.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the barstool across from Max, rotated the shot glass in one hand. \u201cMy opportunity came about two months later. There was a war going on between competing cartels. I plotted out every detail, had everything ready. Late one night when Jorge was asleep on the couch, I hit him in the head with a skillet until he stopped moving. Then I took a power drill and drilled out his eyes. Used a butcher knife on the tongue. It took a heavy-duty meat cleaver to sever the head. Fortunately, his cook kept one stored in the pantry.\u201d</p><p>She delivered the words in a flat monotone, but the air vibrated with everything behind them. Max found he had one hand clenched on his knee, the other on his forgotten drink. She lifted blank eyes to him. Those perfect nails tented over the top of her glass, spun it in circles, over and over, like a nervous tic, except all of her had gone so still.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way the competing cartel was dressing their kills. Jorge had found some of his dealers left that way. I didn\u2019t care if they took revenge on the other cartel for what I did, as long as they weren\u2019t hunting me. But when I took the head, something funny was going through my mind, like this absurd knock-knock joke. \u2018What comes back after you cut off its head? Absolutely fucking nothing\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in a decided sort of way, finished the whisky. She shook her head when Max offered to refill it. \u201cI broke up some furniture, cut my wrist to leave blood and tore off a fingernail. I wanted it to look like I\u2019d been kidnapped. If they couldn\u2019t find me, they\u2019d assume I\u2019d been used and killed, or sold on the black market. Another huge insult to Jorge, selling his woman into white slavery.\u201d Her lips curved grimly. \u201cBecause I was so free with him, right?\u201d</p> <p>Max remembered a night he\u2019d slipped into a dingy gasoline restroom, washing gunpowder off his hands as he thought of two weighted bodies, shoved into the river. He hadn\u2019t been thinking of the horror of that, but going back over all the important details. All the brass policed and bullets dug out of the corpses, no ID left on them. Yet he remembered the look in his eyes when he\u2019d glanced up in the mirror. He\u2019d seen that look in Janet\u2019s face, that night in the hospital bathroom. Because of what he himself had done and experienced, he could reconcile the brutal images she was painting with the woman before him now. A human being was capable of incredible, terrible things.</p><p>\u201cI called Matt. I never questioned that was the right thing to do. He really could have been some idiot, living dangerously, flirting with the drug dealer\u2019s girl, but I knew it wasn\u2019t that. He was back in Texas. He asked me if I could get to the border, and I said I could, but I didn\u2019t have a passport, any way to get through. Jorge had locked up my passport, which probably wouldn\u2019t have done me any good anyhow, since the picture had been before my face reconstruction. Matt told me not to worry about that, and set up the time to meet me there. I had the cash I\u2019d taken off Jorge, but I didn\u2019t take anything else that might connect me back to him. I slipped past the guards he kept posted on his grounds\u2014to keep threats out\u2014and stole a car, which I planned to ditch at the border.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhen I arrived at the border, they made me leave the car and come into their office for further questions. I figured I was about to go to a Mexican jail, where I\u2019d be tortured and killed by Jorge\u2019s associates as retribution. Instead, Matt was waiting for me. I assume he bribed whoever needed to be bribed, because he merely thanked the guards as if they were returning an errant, mentally defective relative to him. He took my arm, and I walked with him to the American side. He walked me around to the passenger door of his car, held it open for me.\u201d</p><p>That seemed important to her. She closed her eyes, her fingers stilling on the glass a long moment before she continued. \u201cHe\u2019d brought his own vehicle, no driver. I remember him driving twenty miles without either of us saying a word. I looked at all the empty, flat land around us, nothing significant, but all of it U.S. soil. I looked down at my hands, and saw I still had blood under the nails, staining the cuticles.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until he pulled the car off to the side of the road and put his arms around me that I realized I\u2019d started crying. It took me a couple hours to stop trembling.\u201d She lifted a shoulder. \u201cShock.\u201d</p><p>She rose then. \u201cI want you to go home now, Max.\u201d</p> <p>What the hell? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s not a request. I need the space. You wanted to get a sense of what\u2019s going on between us, what it means to me. You needed some kind of reassurance that you\u2019re different from Thor, or any of the men I\u2019ve dominated at Progeny.\u201d</p><p>He rose as well. \u201cThen don\u2019t fucking treat me like one of them.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he said it, he could have bitten through his tongue. She\u2019d just told him something only one other person knew. But his response wasn\u2019t based on that. It was based on his own demons, the empty face of his mother in his mind, forever beyond his reach. There was no way in hell he could countenance leaving Janet now, not when he hadn\u2019t been there to protect her, irrational as that kind of thinking was.</p><p>But that was obviously what she wanted. She was showing him a window in her soul, then slamming it down on his fingers, shutting him out. It fucked with his mind, twisted in his gut and became something ugly, cutting the intent connection they\u2019d shared.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, remaining still as a statue. Her expression didn\u2019t change, but he could feel a radical shift in the air, as if she\u2019d physically stepped onto a whole different continent.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you do?\u201d he asked. \u201cGive them that vibe that tells them they\u2019ve fucked up, earned your displeasure? It cuts them, slices out their guts and makes them willing to do anything to make it better, right? Don\u2019t work me, Janet. I\u2019m not wired that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not. I\u2019m not like most women you know, Max. When I let down the shields, I need you to stand at a distance for a while, so I\u2019ll be sure you\u2019re not going to rush over the boundaries, attack what I\u2019m revealing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t. But we can\u2019t figure out how to make the different pieces of who we are fit together if you won\u2019t let me close enough to get a good look at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you usually walk into an enemy compound to check things out, or do you survey things at a distance first, moving in closer as you verify the safest approach? The shape of those pieces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see you as an enemy. But maybe that\u2019s how you see me.\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched in her jaw. \u201cNo. But your lack of trust, the way you pulled back earlier, that disappointed me. I do understand trust must be earned, and a lot of this is unfamiliar territory for you. You\u2019re adjusting, but I have to adjust too. We both feel it\u2019s worth it, because neither of us has backed off yet.\u201d</p><p>Now she seemed to be talking to herself more than him, but then she brought her attention back to him. \u201cI need you to trust that I mean what I say. Give me space. Go home. I\u2019ll contact you when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour terms, your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. On that I don\u2019t compromise. I\u2019m sorry. If you can\u2019t accept that, then it\u2019s time to finish this.\u201d</p><p>Wow, just like that. His emotional radar was screwed up here, things spiraling in a wrong direction that he didn\u2019t really understand. He wanted to make it better if he could, but she seemed locked out at all levels, frustrating him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to hold on to all the control? Is it the only way you can feel anything? Can\u2019t you let yourself be a normal person for one minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Being a deviant is what works for me. And until now, that hasn\u2019t seemed to bother you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so the wrong tactic. When she gave him a searing look and began to pivot on her heel, he moved to stand in front of her. This time he didn\u2019t touch her, but he held up a hand. \u201cDamn it, just wait a second. That\u2019s not what I meant. Yeah, being a Domme is real for you, but sometimes it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t want to make you mad by saying that. But earlier tonight, being a Mistress was something you embraced for your own pleasure, your own reasons. It was real. Now you\u2019re using it as a wall, hiding that real part of you. One\u2019s your true face, the other\u2019s a mask. Tell me if I\u2019m wrong, Janet. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he couldn\u2019t even touch her, hug her like he would any other woman when he acted like an ass. She obviously wouldn\u2019t welcome that. All he could do was what she demanded. Which was what the whole Domme thing was about, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Her gaze was frosty, mouth set. \u201cI need you to go,\u201d she said, her voice jagged glass. \u201cNow. Don\u2019t make me say it again.\u201d</p><p>Everything about her body language, her eyes, rejected him. It did cut him deeply, such that he realized exactly why Thor and the others were willing to do whatever was needed to stand within the circle of her approval. Even now, he remembered the warmth of her body, her generosity in the hot tub and in her bed. But he couldn\u2019t take back what he felt was truth. He wasn\u2019t sure what he was seeking from her at this exact moment, but whatever it was, she wasn\u2019t in a giving mood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going. Whatever you decide...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Picking up his keys, he left her there, standing in the middle of her living room.</p><p>He had plenty to keep him busy. He steered clear of \u201cthe tower\u201d for a while, what they called the executive offices. Janet cooperated, choosing to update the scheduling grid online and send text alerts to the affected drivers, including himself. When something needed to be couriered, she delivered it through one of the interns, or he delegated another driver to pick it up from her. He was the boss, after all.</p> <p>Besides that, he had a lot to do outside of work. His visits with Amanda, some time spent with guys at the VA. He helped Dale out at Eddie\u2019s place and with building the swing set. While he was doing that, he didn\u2019t talk about Janet and Dale didn\u2019t push, especially when he realized Max wanted to think the problem through without help.</p><p>She\u2019d told him he was different, because he\u2019d been to her home, engaged her in an environment different from the club. In turn, he\u2019d pulled a Pretty Woman moment, insisting that was just \u201cgeography\u201d. Fuck, he really needed to stay away from late night television.</p><p>On the day she\u2019d killed Jorge, it had taken her a trip to the border and then twenty miles after that to feel everything that she\u2019d done to escape. She\u2019d planned and committed cold-blooded murder. Then, on top of that, she\u2019d butchered the body. Most people couldn\u2019t countenance either act, let alone execute them. He knew up close and personal the difference between taking out a man through the sights of a rifle, and holding him against your body as you cut his throat. Feeling how hard he struggled against his fate, the way the soul slipped away when he lost.</p><p>Janet had shared the terrible story with him, a story he assumed no one but Matt Kensington knew. That had been her additional offering to show him he was different.</p><p>Yet, in the end, she\u2019d shut him down just like she\u2019d shut down one of her subs. That might be true, but he had no doubt he was the asshole here. He\u2019d basically proven what she\u2019d said. He\u2019d rushed the boundaries, taken advantage of those shields being down. It was an unforgivable breach, he was sure. He\u2019d fucked it up at every level, because he\u2019d wanted it too much. He\u2019d stirred the shark-infested waters, but it was his own demons that had made him crash and burn.</p> <p>So that was clear enough. But was it the finish line? Was their pleasurable interlude a short-term thing, now over, just as she\u2019d predicted from the first?</p><p>If she felt that way, he had no doubt she would have made a move toward closure within twenty-four hours. But five days passed, and that didn\u2019t happen. And his feelings toward her didn\u2019t dim in the slightest. If anything, they became even more excruciating.</p><p>The simple truth was he wasn\u2019t done with it, and apparently she wasn\u2019t either.</p><p>We both feel it\u2019s worth it, because neither of us has backed off yet.</p><p>The problem was, he had no course of action. No matter from which angle he considered it, he came up with nothing. It suggested the ball was in her court, and he needed to wait her out. She\u2019d said that as well, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>He was forced to face the fact he had to do something utterly foreign to his nature. Nothing. He had to wait for her.</p> <p>At the end of that first week, he sent her a text. I\u2019m here, Mistress. I\u2019ll wait. And then he hunkered down into his daily schedule, dedicating his energy to not going out of his fucking mind while he waited.</p><p>Janet stood on the nature trail, gazing up through the leaves. She should have worn gloves, because her hands were cold, but if she decided to use the park\u2019s fitness area, she\u2019d get warm. For now she watched the leaves play with one another in pretty patterns above her head, listened to the birds chirping to one another. She kept her mind still. She really was in unfamiliar waters here. It would have made her laugh, but too much was weighing down her heart, churning in her stomach. She wondered if, when Max went into dangerous situations, it was anything like this. Every detail planned, yet if one small piece went awry, all of it could fall apart, such that he had to be ready for any contingency, adapt as the circumstances changed.</p><p>He came down the trail at an impressive clip, given that she knew at this point he\u2019d already run five miles that took him through the marsh, by the river. Though he was in that mental workout zone, she was wearing a red fleece pullover and black exercise leggings. The red caught his attention, as planned. His gaze touched on her, probably expecting she was another insanely early jogger taking a break, then he locked on, recognizing her.</p><p>She\u2019d only seen him at a distance for four weeks, and not that often. They\u2019d both managed it that way, and she\u2019d been impressed by his understanding of the nature of their d\u00e9tente. I\u2019m here, Mistress. I\u2019ll wait. A pause in their chess game, but possibly not an end to it. Game sounded too frivolous, especially given that the word had launched their argument, but battle was too much the other way.</p><p>She watched him slow to a walk. His hair was damp on his neck, and he wore T-shirt and sweats on the body she knew intimately. With his gray eyes fixed on her, the plans she had unraveled. And not just because she couldn\u2019t hold it together in the face of how much she felt, being alone with him again at last.</p><p>Initially, she\u2019d been angry with him, with his typical male, overinflated testosterone reaction to her wanting him to back off. But then, as she was able to settle the waters of her past to a deceptive placid surface again, she\u2019d thought a lot more about the scenario, things they\u2019d both said and felt. And she\u2019d known there was some truth to his words, but beyond that, there\u2019d been an elusive and unexpected weight in her chest, a sense of regret and guilt she couldn\u2019t define.</p><p>The moment his gaze met hers, she couldn\u2019t have said what it was in his expression that helped her find that meaning, but she did. She finally pinpointed what he\u2019d been seeking from her that night. He hadn\u2019t been able to properly express it either, and, as often happened in an argument when emotions were so raw, things had gotten blown out of proportion, truth lost in anger and hurt.</p><p>She\u2019d given him the story, yes, which seemed a huge concession, but if she\u2019d been asked to report it to a police precinct, she would have delivered it the same way. And then she\u2019d asked him to leave. In her world, the men who attracted her were managed, enjoyed, but never truly trusted. While it might have been unreasonable for him to demand that much from her so soon, she realized he hadn\u2019t been looking for all or nothing, just a step in that direction. Something spontaneous, unplanned.</p> <p>From his expression, she thought he might be pleased to see her, but he was wary as well. Maybe he thought she was going to call an end to it here. Was that what he wanted as well? She quelled the despised insecurity. He hadn\u2019t made that move in four weeks. Why would he want it now?</p><p>He stopped, two feet between them, and didn\u2019t say anything. She looked up at him, the rise and fall of his chest as he adjusted to the change in exertion, the dark-blond hair rumpled and spiked. He\u2019d likely rolled out of bed and gone straight into his workout.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early for a woman to be hanging out in the park alone,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>It was the ma\u2019am that did it. As she let out the breath she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been holding, he gave her a faint smile, though his eyes remained serious.</p><p>\u201cI have it on good authority this is where a Navy SEAL does his morning workout,\u201d she managed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried.\u201d Reaching out, not sure what she was doing, she curled her fingers into the fabric of his T-shirt. Then she\u2019d latched on with the other hand as well. As she stepped closer, his hand rose, rested on her hip, drawing her in. She pressed her face to his chest, inhaling his scent. In a heartbeat, she was overcome with a sense of well-being so strong she shuddered with it. She\u2019d missed him. Really, really missed him. And she had no words to convey that. Touch seemed inadequate, or at least she thought it might be, but when his other hand cupped her skull, she reconsidered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sweaty and nasty,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are. I tend to like my men that way.\u201d</p><p>He offered a tight chuckle, then his grip around her grew stronger. \u201cYou\u2019re not here to end things, are you? Because that would be a shitty way to start my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was, but since it doesn\u2019t fit your schedule, I guess I\u2019ll do it another time.\u201d The band in her chest loosened further at that mild comment, which drove away any worry she\u2019d had that he wanted to go that direction. \u201cMax...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Fuck, I\u2019m sorry in so many ways. I pushed too hard, too fast. You got deep inside me, quicker than I expected, and I reacted like a kid having his fucking ice cream cone taken away.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head against him. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t need to say you\u2019re sorry. You followed your gut, and your gut wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d She took a deep breath, tilted her face up to meet his eyes. \u201cSharing that was very difficult for me, but I lock things down when my emotions are involved. I let you in, but I shut you out at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an impressive skill. Very effective. Like being thrown on a bed of railroad spikes and being told you can leave as soon as you can get up.\u201d He sighed, stopping her response to that. \u201cLook, when bad shit happens, and it often does, I\u2019ve learned not to get stuck in that moment; I use it to do better going forward. From what I see of your life, how you live it, you would have made a hell of a SEAL. If you weren\u2019t a girl.\u201d</p><p>She made a face at him but then sobered. \u201cI haven\u2019t been a girl in a long time.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek then, stroking her hair. \u201cThe girl in that picture is still there. I know, because sometimes she makes me feel like I\u2019m seventeen again.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said she\u2019d gotten deep inside him, but he had no idea how words like that could drive him into her soul, far deeper than she\u2019d ever allowed anyone, even when she was na\u00efve and innocent. Of course, the soul tended to lie at the bottom of a well, its depth determined by experiences, loss and regret, things that happened over the course of a lifetime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cupped her jaw, his thumb stroking it as well as her throat. Tipping up her chin, he pressed his lips to hers, taking it deeper, deep as her soul itself. Her body melted into his, leaning into it in a way she\u2019d never remembered herself doing. It was a surrender of sorts, no physical or mental part of her held apart, just a capitulation to that kiss, to the potential of what was between them. As the kiss deepened, she put her hands under his T-shirt, and he jumped like she\u2019d hit him with a Taser.</p><p>\u201cChrist, woman, did you stick your fingers in ice?\u201d He laughed against her mouth and everything became better, such that she chuckled as well. He hadn\u2019t tried to remove her touch, merely reacted to it, and now she spread her fingers out wide, absorbing his warmth through her palms and digits.</p><p>\u201cPoor baby SEAL,\u201d she teased. \u201cDoesn\u2019t like the cold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me. The one thing SEALs avoid is the cold, because of all the times we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I decide to move to Alaska, this relationship is over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo over. Of course, I\u2019ve endured a lot of crappy weather to serve my country, and you\u2019re at least as important as that.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips slid into her hair, caressing the sensitive back of her neck. The sensation spread over her throat, her jaw, sending pleasurable signals to everything below those points. She slid her cold hands from the small of his back into his sweats, tunneling under his boxers to enjoy his muscular ass, which flexed beneath her grip.</p><p>Banding his arm around her waist, he hiked her up his body, still keeping up with that kiss, teasing her lips with his tongue, a nip from his teeth. She curved her legs around his waist and hips and found herself solidly seated on a growing erection. She gripped his broad shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he muttered against her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s all for you, baby. Now. I need you now.\u201d</p><p>In answer, she took the kiss to a more violent level, biting his lip. His mouth opened to her so she could delve deep, taste him. He tangled his hand in her hair, pulling her back just enough to survey their surroundings. Going off trail, he hiked swiftly up an incline. When he went over the rise, they were standing on a slope leading into deeper forest, the ground covered with leaves and moss. They were hidden from the main trail. When he laid her down on that natural bed, she was sure it would leave mud stains on her exercise clothes, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He laid himself down on her and took up where they left off on that kiss. From her way of thinking, he could have stripped off her leggings right then, pushed down his sweats and plunged, since her pussy was already wet, but he gave her this. Jorge had wanted to be on top most of the time, reinforcing his power, so it wasn\u2019t a position that captured her fantasies. Until Max. Rather than feeling suffocated, this felt as natural as the earth beneath her. The earth was penetrated by a tree\u2019s roots, yet the earth was also the thing that kept the tree strong.</p><p>He moved to her throat, then down, unzipping her jacket and cupping her breasts under the stretch yoga top. It had a built-in bra, no padding, so he was able to nuzzle her, let her feel the moist heat of his mouth as he suckled her through the fabric. She moved restlessly against him, wrapping her legs high on his hips again. When she rubbed her needy core against him, he responded by pressing his hardness against it.</p><p>\u201cToo many clothes,\u201d she whispered in his ear. \u201cI want you inside me, Max.\u201d</p><p>He worked his way down her body, impressing her with the way he caught her waistband in his teeth, ran his tongue beneath it, stimulating her further before he pulled the leggings down to her ankles. He left them there, her shoes holding them on as he shifted his body inside that closed triangle, his calves beneath the stretch of her leggings holding her ankles together. He guided her thighs back up around his hips again, so now her shoes, leggings and the limbs they contained rested against the backs of his knees. It was as if her legs were bound, but with him inside that space, she had him captured as well.</p> <p>She was impressed by his cleverness, but they were both in too urgent a state to waste it on words. Putting her hands on his ass again, she pushed the sweats down, thumbs under the boxers, and he helped, getting the cloth past his turgid cock. At the first touch of the heated steel organ against her, she reached between them to close her hands on it.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees above me, Max. I want to see you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t consciously issuing an order, the desperate desire in her voice driving her. She had to look at him. He complied, her thighs widening to give him room to stand up on his knees, his knees pressed against the inside of hers, his cock jutting up. She stroked the shaft, fingernails scraping over the testicle sac, watching all of it respond to her with a convulsive movement.</p><p>\u201cShirt...if you\u2019re not too cold.\u201d</p><p>He removed it, and her gaze coursed over the skulls-and-trident tattoo on his side, then back down that arrow of hair to the groin. His fingers whispered over her thighs, her knees, then they drew back. His hands opened and closed, as if he was warring with something. Her gaze lifted to him at the moment he decided. Lifting his hands, he laced them behind his head, burning gaze fixed on her face. He\u2019d just given her total access to him.</p><p>She swallowed, pushing herself up on her elbows to press her mouth against his hard abdomen, his hipbone. She kept one hand wrapped around him, finger rubbing over the damp slit, grip tightening as she slid up and back down. She could smell that heady scent of semen, male arousal. When she turned her head, tasted him, sucking on just the head, working her tongue around the rim, he let out an oath. His thighs trembled, but he held fast as she moved back to his stomach, let her other hand roam over his chest, down his sides, back to his hip, knuckles brushing the delectable ass again.</p><p>\u201cMarking your territory, Mistress?\u201d he asked in a husky voice.</p><p>He was encouraging her possession, something she hadn\u2019t expected from him. Looking up at him, hands behind his head like that, she knew there was only one answer to give.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flamed hotter in response. She eased herself back to the ground, letting her other set of fingertips trail down his thigh. When she released his cock, she gave him back the same gift. Deliberately, she laid her hands over her head, shooting him a look of raw need and challenge wrapped together.</p><p>\u201cNow you do the same.\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped. One braced him on the ground at her shoulder while the other gripped the base of his cock. He guided himself into her, measured, deliberate, keeping his gaze on her face the whole time. So she knew he was seeing the pleasure that suffused her features, the way she bit her lip, how her hips lifted to his, taking him in deep. Wrapping her legs high on his hips again, she tightened them, drawing him in farther. She got lost in his gray eyes as he settled on her, elbows on either side of her head, and began to pump his hips into her. Slow, steady, a rhythm that she met with her own body. As her arousal built, the lift of her hips became more demanding. And then he really began to thrust hard.</p><p>She let out a groan at the painful pleasure of it. \u201cMax,\u201d she gasped. Mine. Mine. Mine.</p><p>Remarkably, she was already spasming around him. She hadn\u2019t let herself come these four weeks they\u2019d been apart, though in her bed at night her body had burned for him, recalling him there, in the hot tub, on her couch. She\u2019d even fantasized about taking him on the hood of his truck in the parking deck. She\u2019d open his jeans, straddle him as he leaned back against his windshield. His fingers would dig into her hips, eyes hidden behind the sunglasses but jaw rock-hard, reflecting his absorption in their shared lust. Randall\u2019s eyes would have popped out of his head, she was sure.</p><p>Their gazes locked. \u201cI missed you,\u201d he said, the fierce truth of it in his voice.</p><p>She reached up with trembling fingers and he kissed them, bit them when she lingered there, then she curled her hand over his shoulder. The feeling was building higher, hotter. \u201cI missed you too. I won\u2019t do that to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right. I\u2019ll come sleep under your window.\u201d</p><p>The challenge sparked her own. She reared up to capture his mouth as she squeezed down on him, savoring and pleasuring them both. His arm banded around her like steel, his other arm and her stomach muscles the only thing holding them both up, the anchor point in a spinning world. The smell of damp leaves, earth and forest mingled with Max as she prepared to let herself go.</p><p>When she went over that precipice, she managed to make her own demand. \u201cCome for me, Max.\u201d Come for your Mistress. The one who wants to own you.</p><p>She let out a glad cry as he obeyed, every muscle of that fine body beneath her legs and hands hardening, rippling, his face going concentrated and even fiercer. He groaned out his release, hips pistoning strong enough to push her into the earth. She let her head fall back, careless of the dirt and leaves. Cognizant of who else might be in the park, though, she turned her head to his forearm, pressed her mouth against it, her screams vibrating against his flesh.</p><p>As he started to come down, his other hand slipped from her waist, cupped her jaw, strong fingers caressing it as well as her throat as she offered those cries to him. He kept going until she was all done, carrying her through every aftershock until she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever felt so sated. So...loved.</p><p>It was an unexpected but not unwelcome thought. As she finished, she used the pressure of her hands to bring him back down to lie upon her body fully again. He complied, though he held himself with an elbow to keep his full weight off her. They were breathing in tandem, his fingers laced with hers to her right, her other one curled over his back. \u201cSee?\u201d he murmured into her neck. \u201cI told you that you\u2019d like camping.\u201d</p><p>She bit his ear. \u201cThis isn\u2019t camping. I interrupted your workout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you enhanced it. Want to help me finish it? I usually go through the outdoor fitness stations before jogging home.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was still thundering, her limbs loose and body languorous, so as she looked up and saw he was serious, she didn\u2019t know if the energy and virility gave her heart an amusing feminine leap or made her hate him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing. Your legs have to be noodles. Every man has to have a post-coital nap. Women have counted on it for centuries, to give them that precious moment to slip a knife between the ribs of their Viking captor, or an overly ambitious king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s slipping him the knife, sounds like she\u2019s the ambitious one. Also sounds like a really good reason to keep one eye open around a woman.\u201d Max pressed his lips to hers, a long, sweet denouement to ease the loss as he slid out of her, moved back up to his knees. He adjusted his sweats, then moved off her to help her pull her leggings back up to her hips. As he did so, he dropped a kiss here and there. Her knee, her thigh. When he slid an arm around her back to help her to a sitting position, she crooked an arm around his neck as well. He surprised her, lifting her off the ground entirely as he rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI can walk to the fitness station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I haven\u2019t been able to hold you for four weeks. I\u2019m taking advantage.\u201d</p> <p>Well, that definitely caused a feminine leap to her heart.</p><p>It continued as he went through each station to work out his upper body, legs and back. If he was trying to impress her, it worked, but she could tell it wasn\u2019t that. This was a part of his day he took very seriously. He was no longer in the SEALs but he still trained like one. She thought of how he\u2019d driven Savannah through traffic, demonstrating the skills of a man who\u2019d served as personal security for high-risk dignitaries visiting occupied zones. Probably another reason Matt liked having him on staff, since all the drivers had some form of law enforcement or military background. Though it wasn\u2019t a regular job requirement, Max, Wade and some of the others had accompanied the K&amp;A men more than once to do the driving for them when they were scoping out new plant locations in Central America.</p><p>Her radar detected something more to it than just force of habit though. She wondered if he was staying prepared for something specific. The thought was an uneasy one, taking her back to the roof and Matt\u2019s warning that Max had his own demons.</p><p>A mystery to puzzle over and unravel another time. Today, she had no desire to open a new can of worms. It was much more pleasurable to float in a dreamy haze of lust, watching him working out his upper body on the push-up stand, pommel horse, parallel bars and horizontal ladder, then showing off his climbing skills on the integrated fitness station. He finished up with the bounding bars and floating balance system, testing his agility.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you really wanted to impress me, you\u2019d fuck me three more times after doing all this. And still show up for work on time.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed her a grin as he came off the last station. He\u2019d left his shirt off, bless all the gods. She tilted her head back for the kiss, but he gave her that and more. Snaking an arm around her waist, he lifted her off the balance beam and put her up against the tree beside it, one fluid motion. As he pushed his body between her thighs, her still-damp pussy responded to hard male demand, her tissues quivering. His gray eyes got that heated look that suggested they might end up in the leaves again. It was insane.</p><p>\u201cExercise turns you on?\u201d She had to gasp it out, no help for that, though she laid a quelling hand against his chest. \u201cNow I really hate you.\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth on her throat, one hand gripping her ass, fingers sliding along the seam. \u201cJust answering the challenge, Mistress. Wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint you. Christ, I can\u2019t get enough of you. What is that scent you wear?\u201d</p><p>It would have made her laugh if she didn\u2019t feel so swept away by him and bemused by her own reaction to it. \u201cAt the moment, it appears to be male sweat.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her skin. \u201cTrue enough. But something else beneath that. You put it on your thighs as well, because I smell it when I\u2019m eating your cunt. It gets me hard during the day, thinking about what you put between your legs.\u201d</p><p>She tried to get her legs down, slip his hold, but each time she did, he countered it, caught her to him again. It moved them to the grass, and now she tried twisting inside his grip. That just gave him the opportunity to cup her between her legs, send a ripple of pleasure through her core. She was laughing through her frustration and tried to drop out of his hold. He countered that as well but brought their play to a halt, releasing her enough to let her step away, though he held on to her hand.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to break my hold the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone thinks you fall back against your attacker, and instead you fall forward. Look.\u201d</p><p>Now serious, he turned her so her back was against him again. \u201cThis time, lunge forward, not back against me. I outweigh you by nearly a hundred pounds. That\u2019s like shoving back against a tree. If you lunge forward, I have to grab at you, and I\u2019m off balance for a vital second. It might give you the chance to duck under my arms.\u201d</p><p>She did it, found he was right, though of course she was sure he modified his response to show her how it worked. When she did the duck, she balled up her fist, hit him in the side, albeit not too hard, but he had a correction for that too.</p><p>\u201cBetter to hit below the sternum with the heel of your hand. For a girl, tiger claw is better than the full fist.\u201d He took her hand, curled it so the knuckles pointed out, fingertips pressed to the top of her palm. Running his finger over the knuckles, he had her do the same with her free hand. \u201cSee how hard and sharp that is? You get that on either side of his windpipe, or hit his temple, you\u2019ve really landed a blow. Plus, those beautiful nails of yours left some great marks on my back, but they make it hard to form a tight fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me the marks,\u201d she demanded, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou were ogling me close enough to see them, Mistress. You haven\u2019t seen me in four weeks. They\u2019ve faded. You\u2019ll have to give me new ones.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at the ogling comment, but he dropped a kiss on her knuckles, his tongue teasing the crease between two of them. He also wasn\u2019t done with his lesson. \u201cYour best shot is a kick that takes out someone\u2019s knee. Or if you can get your hands on the back of his neck, pull him down, put a knee in his diaphragm. Women have much more strength in their legs. Even the average guy has two-thirds more upper body strength than you do, so you play on your strengths. You should take some Tae Kwan Do. You\u2019d be good at it. You already have the confidence part down, and that\u2019s the hardest part for a woman.\u201d</p><p>Her brow lifted. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not insulting women. When it comes to fight or flight instincts, men are more socially conditioned to fight, with women conditioned to flight. Which makes sense if you think about it, because women usually have the kids. They run to get children out of the way while men hold the line to give them time to do that.\u201d</p><p>Then he rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay, let me correct that. Men used to be more socially conditioned to fight. Now they\u2019re momma\u2019s boys who play non-competitive sports and duck the ball at baseball games so it hits their girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>As she smirked and shook her head at him, he continued. \u201cAnyhow, the thing most women have a hard time doing in Tae Kwon Do is standing toe to toe to spar with someone, accepting and giving blows. But learning that skill is vital, because when it comes to some scumbag chasing you, nothing\u2019s harder than to stop and wait for them to come at you. However, if you\u2019re at the end of a blind alley, that\u2019s all you can do.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face, bringing her eyes back up to him, \u201cFrom what you told me about Mexico, I think you\u2019ve learned that. You don\u2019t run, Mistress. That\u2019s why I said you\u2019d make a hell of a SEAL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a girl,\u201d she added, more moved than she wanted to reveal.</p><p>\u201cFor a girl,\u201d he agreed. He dodged her attempt at the tiger claw. Chuckling, he caught her to him, but when he did, he sobered, hands cupping her face so he could press his forehead to hers.</p><p>\u201cWe good now? Because I don\u2019t want to go through four weeks like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise. You\u2019re my first relationship outside those club doors, Max. Sometimes I need space to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have at least sent flowers. A card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What were you saying about momma\u2019s boys?\u201d Laughing, she broke free and dodged around the balance beam, letting him chase her down and catch her at the horizontal ladder. He pressed her against it, kissing her deep, freeing her hair so it rippled down her back, tangled around them both.</p><p>\u201cWill you come visit my sister with me this week? I\u2019d like for her to meet you, if she\u2019s up to it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, studied him. His expression said he wasn\u2019t sure what had made him go down that road at this exact moment, but she had a distinct feeling he\u2019d been thinking about offering her the invitation for a while. And that made her feel a variety of ways, not unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>All in all, it was a perfect morning.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>They\u2019d showered at his place, which he\u2019d warned her wasn\u2019t much more than a hole in the wall, but the small size of the shower had proven to be a benefit beyond measure. For one thing, he knocked another pin out of the challenge she\u2019d issued about impressing her. He\u2019d taken her up against the wall, driving them both to orgasm. The water tattooed against her face, her throat and against his back where her hands gripped him. Within only a few moments, the shower had echoed with her cries, his guttural sounds of release.</p><p>Afterward, while he was occupied in the kitchen, pulling them together an omelet, he encouraged her to look around. He was right. His house was no more than a box divided into four rooms. The neighborhood was close to Dana\u2019s church, so it wasn\u2019t the safest area of NOLA.</p><p>It was military neat, such that she considered bouncing a quarter off the smooth bedding. There were few personal items in the house. Given how likely robbery was in this neighborhood, that might explain it, but he didn\u2019t even have an old television. Just a radio, an assortment of old paperbacks on a shelf, his toiletry items and clothes. The suits he wore for more formal assignments with K&amp;A appeared to be the most expensive things in the house. That and the gun safe bolted to a central support beam in the bedroom wall. Standing in his closet, she ran her fingertips down the sleeve of one dress shirt. There was a precise inch of space between each garment, all pressed and clean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max, you\u2019re a little scary. Turning to the shelf behind her that held a small assortment of dress shoes and two pairs of running shoes, she found a picture propped up behind them. His mother and sister obviously. They were laughing, at some kind of birthday party. His mother had dark eyes and hair. His sister had the dark hair, but Max\u2019s gray eyes. The dark-blond hair and impressive size must have come from his father, but there was no picture of him.</p><p>He\u2019d talked about how intoxicating her scent was, but she felt like if she slept anywhere in this house, it would be here, where she could inhale the various scents that were all him. Of course, if he was in that bed, that was where she could inhale the drug direct from the source. She thought about waking him in the morning by putting her lips around his cock, a slow, leisurely, dragging suck up the hard length. He\u2019d wake to find his hands tied loosely to the headboard with her robe tie, and she\u2019d bring him to climax that way.</p><p>Of course, she suspected he was a very light sleeper, so more likely she\u2019d order him to put his hands above his head and do as she pleased while he watched her with those heavy-lidded gray eyes. His fingers would clench in self-imposed restraint, body bowing up to her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cIn here stealing or snooping?\u201d He spoke behind her.</p><p>\u201cI was told I could look around. You didn\u2019t put any limits on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Two steps to cross the room and he put his arms around her waist. He drew her back against him to nuzzle her throat. He was bare-chested, wearing only a pair of flannel shorts. His skin was still damp from the shower, hair scented with the fragrant shampoo. \u201cBreakfast is ready. You smell like my soap. I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a picture of your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He left before Amanda was even in school. Mom did it all, so he didn\u2019t earn a place on my shelf. A guy that cuts out on his family like that isn\u2019t a father. He\u2019s a sperm donor.\u201d</p> <p>It was a trait she liked about Max, and one they shared. There was no self-pity in the flat statement, nothing to suggest he nursed the specter of an abandoned kid who wished daddy would care more. If the incident defined him at all, it was likely in making sure he was the antithesis of what his father had been.</p><p>He also made a good omelet. Returning to his kitchen, she sat at his little table, which she expected had been pulled off someone\u2019s curbside trash and repainted. There was a crack through the middle that had been caulked and sanded before the paint was put down. \u201cYou know, I could talk to Matt about your salary. If this is the best you can afford, he deserves to be horsewhipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get paid well enough, as I\u2019m sure you already know. This just suits me. I don\u2019t spend much time here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re usually at work, or apparently doing an insane fitness regimen. What demons are chasing you, Max?\u201d</p><p>He kept his eyes on his plate, didn\u2019t answer. Reaching across the table, she touched his face. When he caught her wrist, she didn\u2019t withdraw, just met his gaze. \u201cI asked you a question, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any demons chasing me.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him. \u201cNo. That\u2019s true. You\u2019re the one doing the chasing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The dangerous flicker in his gaze confirmed it, but he merely squeezed her wrist and let her go to scrape up another bite. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done eating, I\u2019ll give you a ride to your place, make sure you get to work on time. Don\u2019t want Matt chewing your ass for being late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that brave. As many times as I\u2019ve stayed past midnight or worked from home to make sure they have what they need the next day, I\u2019d like to see him try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d like to watch that. Bet it would make a great YouTube video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d She folded her hands in her lap, stared him down. \u201cAfter what I shared with you four weeks ago, you\u2019re really going to dodge this? Quid pro quo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s emotional blackmail. And in all fairness, you put me through hell these past four weeks. So I\u2019d say slate\u2019s balanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But you\u2019ve given me a bad feeling, and I don\u2019t like it. You don\u2019t work out like you\u2019re addicted to exercise. You work out like you\u2019re staying ready for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be a part of that.\u201d The set to his jaw said the topic wasn\u2019t negotiable. He sat back in the chair, wiping his mouth with a napkin. \u201cWhen it\u2019s done, it will be done, and I\u2019ll never revisit it again.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head at her look. \u201cI\u2019m not shutting you out, Janet. I\u2019m trained in OPSEC, operations security. The demon I\u2019m chasing, I view it the same as I viewed any mission I took with the SEALs. I don\u2019t divulge any information about it, because it\u2019s classified, and it\u2019s going to stay that way, to protect everyone around me as much as the mission. It\u2019s like when a SEAL is married. It\u2019s just separate from what he is with his wife. She has to figure that out and accept that to accept being with him. It\u2019s not an ultimatum or a fucked-up power play, I swear. It\u2019s just the way things in my world work. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cNot an easy thing for a woman used to control to accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an easy thing for anyone to accept from someone they love,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why SEALs have an eighty percent divorce rate.\u201d Then, as if realizing how the statement might be taken, he shifted in the chair. \u201cNot that I\u2019m saying that you love me, or have given marriage any thought...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as she lifted a brow, her lips quirking. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re just sitting there holding the shovel, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s much more fun to watch you dig the hole with your bare hands.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, picked up her empty plate and dumped them both in the sink. For the next few moments, she watched him efficiently wash and rinse, stacking their plates and cups neatly in the dish drainer. Then he dried out the sink with a towel, polishing the faucet.</p><p>God, she was in trouble if just watching the man do dishes could make something in her stomach yearn, her heart soften. Rising, she slipped her arms around him, pressing herself against his back. She didn\u2019t say anything, just held him, and he put the towel aside, closing his hand over her linked fingers.</p><p>\u201cSomething is happening with us, Max. Today was a breakthrough moment, and we both see it. If you agree this isn\u2019t a casual thing for either of us, and you believe not only in being prepared, but in preparing those around you, then it needs to be talked about.\u201d</p><p>She had him there, because tension thrummed through his muscles. She rose on her toes to put her lips against the back of his neck, then slipped down again, still holding him to her.</p><p>\u201cI think there is a difference between chasing a demon \u2018down range\u2019 and chasing one in your own backyard. It might require a different level of disclosure at some point. If you get hurt, and I was close enough to stop it from happening, I\u2019m going to be extremely angry with you. I gave you a sign of my trust four weeks ago. I didn\u2019t do it well, but I did it. Can you give me something?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, the broad chest lifting and falling beneath her touch. He turned in her arm span, putting his hands on her hips and leaning back against the counter, stretching his legs out on either side of her. \u201cMy mother was killed as an example to those in the neighborhood who stood up to the gangs, Janet. She was beaten to death. My sister...they raped and then beat her as well, only she lived. In a way. She had brain damage, part of it psychological, a lot of it physical. All of it apparently permanent. While I was away on a mission to keep our world safe, they weren\u2019t safe. Not even close. If you\u2019ve been doing your SEAL research, you saw the movie where they said that a SEAL is always trying to get home, that home\u2019s the whole point of it. But my home was gone when I came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the men who did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were three of them. Two are no longer an issue. The ringleader went underground.\u201d</p><p>She studied his face, the calm stillness of his gray eyes, the set of his jaw. The same way he\u2019d understood never to use her real name, she knew not to speak aloud the possibility of what had happened to those two.</p><p>\u201cI expect the police will eventually find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cold file at the bottom of a stack of files, because he left the country. Went underground, lost in the network of Mexican cartels. And even if they do luck out and find him, I know how it works. His mommy won\u2019t have held him enough, he was poor and misunderstood, it\u2019s racial profiling...whatever bullshit they want to concoct to excuse his actions. There\u2019s right and wrong, and there\u2019s the law. Sometimes they agree, but a lot of days they don\u2019t. You know that as well as anyone.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she did. She touched his face. \u201cThere\u2019s this peculiar thing that happens, Max, when a Domme gets attached to a sub. She considers him hers. Her property, and she expects her property to take very good care of himself.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid up her back. He pressed her close as he wound his hand in her hair, clipped back in a tail now so when he caressed the strands, he tilted her head back, his lips coming so close to hers they hovered an inch apart when he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the sub? What if he considers her his as well? Does that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time. Though some are more blatant about it than others.\u201d She liked the strength of his arms, the determination in his expression. She wanted everything about him, even the things they\u2019d just discussed that disturbed her. They were all part of who he was. \u201cSo take me to work, and promise me when I\u2019m not around to do it, you\u2019ll guard that fine ass of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like my fine ass is yours, not mine. Mistress.\u201d He spoke the last word against her lips. The way it vibrated through her body told her, amazingly enough, he was going to prove he was more than capable of taking her once more before they headed to work.</p><p>In some ways, the man truly was a god. But in some very harrowing ways, he was all too mortal and fragile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were physical repercussions to doing all that on a work day, but she knew adrenaline could carry her through until quitting time. What she hadn\u2019t expected was how thoughts of the past several hours could utterly destroy her focus. Her skin bloomed with heat whenever she thought of him, her heart rate elevating like a tiny mouse scurrying up her chest wall. She\u2019d laugh at herself about it, but there was a poignant ache in that same vicinity. She\u2019d started down a path from which she couldn\u2019t return. She was falling for him, and she was pretty sure he felt the same way.</p><p>Her mind kept revisiting the morning in delicious detail. That first touch, curling her fingers in his shirt, moving into his embrace, the two of them simply holding one another. Max\u2019s smile. Him calling her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d in that slow, sexy way. How he\u2019d lifted her up so effortlessly against the shower wall, his body flexing inside the clamp of her arms and legs, the powerful urgency in his expression. The unsettling issue of him pursuing the last man responsible for his mother\u2019s death.</p><p>She\u2019d been in a situation where she couldn\u2019t rely on the police to save her from a violent criminal, and she\u2019d employed macabre measures to handle it. She couldn\u2019t throw stones. Beyond that, she worked for a man who clearly felt the way Max did. If anyone ever harmed Savannah or Angelica, Janet had no doubt the last thought on Matt Kensington\u2019s mind would be calling the police. The perpetrator would die wishing that the police had had time to get to him before Matt had. And every man of his executive team would help him, because they shared that same code.</p> <p>\u201cJanet, can you read back that last point?\u201d</p><p>Speak of the devil. She shook herself out of her thoughts to find Matt gazing at her from the head of the boardroom table. Though his expression was bland, she sensed something quivering beneath the surface. Amusement? Whatever it was, Peter, Jon, Ben and Lucas seemed to have a dose of it as well, because their body language and expressions were almost identical to Matt\u2019s.</p><p>She glanced down at her shorthand. \u201cProduction in Costa Rica is up fifty percent. Peter anticipates that trend to continue while handling the Porter account, justifying the equipment upgrade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI win,\u201d Ben pronounced. He stretched across the table, collecting the five poker chips that had appeared in the center of the table as if by magic. As he pocketed them, he gave Lucas a grin. \u201cYou were close, but I hit it dead on. She tuned us out four bullet points ago.\u201d</p><p>The K&amp;A lawyer glanced over at her, his green eyes twinkling. \u201cYou completely missed our plans to hire tranny prostitutes for the Johnson reception.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the policy change that requires all female employees to wear string bikinis whenever the predicted high is over eighty,\u201d Peter put in helpfully.</p><p>An unprecedented flush climbed up her cheeks. \u201cI apologize,\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cI\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cDid I miss any action points? Real ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We were generally discussing the direction for South America, but it was more brainstorming than anything.\u201d Jon offered the information kindly, which was almost worse than Ben\u2019s teasing. He studied her with his serious midnight-blue eyes, enhanced by the fall of dark, silken hair around his sculpted face. \u201cNothing concrete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, sir,\u201d she repeated to Matt, but she directed her next words to all of them. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Matt nodded. Straightening, she put her pen to paper. \u201cNow, how many tranny prostitutes will you need?\u201d</p><p>The men chuckled, easing her embarrassment, though she felt Matt\u2019s scrutiny lingering. A few minutes later, they concluded the meeting. As the other men rose, heading out of the boardroom to start their respective schedules, she wasn\u2019t surprised to see Matt motion to her to stay.</p> <p>Ben brought her a napkin that held three mini-muffins and a cup of coffee. Since she never ate during the monthly staff meeting, the men always saved her three of the muffins that Ben baked himself. She saw the chocolate chip, blueberry and raspberry flavors she preferred, while Ben put down a fresh black coffee next to it.</p><p>Giving her a nod, he added, \u201cGo with a baker\u2019s dozen on those prostitutes. It\u2019ll take that many to give Johnson\u2019s attorney an apoplexy, and I\u2019m looking for a full-on drop-dead stroke so he\u2019s no longer a thorn in my ass. See if you can get us a group discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work on that,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He gave her a wink. When he left, he closed the door after him, so she and Matt were alone. Rising, she moved to the head of the table, taking a seat at Matt\u2019s right. It wasn\u2019t unusual for him to have her stay behind to dictate additional notes or correspondence, but she knew that wasn\u2019t the case today. She folded her hands in her lap. \u201cI am sorry, Matt. I know I\u2019m distracted today.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, his shoe braced on the table leg beneath to rock him on the chair\u2019s axis, giving his legs more room. \u201cJanet, you could take a nap through every staff meeting we have for the next five years, and only then would it balance out all the times you\u2019ve been right on top of everything we need, right when we need it. I\u2019d be a poor boss to snap at you for taking fifteen minutes. But I know you well enough I\u2019m going to ask. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. She really didn\u2019t know how to answer that question, and Matt Kensington was not the type to take a generic \u201cfine\u201d. \u201cHow do I seem?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>Very few things mattered to her as much as how she presented herself when she was representing K&amp;A and Matt\u2019s interests. If she was in uncharted territory, she trusted Matt to give her an evaluation, direct and to the point. He didn\u2019t disappoint, but it still startled her to hear it said aloud so baldly.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a woman falling in love. Happy, anxious, thoughtful. And you have a stubble burn on your lovely jaw. I threatened to skin Ben alive if he brought it up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She thought she\u2019d covered that with enough concealer, but apparently she needed clown makeup with these men. She wanted to be horrified, but she\u2019d known them too long...especially Matt. \u201cI told him. About Mexico.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flickered. \u201cHe won\u2019t abuse your trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Else I wouldn\u2019t have told him. I\u2019ve also learned that he and I have some things in common. Only that chapter in his life, unlike mine, isn\u2019t yet closed.\u201d</p><p>Not many people could read Matt Kensington, and even she had difficulty at times, but this time she caught it. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>Matt nodded. His thigh muscles flexed as he rocked the chair back, his fingers tapping the table surface in a meditative fashion. \u201cI do. I wish it was closed, that he would close it, but I also understand enough I can\u2019t stand in his way. He won\u2019t allow me or anyone else here to help him with it. SEALs share a very close bond. His teammates helped with...the first phase, but he\u2019s kept them limited to intel, making it clear they have other priorities he expects them to put first. They\u2019ve had to be satisfied with that, which means not satisfied at all, but it is what it is. He\u2019s one of the most quietly stubborn and unshakably honorable men I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Quietly stubborn and unshakably honorable. The description fit Max well. There was no flash to him, no sense that he ever had to be the center of attention, and yet he commanded confidence, a sense of safety, with the strength of his presence. It was that steadiness that drew her, that perhaps called to something in her she\u2019d always sought, a gift for herself. And Max was offering it to her fully, making it irresistible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never contemplated a long-term relationship with a man who\u2019s not a sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever contemplated a long-term relationship with one who is.\u201d Matt tapped her hand, winning her smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting for the right combination. You\u2019d never settle for anything less than everything you want, and women are so intuitive, they often don\u2019t know what that is until they feel it, deep in the heart and soul. The day you and Max brought Savannah to the hospital and I thanked him...there are some things about that day that passed in a blur, but others that stand out in sharp relief.\u201d</p><p>He shifted to an upright position again, lacing his fingers on the table and leveling his hawklike gaze at her. \u201cWhen I walked back up the hall, I saw you, watching us. Watching Max. It wasn\u2019t the first thing on my mind, but when I thought about it later, I knew something was going to happen between you. You\u2019ve been looking for a man all your life who matches your strength, Janet. One who understands your passion, your occasional savagery and glorious darkness, and your tremendous capacity for love. Most importantly, you\u2019ve been looking for a man who is not deeply terrified of you. That number is few.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled at that. Matt smiled. When he rose, a subtle hint their t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate was over, she gathered her tablet and cup of coffee. Matt picked up the napkin of tiny muffins in his large hand, handling them like a bird\u2019s nest as he followed her. He deposited them on her desk, but before he turned toward his office, he touched her hand once more, drawing her gaze to his serious face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve earned a great deal of vacation and personal days in the years you\u2019ve worked for me and K&amp;A, Janet. And Max pretty much lives on the clock. If either of you wants to take some time off these next few weeks, I will support that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he and I want to take the same days off?\u201d</p><p>His eyes twinkled, appreciating her. \u201cWiseass. Call Rosalind and have her on standby. She always appreciates the extra money, and she knows your job well enough to cover things adequately for a day here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus she\u2019s not terrified of you.\u201d Janet tucked her tongue in her cheek. \u201cAlso a very small number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to work on that. She could spread the word that I don\u2019t actually decapitate incompetent employees in my office. I\u2019d have to sacrifice one or two to debunk the rumor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you would ever hire an incompetent employee,\u201d Janet scoffed. \u201cBut if you decide to sacrifice Ben to prove the point, I\u2019ll pay for the extra roll of plastic to keep the blood off the carpet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d told Max she\u2019d go visit his sister with him Wednesday afternoon. Just to prove she had some willpower, for the next two days she didn\u2019t go home with him or invite him to do the same, though he sent her some fairly provocative and suggestive texts. When she responded with a threat to sic Human Resources on him, he started sending her lines of poetry. Everything from e. e. cummings to Edgar Allan Poe. She responded he was going to have to do better than steal one-liners from a Best of the Poet Masters desk calendar.</p><p>You\u2019re a tough crowd. Take a break this afternoon. I\u2019ll give you a foot massage.</p><p>Maybe.</p> <p>But at two p.m., she decided to do just that. The moment she saw him stretched out on his truck in that sexy, deceptively somnolent pose, arms crossed over the broad chest, long thighs and groin accentuated by the crossing of his ankles, she thought visiting him on break might become like a crack habit to her. As she crossed the parking lot, he sat up and slid off the hood, meeting her halfway. She was carrying a meatball sandwich left over from a lunch meeting and a napkin full of cookies, both of which she extended to him. \u201cI thought you might enjoy these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you having?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, enjoying him. \u201cI had my lunch in the meeting, but I expect you to share at least one of those chocolate chip cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure our relationship has progressed that far.\u201d</p><p>Giving her a grin, he set the food inside the front seat of the truck, then guided her around to the truck bed. Intrigued, she saw he already had the tailgate down and the thick quilt folded there as a cushion. He put his hands to her waist and lifted her on to it, the same way he\u2019d done the day this had all started. Only this time she kept her hands on his shoulders, letting her fingers whisper over his neck, curl in his T-shirt, bringing him closer. The skirt she was wearing was short enough she could spread her knees and bring him inside their span. He put his hands on her waist, drawing her against him so core met core. The kiss was hot, deep, and kept them both holding to one another, even when he finally drew back with a regretful look.</p> <p>\u201cMore than that, and I\u2019ll compromise your reputation on the security cameras. They\u2019re only catching our head and shoulders in the corner of the screen, but even so...\u201d</p><p>His eyes were sparkling though, aware of the significance of her encouraging the act where it would quickly become public news they were seeing one another. \u201cSo this is no longer bound by OPSEC?\u201d</p><p>She punched his shoulder. \u201cUnless you tease me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStopping the teasing immediately, ma\u2019am. At least that kind.\u201d He amused her by pinching the hem of her skirt on either side and working it back down her thighs. It restored her modesty for the grainy resolution of the security feed, if the camera could see her legs. From what he\u2019d said, she suspected not. She noticed his truck was at a different angle and realized he\u2019d likely checked on the scope of the video camera in this corner of the parking deck. A wave of pleasure washed through her, thinking of him protecting her privacy that way. It was exactly the type of thing he\u2019d do.</p><p>Then he turned his attention to her feet.</p><p>Apparently, there were reasons other than the camera angle that had him placing her on the tailgate instead of the hood. More pleasant sensations swirled through her chest and lower abdomen as he dropped to one knee. He glanced up at her as he did it, making clear it was deliberate. He removed her shoes, setting them neatly on the tailgate next to her before clasping her stocking-covered feet in his magical hands. As he began to rub her arches, working her toes between his strong fingers, massaging her ankles, she was hard-pressed not to moan like she did during sex. She struggled for something to distract herself.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know Matt gave us his blessing. Not that I need his blessing for anything I do, but he did. He told me I could trust you, and that you are one of the most honorable men he knows.\u201d</p><p>Max stopped at that, looking up. \u201cHis opinion carries a great deal of weight with me,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut he didn\u2019t tell me anything I didn\u2019t already suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been...\u201d Max lifted a shoulder, then looked down at her feet, his fingers tightening on them. \u201cI trust him.\u201d</p><p>She knew he couldn\u2019t give a greater compliment to another man, and she made a note to share that with Matt sometime, return the favor.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t say anything for the next few moments. She figured he was focused on her feet, trying to inspire an orgasm through her arches. He was pretty damn close to succeeding, enough that if she ever saw him with his hands on another woman\u2019s feet she\u2019d probably shoot him for infidelity.</p><p>Wow. Getting a little possessive there, girl.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said slowly, keeping his eyes on his task, \u201cI earned a punishment that day, when you told me not to come until you said so. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Her gaze coursed over the strands of his dark-blond hair, the angle of his face she could see. She could almost hear the gears turning in his mind, the decisions being made. That coil in her lower belly became even sweeter.</p> <p>\u201cSo I was thinking that maybe it...the punishment, could clear a few things up. If I joined you at the club this weekend. As your guest.\u201d He cleared his throat, lifted his face to her. \u201cAs yours.\u201d</p><p>She prided herself on being able to anticipate a man, enjoyed the pleasure of being a step ahead, but he\u2019d taken her by surprise on that one. As a Domme, she was intuitive enough to recognize a situation where a sub was pushing himself where he didn\u2019t really want to go, just to please a Domme. The signals for a non-sub doing it would be similar, but she didn\u2019t see that in his face. The reasoning became clearer as he put his hand on her knee, fingers toying with the hem of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cI trust you, Janet. I not only want to prove it, I want you to believe it.\u201d His gray eyes held hers. \u201cIt\u2019s like me going to the ballet class with you. I\u2019m not a dancer, but you included me in it, because it was something important to you, a passion. You didn\u2019t leave me on the sidelines as a spectator either. You helped me understand the steps, let me lift you, even knowing I\u2019m not going to be leaping around in tights. The way you brought me into it like that...something in me responded to your love of it. I want to have the experience of sharing this other part of you the same way. I trust you to know what I am and what I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>As she considered that, his fingers curled on her leg. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like foreplay,\u201d he added. \u201cWomen always need more of it than men, but we like what happens to you when we\u2019re doing it with you. That gives us an incentive to keep doing it.\u201d</p><p>Only to a man who understands the rewards of generosity of spirit, she thought. Matt had essentially told her she was a different kind of Mistress, that she\u2019d been looking for a rare combination in a prolonged relationship. Max had said it more directly. She didn\u2019t need him to be her typical sub. Just hers.</p><p>\u201cAll right. How about Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>He considered that. \u201cCan you do Friday? I\u2019m supposed to fix a friend\u2019s plumbing and eat pizza with her Saturday.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a jealous bone in her body, but suddenly her entire skeletal system turned green. \u201cHer?\u201d she asked, deceptively mild.</p><p>Rising to his feet, Max cupped her face and kissed her again, making it last even longer, to the point she hoped he was right about those cameras and slid both hands to his ass, gripping hard and pressing him closer against her. He responded with a growl and cinched his arm around her waist so his thick erection was against her abdomen.</p><p>How was it that they\u2019d had sex multiple times this morning, and she wanted more? Of course, he obviously felt the same way.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s married to a SEAL buddy,\u201d he said, his voice not entirely steady when he lifted his head. \u201cWe watch after each other\u2019s families. You can come with me if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s in Houston, so I\u2019ll probably stay overnight. I bet Gayle would love to meet you. I just didn\u2019t think to invite you because you seem to like skipping a day or two between our meets. You\u2019re seeing my sister Wednesday, and then if we\u2019re doing Friday... I figured it might be more than you want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the flip side, if I see you three times in the same week, I can get you out of my system, cast you aside. Then I can move on to the next dime-a-dozen, bounce-a-quarter-off-his-ass honorable man with special ops military training and a sex god\u2019s stamina.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cStroking my ego?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust telling you the standards I expect you to maintain,\u201d she said loftily.</p><p>From his expression, she could tell he understood the significance of her agreement. Not only was she seeing him three times in the same week, she was agreeing to meet people he considered his family\u2014both blood and chosen. And speaking of quid pro quo, in that same week he would be submitting to her, in a formal club environment.</p><p>It was an exchange of worlds, to see how they did in both. Maybe it was a little much all at once, but to be honest, Matt was right. She was falling in love, and like any woman in love, in the first throes of that breathless passion and fascination, she wanted to be with him every minute. The possessive grasp of his hands, the look in his eyes, the demand of the lips he put back on hers now, told her he had the same overwhelming desire.</p><p>So fuck it. Go big or go home. And she didn\u2019t want to go home unless Max was with her.</p><p>Amanda Ackerman was a permanent resident at a private, top-of-the-line psychiatric home. Located on the outskirts of New Orleans, the main building of the property was an old plantation with graceful pillars and a verandah. The grounds had extensive gardens, a pond and peaceful nature trails. Brick annex buildings housed the medical facilities, so that such ugly necessities didn\u2019t intrude on the living quarters. In the main house, the thirty permanent residents had their own rooms and were watched over by an ample full-time staff. There were several solariums, an indoor and outdoor pool, a recreation area and more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another annex was being built. As they passed it, Janet read the construction sign. Future Site of the Clinical Neurological Studies Center. Beneath that, she noticed the building would be dedicated to Angelica Kensington. It confirmed a couple things for her. One, Matt and Savannah Kensington deserved every blessing they received in their lives, precisely because they never forgot how blessed they were. Two, Matt had probably used his not-insignificant negotiating skills to convince Max to let him help get his sister into the facility. While military benefits could be good, she suspected they were not this good.</p><p>Max was not the type to accept charity, but she already knew he\u2019d swallow an ocean of pride to give his sister the best of all things. Just as she knew Matt would never hold it over his head to influence Max in any way. The people who were loyal to Matt were loyal because of the man himself, not because of what they owed him. She knew that firsthand, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>When they arrived in the lobby, the nurse told Max his sister was in the west garden. As they moved in that direction, Max squeezed Janet\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you want to have a seat on a bench when we get out there, I\u2019ll bring her over to introduce you, if she seems in the right state for it. If she\u2019s not, I\u2019ll give you a signal, and you can go do whatever you\u2019d like while we visit. I hate to do that to you, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou already explained this to me three times, Max,\u201d Janet said with gentle reproof. \u201cI completely understand. If things aren\u2019t right, I\u2019ll just be another person sitting in the garden, one she doesn\u2019t have to meet. I doubt I\u2019ll get restless watching you two together, but if I do, there are plenty of walking trails. Plus I have my tablet, so I can catch up on my email. Don\u2019t you dare think of rushing your visit on my account.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, leaned down and brushed her lips with his. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid that I\u2019m nervous about this. I want her to like you, even knowing that\u2019s nothing that I can control, and it doesn\u2019t have any significance if she doesn\u2019t, because of how she is. Mother Teresa could walk in there and Amanda might react to her like Jeffrey Dahmer, because her eyes are the wrong color, or she has an age spot on her hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how she reacts to me, it will be okay.\u201d Janet reached up, touched his face. \u201cI will love her.\u201d Because I\u2019m pretty sure I love you.</p><p>He held her gaze as if she\u2019d said the words out loud. Lifting her hands, he pressed his mouth to them. Then he gave them one more squeeze and stepped out the door.</p><p>After he was about ten paces down the garden path, Janet slipped out as well. She picked a bench set on a concrete pad encircled by a lovely rainbow of flowers and sculpted dwarf shrubs. As she settled, she watched him move toward a young woman in a blue dress, her dark hair cut to her shoulders. When she turned, Janet saw the curious vacancy in the gray eyes turn to a different kind of light. The way she walked toward Max, jerky and somewhat unbalanced when she got too fast, the listlessness of her left arm, showed the evidence of the brain damage, but the enthusiasm in her face was like a lit candle in darkness.</p> <p>\u201cMax,\u201d she said. \u201cMax Max Max.\u201d</p><p>The tightening in her throat was unexpected, the sting of tears in her eyes. He\u2019d said he saw her twice a week, and Amanda acted as if she hadn\u2019t seen Max in months. Janet wondered if she always reacted that way. But it wasn\u2019t that alone which caused the emotional reaction. Three men had held this beautiful child down, brutalized her, beat her. Janet remembered what it was like, being down on the ground, Jorge whaling on her with the bat, blow after blow. If he\u2019d hit her head just the right way, she could have been this. Only she wouldn\u2019t have been in this beautiful facility. She\u2019d have been tossed in a hole somewhere, left to die.</p><p>She closed her eyes, fighting the surge of unbalancing emotions. She couldn\u2019t do this here and now. Not if Amanda wanted to meet her. She had to pull herself together. Damn it, she should have predicted his reaction.</p><p>\u201cSad girl. Sad girl. Max.\u201d</p><p>Janet snapped back to the present. She always lost time when this happened, and a quick glance at her watch told her about ten minutes had passed. Amanda was standing right in front of her, those gray eyes so much like Max\u2019s fastened on her face. Amanda was handing her something. A tissue.</p><p>\u201cSad girl.\u201d No, she wasn\u2019t handing Janet the tissue. Amanda was bent forward, wiping her eyes for her, dabbing at the tears. She sat down next to Janet, pressed the tissue into her hand and put an arm around her. Then she rocked the two of them back and forth, making a crooning noise. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Max is here. Max makes everything okay.\u201d</p> <p>Janet looked up to see Max watching them. The concern on his face pierced her heart even more deeply, particularly when he dropped to his haunches before them, laying a hand on Janet\u2019s knee as well as his sister\u2019s. As he looked up at them both, her with her reconstructed face, his sister with her obvious neurological issues, Janet saw regret in his expression, his realization of the connection.</p><p>She firmed her chin. She wouldn\u2019t let this visit take that turn. Covering his hand with her own in reassurance, she put her other one lightly on Amanda\u2019s, hoping it wasn\u2019t the wrong move. Amanda\u2019s head popped up, her gaze locking with Janet\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Amanda. I feel better now. Thanks to you and Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda, this is my friend Janet. She wanted to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Amanda gave her a perusal that was the equivalent of a visual strip search. She touched Janet\u2019s hair, then began to pluck out the bobby pins. Max made a move to stop her, but Janet shook her head, a slight movement telling him it was okay.</p><p>\u201cOoh. Pretty. Doll hair.\u201d As it unraveled down her back, over her shoulders, Amanda stroked it, touched Janet\u2019s face. \u201cOkay. You\u2019ll take care of Max. Max needs someone to take care of him.\u201d She made an expression so remarkably like a smug little sister Janet smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s a big dummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter a big dummy than a priss pot,\u201d Max returned. He pinched Amanda\u2019s knee and she swatted at him. Then she settled against Janet\u2019s shoulder, tracing the patterns on her skirt. Max sat down on the other side of his sister, and the young woman took both their hands and began to hum. As Max cupped the back of her head, stroking, Janet saw the strain on his face.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine how hard it was to do this, to see his sister forever caught in the state of a young child. Amanda was in her late twenties, perhaps even thirty. She overlapped their hands, so that they were holding each other as well as Amanda.</p> <p>\u201cDo you play checkers?\u201d she asked Janet.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you play with me? And then maybe read me a story with Max? He got me the Nancy Drew set, and he\u2019s reading them to me. Then it will be time to eat. I\u2019ll share my snack with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>It all went well until the snack. In almost every room and even out in the gardens, signs clearly and emphatically indicated all cell phones were to be turned off, but one visitor had ignored the signs. The cell tone that blared forth was a rap song. Before it reached its first stanza, Amanda transformed from a playful child into a ferocious banshee who screamed at invisible attackers to stop, stop, stop. Max refused the orderly\u2019s help, holding his sister against him, arms banded across her upper torso, until the nurse injected her with a sedative strong enough to make her mercifully insensible in a matter of minutes. As she faded away, she was repeating it over and over. \u201cStop hurting me. Stop...hurting...me.\u201d</p><p>Max lifted and carried her to her room with the nurse in the lead. Janet trailed after him. When he laid her down in her bed, as tenderly as if he held an infant, he excused the nurse, telling her he\u2019d care for her. Apparently the sedative would keep her out for hours. Janet joined him, helping him undress Amanda and put her in a cotton nightgown. She wondered if he\u2019d picked it out for her. It was warm and rabbit fur soft, with pretty embroidery on the hem and neckline. After they tucked her in, he sat at her bedside, stroking her head and murmuring to her. When the nurse returned a half hour later, he brushed a kiss on Amanda\u2019s forehead and nodded to Janet, indicating it was time to leave.</p><p>As they walked out the front door, he seemed to be setting a straight course for the parking lot, but Janet took his hand, tugged him toward a bench surrounded by the flowers and foliage of the front landscaping. When she pressed him to a seated position, she sat on his lap, wrapping her arms around him. He said nothing for a moment, stiff and rigid, but she said nothing either, simply putting her head on top of his. He sighed, his head sinking down to her breast. As his shoulders began to shake, her heart broke.</p><p>Letting a new person bear witness to a wound that could never possibly heal could bring forth such emotions. Hadn\u2019t she reacted in a volatile way of her own when she had told Max her story? She held him, letting those bitter, silent tears mark her shirt. He banded his arms around her, rocking them both.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here.\u201d She ached for him, and also understood fully why he wanted every single person responsible for this dead. In his shoes, she\u2019d hunt and exterminate them like the vermin they were.</p><p>\u201cWhen I don\u2019t come every few days, she lapses into that state,\u201d he said at last, lifting his head. He would have wiped at his eyes with typical male self-consciousness, but just like Amanda, she did it instead, taking the tracks away on her fingers, caressing his jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s like she uses me as a touchstone, cycling around it. When I\u2019m gone, the cycle breaks, and she gets pulled into the center, back into the nightmare. Once, we tried having me stay away for a month. Though they warned me she might forget who I was, they thought it might alter the nucleus of the memories, make things better. Instead, it got so bad she almost died. Wasted away to nothing. I had to stay here for a couple weeks, hand-feeding her, and if I left the room at all, she had to be sedated. We eventually got her back to this.\u201d</p><p>Thinking about the toll of doing this, she could comprehend why Max was so quiet, so steady. Or perhaps it was a chicken or egg thing. The calling that had put him overseas when this happened must be the same one that gave him the strength to deal with this week after week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned his head, looked at her, and she saw the stark desolation in his gaze. \u201cI know it would be better if she had died. Why was I in the right time and right place for Savannah and her baby, for so many missions, and not for my mother and sister? What kind of God fucks with you like that? You can make yourself crazy with the questions. Even if He couldn\u2019t stop it, why would He let only a part of her mind survive it? Why not be merciful, take her life?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it works like that. I never have. I don\u2019t think God, whatever It is, is like some kind of movie director, on top of every action and reaction. I think it\u2019s much more high level than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a SEAL, you learned it was all up to you and your team, and you don\u2019t quit until the mission is accomplished, no matter what goes wrong. That\u2019s the way life is. You don\u2019t give up, you don\u2019t quit.\u201d He sighed. \u201cSuperman. That\u2019s what Amanda called me, because of the jaw.\u201d He gestured to it wryly, the square cut that defined his strong face. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t matter. I was trained to be the best of the best, but it means nothing if I\u2019m not there at the critical moment I\u2019m needed. I wasn\u2019t there. That\u2019s nothing you can predict, change or help. Completely out of my control. It makes no sense. I felt like God was fucking laughing at me.\u201d</p> <p>Janet stroked his hair, touched the handsome jaw. \u201cI\u2019ve done that too. Thought about the moment Jorge said the right combination of words, the things that made me decide to stay with him instead of going home with my dance company. I think of a hundred ways I might have noticed this or that, chosen differently. But I didn\u2019t. Maybe in some alternative universe I did, and as a result, I became a different person. Maybe a less strong, less certain person than I am now. But when this happens to an innocent, one who was given no choices at all in her Fate, there seems to be no clear answer.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, a bleak look in his gray eyes. She put her lips to his temple, spreading her fingers between his shoulder blades. \u201cIn this situation, you can only love her,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHelp keep the pieces together. That was the lesson I learned when I crossed paths with Matt, and he helped me pick up my pieces. If he hadn\u2019t been there, it\u2019s very likely I would be in a far worse place than I am now. Each of us has this sense that we\u2019re somehow divinely touched, a chosen person, but the reality is we\u2019re no different from any other creature struggling to survive. We try to find moments of peace and contentment, ways to enjoy the life we\u2019ve been given, because this life is the only sure promise we have. You\u2019ve given her the very best option she can have, and she has you.\u201d</p><p>Janet touched his face, drawing his gaze up to hers. \u201cI can tell you that if I was reduced to nothing, but you were a part of my life, I\u2019d still feel blessed. The fact that girl\u2019s eyes light up at the sight of you says she knows it too, even if she knows nothing else. You\u2019re her peace and contentment, Max.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. She\u2019d never been gladder for her hard-ass, no-nonsense bitch reputation, because it meant the sincere words had the power to startle him, shock him out of the dark place his mind had been trying to take him. And she did mean it. It even shook her up a little, given that her words weren\u2019t much different from a declaration of love. Perhaps even more significant than that.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His voice cracked a little. He cleared his throat. His arms had slipped down into a loose coil on her hips, his fingers curved over her buttocks. Not as a sexual tease, but more as a resting place from where they\u2019d fallen, loose and tired. She kept her arm around his shoulders, stroked the hair at his nape, encouraging him to lay his head back down on her breast. You can rest for a little while, Max, she thought to herself. I\u2019ve got you.</p> <p>Even a warrior deserved a port in a storm. Maybe especially a warrior.</p><p>\u201cMy mom and I were really close,\u201d he said, his breath warm on her flesh. \u201cLike partners, as I got into my teens and could bring home some money. We were in such a crappy neighborhood, broke, barely making it. I wasn\u2019t great at academics, but I had such self-discipline and determination, the school guidance counselor suggested I look at the SEAL program. Mom encouraged me in every way possible to do it, and kicked my ass if I even looked toward the riffraff in our neighborhood that wanted me to go a different way. She was so proud when I graduated from BUD/S, both her and Amanda.\u201d</p><p>That was where he\u2019d acquired his deep respect for women, Janet realized. He\u2019d experienced firsthand the power of a tough, loving mother. \u201cI was worried about leaving them in that neighborhood, but I sent them home money, which she could put away to get them into a better place eventually.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cThere was this one op...I can\u2019t tell you much about it, but basically for a short time we had our hands on a shitload of drug money, confiscated on a raid. It was just us six guys watching over it, guys who knew everything about one another.</p><p>\u201cOne of my buddies joked about grabbing a handful before the politicians had their hands on it. They even did the Mel Gibson impersonation. You know, from Lethal Weapon II, where Murtaugh is thinking about taking some drug money to put his kids through college, but then puts it back, saying it\u2019s fucking drug money. And Riggs says, \u2018So? Do some good with it\u2019. That haunts me now. If I\u2019d taken one fucking fistful of that money home, my mom and sister could have moved out of that neighborhood. That\u2019s a stain I could have borne on my soul.\u201d</p><p>She considered that. \u201cBut it would have been different, wouldn\u2019t it? You wouldn\u2019t have known then you were saving them from that fate. You would have been just some guy who did something immoral, going against everything the SEALs stand for. You would have taken the easy way out to give your mom and sister a better place to live, and if your mom\u2019s the type of person you say she is, she wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to do that. She would have donated the money to some charity, and kicked your ass seven different ways.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cYeah, she would have. Dale\u2014he\u2019s a buddy of mine\u2014says the same thing you do, that the only sure thing we know is that we have this life. That the code we live by says what and who we are. Nothing else matters, everything different is just an excuse. You\u2019d like him. He\u2019s a hard-ass like you. Metaphorically.\u201d He gave her a discreet squeeze. \u201cThe actual ass feels pretty good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMine or Dale\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt Dale\u2019s. Never had the urge and he\u2019d probably shoot me in the balls if I did, but my guess is yours feels better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t say it was soft,\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cOnly in the exact right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d Janet sighed, put her head on top of his.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that knows it wasn\u2019t in my control,\u201d he continued. \u201cWithin a few years of me serving in the SEALs, Mom could have moved them out of there. But Amanda had graduated high school, was working a job. She\u2019d been in ROTC, was thinking about enlisting, and they both...Mom had friends in the neighborhood, and so did Amanda. They ran a community watch, were trying to make things better. And they both had this attitude of \u2018this is our home, and no one\u2019s going to make us leave it\u2019. The fucking irony is that\u2019s why they were targeted. The bastards wanted to make an example out of the ones who stood up to the monsters, who refused to be broken by them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what-ifs can put you on a lifetime-numbing dose of Xanax, trust me. There\u2019s what-is, and that\u2019s that. You live your life based on the what-ifs, and you\u2019ll never live.\u201d She touched his cheek, trying to change the direction of his thoughts. \u201cTell me something wonderful you remember about being a SEAL.\u201d</p><p>He shifted, propping his chin against her shoulder. \u201cUnderwater dives in tropical waters. It\u2019s a different kind of garden, but still a garden. There are so many things that glitter at night. Particles, the trails that fish leave. You don\u2019t expect it. In some ways, you want to stay down there forever.\u201d</p> <p>He remained silent in her arms for a while. \u201cDale was with me when I got home, had to identify my mom\u2019s body and figure out what to do for Amanda. Mom was always so strong, and seeing her broken like that... I wanted to die. I couldn\u2019t imagine anything worse. Dale got me through, he and a couple of the other guys. Matt was connected to them, and they introduced us. He helped me find this place for Amanda. The guy who founded it, he was a doctor who had a son in Vietnam. The kid came back with PTSD, killed himself. When Matt told him about my situation, he worked out a payment plan I could afford, probably a tenth of what it costs to be here. He died a year after that happened, but even left it in his will, that Amanda could always be here, no matter my income level.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s things like that which don\u2019t make much sense. How some people can be so good, and others can be so bad. My SEAL buddies checked in on my mom when they were home and I wasn\u2019t. One of them talked to me about moving them into the adjacent unit of his duplex when the renter\u2019s lease was up. It wasn\u2019t too far from where Mom and Amanda were living, but it was a better area, and would have been safer. And Eric\u2019s wife and kids lived in that other side. Mom was killed two months before the renter moved out. Eric felt so bad about it, but I told him Mom wouldn\u2019t put up with him feeling like that.\u201d</p><p>She felt his lips curve against her, a painful grimace. \u201cShe always said she had her hammer and her pepper spray, bars on the windows, and I\u2019d taught her to use a gun. But she wasn\u2019t able to get to it, they cut her off. Everything was the wrong timing, too fucking late.\u201d</p><p>Some things worked out perfectly, other things went so wrong it was hard to imagine how they could have been any worse. And like he\u2019d said, it was good and bad. A person just had to learn how to appreciate the one and survive the other.</p><p>\u201cHow about I buy you some lunch, sailor?\u201d she murmured. \u201cThat sandwich place off the highway looked pretty good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled against her, lifted his head. As he did, she put her hands on his face, her thumbs passing over the dried tear tracks, her heart twisting anew at the sight of them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my mom always said, if I came home upset about anything. There was nothing that a good meal couldn\u2019t cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a teenage boy, I expect that\u2019s true. And even more so for a big, strapping man with a healthy appetite. Just keep in mind I have a secretary\u2019s salary.\u201d</p> <p>Max squeezed her, then lifted her to her feet. \u201cCan\u2019t fool me, ma\u2019am. You\u2019re Matt Kensington\u2019s secretary, and he pays his people what they\u2019re worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the truth comes out. You\u2019re after my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Just the sex.\u201d He looped an arm around her waist, gave her a smile with a few less shadows behind his eyes, making her own heart lighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to come back here with you. Whenever you and Amanda would like my company. Maybe I can teach her some ballet. Does she like to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always wanted to take ballet and jazz. We never had the money. I bet she\u2019d love it.\u201d They\u2019d reached the truck and Max opened the door for her, put his hands to her waist to lift her into the passenger seat rather than her having to use the step. Once there, he held on to her, putting the two of them eye to eye.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said anything else, just closed the door and crossed around to the other side. It had been an emotional afternoon, but Max didn\u2019t strike her as the type that led with emotion for a declaration like that. He felt things strongly, that was clear, but he thought things through before he spoke. He hadn\u2019t seemed to need her to say the words back, hadn\u2019t followed up with her on it, but the words surrounded her heart, held them, made her feel...wonderful. Still, happy, flustered...anxious.</p><p>One of Gayle\u2019s kids had come down with the flu and so they had to reschedule their visit with her for the next weekend. But Friday was still on the books. She had forty-eight hours to clear her mind and think about it, about him coming to Club Progeny as her guest.</p><p>Thursday she didn\u2019t get to see him because he took Matt and Jon to Baton Rouge, but in the late afternoon she received an intriguing text, probably while he was out in the parking lot waiting on them.</p><p>Any special instructions for tomorrow?</p> <p>Yes. Shave off all body hair and paint your nails hot pink. I\u2019ve shipped an I Heart Justin Bieber T-shirt to your home. Wear that with jeans. No underwear of course.</p><p>Sorry. Urgent mission. All SEALs being recalled to active duty, Friday night only. Crisis in Tahiti involving a shortage of sunscreen on swimsuit models.</p><p>I\u2019d rethink that mission, sailor. Doubt you\u2019ll get out of that one alive. A not-so-friendly fire incident.</p><p>Love it when you\u2019re possessive, Mistress.</p><p>That had made her smile. It wasn\u2019t a bad feeling, thinking of Max as hers exclusively, especially when he seemed to reciprocate.</p><p>No special instructions. Just bring yourself. If you can find time to brush your teeth and put on deodorant, that would be appreciated.</p><p>Check. No sweaty man smell or spinach between my teeth.</p><p>No disagreement on the spinach, but she found she actually liked Max\u2019s sweaty man smell. She\u2019d prefer to cause that state, however, and planned on it for Friday.</p> <p>Putting her cell phone away as the elevator opened, she was surprised to see Dana. Using her cane, the minister navigated her way efficiently to Janet\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cJanet, you wear the prettiest scents. Still making your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. I have a new honeysuckle and lemon verbena combination that\u2019s lovely. I\u2019ll send some home for you with Peter. Was he expecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. With Max off in Baton Rouge, and everything wrapped up at the church early today, I had Wade bring me back here. Since I have some class tapes to review, I figured I could park in the back lounge area where I\u2019ll be out of everyone\u2019s way until the end of Peter\u2019s work day. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have you here, as always. Can I get you a soda or snack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can check the break room. I\u2019m not here to interrupt your work.\u201d</p><p>Belying that, however, Dana lingered, parking a hip on the desk and fishing through Janet\u2019s candy dish. She always knew which of the wrapped selections were chocolate. Of course, Peter\u2019s wife had enhanced senses on many levels, as she proved now.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear you\u2019re putting moves on my other man.\u201d</p><p>Janet lifted a brow. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mind sharing? Peter and Max are more blessings than any one woman deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so good, I deserve all the blessings that come my way.\u201d Dipping her head so Janet could see her eyes over the edge of the sunglasses, Dana gave her a wicked wink. \u201cCan I get raunchy? Are we all by ourselves?\u201d</p><p>Janet chuckled. \u201cYes. Nearest occupied office is Lucas\u2019, and he can\u2019t hear us from here, unless we\u2019re shouting. Plus he and his accounting team are working on quarterly taxes, which means he has his doors closed so I can\u2019t hear him lavishing creative and vivid curses on the government.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless the incompetence and greed of our government then. Seriously, Max is a good man. I was delighted to hear the boy is getting some. I was beginning to worry he\u2019d retired that dick altogether, and that would be a sin, with a body like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd being a minister-in-training, you are an authority on sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter calls me the cause of original sin. He\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Dana unwrapped one of the chocolates and extended another to Janet. Deciding to roll with it, Janet took the candy, enjoyed the taste in companionable silence. Dana didn\u2019t make a habit of wasting anyone\u2019s time, so Janet expected there was more she wanted to say. While the woman was mulling it over, she decided to take advantage of the information source.</p><p>\u201cMax has been volunteering at your church, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a godsend. Does a lot of heavy lifting, maintenance, plays basketball with the boys. They love him, though they\u2019ve nicknamed him White Boy Can\u2019t Jump. CJ for short. I tell them to give him a break, because they know they have a genetic advantage on him. He claims that\u2019s racial profiling. I tell him it\u2019s just the sad fact of why black people have taken over professional contact sports.\u201d Dana smirked, but then sobered. \u201cI love him to death, Janet. He\u2019s tough as nails, but try not to pulverize his heart. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s offered it to a lot of women in his life. If he has a mind to give it to you, treat it with care, even if you decide to give it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to take him to the club on Friday night. As mine.\u201d</p><p>Dana, about to rise, shifted into Janet\u2019s guest chair with a decided thump. \u201cSay again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Noting the concern on Dana\u2019s face, Janet settled her hands on her desk, clasped them. \u201cDo you think that will be a problem?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t intended the cool edge, but it was there. Dana didn\u2019t take offense. \u201cI wasn\u2019t meaning anything against you, Janet. I just...he\u2019s not a sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not. I do know that. But he wants to show that he trusts me, and he wants to experience that side of me. It\u2019s a gift, but I intend for it not to be one-sided.\u201d She couldn\u2019t really explain something so complex further, but fortunately, it seemed to make sense to Dana. She was as much a part of that world as Janet, only on the submissive side.</p><p>\u201cThat fits him. And you.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cAre you looking for advice?\u201d</p><p>Janet felt her hackles ease. \u201cI would welcome any, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I have a friend who\u2019s married to a SEAL. She says the best way to turn them into basket cases is park them at a table in the center of a place that has about a dozen different exit and entry points. It\u2019s like watching a bunch of cats in a roomful of rockers. Doesn\u2019t matter that they know they\u2019re on civilian ground. They\u2019re trained and trained and trained until these things are like breathing to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what would you suggest?\u201d</p><p>Dana\u2019s full, moist lips pressed together, considering. \u201cDo your session in a private room. Let him see it before you blindfold him. If it\u2019s at Progeny, the rooms only have one exit and entry point. Show him that it\u2019s coded so that he knows once the door\u2019s locked, the only one who can come in is a staff member with a master key override, and that only happens if there\u2019s a safety issue. Even so, he\u2019s not going to be able to handle being restrained to the point he can\u2019t get loose. I know nothing\u2019s more tempting to a Domme than seeing a man that fine bound and helpless, but it will make him edgy, nervous, and you don\u2019t want to put a SEAL in that state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he would do it, if I asked, despite that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dana answered her bluntly. \u201cBut don\u2019t make him do that, Janet. Please.\u201d</p><p>She reached over the candy bowl and found Janet\u2019s knuckles, tapped them. It was a plea and admonishment both.</p><p>\u201cBDSM is so intense, it\u2019s kind of crazy to call it a game, but it is, at one level, where the pleasure comes into it. Tying him up so he can\u2019t get loose...that won\u2019t be a game to him, and there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be able to make it one. From what I understand from Peter, I think he\u2019d pretty much do anything you wanted him to do at this point. Until he realized it was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Max had told her he loved her, which had been a shock to her system. She knew Max well enough to know he wouldn\u2019t have shared that with anyone else, so hearing that the men she worked for had already detected his feelings was an additional surprise. Not necessarily unpleasant but...unsettling.</p><p>\u201cNo unexpected loud noises. We all hate those. I still can\u2019t stand hearing kids play those dumbass war video games. If you go the way of blindfolds and light restraint, do a lot of physical contact. Keep connected to him by voice or touch, so he knows where you are in the room. You\u2019d be amazed at how much control a SEAL has. He could pull up the nose of a gun a hair before a civilian pops out of the woodwork in front of his target, but he\u2019s still trained to be a deadly force weapon. He wouldn\u2019t be willing to do this unless he trusts you and himself enough to keep things safe, but you can help him do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Janet digested that. \u201cUnderstood. How about anal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. A strap-on might not be out of the question. You\u2019ll have to figure that one out. Hasn\u2019t come up in our daily conversation.\u201d She gave Janet a cheeky grin. \u201cBut I can tell you right off, don\u2019t touch him with an actual cock. That boy\u2019s as straight as Pat Buchanan on a holy roller tour. Some poor guy would lose their most vital appendage.\u201d</p><p>Janet chuckled at the image, even as she remembered how he\u2019d handled Thor, so casually intimate, but firmly distancing himself from any sexual implications to it. \u201cAll right. Anything else?\u201d</p> <p>An expression of feline pleasure wreathed Dana\u2019s face. \u201cYeah. I\u2019d probably sell my soul to be able to see this go down. You\u2019re one lucky woman. Why don\u2019t you plan to come to our girls\u2019 night this month? I bet everyone would be willing to offer major bribes to hear you rattle off a play-by-play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never averse to bribes.\u201d</p><p>For the third time, Max checked himself in the mirror. This was getting ridiculous. He wore a belted pair of stressed jeans and a black dress shirt. He\u2019d seen the things Janet did with her subs, and he was starting to think he was crazy, imagining himself in similar positions. One night, she\u2019d led a poor bastard around the club on hands and knees. He\u2019d been buck-naked, except for a cage-like thing around his cock. What if any of the K&amp;A men were there? He cut the vision of Matt seeing his limo driver being led around by a cock leash right out of his head, because the mere thought would make Max break out in hives. It would probably make Matt break out in hives as well.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about any of that when he offered this. He\u2019d had some vague sense of her hand upon him, him being on his knees, close enough to put his mouth on her sweet-smelling skin, rub his cheek against whatever sexy concoction she\u2019d wear to drive him crazy. So basically his brain had disengaged and his cock had done his thinking.</p><p>Except it hadn\u2019t been his cock leading him, but his heart. He should have remembered his heart had no more of a brain than his cock did, and they\u2019d both left his head out of it. Idiots.</p> <p>Okay, he was turning his internal organs into a community forum, so he was not in a good head space right now. His date was waiting on him. If he waited five more minutes to leave, he\u2019d run the risk of being late, not a good start to the night. Fuck it.</p><p>No. He drew a deep breath. It wasn\u2019t his date waiting for him, but his Mistress. He liked the way she reacted to that, her eyes sharpening but her mouth getting a little softer, the silky brows arching in an interested way. It would be all right. Either way, he\u2019d agreed to do it and he wasn\u2019t backing out. No sense chewing on it any more. Grabbing his keys, he headed out.</p><p>She\u2019d told him she wanted to meet him at the club, not be picked up, so as he drove that way, he wondered what she\u2019d choose to wear. Leather, corset...those awesome boots and gloves that fit like a second skin. No, he bet she was going to be more unpredictable tonight, though if she showed up in sweats and running shoes he\u2019d still be hard as a rock for it. Yeah, he had it bad.</p><p>His mind moved to thoughts of their day together with Amanda, then to what Janet had done when they left the facility, guiding him into the garden and putting herself in his lap. She hadn\u2019t coaxed or chased his emotional reaction. She\u2019d demanded it, in a way that had resulted in a purging of the pain. He\u2019d broken down after his mom, sure, but by himself. In the early days of dealing with it, he\u2019d almost lost it a couple times in Dale\u2019s company, or with the other guys, but their way of handling it was letting him walk it off, protecting him from interruption until he collected his shit.</p><p>Maybe it just wasn\u2019t in his makeup to accept from a guy what Janet had offered. When she took charge, instead of swallowing it down, he\u2019d let it swallow him up. Everything he\u2019d needed to do since he first saw his mother\u2019s body had risen out of his heart and taken over. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d cried about anything, but if a man couldn\u2019t cry about losing his mother and the death of his sister\u2019s future, then he supposed he had no tears for anything.</p><p>He pulled up to Club Progeny. Fortunately, Matt and his guys mostly preferred the slower weeknights. Since that meant they likely weren\u2019t here, that was a plus, but seeing the profusion of people coming and going, Max felt an unfamiliar shot of uneasiness through his vitals, something perilously close to unmanly fear. He was familiar enough with this stuff to know there were safe words, limits. He could tell Janet what was a no-go for him. But of course that caught in his craw, because it clashed with his determination to be the big alpha guy who could handle anything.</p> <p>\u201cFuck it. Get the hell out of the truck and do it.\u201d Trust her. That\u2019s what this is about, remember?</p><p>As he strode up to the club, he was aware of calculated glances. When he brought the limo, he had an obvious role as a staff person delivering a club member. Tonight his status was up for speculation, an unknown quantity. Dom? Sub? Curious voyeur?</p><p>Trinity was the hostess on shift tonight. She was a gorgeous blonde with glossy pink lips and a lot of soft white breast displayed up high in a blue satin corset with black lacings. He\u2019d had cordial dealings with her before, had even brought her a cup of coffee one night when she couldn\u2019t get away from the desk and he was waiting on Ben and Marcie to finish their session.</p><p>\u201cMistress Janet told me you\u2019d be coming as her guest,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cGlad to have you with us as a player tonight, Max. Will you give me your wrist, please?\u201d</p><p>When he complied, she put a rubber bracelet on him. It had been stamped with dark letters. Exclusive property of Mistress Janet.</p><p>\u201cNo one will offer you any proposals while wearing that,\u201d she said as he studied it. \u201cShe said you\u2019d be most comfortable that way.\u201d</p><p>When he glanced up, Trinity gave his hand a quick squeeze, fingers whispering over his palm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019re just people. No one\u2019s going to try to eat you alive, though we can\u2019t keep people from fantasizing about it.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you in room D, second level. That\u2019s a private room.\u201d</p><p>Though he should be embarrassed that his anxiety was that obvious, some of it eased at the information. It underlined what he\u2019d thought when he got out of the truck.</p> <p>Janet knows you. You can trust her.</p><p>The club really was hopping tonight, music booming on the dance floor, the bass accompanied by the bounce and twist of a lot of bodies showing plenty of bare skin. In the public play rooms, several scenes were happening on the suspension beams, with the St. Andrew\u2019s Crosses and spanking benches at full occupancy. Though he usually enjoyed watching from the safety of his coffee spot, he decided keeping his eyes averted tonight was the wise move. On the first HALO jump, he\u2019d found it was better not to lean out of the plane and see how fast and far the guy who\u2019d jumped ahead of him was falling. But he remembered the rush of adrenaline when he followed him, the oh fuck, what the hell did I do, followed by the glorious sense of I\u2019m fucking flying. When can I go on this ride again?</p><p>This was going to be like that, because that\u2019s what he wanted to happen, and it was what she wanted to happen. They were in it together. He was being a fucking pussy. He\u2019d gone through buildings that were a maze of blind turns obscured by concrete dust and darkness, fire crackling at his heels, the possibility of an insurgent\u2019s gun or an explosive device directly ahead. He could handle one D/s session with a petite, beautiful Dominatrix who already had most of his heart in her hands.</p><p>Room D. He started to turn the door handle, then stopped, knocked. The security light over the door turned from red to green, a beep inviting him to enter. He noted a security card was needed to get in, unless the person already inside unlatched the door. Secure and ultra private.</p><p>Out of habit, he glanced through the crack as he opened the door, checking behind it, and then his gaze swept the room as he stepped inside.</p><p>It was a simple rectangle with a lavatory closet built into the far left corner, that door open to show a polished silver sink, commode. A built-in cabinet along the same wall displayed an array of items assembled on the counter\u2019s surface. Velcro cuffs, a flogger and a sturdy cloth bag whose contents were concealed, but he expected there was more of the same inside it, since he\u2019d seen Janet bring it to her sessions before. The floor was painted with concentric circles, a chair bolted on the bull\u2019s-eye. One wall had several different options for restraining a body against it. The opposite wall had some of those options as well, but they were obscured by an image being projected from the video equipment embedded in the ceiling.</p><p>It was the ocean. Just a continuous, panoramic view of a mild surf breaking and then rushing to shore. The sky was a pre-dawn marmalade. The projector provided sound, matching the image flowing from the wall onto a foot of the floor. He digested all of it in a second, and then found his Mistress. She was leaning against the opposite wall, watching him.</p><p>The things he\u2019d imagined her wearing\u2014boots, corset, tight pants\u2014were things he\u2019d seen her don for this type of play in the past. Things that made any man\u2019s imagination run to hot, wet dreams. Her outfit tonight definitely met that requirement, but it wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d seen her wear before. It was as if she\u2019d worn it specifically for him.</p><p>She wore a bikini top, the sides shaped so the garment lifted her small breasts and made them swell out and over, her cleavage deep and tempting a man\u2019s tongue to tunnel there. The pale-yellow color showed the dark smudge of her nipples, the silky, thin fabric molding the points. A sarong wrap was tied at her hip, so her leg appeared bare all the way from waist to ankle. She wasn\u2019t wearing anything under the sarong, unless it was a thong so small the strap was hidden beneath the knot of the fabric.</p><p>She was barefoot, her hair down, curled around her face. She was wearing makeup, but it was different from the office or what he\u2019d seen her wear here. This was so natural, he might have missed it, except for the gleam of the lipstick, the scent of her gloss. Some kind of musk he expected was injected with pheromones, because it pulled him across the room to her like she\u2019d wrapped a chain around his cock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop.\u201d Her eyes were half slits, her head leaned back as if she was on the beach, listening to the waves. \u201cGo to the wall, Max. The one with the ocean.\u201d</p><p>When he hesitated, those dark eyes opened fully. \u201cThis is your punishment, yes?\u201d Her voice was a sultry purr. \u201cWhich means you follow your Mistress\u2019 commands. She knows what kind of discipline you need.\u201d</p><p>They were the type of words he didn\u2019t expect to arouse him, make him harder, but they sure as hell did. Nodding, he moved to the wall. She watched him, that mysterious gaze following his every move.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t speak unless I give you permission to do so. Face the wall and grasp the handles that are closest to the full stretch of your arms.\u201d</p><p>He could see the flicker of the video as he obeyed, his body becoming a part of the wave images. The handles were just above his shoulder height, and she\u2019d accurately predicted his arm span. The set at the full reach of his arms had already been locked down in their tracks.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs shoulder width.\u201d She\u2019d moved closer. When she curved her hand over his tense shoulder, let her fingers glide down the center of his back, over his shirt, his nerve endings reacted to that touch like a drug. It helped him deal with the fact he had his back to the door, making him twitchy.</p><p>\u201cThat beep you heard when you entered happens whenever the door unlatches. There\u2019s a five-second delay before it opens. Once it\u2019s coded by the user, the only one who can come in without me unlocking it from the inside is a staff member with an override. Even with an override, there\u2019s that beep and five-second delay. All right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, another concern dissipating. \u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>She moved away from him, over to the cabinet on the adjacent wall. As she studied her options there, she pulled her hair over one shoulder, so his gaze was caught by what was drawn on her back. He\u2019d seen enough of her body to know she had no tattoos, but this temporary wasn\u2019t a cheap sticker. Her skin was the canvas for a monarch butterfly, wings stretched out and curved over her shoulder blades. The lower set of wings were pierced by a trident, the eagle with the bowed head along the base of it, across her lower back.</p><p>The butterfly was a fragile creature, but so beautiful its beauty had an indelible strength. And it had been pierced, captured, by a modified form of the SEAL trident symbol. Whether she\u2019d intended the meaning or not, the idea of it swamped him, giving him courage and a willingness to handle whatever this was. As well as risk additional punishment by speaking without permission.</p><p>\u201cI like your ink.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him over her shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the eagle, why his head is in that position. I liked that.\u201d</p><p>The SEALs were the only armed services division whose symbol showed the eagle\u2019s head bowed. It was done that way to honor the fallen. Seeing her honor it on her flesh made him want to put his lips there, follow the trident up her spine, kiss every inch of the butterfly\u2019s wings. His neck was getting a crick, looking at her at the strained angle, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cThe artist said he\u2019d enrolled in SEAL training once, when he was much younger,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe made it to the third week, and had a tremendous appreciation for SEALs. He also said, and I quote\u2014\u2018those are some of the craziest motherfuckers in the world\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I figured as much.\u201d Now her lips curved. \u201cLook at the wall, not at me, Max.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d pulled something from the bag but was keeping it concealed in her hand. As she returned to him, she touched his nape. She leaned against him, her breasts pressing against his back, and he felt silk against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to blindfold you, Max. You\u2019ll be able to hear my voice, and I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m going to do before I do it. You may wish I didn\u2019t,\u201d that seductive tease was in her voice again, \u201cbut I\u2019m counting on that brave, alpha, all-guts-and-balls side of you to take your punishment like a man. Can you handle that? It\u2019s just a day on the beach...and you know just how punishing that can be, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Even his missions hadn\u2019t been as tough as certain parts of BUD/S training, so she was right about that. As she guided the blindfold over his eyes, she spoke again. \u201cTell me about Hell Week. What do you remember about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything hurt. There was nothing but cold.\u201d God, every SEAL remembered that fucking, unbelievable cold. \u201cBut when you reached a certain point, your brain shut down. All you did was follow the instructors, trusting them and the guys around you to get you through. You weren\u2019t going to quit. No...it wasn\u2019t even that conscious. You passed exhaustion, left it way the hell behind. Everything was stretched past breaking...it was broken, and yet you were being remade too. You\u2019d keep going as long as the instructor said you had to go, until you dropped and died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave everything over into his keeping,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThe most difficult and yet most complete moment of your life. The mind no longer involved. Just the effort, the goal, the instructor\u2019s commands. That was everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He hadn\u2019t ever really thought of it that way, but he guessed that was true. She\u2019d made the blindfold snug, using a Velcro strip in the back, something he could rip off if needed. Her nails slid across his back, and then her touch was gone, leaving only the rush of the waves. He couldn\u2019t hear her footsteps.</p> <p>\u201cJanet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if he should call her Mistress, but her name was what came to his lips. Ironically, he realized he called her Mistress when he felt in control.</p><p>\u201cI was getting these.\u201d More cushiony fabric brushed his left hand, wrapped around his wrist. \u201cThese cuffs are going to hold your hands to the handles.\u201d After she put another one on the right arm, a wider piece brushed his throat. \u201cThis is a collar. I\u2019m going to put a short tether on it, attach it to a clip embedded in the wall. All of the connectors are plastic snap locks, which can be broken easily by a powerful man. But you won\u2019t break them. That would displease me. You will restrain yourself, follow my commands. Do you understand, Max?\u201d</p><p>He got his cue this time. \u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d They could be broken. It didn\u2019t make his gut tighten any less or make his throat less dry. Though the cuffs made him feel peculiar, they couldn\u2019t hold a candle to his reaction to the collar. Maybe it was how she lingered over it, stroking his throat, tugging on the strap in a way that told him that putting it on him seriously aroused her. His cock, which had diminished some while evaluating the uncertainties of the situation, came back to life. When she rose up on her toes to hook the tether, keeping his face within a foot of the wall unless he pulled against the leash, her body pressed against the side of his.</p><p>\u201cI like the outfit. You dressed up for me. Nice jeans, black shirt. You even shined your shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am. My mother always told me to look my best for a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsshh. No more talking unless I ask you a direct question. If I have to remind you again, I\u2019ll gag you.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was firm, calm. A reminder of consequences. She hadn\u2019t snapped the cuffs to the handles yet, but he figured out why soon enough. She wanted to undress him first. She ran her hands down his back, like a police officer searching a suspect, only her touch was far more provocative, teasing, molding to his sides, his waist and hips, cupping his buttocks in the jeans, then slipping her fingers into the back pockets. She took out his wallet, his keys, fingers caressing his groin through the pointed reach of the front pocket. The waves continued to make their rushing noise. Some sort of air filter was adding to the hologram, because he could smell sea air.</p><p>Her hip bone was against the lower part of his buttock as she reached around him to tug his shirt out of his jeans. She worked open the buttons from bottom to top, palms sliding over his ridged abdomen, his chest, fingers tugging the curling hair there, then the shirt was fully open. When she slipped the buttons on the cuffs, her nails scraped his wrist pulse, then trailed down the opening of the sleeve as far as it would allow.</p><p>\u201cLift your hands from the handles and put them behind your back.\u201d</p><p>As he complied, she slid the shirt off his shoulders, slow. When she got it to his elbows, she shifted her grip so she was pulling on the collar only and putting her other hand directly between his shoulders, palm against his heated flesh, nails scraping as she pulled the shirt free. Her fingers lingered on the tattoo on his rib cage. She seemed to like touching that one quite a bit.</p><p>He only had the one, representing a mission where he and his team had taken out three high-level insurgents. They\u2019d also lost three men of their own that day; hence the three prongs of the trident for the three lost men, and the three skulls for the three enemies removed. He had it on a mission patch, but while he\u2019d been in the SEALs he\u2019d never marked his body, since tattoos could reveal his branch of service if he was captured. But when it was clear he would never return to the SEALs, he\u2019d needed the connection. It had been the last mission he\u2019d done.</p><p>Now he thought about what she had inked on her back. Maybe he\u2019d put that design on the opposite side of his rib cage. A symbol of the mission he served now, the one he might want to serve for the rest of his life. Would she like that? It would be an ownership mark of sorts, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cPut your hands back on the handles.\u201d She snapped the locks so he was held to those handles by the cuffs, his body kept close to the wall by them and the one-foot tether to the collar. Her fingers traced his belt. \u201cI liked using your belt on you, that first night. Did you look at the marks on your ass the next day, in the mirror?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She cupped one buttock, squeezed it hard through the fabric, and his cock ached, imagining her hands on both of them, kneading hungrily as he thrust into her wet pussy, serving her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHow did it make you feel?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOwned.\u201d</p><p>No use denying simple truth. It was the word that had come to mind when he\u2019d stared at those fading marks. In a totally different but similar way, it was like carrying a picture of his mother and sister with him whenever he\u2019d been able to do so. That invaluable sense of belonging, of connection, no matter how far from home he got. Which was probably why he was having that crazy thought about the tattoo.</p><p>\u201cA nice answer.\u201d She put her mouth between his shoulder blades and worked down his spine with heated lips and moist tongue. Her hands curved around his waist, following the line of the belt until she reached the front. She loosened the tongue, unbuttoned the jeans, worked the zipper down, her body still against the back of his. Her leg hooked over his thigh and she rubbed her mound over the seam of his ass, making him harden, his muscles tighten. He had to quell a desire to thrust forward, show her what he wanted to do for her. Then she shifted, bringing both feet back to the floor so she could slide her hand into the open jeans.</p><p>\u201cNo underwear. You\u2019re a tease, Max. Who would have guessed? And the area around your cock so smooth and neatly trimmed. You really did make yourself presentable for a lady. You didn\u2019t pick up that tip from your mother, did you?\u201d</p> <p>He strangled on a half chuckle. \u201cNo, not that one.\u201d</p><p>She gripped his cock in a loose curl and slid upward, working the velvet skin along his shaft. A wave of sensation rushed up through his balls, following her touch. She kept doing it, up and down, showing a skillful knowledge of a man\u2019s body. He tried not to thrust into her hand, but it required tightening his buttocks so the muscles were hard steel. She rubbed herself against them, her scantily clad breasts pressed to his bare back. Her nipples had turned into aroused stiff points as she used the friction between their bodies to arouse herself.</p><p>Releasing him, she worked the jeans off his hips. She untied his shoes, had him lift each foot so she could remove them. He could have toed them off. He didn\u2019t like the idea of her having to bend down like that. He bit it back before he spoke though. He didn\u2019t want to be gagged. He was doing well with the blindfold thing, better than he\u2019d expected, but he was still tense enough to know he wouldn\u2019t maintain as well if he lost another perceived freedom. The more he capitulated to her as a Mistress, the more he suspected that would happen. He needed to control the pace as much as possible.</p><p>While she was down there, she wrapped cuffs around his ankles, attached tethers of the same length as the one at his throat and snapped them to hooks in the wall as well. Now he was naked except for collar and cuffs. She straightened, her nails trailing over his ass. One finger tunneled between his buttocks, despite his reflexive tightening there.</p><p>\u201cOpen up for me, Max. Relax.\u201d</p> <p>He recalled what he\u2019d thought about in the car. Ground rules, safe words. Janet had done none of those things with him, relying on their innate understanding of one another, the trust he was attempting to grasp. He could call a stop to it now, but he didn\u2019t. For one thing, she changed her mind about her direction, stroking his flanks briefly before stepping away, leaving him there.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear her footfalls over that wave score, but a moment later he heard the cabinet open and close, the clank as she likely went through what was in that velvet bag. His fingers flexed on the handles and he shifted his weight.</p><p>\u201cOh that was nice. Do that again. You have a superior ass, Max. Dana\u2019s right about that.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced but obeyed, feeling a little foolish until he heard her hum, a note that made him think of a cat eyeing cream. Or in Janet\u2019s case, a lioness eyeing a bull calf.</p><p>When she touched his back again, his muscles eased a fraction. She noted it, pressing her fingers more firmly into his flesh. \u201cI\u2019m here, Max. I\u2019m not leaving the room. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to sound impatient with her. He didn\u2019t want her thinking he was weak, nervous. He just wasn\u2019t great with being blindfolded and that damn wave track masking noise. The speakers must be embedded in this wall. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are. More than fine.\u201d She stroked his buttock again, nails scraping his flesh. \u201cIf I had my way, I\u2019d put you just like this against the wall across from my desk. Of course, there wouldn\u2019t be a K&amp;A female employee who\u2019d get any work done that day, and that would include me, since they\u2019d all be making excuses to come to my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention what Matt would have to say about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d do it when Matt and the others were traveling. It would be a girls-only day on the executive floor. Maybe I\u2019d invite Savannah, Dana, Cassandra, Marcie and Rachel for lunch. Strap you down on the boardroom table. Do you know the new one converts to a St. Andrew\u2019s Cross of sorts? Designed by Jon, of course. I\u2019d blindfold you like this, and they\u2019d tease, taste, bite. Feed you bits of their lunch. Perhaps I\u2019d talk to Peter about it beforehand, so I could order Dana to wrap her lips around your cock, make her suck you to orgasm but deny her one of her own, punish her for taking liberties with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. She\u2019s just... It doesn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean anything? No, perhaps not. Until you belong to a Mistress. And then it\u2019s a serious infraction.\u201d Her palm slid down his side, over the trident and skull tattoo, down to his hip, then back to his front, stroking his groin, his stiff cock, fingernails tracing the corona, thumb pressing against the slit as she took hold of him again like the gear shift of her Mustang. \u201cShe and I will have to talk about that.\u201d</p><p>He groaned as she eased under his arm, bringing her body between his and the wall. A scraping noise, like heavy plastic, and then he realized she\u2019d brought a small footstool, because when she stepped onto it he felt the touch of her breath on his brow, meaning she was a couple inches taller than him. Unhooking his tether, she wound it around her hand so that he felt the pull of it against the collar when she rested the point of her wrist on his pectoral. She allowed the strap enough slack to turn her back to him, put it over her shoulder, tugging upward so he lifted his jaw. A moment later, she rubbed her ass against his abdomen.</p><p>His immediate desire was to thrust his cock up between her legs, because he could feel the brush of her thighs against his aroused sex. He suppressed the desire, having enough sense to know that was going to be a punishable offense. A warning tug on that tether reinforced it. However, another second of that delectable ass against him and he might go for it.</p><p>She put her hands over his on the wall, rubbed her ass in a slow circle against him, making that little teasing purr in her throat again. \u201cThe tie to my bikini top is in front of you, Max. Pull it loose with your teeth and you\u2019ll get a reward.\u201d</p> <p>As he leaned forward, she caught his cock between her thighs, squeezing down on it and making him thrust involuntarily. Fuck, she felt good. She chuckled, a dangerous sound.</p><p>\u201cBehave, or you\u2019ll wish you had.\u201d</p><p>First, though, he pressed his lips between her shoulder blades, where the drawing was. He could smell the faint scent of the ink. \u201cI really like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like you.\u201d</p><p>The simple, whimsical response made him smile. He tugged the tie loose, grateful for that slippery fabric that made bikinis easy to remove when dry. She started to turn, so he leaned back, but not very far. He knew just which part of her anatomy would be within reach of his mouth on that turn, and he wanted to be ready if she gave him that reward.</p><p>The beep of the door made him stiffen. He jerked back reflexively, forgetting he was bound, and the cuffs pulled against his wrists, the tether holding him like a dog on a short leash.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s a staff volunteer. I pressed a button requesting a few minutes of assistance. It\u2019s Rita. You know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress Janet.\u201d At the female voice, he didn\u2019t relax, but he did stop pulling. He didn\u2019t like this. He hadn\u2019t heard the door close. The wave sound emitting from the speakers above him might have drowned it out, or it might be standing open.</p><p>\u201cTurn the soundtrack off. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will in a minute if you want me to do so, but think it through. It\u2019s just you, me and Rita. The door is closed and locked, I promise. Can you trust me, Max?\u201d</p><p>He set his teeth. That was the point, he got it. But as much as he might trust her, there was no way he could relax like this. He couldn\u2019t pleasure her the way he wanted to do it, not with half his mind caught up in the vulnerabilities of the environment. But every environment had vulnerabilities. Hell, a well-placed sniper could take out half the tourists in Jackson Square on any given day, and he could have a cup of coffee there without freaking out. The restraints and unfamiliar scenario had shifted him into a defensive mindset, but this wasn\u2019t a third-world country, and he wasn\u2019t here as a SEAL on a mission. He was in a BDSM club in the middle of New Orleans, with a beautiful Mistress demanding only one thing from him. Trust.</p><p>\u201cI was promised a reward,\u201d he managed. He sounded sullen. A little mean.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were.\u201d Her fingers buried in his hair, pulled his head forward. His lips brushed her nipple, and he needed no more invitation than that to latch on and suckle, tease, nip. He licked her breast all around the tip, wanting to arouse every inch of her. He rubbed his face between them, attacked the other one, giving it the same treatment, rough, aggressive, demanding. She dug her hands into his scalp, her body arching into his. His cock pressed between the seam of her thighs, but that was as far as he could get. She had his ankles cuffed to the floor. He couldn\u2019t angle his hips to drive into the naked, eager pussy under that barely there sarong.</p><p>\u201cRita is going to touch your back now.\u201d Janet\u2019s voice was satisfyingly strained, breathy. He pulled on the right nipple so strongly she cried out in pleasure and discomfort at once. Her foot had hooked around his left thigh again. She liked to hold on with her legs. It made him think of that ballet pose where the ballerina stood on one toe, gripped her partner with her other leg like that while he turned them both, their bodies melded together. He\u2019d like Janet to teach him that one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rita\u2019s fingers slid down his back to his ass. Janet rubbed her mound against his body, shifting to brush against his cock, teasing him with the hint of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cI want to fuck you,\u201d he growled against her breast.</p><p>\u201cYou will. When it\u2019s time. When I say. Please me, Max. Let me lead you where we both want to go.\u201d</p><p>Rita\u2019s fingers were now between his ass cheeks. She had something slippery and warm on her fingers, something that heated his skin and tingled on contact. She teased his rim, stroking. His attention zeroed in on that, but then Janet\u2019s cunt brushed him again, this time the wet lips sliding provocatively over the head of his cock. He jerked, and in that moment, two of Rita\u2019s fingers slid inside him. His head came up like a startled stallion, buttocks tightening.</p><p>\u201cNo. What the hell is she doing? Stop.\u201d He twitched, trying to get away from her, but she simply moved with him. As she did, a not-at-all-unpleasant sensation thrummed out from the point where her fingers were. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany straight men enjoy anal stimulation, Max. It\u2019s a mind-blowing experience, I promise you.\u201d Janet\u2019s lips brushed his cheek, that musky gloss scent so near his mouth he reached for it, but she drew back, denying him, teasing him. \u201cRita is going to strap a dildo inside your ass. Once she does that, I\u2019m going to command you to fuck me. When you bring me to climax, the dildo and my pussy will make you want to come. But you\u2019re going to resist until I give you permission, unlike the other night when you misbehaved. And when I finally, finally say you can come, it\u2019s going to feel better than anything you\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was that mesmerizing croon, like a succubus fucking a man straight into hell and making him long for the fire. She\u2019d push him beyond his limits, because she had that quality to her, but he\u2019d been trained to be pushed beyond his limits, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Let me lead you where we both want to go. This wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever fantasized about, but he admitted that sensation Rita had coaxed from his ass had been unexpected. Maybe the biggest hurdle was getting past the idea of it, that he was bound to the wall, being topped by a woman. He\u2019d known when he agreed to it that the night could go this way, though he\u2019d avoided imagining the details. What had been more important was the intention. He was willing to hand that power over to her tonight, to show her what she was beginning to mean to him.</p><p>He understood the blindfold now. That scrap of cloth could help him do something he might not be able to do if he saw himself reflected in her eyes. Accepting the unexpected in oneself was easier without sight, existing in a formless world where she was his one point of contact.</p><p>\u201cMy nipples are feeling neglected.\u201d She didn\u2019t ask him if he was okay with what she\u2019d just laid out, but how he responded to that simple statement would guide her. It really was like a dance, wasn\u2019t it? He expected she saw it that way in her head, and it was probably why she could lose herself in it. She\u2019d brought him on stage with her, to be her partner.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they look like?\u201d His tone was husky, uncertain and demanding at once. Her fingers slid back through his hair, a caress this time, her fingernails scraping the sensitive skin under his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made them swell to the size of cherries. They\u2019re deep, dark red, the flesh around them glistening from your mouth. My breasts are swollen, just like my clit and cunt. I want your cock inside of me.\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth back over her left breast, took as much of it as he could, and began to gently suckle. His cock jumped at the sound of her pleased moan. Rita\u2019s fingers were busy, working more of that oil into him. It was an odd sensation, but still not unpleasant. Just disturbing. When she at last pulled out, she lingered to massage more oil into his rim. His hips bucked at the stimulation, his cock spurting pre-come against his Mistress\u2019 thigh. Janet\u2019s hand slid along his length to the point of contact and collected it. When her arm brushed his shoulder, he knew she\u2019d put it in her mouth, tasting him.</p><p>The firm rubber head of what he assumed was the dildo was placed against his rim, Rita gripping his buttock.</p><p>\u201cPush out against her, Max. And try to relax everything else. Just let it slide in.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the easiest command he\u2019d ever followed, but he managed it. It wasn\u2019t excessively thick, thank God. Janet was merciful enough to go easy on his virgin ass, but his balls drew up, his cock convulsing as Rita seated the dildo and then strapped it around his thighs and hips, cinching it into place. But on top of that, she also cinched something tight around the base of his cock. Something that made him groan and quiver.</p><p>\u201cThat will keep you from going off before I command it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have held out until your command, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so. I like the way your cock looks, all bound up like that. It makes me wetter. Squeeze down on that dildo, Max. Imagine I\u2019m wearing it, thrusting into you.\u201d</p><p>Not an image he ever would have imagined with a woman. He liked to be doing the thrusting, but there was no denying his cock was thick and pulsing, liking whatever that dildo was stimulating. When he squeezed down on it, it got more intense. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Rita. Please leave us now and close the door after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d</p> <p>This time he heard the snick, because he concentrated hard enough on the sound, anticipating when it would happen. Then he turned his attention to better things. His Mistress had brought his head back to her nipples again. She really liked his mouth there, making little whimpering noises to prove it.</p><p>\u201cJanet. You\u2019re driving me crazy. I want to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me. Show me how much. I want to feel your strength, Max. Prove how it can take me over, even as it serves me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop to think what she might mean. He simply acted. He broke the plastic connections to the wrist cuffs with one fierce yank, released one of the ankle cuffs with another sharp snap of his leg. Catching her ass in one hand, he lifted her up against the wall as he put the other behind her head and neck, making sure he hadn\u2019t shifted her on to the metal hook that tethered his collar to the wall. Then he found her mouth and plunged with teeth and tongue, pushing her skull back into the cup of his hand.</p><p>Both of her legs curled around his waist. With the side slit of the sarong all the way to the hip, there was nothing in the way of his other plunge. He\u2019d been right. She wasn\u2019t even wearing an indecently tiny thong under that thin fabric. He\u2019d seen the provocative shadow of her ass, the seam between her buttocks when she left him to go get the blindfold, and now he worked his hand under the fabric so he was clutching flesh when he drove into slick, hot wetness.</p><p>He let out a reverent oath, mirrored by her guttural moan, and he was pounding against her, reveling in the sound of her body hitting the wall with sensual impact. He showed her his strength, how it could serve her, just as she said.</p><p>That thing in his ass was making things even more crazy intense than they already were. He\u2019d gotten impossibly harder, and the cock ring was starting to cut like a son of a bitch. He wasn\u2019t going to be able to come with it there, an agony that would serve his Mistress to the nth degree, since he was staying titanium hard.</p><p>\u201cYour punishment, my pleasure, Max,\u201d she whispered against his ear, his Mistress inside his world of darkness. \u201cI\u2019m going to come, and you\u2019re going to listen, and beg me for the same privilege. But I\u2019ll make you service my pussy with your mouth until I come again, before I even consider it. With that dildo still inside, I\u2019m going to flog you, make your skin burn fiery red. Then, and only then, I\u2019ll let you come. I\u2019ll play with it, push it in and out, and you\u2019ll come into a condom. Your punishment. You get your Mistress\u2019 pussy after that. If you can still get hard at that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it, Mistress.\u201d He said it between clenched teeth, everything in him worked up, like a battle rage but different, everything driven by the need in his cock, by her scent, by the taunt in her voice that was all seductive cruelty. She wanted to wear him out, wring every ounce of sensation from him, turn him into a mindless fucking machine. Make him let go of his will and serve her with everything he was. Exactly like his instructors had done during Hell Week.</p><p>He was going to give it all to her, even more than he\u2019d given to them. And he thought he\u2019d given them everything.</p><p>When he\u2019d pulled his cuffs away from the wall, he\u2019d used enough force that one of the metal handles had cracked the sheetrock. She\u2019d pay for that damage, of course, but it had been worth it, on so many levels.</p><p>Now she sat on the bull\u2019s-eye chair, studying him. He was on his hands and knees in the middle of the floor, condom rolled onto his aching cock, wrists still in cuffs, locked to each other while he clasped a metal bar embedded in the floor. She\u2019d ordered him to spread his knees and was studying his gorgeous ass, the quivering of his flanks. He\u2019d just come into the condom, and his head was down, forehead pressed to his knuckles. She held the cock ring in her hand, working it around two of her fingers like a tiny hula hoop. It was slick from the sweat off his balls, the lube that had slipped out of his ass, the semen trickling from his cock.</p><p>He\u2019d come while she was flogging him. She\u2019d used a medium-weight flogger, knowing his nerves were aroused enough that the slap on his tender inner thighs, the crease between legs and ass, the muscle layers of the upper back, would intensify the sensations as if she was using a heavier weight. She\u2019d driven him to the finish like a drover over a team of wild horses. Reaching down between strokes, she worked off the cock ring, squeezing the thick base of him with deep pleasure, and then started flogging the upper back again.</p><p>With the other hand, she\u2019d started to work that dildo in and out, in and out. If she\u2019d tried to fuck him with it earlier, he likely would have frozen, but at that point it was all about the physical sensation. She\u2019d worked him too hard, too relentlessly, for a little macho hang-up like his concerns about sexual orientation to get in the way. He\u2019d convulsed, bucked, his face contorting, and managed to strangle out the words he\u2019d instinctively known to reach for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMistress...I need to...can I...\u201d</p><p>From a true sub, she would have demanded, May I come, Mistress? Maybe even made him hold out a little longer.</p><p>Instead, she stopped flogging him and bent over his body, wrapping her arm around the great chest, pressing her hips against the curve of his buttocks, giving the dildo a firm push with her pelvis. \u201cLet go for me, Max.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d roared with it, overpowering the thunder of the waves she expected he\u2019d forgotten during that key moment, though he\u2019d stayed intensely aware of his surroundings far longer than she\u2019d expected. She\u2019d wanted him to lose focus, to see if he could trust her that much, if she could overcome bone-deep training. Arrogance on her part, an unreasonable demand, but it was a female thing she wouldn\u2019t deny herself.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say for certain he\u2019d completely let go of that control, but he\u2019d joined her on the beach for certain. She could live with that.</p><p>Rising from the chair now, she eased the dildo out of him, wrapping it in a towel and moving to the sink to leave it there. She found a bottle of cold water in the mini-fridge and came back to him. Folding down on her knees beside him, she touched his face and brought it up, curling her fingers in the collar he wore. She didn\u2019t ever want to take it off him. She wanted to make him a permanent one, something with steel links that she could toy with, twist in her fingers to tighten it when she drew him down to her for a kiss, that would mark his flesh when he slept in it.</p><p>She\u2019d put him in the zone, but she was deep in there with him.</p><p>She told him to release the bar and straighten. She didn\u2019t unlatch the cuffs from each other, so his bound hands rested on his thighs as she brought the bottle to his lips. He drank from her hand as she stroked his face, his sweat-dampened hair. He\u2019d worried that he was like the others, that he was no different, and she wasn\u2019t ever going to allow him to think that. She loosened the blindfold, letting it fall away so he could see the rapture she knew was in her expression, the sheer bliss shining out of her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cThat was stunning, Max.\u201d</p><p>He was...dazed wasn\u2019t the right word. He was too self-aware for that. But he was definitely in what was probably the SEAL version of post-subspace. Breathing leveling out but still deep, a quiver in all his muscles. Everything riveted on her, body and mind caught in a curious stillness, no words to say. He turned his head to kiss her hand, mouth working over her fingers, moving to her wrist, down her forearm. He brought his bound hands up to hold it, then drew her forward, his knees spreading to bring her as close as the restraints allowed. He captured her mouth, his fingers still wrapped like a manacle around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMy Mistress.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, captivated by his power over her senses. She clasped his shoulders with her free hand, deepening the kiss, but he was through letting her take the lead. When he broke the hasp between the two cuffs, she had to suppress a curse. He\u2019d gone through a fair half dozen clips tonight. It didn\u2019t matter though, not in the face of more important things. He wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her against his body so she straddled him there on his knees.</p><p>\u201cTake off the condom,\u201d he said against her mouth. \u201cI want to feel your pussy when I shove into it.\u201d</p><p>As she reached down between them, she found her fingers were shaking. He hadn\u2019t been boasting. He was recovering fast, and she was more than happy to help, tossing the used condom to the side and closing her hand over him to caress his cock. He caught his hand in her hair, tongue lashing hers, every muscle in his body showing his demand, his need for her. He worked her against him, kneading her ass, rubbing his shaft with devilish skill against her swollen clit as he got stiffer.</p> <p>\u201cYou must take Viagra,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what your cunt is for me, Mistress. It makes me hard just to think about it.\u201d He tugged her head back, arching her throat, and then he was biting and kissing her there as he continued that massage between their bodies. Janet writhed on him, working herself over him. With a primal sound of demand, he used that impressive strength to turn her away from him, put her on her hands and knees. In one shift, he was behind her, his cock still stimulating her clit, only now he was erect enough he could do it with his pelvis flush against her ass, hips working as he rubbed the ridged head against her pussy.</p><p>She\u2019d never done it like this. Not since Jorge did it to obviously dominate her. Which was what Max was doing, but in an entirely different way, with entirely different responses. I\u2019m yours...but I can do this to you, because you\u2019re also mine...</p><p>That was the message, and it overwhelmed her. With him, she accepted it, didn\u2019t resist either side of that coin, and relished both.</p><p>He draped himself over her, taking her to her elbows with the gentle pressure of his body. He fastened his teeth on the back of her neck where her hair had fallen away, exposing the nape. He licked her there too, still moving his hips against her, and she was lifting up to him. One large hand cupped her breast, squeezed and she let out a soft gasp at the pleasure that shot from the pinched nipple to her core.</p><p>\u201cCan never get enough,\u201d he muttered, biting her shoulder, then kissing it. Pain followed by a soothing caress, and she was so caught up in those sensations his penetration took her by surprise. One lift of his hips and he\u2019d slid home like he\u2019d slide his sidearm into its holster, sure and straight, powerful and strong. Strong enough that it plowed her deeper onto her elbows and he banded an arm around her waist, holding her close to his body, breath hot on her neck.</p><p>\u201cWant to fuck you forever, Mistress. Make you come all over my cock, make you scream my name.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, the pleasure of his demands and desires sweeping over her. The passion gripping him now had as much to do with what she\u2019d stirred in him while he was her captive as with her being in his arms now. Cradled like an egg even as he vowed to shatter her universe.</p> <p>She pushed back against him, challenging him with her answer. When she tossed her head back, he caught her jaw, fingers pressing into it to turn her face to him. Sealing his mouth over hers in a powerful, deep plunge, he began to work his cock inside her. When his hand dropped from her face to slide beneath her, she bucked her hips, reacting to his clever touch upon her clit. The man had multiple talents while fucking, thank the gods.</p><p>He growled in satisfied response to her moans, driving into her harder. His fingers bit into her hip as his other hand pinched, stroked, worried her clit until she was rotating against him, slamming back into his cock over and over. She could have squeezed down on him, tried to take over the pace of the climax, but there was nothing now but the wild, rushing whitewater ride of their pleasure together. As she went over that pinnacle once again, she screamed out his name, just as he\u2019d desired and threatened. And he called out for her as he joined her on that fall.</p><p>They\u2019d been quiet for a while. Max was idly stroking the line of her back as she lay on his chest, her thigh draped over his. Janet was glad she\u2019d booked the room for the night, as she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d have the strength to get up anytime in the next hour. She was...well, sated might not even cover it. This was like a human form of paradise, everything so utterly right, so perfect, that there was no desire to move. Hadn\u2019t there been a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode like that, where Buffy and Riley were caught in a euphoria where they didn\u2019t want to come out of a bedroom? Of course they were magically ensorcelled and bad things were eventually going to happen as a result. Unlike this situation, where she felt everything that should be right with the world was here in this room.</p><p>She shared the Buffy part of that thought with Max, won the lazy, devastating smile she\u2019d hoped to see, to verify he was feeling the same way. He was a big, replete male animal, and she wanted to simultaneously devour and lie upon him like this forever.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t figure you for a Buffy fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie was, as a teenager. When Cass and Lucas were on their honeymoon, we were taking shifts, staying at the house at night so she\u2019d have an adult to help out with the younger children. She and I did an all-nighter, watching a marathon of Buffy episodes. She talked me into it.\u201d</p><p>Max grunted. His fingertips whispered over her buttocks, circled, came back. She couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d last relaxed in a lover\u2019s arms, both of them naked like this. Or when she\u2019d last given a lover total access to her body, the permission to touch implicit with every breath, every heartbeat, rather than a formal structure. This was beyond issues of rules or restrictions. She needed his hands on her, wanted him to touch her however, whenever he wanted to do so. And she wanted to do the same.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head down to hold his lips against hers in a lingering touch. When he pulled back, just enough to break the connection, he touched her face, fingers sliding along her jaw.</p><p>\u201cI think it was everything we both wanted it to be. I\u2019ve no regrets, Mistress. And any time you want to do something like that again...I\u2019m game. As long as it\u2019s just with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. I had the Miami Dolphins\u2019 cheerleaders all lined up to jump you, but since you\u2019re going to insist on being monogamous...\u201d</p><p>Laughter vibrated through his chest as he lay back again. \u201cWell, maybe I spoke too soon. I can be more open-minded with the right motivation. How about if the cheerleaders were jumping you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cYou\u2019d prefer that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, probably. I\u2019d love to watch you get it on with another woman. Maybe even more than one, though a whole cheerleading squad might get too chaotic. But as far as I\u2019m concerned...I just want you, Janet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are either an incredibly good liar, or you\u2019re...\u201d Her words drifted off as she looked into his steady gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can say it,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you that day, with Amanda. It\u2019s still true. Fuck, I\u2019ve pretty much known since that day at the hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed, sat up. \u201cYet for six months...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did nothing. Yeah. I\u2019m chickenshit, what can I say? I wasn\u2019t sure if it was one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she decided. \u201cYou weren\u2019t afraid. You were waiting.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her hair a tug. \u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman to bullshit. Like your boss. Were you two created in the same alien pod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we exploded from the same chest, complete with teeth.\u201d But Janet put a hand on his lips, tracing them, her thoughts whirling. \u201cWhy did you wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were the type who made the first move. My job was being ready with the right second one.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that, but his expression became thoughtful. \u201cWhat we just did...it wasn\u2019t exactly like I expected. It took over until it wasn\u2019t clear who was what, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf done right, that\u2019s exactly where you hope to get.\u201d She lay back down on his chest, slid her fingertips through the light mat of hair there. \u201cWhen Matt first took me to a club, introduced me to things, I was still in a very resistant phase. Jon was there too, and he sat with me for a while. While he was keeping me company, he drew my attention to a couple. The man was tied to a frame, and she was whipping him. For the half hour we watched, she used a variety of emotional and physical means to shake him up, break him down. When I first started watching, all I saw was the bondage, the pain, but Jon made me look at their expressions, their body language.</p> <p>\u201cIn time, I saw what he was seeing. The Mistress was as wrapped up in things as the sub. There was a thread between them, so vibrant and strong that it quivered every time one of them uttered a word or made the slightest motion. His body was gleaming with sweat, and I could see the marks she\u2019d left on his back and ass. When her fingernails glided over them, he quivered as if he was being touched by a Goddess, totally enraptured by her will. But I also saw her expression when he reached that state, the softening of her mouth, the way she gravitated toward him.\u201d</p><p>She shifted, propping her chin on his shoulder. \u201cAre you familiar with the yin and yang symbol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little black and white circle decal a lot of kids put on their cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one. Though adults have been known to put those on their cars too.\u201d Janet pinched him, but she settled deeper into the curve of his body, fingers tucked under his shoulder beneath her, her other arm stretched out so she could stroke his bare hip the way he was stroking her back. She traced a line to his upper thigh, shifted her knee so it rubbed with sensual idleness against his testicles.</p><p>\u201cJon said that when a session starts, it\u2019s like the black side of the symbol, with the small white spot in the middle. The Dom is the black, surrounding the sub, making her feel small, safe, like a cat in a box. Have you ever noticed how cats like to do that, get into a small box, as if being contained by that limited environment makes them feel safe? The Dom takes over, takes control. Psychologically, physically, giving the sub a limited world within his commands. If they\u2019re doing it right, eventually the sub lets go of control, surrenders. When the session progresses, something amazing happens. The other side of the symbol. The sub\u2019s energy grows and surrounds the Dom, the white taking over. The Dom becomes the black speck, like a sorcerer in the middle of an energy cloud, amazed by what\u2019s been unleashed by their interaction with one another. It\u2019s a form of rapture, for both. Yin and yang. A circle and balance both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like Jon\u2019s kind of thinking.\u201d He smiled against her forehead.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of truth you can hear, but until you reach it yourself, you don\u2019t feel it, believe it. And then it feels like it came straight from your own soul, even if someone\u2019s already said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She could feel him thinking that through, so she stayed silent until he worked it out, spoke. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got it right...based on how it felt to me. When we first started talking about this, I admit I found it hard to understand. Especially after you told me about what had happened to you. It seemed like the last thing you\u2019d want to do is take away someone else\u2019s power, give them pain.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arm around her back, preventing her from drawing away. \u201cI get that it\u2019s not the same thing now, but when you were on the wrong side of that coin for so long, it seemed odd to me that you\u2019d stay so close to the line, even on the right side, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d She pushed down her automatic defensiveness. \u201cPeople come to this for so many different reasons. There\u2019s no one single motive for it. When Matt and Jon showed me that side of things, I realized what a profound difference there was between it and what Jorge did to me. Such that every session I did with a sub was a big black line on the universe, underscoring that difference. I was saying this is what holding power over someone for mutual pleasure is. The power of that synergy, of that yin and yang, is so much more than Jorge ever found imprisoning me the way he did.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cAnother part of it was confirming to myself that I wasn\u2019t him. That though I did what I did to get away from him, it wasn\u2019t the same. I can hold control over others, and I don\u2019t cause harm. I don\u2019t take without giving back in equal or greater measure.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin, met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m self-aware enough to know that might be a coping mechanism rather than truth, but if you can find an illusion to bring balance to your reality, it makes every day possible, manageable. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does. Other things do that as well. Moments like this.\u201d</p><p>She had no disagreement with that. She laid her fingers on his lips. \u201cI guess we need to be thinking about clearing out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d But neither of them moved. She studied him, pondering, then realized there was nothing to think about. She simply refused to let go of him. \u201cI want you to come home with me, Max. Share my bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>His gray eyes kindled with heat, telling her they\u2019d be doing more than sleeping. Probably several times. She was going to need some painkillers in the morning. That was fine\u2014she\u2019d gladly swallow down a bottle of Advil to pay for a night like that.</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>He stayed until Monday morning, something she hadn\u2019t expected herself to offer. But he helped her prune and trim the shrubs, edged the walkway. They took strolls around the district, ate at small holes-in-the-wall restaurants that offered better food than opulent ones. When Saturday night came and they were sharing takeout on her living room floor, watching television, it seemed natural to invite him to share her bed once again. Especially when he carried her up there and gave her a memorable bedtime story.</p><p>On Monday, he offered to take her to work, if she didn\u2019t mind going by his place that morning so he could pick up clean clothes. She didn\u2019t mind. She hadn\u2019t minded waking up with him curved around her body, the smell of him on her skin, the lingering stickiness of his seed between her legs from the couple times they\u2019d come together in the night. Her designer pillows had spent the weekend scattered about the floor of her bedroom like a flock of colorful sheep. There hadn\u2019t been room on her bed for them and a sprawling, large man like Max. She liked the new look.</p><p>Showering with him had been an indulgence that almost made her forget it was a workday. He\u2019d given her sore back muscles a thorough massage under the jets. When he\u2019d moved down to her lower back and hips, she\u2019d let out a noise that he observed sounded close to orgasmic. He\u2019d also knelt and sponged off her thighs, cleaning in between while she watched him, bemused, threading her fingers through his wet hair.</p><p>He placed an almost chaste kiss on her mound, her clit, her labia, then suckled beads of water off her skin, tongue making slow, heated circles beneath the spray that had her gripping the wall bar and her thighs loosening. His hands slid up behind her buttocks, supporting her as he worked her up to a slow, decadent climax that sighed out of her body. He hadn\u2019t asked for anything after that, simply standing to give her a kiss, letting her taste herself on his wet mouth.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he\u2019d murmured, though he\u2019d been hard against her abdomen, enough she rubbed against him, teasing. He\u2019d turned away with a glint in his eye that promised he\u2019d want to get back at her later for that. \u201cWe better get to my place if I\u2019m going to have us to work on time.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at his house, he parked her at his scarred kitchen table with an excellent cup of coffee they\u2019d picked up at the corner, from a store with bars on the windows and graffiti on the outside walls. She sipped it, studying the dismal backyard he had, neatly mowed but otherwise devoid of flowers or even a decent shrub. No cover for an approach, she realized. He had a clear view of any of the neighboring houses, small shoeboxes like his own. He might have grown up poor, but she expected his mother in Texas had had at least a flower box, little touches to make even a poor house a home.</p><p>Ah well. Inside his safe, all his guns, grenades and rocket launchers were likely arranged with the proper feng shui.</p><p>She smiled into her coffee, then heard the sound of a vehicle stopping out front. From the roar of the diesel engine, she guessed an old pick-up truck. When she heard a door slam, she assumed a neighbor was picking up a carpool companion. However, a moment later, a large man strode into the backyard and onto the broken concrete walkway, headed toward the back door. While he moved confidently, she noted a hitch in his step, a slight limp.</p><p>It was more than the clean-shaven jaw and close-cropped dark hair, handsomely peppered with silver, that told her this was one of Max\u2019s brothers-in-arms. He had the same alpha-male-capable-of-handling-anything expression. She wondered if they ran them through a press at BUD/S graduation, stamping it on their faces.</p><p>She was sitting in the corner nook, not visible until he opened the door and stepped in, but his eyes went to her immediately. She\u2019d surprised him, she could tell, and she expected that didn\u2019t happen often. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said genially. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize Max had company.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot a common occurrence?\u201d</p><p>An amused look crossed his rugged features. \u201cHonoring the bro code, I\u2019d say that\u2019s need-to-know, but you have eyes. What woman would come to this dump willingly? He didn\u2019t kidnap you, did he?\u201d He bent to look beneath the table. \u201cNo chains, but if you want to make a dash for my truck, I\u2019ll get you to safety\u2014and to a place that doesn\u2019t have lingering eau-de-crack-house, what this place used to be.\u201d</p><p>When she chuckled, enjoying him, he offered his hand. \u201cDale Rousseau.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJanet.\u201d</p><p>The pressure of his fingers and the direct look telegraphed another quality, one she\u2019d seen often enough for her to guess she and Dale had something else vital in common. She decided to throw out a line and see if she was right.</p><p>\u201cSo, did Max come to you for advice on how to deal with someone like you and me?\u201d</p><p>His slow smile told her she\u2019d hit the target. \u201cLots of differences between a Master and Mistress. I hopefully told him enough not to get his ass chewed off. How\u2019d he do with the information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe exceeded expectations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe always does.\u201d</p><p>She ran her gaze over him, a thorough appraisal of the broad shoulders, the fit body that looked solid and unstoppable as a Mack semi. When he shifted, the tilt of his head, the hitch in his step, brought the whole package together, and she realized he was familiar to her. She was almost certain he was an occasional regular at Club Progeny. Though he was always masked, his public sessions with submissives were memorable enough that Janet had watched more than one of them. He was thorough and overwhelming, an artist of their craft.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask if he recognized her as well. With the level of detail Max brought to every encounter, if this man was of the same stripe, the decorative mask she wore for public play wouldn\u2019t hamper his ability to pick her out of a crowd. \u201cWould you like to share my coffee? I still have half a cup. I\u2019m sure I can find a mug here to split it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in these cabinets except roach powder, though he usually keeps a supply of paper plates for takeout. Since he mostly swigs beer and bottled water, paper cups aren\u2019t a priority.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t gotten as far as snooping through Max\u2019s cabinets, but when Dale crossed the spare couple strides to the nearest one and opened it, she saw he was right. Even to the roach powder. Her brow creased.</p><p>Everything about Max\u2019s house was neat, clean, well-ordered. But as she\u2019d noted on her earlier visit, except for his clothing, a pocket change jar and a file cabinet for some paperwork, there was nothing personal in the house. Even the blankets on his bed looked like they\u2019d been picked up from an Army-Navy supply store.</p> <p>\u201cIn all fairness, given the neighborhood and the fact he\u2019s here so rarely, he doesn\u2019t buy things that can be stolen. He doesn\u2019t lock his doors, so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about repairing broken windows.\u201d Dale shook his head at her expression. \u201cDon\u2019t judge the boy too harshly for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother and sister were his home,\u201d she said.</p><p>After a pause, during which he was clearly evaluating how much she knew about their common subject, Dale inclined his head. \u201cNot sure he knows how to make one without them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides which, he\u2019s still down range, isn\u2019t he? Still working the mission.\u201d</p><p>Dale\u2019s eyes sharpened on her. She leaned forward. \u201cAre you helping him find the last one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me he shouldn\u2019t be doing that, that he should be moving forward with his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He sat down across from her. When she pushed her coffee over to him, he took a sip, handed it back to her. \u201cYou take it strong. No cream or sugar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like diluting the full strength of something meant to be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m liking you better and better. You won\u2019t be able to talk him out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. But did he try other options? The police?\u201d She knew the hypocrisy of pointing it out, but she cared enough about him she asked anyway.</p><p>Dale grunted. \u201cMax has a healthy respect for the law, the Constitution\u2014the real deal, not the crap that people and politicians twist to serve their own purposes. But he gets there\u2019s a difference between justice and the law sometimes, and justice gets served first when we have the ability and choice to make the call. This call is his choice. No muss, no fuss, no drama. He\u2019s not going to talk about it, but I guarantee it takes up about a third of his brain space every day.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cI expect the other two-thirds is probably about you. So you still have the majority of his brain cells, if that\u2019s a comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompetition is not my major concern, not when it comes to this.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cWhy do you limp, if it\u2019s not too personal to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmputation below the knee. Lost it during an explosion.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze swept downward, and now she noticed how one pants leg seemed to crease differently below the knee. At her look, Dale reached across, closed his hand on hers. He rested it on what felt like a plastic cuff molded to his knee joint beneath the denim. Continuing downward on her own, she felt the solid metal shaft he had instead of a leg. He wore hiking shoes, such that except for the slight limp, she wouldn\u2019t have guessed it.</p><p>She looked up. They were almost eye to eye. He gave her a faint smile, nodded and straightened.</p><p>It affected her peculiarly, feeling metal and plastic where a firm calf should have been. She moved her touch to his other leg for comparison. It was intimate, forward behavior, but Dale didn\u2019t object. She gripped the calf as he flexed beneath her touch and offered her a somber wink. When she sat up, sat back, her stomach was doing an odd flip-flop. That could have been Max. Or instead of losing a limb, he might not have come home. His sister would have been all alone in the world, and Janet would never have known him.</p><p>You might as well say it. I\u2019ve known since the hospital... She hadn\u2019t said it. Unlike him, she wasn\u2019t ready to accept the strength of his feelings, let alone her own. This moment didn\u2019t really leave her a place to hide from that, did it?</p><p>She reclaimed her coffee, took a bracing swallow. \u201cYou know what happens when you break them down, break them open. You understand who and what they are. There\u2019s no compromising that. I wouldn\u2019t want to compromise what Max is, but I have a real problem with him doing anything that would take him away from me, by death or imprisonment. I\u2019m a selfish bitch that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, God bless you. Hope that he starts to see things your way.\u201d Dale fished a card out of his pocket, slid it across the table to her. A phone number was handwritten on it. \u201cMy cell,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case you ever need it.\u201d</p><p>Janet lifted her gaze, held his. He had unusual blue-green eyes, but in them she saw a clear message. With a nod, she slipped the card into her pocket, took another sip of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou know, sound carries through this house like a megaphone,\u201d Max said, arriving in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself, Ack Ack. These walls are thin enough people could sit in the street and hear you,\u201d Dale said comfortably. \u201cBrought you the yard and plumbing tools you wanted for Gayle\u2019s next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate it. I would have come and gotten them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh. I was in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Janet turned to see Max shrugging into his shirt. Today it was tailored silk and cotton, coupled with slacks. Matt had an important meeting at the Omni Royal, one that called for his driver to wear formal attire to properly impress the attending members. As he buttoned the shirt, Max moved into the kitchen, touching her shoulder before claiming his own coffee from the counter. He didn\u2019t seem particularly perturbed by Dale\u2019s discussion with her, but from the glance the men exchanged, she realized Dale wouldn\u2019t have imparted anything to her that Max wouldn\u2019t want her to know.</p><p>\u201cSo did you check to see if he had a prosthetic ass while you were groping him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat looked nicely real to me,\u201d she said without missing a beat. \u201cBut I\u2019d be happy to verify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not challenge this one,\u201d Dale advised. \u201cShe\u2019ll kick your balls into your throat. And then grope my ass while you\u2019re curled up like a shrimp on your dingy-looking tile floor. Jesus, buy some cheerful linoleum. Something with little yellow and blue flowers. At least a freaking potholder. I\u2019m getting you a potholder for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Janet looked between the two men, amused, but then focused on Max, brow raised. \u201cAck Ack?\u201d</p><p>Max rolled his eyes. \u201cMy nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of like Maverick or Ice Man from Top Gun, only a lot less cool-sounding.\u201d Dale winked. \u201cIt\u2019s from an early John Cusack movie, One Crazy Summer. There\u2019s a character in it who\u2019s a mild-mannered Boy Scout. He always comes through in a pinch. Face like a choir boy, heart of a lion and stubborn as hell when he\u2019s sure he\u2019s right. His nickname was Ack Ack. It fit, on all levels.\u201d</p><p>Scraping back his chair, Dale rose, giving her a nod and another wink, then directed his parting words to Max. \u201cI\u2019m due at the community center. Let me know if you need anything else for Gayle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing them by.\u201d</p><p>Dale raised a hand, letting himself out the back door without another word. The minimalist communication of the Homo sapiens male, Janet thought. A moment later, they heard the diesel roar of the truck starting up.</p><p>She put down her coffee, just in time to have Max lift her under the arms, turn and sit her up on the counter, putting himself in between her knees. He pushed up her short work skirt, his fingers sliding along her thighs under the hem. \u201cYou wore stockings just to drive me crazy,\u201d he muttered against her mouth. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>She gave back as good as given on that heated kiss, but then she pushed him back, holding him off. Somewhat. He started on her throat, his body pressed close enough to her core that she felt his erection grinding against her. \u201cI thought you said we had to be to work on time.\u201d Despite her protest, she slid her arm over his shoulders, bringing him closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe will be. Need you. Just need you, Mistress. Please.\u201d</p><p>It was the please that did it. The almost desperate request of a man who always seemed so self-possessed. Maybe her being here, amid the bare evidence of his life outside of his work, had sparked this response. She was real and alive, part of the present and his tentative future. A stark contrast to his past, that poignant desolation provoking a clash between the light and the dark.</p><p>She knew that feeling. At particularly bright moments, she still occasionally experienced it, that blot of darkness on the sun, the memory of blood in a bathroom. Hacking through a throat with a meat cleaver. She clung to him tighter and surrendered to their mutual passion, willing to be swept away from nightmares together.</p> <p>The emotions he\u2019d stirred up there at the end lingered with her, making her feel unsettled. Not wrong, exactly, not after such an incredible weekend, but emotional upheaval was emotional upheaval, and even the good kind could stir the silt at the bottom. The war between dark and light wasn\u2019t something that could be shrugged off lightly.</p><p>One member of the K&amp;A team knew that better than anyone. Unfortunately, it appeared the condition was contagious this morning, because when she arrived Ben sounded as unsettled as she felt.</p><p>She heard him snarling at someone on his phone, then he slammed it down with a creative combination of oaths that could fill a swear jar to the brim. \u201cAlice,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Janet dropped her purse and keys on her desk and moved down the hallway to his office. It was in a separate wing due to the confidential nature of the things he handled, but in this mood, he could be heard clearly. \u201cAlice is off this morning. Doctor\u2019s appointment, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Fucking great.\u201d He muttered it under his breath, so she decided to let it pass. He looked tired, telling her he\u2019d been here all night. When his therapy session dredged up particularly difficult things and he got in a foul mood over it, sometimes he came to his couch here, rather than taking the attitude home to Marcie. Janet knew he\u2019d do better if he went home to her, but men could be stubborn about that, especially a man determined to give the woman he loved only the best side of himself. He sometimes forgot that what Marcie wanted most was all of him, good and bad. It made Janet think of her discussion with Dale again.</p> <p>Ben launched into another tirade. \u201cSomebody down at the courthouse royally fucked up the filing of the Watkins affidavit. Missed the deadline. The asshole judge, who likes to jerk our chain, has rescheduled the hearing for fucking two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Stacie in the clerk\u2019s office. She owes me a favor. She might be able to fix that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cFucking do it then.\u201d</p><p>As Janet patiently waited, he stopped, closed his eyes. Pivoted away from her. She could almost hear him counting. He didn\u2019t turn back toward her, but when he spoke, his tone was more even. \u201cSorry, Janet. No excuse for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s not. It\u2019s just a piece of paper or two.\u201d When he glanced over his shoulder at her, she kept her expression neutral. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made me agree to marry her. This spring. I was going to let them know this morning, before the Omni.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI assume you mean Marcie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The hooker on the corner who gives me insider trading tips. Yes, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>It made sense now, what had dredged up the same attitude he had after a bad therapy session. Despite the fact he likely wouldn\u2019t welcome it, she crossed the room and touched his arm, drawing his green eyes to her. \u201cYou deserve her, Ben. You belong together. She loves you tremendously. And you staying here on the evenings when you can\u2019t make it all make sense? It\u2019s stupid and wrong, and it hurts her, shuts her out.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a narrow look. \u201cYou finally decide to put down the whip and see a guy without a leash, after how many years, and you want to talk to me about shutting people out? Sounds like you\u2019re the real expert on that. Mistress.\u201d</p><p>The derision in his tone was intended to cut, and it did. It was ironic that she recognized the tactic so well, exactly because of what he\u2019d just pointed out. They weren\u2019t all that different. Except she could step back from this and see his misery. His fear.</p><p>She dug her nails into his wrist, right above his insanely expensive Louis Vuitton watch. \u201cBen O\u2019Callahan, you\u2019re being rude and cruel. Do it again, and I\u2019ll slap your ear through your head.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened further. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come in here. And if you draw blood and get it on my cuff, you\u2019re paying for the dry cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she said. \u201cBen, think about Dana, and her PTSD. She worked through it, because she wanted to heal, to be the best person possible for Peter. He loves her so much, doing anything less is unacceptable to her.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her, then his attention shifted to the window. Sensing a similar shift of his mood, she touched his jaw. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing, trying to heal the scars of the past to be a better person for yourself and Marcie, it would be tremendously difficult for anyone. But you\u2019re doing it, Ben. You are a remarkable man. I think you forget that far too often.\u201d</p><p>When his gaze flickered, she caught a glimpse of what she was painfully aware lay behind the formidable Master, the exemplary lawyer. The younger version of himself, so unsure of his own worth.</p><p>\u201cLet Marcie be everything for you that you want to be for her,\u201d she said gently. \u201cThat\u2019s the deal, and as much a part of healing as anything else.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, but when she dropped her hand to his arm again, he glanced at it. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pain in my ass,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cYes. I love you too.\u201d The worst had passed. She squeezed him, moved back toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the affidavit with Stacie. You get ready to tell them your good news. They\u2019re going to be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Coming out into the office area, she saw the insulated bag with her homemade lunch on her desk. She\u2019d left it in Max\u2019s truck by accident, but of course her SEAL had noticed, brought it up for her. The gesture cut some of the tension the confrontation with Ben had provoked, but not as much as she would have liked. She rubbed her forehead, rolled her shoulders.</p><p>At least when she came around her desk, she noticed the light on her phone that indicated Ben\u2019s line was engaged. It stayed that way for nearly ten minutes, telling her it was likely that he\u2019d called and talked to Marcie. Either way, when he emerged from his office and came toward the boardroom for their pre-Omni Royal strategy session, he looked easier.</p><p>She sat in on that meeting, but she was relieved it would be a short one. Ben\u2019s turmoil had obviously pushed a few of her own buttons. What she deserved, what she wanted. The silt everyone brought into their relationships. She felt like the lid of a kettle, sitting on a building pressure.</p><p>Ben\u2019s good news would help distract her. She hoped. As Matt concluded the meeting and they all shifted, preparing to rise and head out, Ben cleared his throat. Absently, she noted all of them looked so handsome today, dressed in their power suits and ties. Any female attendees of the Omni Royal meeting were in for a treat. How in the hell did Jon\u2019s dark hair always look so gorgeous and silky, feathered back from his brow, the tips brushing his shoulders? Rachel swore he didn\u2019t wear any hair product, which simply confirmed that God was female, and She liked looking at men more than women.</p><p>\u201cThere is one last discussion point, though I don\u2019t want it recorded, in case it comes back to bite me on the ass, which I\u2019m sure it will.\u201d Ben shot Janet a significant look. \u201cMarcie and I are getting married. In the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t already married?\u201d Peter lifted a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so pussy-whipped since you hooked up with that girl, I figured it was already a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says the guy who gave his wife a clone of himself as a limo driver.\u201d</p><p>Dana had always been very flirtatious with Max, part of her M.O. as a hardcore sub who liked to brat for punishment. Even during her earlier discussion with Peter\u2019s wife, Janet hadn\u2019t reacted personally to that aspect of their relationship. But now Janet thought of what she\u2019d said to Max about Dana, in their intense session at Club Progeny. He\u2019d taken that as part of the scene, but given the twinge she felt now, Janet wasn\u2019t so sure she hadn\u2019t meant it.</p><p>Had Peter ever shared Dana with Max? It wouldn\u2019t fit with the K&amp;A men\u2019s usual code of keeping everything within their circle, but there were certain areas she didn\u2019t delve into too deeply for specifics.</p><p>Really, she was going to go there? She needed to do her own personal therapy session if she was getting bogged down in things she normally understood quite well.</p><p>Lucas grinned. He came around Peter to embrace Ben as the K&amp;A lawyer rose. \u201cCongratulations. Don\u2019t ever forget what a lucky bastard you are. Or I\u2019ll be forced to personally beat your head into a wall to remind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Marcie wouldn\u2019t take it off with my restaurant-grade meat cleaver if I forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be your head, my friend. It\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been reaching for her coffee mug. It slipped out of her fingers as they jerked in reaction. She grabbed for it, a mistake, because it was already tilting. She managed to turn a simple spill into a spinning arc of coffee that splattered her tablet, her chair, the carpet, and the front of her pale yellow suit, one of her favorites. As well as her wrist, and it was still quite hot.</p><p>\u201cDamn it all.\u201d</p><p>The men reacted like a well-oiled machine. Peter brought a damp cloth from the sidebar and pressed it to her arm. Lucas retrieved the cup from the floor as Jon dropped a towel on the floor to mop the excess out of the rug. Their quick jump to her rescue made her eyes sting with an appalling emotional reaction.</p><p>Ben brought two additional wet cloths, one for Jon to soak the stain on the carpet, and another for her clothes, which he handed to Peter, since the operations manager was still holding the compress to her arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peter considered her thin blouse, the coffee making it stick to her skin, then extended the cloth to Janet. \u201cI\u2019d do it,\u201d he teased, \u201cbut you might file a harassment suit against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was one of the others, no,\u201d Ben said dryly. \u201cBut due to your well-known obsession with women\u2019s breasts, your ass would be nailed.\u201d</p><p>As the men grinned at her, she tried to smile back. That was when her body betrayed her yet again. Two of the threatening tears made the leap, started sliding down her face. \u201cDamn it.\u201d She snatched the cloth from Peter, started wiping the front of her ruined suit. Her fingers were trembling.</p> <p>A hand gripped her arm, lifted her out of the chair, putting her against a solid, reassuring male chest. Of all the people she\u2019d have expected to step forward at that moment, it was both the biggest surprise yet the most inexplicably suitable choice to find herself in Ben\u2019s arms. Heedless of what the coffee might do to his clothes, he held her close, letting her take shuddering breaths against a wall of muscle as she fought for control. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said against her hair. \u201cFalling in love sucks, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it, she laughed, a broken sound. Then, before she could get uncomfortable about the intimacy, he\u2019d turned her toward Matt. With that exceptional intuition they all had, Ben knew Matt was the one man she\u2019d trust with her raw emotions for more than a few seconds. However, Ben\u2019s hand remained on her shoulder, massaging. Peter clasped the other shoulder, Jon squeezing one of her hands as Lucas stroked her hair. Matt held her other hand against his chest while he rubbed her back.</p><p>As part of her rather extensive classified personal knowledge of the team, she knew the men had more than once worked together to sexually dominate and give a woman the erotic experience of her life. Each of their wives\u2014or intended wives, in Marcie\u2019s case\u2014had been the recipient of that enviable experience. As amazing as that idea was, she wondered if any of them had ever thought of calling on the five of them when the woman in question needed a good cry. The fortress of protective male reassurance was like being inside a warm comforter on a rainy day, with a bottomless thermos of rich hot chocolate at hand. It was as overwhelming an experience as an erotic one.</p><p>She and Matt had a special connection through her bloody past, but it was the first time she realized the K&amp;A men\u2014all of them\u2014saw her as one of theirs, her family when she had no other. They\u2019d closed around her, sheltering her from the world.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late for your meeting,\u201d she managed. Matt squeezed her fingers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make an even grander entrance if I\u2019m late. Send the message that my ass is the most significant one to kiss.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. She\u2019d left tiny dots of moisture on Matt\u2019s white shirt. Her tears, she realized. She glanced up as Matt used his handkerchief to dab at her face, then closed her fingers around the cloth before she could fuss at him for the babying. He gave her a faint smile.</p><p>She took a couple deep breaths. Steadied. When she did, he nodded, touching a brief finger to her cheek in approval.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for yelling at you, Janet,\u201d Ben said. When she turned in Matt\u2019s grasp, the lawyer brushed her arm, another reassurance. \u201cI\u2019m a total prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that wasn\u2019t it.\u201d Gathering her courage, she met each of their gazes, accepted the same thing she\u2019d seen in Matt\u2019s expression. Caring and understanding. \u201cThank you, all of you. You\u2019ve made it better. Now please get the hell out of here and let me go back to being me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas brushed the tender line of her throat with his knuckles. Peter handed her the damp cloth he still held. \u201cRun some more cold water over your arm. There\u2019s some topical in the first-aid kit if you need it, but usually air\u2019s the best thing.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. They exchanged glances with Matt, then, based on that unspoken communication, the other men filed out, leaving her with her boss.</p><p>\u201cI really am fine. I know you\u2019ll be angry if I say I\u2019m sorry, but you know how mortifying I find something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d His serious dark eyes twinkled. \u201cBut you\u2019ve given us verifiable proof you\u2019re human. We\u2019ve had a standing bet about it for some time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She sniffled, trying not to well up again as he pressed his large fingers over her own, reminding her that she was holding his handkerchief. \u201cWho won? Or is that information going to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I\u2019ll tell you anyway. I did.\u201d He winked at her. \u201cIn the beginning, Jon thought you were a very sophisticated robot and Peter agreed. He said you were a top-secret prototype I was demo\u2019ing for the military, trying you out as a potential sleeper assassin. Ben\u2019s money was on you being Satan\u2019s mistress. He told us we\u2019d have to forward his winnings to him, since he couldn\u2019t provide verification until he died and ran into you in Hell. Lucas and I were the two who believed you were human. The bet was for how long it would take to indisputably prove your humanity or lack thereof. I beat Lucas\u2019 estimate by about a year. Of course, I probably owe a portion of my winnings to Max, since you might have held out until Lucas\u2019 projected date without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell Max about any of this, I will put you in the industrial shredder in the basement.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, he leaned forward, pressed his lips to her cheek, his hands closing on her shoulders once more. \u201cWe love you, Janet.\u201d He spoke against her temple, making her close her eyes, her heart aching. \u201cTell me what you need, you\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave it to me, all those years ago. And you haven\u2019t stopped giving since. Now please, at the risk of repeating myself, get the hell out of here. I need to deal with the carpet and my suit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth of which you will charge as company expenses. Don\u2019t let me find out you paid for it, or I\u2019ll transfer you to Ben\u2019s area for the next six months.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not scared. You couldn\u2019t survive that long without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what I\u2019ll do to prove a point.\u201d His fingers tightened on her. \u201cJanet, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fine.\u201d She shrugged him off irritably. \u201cShoo.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, stepped back. \u201cI leave all of it in your capable hands, as always. But you know where we are if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my line, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d He dropped one more kiss on her forehead, his lips curving when she shrugged him away with an irritable noise. \u201cSee you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He strode toward the door, relieving her with his matter-of-fact acceptance that she was back at the helm. Given how intuitive the five men were, it was unlikely they\u2019d even mention it again...unless they felt it needed mentioning, and she\u2019d make sure it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She surveyed the carpet, already thinking of the local vendor K&amp;A used when the carpets required deep cleaning. First, though, she\u2019d better spot treat her blouse and coat until she could get them to the dry cleaners at lunch. She had a spare change of clothes here, for the occasional all-nighter required by some of K&amp;A\u2019s more ambitious projects.</p><p>As she moved to take care of that, her office area quiet with all her men gone, she saw her cell phone had a text, not a surprise. Picking it up, she read it.</p><p>How about we make it a long weekend in Texas and do some camping? I promise it will be fun. I miss you already, Mistress.</p><p>She closed her eyes, pressing the screen to her forehead. After another moment, she replied.</p><p>If it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll tie you to a rack and give you a full body wax.</p><p>She\u2019d found the number for the carpet cleaning company when her phone buzzed again.</p><p>The rack part sounds intriguing. Pass on the wax. You like my manly body hair.</p><p>She pursed her lips. Yes, the rack did sound intriguing. And the fact he gave her the idea he\u2019d be okay with it made it even more tantalizing. But camping...hmm.</p><p>She sighed. Matt had said to let him know if she needed anything. She wished he could erase the last member of that gang from Max\u2019s mind. She wanted to attribute her uneasy feeling about it to echoes from her past making her paranoid, but she didn\u2019t think so. Dale had told her. I can promise you it occupies one-third of his brain... And yet it had happened years ago. What if they found the man in Mexico, or South America, and Max went after him? Or if he went after him here, and was caught or injured? Or killed?</p><p>She firmed her chin. She wasn\u2019t some swooning heroine, waiting for Fate to trample her. It was obvious Max\u2019s only real fear was that of being less than the man he felt he was supposed to be. So she would figure out how to deal with this. The way any Navy SEAL\u2019s wife, girlfriend\u2014or Mistress\u2014had to figure it out.</p><p>Ben checked his watch as he came out the front door, saw Max and the limo waiting. Peter, Jon and Lucas would be following in about an hour, because only Ben and Matt were needed for the first agenda items. Matt wouldn\u2019t push it too late, but he\u2019d make sure Janet was okay. Even so, Ben had a few minutes to kill. He could duck into the back and arrange some documents...</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Max stepped in front of the passenger door, blocking his entry. Sometimes he did the door-opening routine, usually if Matt needed to appear impressive, though for the most part Matt didn\u2019t waste a lot of time on that kind of shit. But Max\u2019s intent wasn\u2019t to open the door for Ben. From the expression on his face, Ben thought it more likely he was considering Mel Gibson\u2019s Lethal Weapon 2 maneuver, hammering Ben\u2019s head in the door.</p><p>\u201cProblem, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I brought Janet\u2019s lunch up to her. She\u2019d left it in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s cool gray eyes fixed on Ben\u2019s. \u201cI get that you and she lock horns sometimes, and that\u2019s part of your deal. But it\u2019s time you stop talking to her like that. Period.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s kneejerk reaction was to set aside his briefcase, step toe-to-toe with the tight-assed, muscle-headed bastard and ask him who in the fucking hell did he think he was talking to. Then he thought about the tears in Janet\u2019s eyes\u2014something that had scared the hell out of all of them, frankly\u2014and what he\u2019d do if he\u2019d seen some guy being a foul-mouthed ass to Marcie. Well, fuck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re right.\u201d He saw the brief flash of surprise in Max\u2019s eyes, then it was back to that ice calm, I-can-break-your-neck-with-my-mind look. Ben might have grinned at the thought, except the man code required that he keep his hackles up the requisite amount of time. \u201cCan you get your ass away from the door? Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t ask you to open it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be smart.\u201d</p><p>Unlike Ben, Max wasn\u2019t posturing. He was obviously still pissed.</p> <p>Ah hell and Jesus. Therapy is making me such a pussy. Ben sighed. \u201cIf you ever tell her this, I\u2019ll kill you, but there\u2019s something about her... Sometimes it\u2019s like she\u2019s a mom, the kind I can snap at, but she\u2019ll love me anyway, even as she\u2019ll bust my balls for mouthing off, and I\u2019m looking for the ball-busting, you know? But mom or not, she deserves way more respect than that. I\u2019ve heard you. Okay?\u2019</p><p>Max considered that, nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t think of her as a mom at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved to hear it. Else I\u2019d park you on the shrink\u2019s couch with me and tell you to stay the hell away from her.\u201d</p><p>This time Max answered with a tentative curving of lips, but Ben saw the conflict in his eyes. He stepped closer, put a hand on Max\u2019s broad shoulder. Jesus, the guy was built like a fucking tank. They should put bets on him and Peter mud wrestling one night. Though it would be way more fun to see Marcie and Dana go at it. In thongs. He\u2019d rather not entertain that visual of Peter and Max, though Marcie and Dana would probably love it. Even if Dana only got the visuals through Marcie\u2019s description.</p><p>\u201cI get it. She\u2019s your girl, and you\u2019re going to kick my ass if I don\u2019t treat her right. Good. She deserves that. Though if I tell her you think she needs defending, she\u2019s going to kick your ass. Keep that in mind.\u201d</p> <p>With a wink, Ben got into the car.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d completely lost her mind. Camping. Showing the depths of her insanity, she would have given him the whole week if he wanted it, but she understood now that five or six days was as long as he could be away before Amanda had problems with his absence. She took Monday and Tuesday off, with the plan being they\u2019d return on Tuesday night and he\u2019d go see Amanda on Wednesday.</p><p>They were headed for the Rio Grande area, but as he\u2019d indicated, they broke up the trip with an overnight in Houston to visit with Gayle Kirby and do some chores around the house for her. Gayle\u2019s husband Charles was currently deployed. As a matter of course, SEALs like Max or Dale, as well as SEALs not currently on active missions, tended to keep tabs on SEAL families when their men were gone, to help out where needed.</p><p>It made her think again about Eric, the SEAL who\u2019d hoped to get Max\u2019s mother and sister to move into a duplex. If all SEALs had the same commitment to personal responsibility, she imagined the guilt had weighed heavily on the man\u2019s mind, likely as much as Max\u2019s. But from what Max had said, Janet expected her SEAL had helped Eric accept that some things were beyond a man\u2019s control, no matter how bitter a pill that was to swallow.</p><p>Her SEAL. She liked the sound of that.</p><p>Gayle had three rambunctious boys, ages four to nine. Max quickly employed them in the yard work, telling Gayle to take a couple hours to rest her feet. Watching from the front bay window, Janet smiled at the sight of the four-year-old carrying small, mostly ineffectual handfuls of leaves to the wheelbarrow while Max pruned, trimmed, mowed and had the two older boys weeding and dragging cut limbs. He had an easy way with children, direct and not patronizing. His authoritative, no-nonsense attitude commanded the children\u2019s respect and attention.</p> <p>She could have watched him all day, but she turned her attention to giving Gayle a hand with the breakfast dishes and getting some laundry started so the mother could have a portion of those couple of hours Max had indicated.</p><p>Gayle was also watching over another SEAL wife, Jenny Reid. Jenny lived up the road, but she was seven months pregnant with her first child, so she was now staying with Gayle until the baby came. She was a baby herself, barely twenty years old, and though she smiled and shook Janet\u2019s hand, and was cordial to Max, Janet could tell the pregnancy was putting her through a rough time. After she and Gayle got the mother-to-be settled for a nap on the patio lounge chair in the back, they sat down to share an iced tea on the sun porch, where they could watch over her. Max and the boys occasionally came into view as they dumped bagged leaves in a compost heap in the side yard. Gayle\u2019s property seemed to encompass a couple acres.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing and a curse,\u201d Gayle noted, watching the boys wrestle with Max. He picked up the oldest one, tossed him into the leaves, then had to do it to all of them, though he was of course far more gentle about it with the four-year-old. \u201cThey never stop missing their dad, and when any of these guys come through, it gives them that sense of him. Which is wonderful, but it makes me miss Charles all the more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how difficult that is.\u201d Janet thought about Max\u2019s text from the other day. I miss you already. She knew it was the stage of their relationship, that heady, falling-in-love feeling where no amount of time was enough, but even so, she wondered if, for a couple truly in love, that feeling ever went away.</p><p>She\u2019d never considered herself such a romantic, but the feeling hadn\u2019t waned in the slightest between Matt and Savannah, and they\u2019d been married the longest of the K&amp;A team. Not so long really, but she\u2019d seen the same thing between elderly couples sitting together in the park. Perhaps time and maturity taught a couple how to manage it, tone it down in public, but they couldn\u2019t hide the fact they felt complete only when they were with one another.</p><p>At least, she hoped and suspected that was the way love was. The kind of love she might be willing to consider with Max in the long term. That was an even scarier thought than camping.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not easy, but you figure it out.\u201d Gayle sobered, glancing toward the lounge chair. Jenny shifted, but from the slackness of her wrist, the fact the book she\u2019d been reading was now pressed to her belly, it appeared she\u2019d drifted off into a doze. \u201cI\u2019ll have to have Max take care of her swollen ankles. He gives a hell of a foot massage.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of the back massage he\u2019d given her in the shower, Janet shivered. Catching it, Gayle nodded. \u201cYep, you can thank me for that, sister. I taught him how to give a proper massage when I was pregnant with my second one, but you can\u2019t train anyone to have those kinds of hands. A strong man massaging your feet... Oh my God, there\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d She took a bracing swig of tea. \u201cAnd getting one when he\u2019s not expecting sex out of it\u2014or rushing it so he can get sex out of it\u2014that\u2019s pretty much God\u2019s miracle, right there.\u201d</p> <p>She gave Janet a devilish grin. \u201cOf course, I sort of had the opposite problem with Max. I was in my second trimester, when all you want to do is have sex all the time, and here\u2019s this gorgeous guy with a body like they all have. I wanted to stick my husband\u2019s face on him and have my way with him. Poor Max is lucky he made it out with his virtue intact.\u201d</p><p>It startled a laugh out of Janet. Gayle grinned even wider. \u201cI don\u2019t usually talk so plain, but you seem the type to appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>The women glanced back toward the patio as Jenny turned away from them, put a pillow between her knees. Her book had been set aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s going to make it.\u201d Gayle shook her head. \u201cSEALs have a pretty high divorce rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighty percent,\u201d Janet recalled Max\u2019s words.</p><p>Gayle lifted a shoulder. \u201cThe reasons are kind of obvious. But when you\u2019re so young, like Jenny, it\u2019s hard to put it together in that first phase. You\u2019ve met this alpha, no-holds-barred, high-testosterone guy who can face down anything. The swooning damsel inside all of us just melts. What you don\u2019t realize until you\u2019re in it is your alpha hero is going to be out saving the world most of the time. He\u2019s going to be gone for months at a time, leaving at the drop of a hat, returning God-knows-when, so he\u2019s only going to get to be your hero for limited periods of time.</p><p>\u201cWhile he\u2019s off somewhere, you have to become the hero of your own life\u2014handling all the crises with kids, bills, family, the car breaking down. On a good day, you get really mad about it, thinking he\u2019s out there playing with his guns while you\u2019re sorting laundry and dealing with colic. On a bad day, you think he might be shot, captured...that you may never see him again. Each of those reactions comes with their own kind of stress. But then you see him standing in the door, and you have this little good death, seeing him there. When you have your arms wrapped around him and the kids are grabbing hold of any part you don\u2019t already have, you want to hold on to that one moment forever.\u201d</p><p>Gayle blinked, laughed as Janet handed her a tissue. \u201cYeah, thanks. Don\u2019t tell Max I welled up. I\u2019m the supreme SEAL wife, the example for all the others. But I get what Jenny\u2019s dealing with. At a certain point you pass the \u2018all clear\u2019 sign, so to speak. You\u2019ve figured it out, intuitively, and you know the two of you will make it, because you\u2019ve worked it out in your head, accepted what is. But until you reach that point, it can be a tough road. I\u2019ve told Charles it\u2019s the wives\u2019 version of BUD/S, only it can go on for years for us, rather than just a few months. Even now, I sleep on his side of the bed when he\u2019s gone, as if it\u2019s how I can be the closest to him.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cSorry. God, listen to me. I\u2019m talking too much.\u201d</p><p>Janet shook her head. \u201cIf you\u2019re the supreme SEAL wife, I\u2019m thinking you don\u2019t get to talk about the way you feel too often. Beyond using it as a tool, an example to help other women.\u201d</p><p>Gayle\u2019s expression shifted from mild embarrassment to a warm gratitude, and she touched Janet\u2019s hand in simple solidarity. \u201cIn my own defense, you have a great listening ear. Not to mention an obvious strength to you. It\u2019s nice to be around.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given the fact Gayle was dealing with Jenny\u2019s fragile state and three demanding children, Janet expected being around another independent woman was like a bracing shot of whisky. Like Gayle, Janet was viewed as a mentor by most of her women friends, probably because she had no patience for the self-pitying, wallow-in-trumped-up-personal-baggage that seemed to be the norm these days. She was usually quick to shut down any female who was carping about issues that any woman could handle if she\u2019d merely stop whining incessantly about it and take responsibility for her own life.</p><p>She decided she liked Gayle immensely. \u201cSame goes,\u201d she said, winning a warm smile, another press of that chapped hand.</p><p>It was like her feelings toward what had happened with Jorge. She\u2019d done it, she couldn\u2019t take it back, and she couldn\u2019t make herself regret it. So she\u2019d moved forward with her life. She refused to stay in that blood-soaked room in her mind when her body hadn\u2019t been able to get out of there fast enough.</p> <p>\u201cMax seems to appreciate strong women,\u201d she observed. \u201cI like that about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Gayle beamed at her, poured her more tea. \u201cAs they mature, a lot of the SEALs realize it\u2019s the strong women who can handle a relationship with them for the long haul. Because reconciling yourself to his absences is only part of it. You also have to understand his bond with other SEALs.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s indescribable. Impenetrable. Did you know, when one of them falls, his fellow SEALs will each hammer their Trident into the top of his coffin, signifying he\u2019s taking a part of them with him? I\u2019ve had to see Charles do that twice, and both times, I prayed I\u2019d never have to see them do it for him. But that\u2019s the terrible, beautiful part of their connection. The other side of it is the one that can really test a marriage.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s just gotten home from a thirteen-month absence, but something comes up with one of them, he\u2019s going to invite his buddy over, or take him a six-pack to help him out. That\u2019s pretty tough. It makes a wife feel like she\u2019s less important to her man than those guys, but if she pays close attention to the way he looks at her as he comes through the door, that hunger in his eyes, that sense that yes, there is something in the world worth fighting for, she\u2019ll get it. He doesn\u2019t look at anyone else the way he looks at you or his kids. You\u2019re his anchor, you\u2019re what he fights for, what he lives for. They may be adrenaline junkies, but they\u2019re also human beings. When they\u2019re in the thick of horrible violent stuff, the one thing they hold in their heads is getting back home. And you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder at the young pregnant woman. \u201cThe problem is, that\u2019s not always enough for a woman. I hope they make it. We try to help each other through. But that\u2019s what we all do with those we love, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t in here telling her bad stuff, are you, Gayle?\u201d Max opened the screen door, stepped onto the porch. \u201cI\u2019m counting on you to be my wingman, convince Janet how lucky she is to have me and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just astounded someone\u2019s putting up with you. If she\u2019s hit the two-week point, she deserves a medal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d He picked up Janet\u2019s half-full glass of tea and drained it. He\u2019d stripped off the shirt and had been sweating. He also had a leaf stuck to his lower back. Janet plucked it free, twirled it by the stem so he could see it. He grinned. \u201cWe had a wrestling match in the leaf piles. The boys are now re-raking what we messed up. I\u2019ll go get you some more tea.\u201d</p><p>He moved into the kitchen area, raising his voice as he disappeared around the corner. \u201cGayle, I took care of the stopped drain upstairs, but is there anything else you need me to handle while I\u2019m here? I don\u2019t want Chuckles to think I\u2019m slacking off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need to be serviced sexually, if you can work that in. And I\u2019m sure Jenny wouldn\u2019t mind a go if you could handle her as well.\u201d Gayle winked at Janet at the sound of the glass hitting the sink. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t expecting me to tease him like that in front of you,\u201d she murmured. Janet bit back a smile as Max returned, shooting them both a narrow glance.</p><p>\u201cWomen,\u201d he pronounced, putting a full glass down for Janet and topping off Gayle\u2019s. \u201cOne is trouble enough. Get a pack of them together, and a smart man steers clear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Gayle toasted him. \u201cIf you can come back in a couple weeks, I\u2019m going to have a barbecue for all of you guys that have been helping us out so much. Bring Janet, if she\u2019s still putting up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. His gaze moved to Janet, a warm, lingering look that made her want to take her tea glass and slide it along the slick ridges of muscle on his abdomen, down to those belted jeans. She\u2019d hook her fingers there and feel the intimate flesh beneath. Giving her a slow grin, he bent to brush his lips over hers, a promise.</p><p>\u201cGot to finish the job,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t believe any terrible things Gayle says about me.\u201d</p><p>As he left the sun porch and headed back toward the front, they heard him roar. The boys had apparently planned an ambush, if the stray leaves that spun by on the light wind were any indication.</p><p>\u201cAt this rate, they\u2019ll be raking for the rest of the day,\u201d Janet observed. Gayle laughed.</p><p>\u201cMost likely. But the main point is him spending time with the boys, letting them have male role models in their life as much as possible. For that, I\u2019m happy to let those leaves pile up like snow drifts.\u201d</p><p>She sobered then. \u201cIn a way, I\u2019m glad you found Max after he was out of the SEALs, because you won\u2019t have to deal with a lot of this, but unfortunately, he\u2019ll figure out a way to find trouble. A lot of them go into law enforcement or related fields. It makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t train to be a rocket scientist, work for NASA sending up rockets, and then find contentment as a cable guy. They have to live on that edge somehow. Except Max has a different scenario. His sister is his mission now. That helps, having the mission.\u201d</p><p>Janet felt an uneasy ripple, once again thinking of her conversation with Dale in Max\u2019s far-too-bare kitchen.</p> <p>Seeing it, Gayle reached across, covered her hand. \u201cAll that aside, here\u2019s what\u2019s important. They\u2019re all infuriating in their own way. They all have their code, their set way of doing things, and that\u2019s pretty immovable, but Max is a very good man, in every sense of the word. If he gives a woman his heart, he\u2019ll treat her right, whether it\u2019s today or fifty years from now. If you realize that\u2019s what matters, that the rest doesn\u2019t, then you\u2019ll find gold.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>She thought about that, as well as a lot of other things. They left Gayle\u2019s early the next morning. Though Gayle had given them a bedroom to share, Max fell asleep in the living room with two of the boys sprawled on him, having indulged them in a horror-movie marathon. When they left in the morning, both women were up to see them off. Jenny even kissed Janet\u2019s cheek, pressed her hand. The young woman looked in better spirits this morning, but as she gave Janet an intent look, she murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to get one after they\u2019re out of it.\u201d</p><p>Max was standing behind Janet, giving Gayle a big hug, but she knew he heard it. When he turned to say his goodbyes to Jenny, he drew her to him for a warm embrace, holding her an extra moment, hand cupped over the back of her head. He said something to her, something that made her fingers tighten on his broad shoulders, then he eased back, touched her nose. \u201cWhen I come back for that barbecue, you and me will go to the mall. We\u2019ll snag one of those portable wheelchairs so I can zoom you around and your feet won\u2019t get tired. I\u2019m a trained chauffeur, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a combat driver. I have firsthand knowledge,\u201d Janet added helpfully, making Jenny smile.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Gayle linked arms with Jenny. \u201cThen when Lew gets back, you\u2019ll tell him you expect him to do mall shopping just like Max does.\u201d</p><p>Jenny snorted. \u201cHe\u2019ll think of a reason to stay away for another six months if I tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Max held her bleak gaze. \u201cAs soon as he can be back with the both of you, he will be, no matter how much mall shopping he has to do. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>When they were in the truck and well on their way, Janet looked toward him. He seemed a little tired from his late night with the boys, but otherwise content. He had her hand in his grip, lifting it to his mouth to brush a kiss over her knuckles. \u201cWhat did you say to her, when you hugged her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI told her it didn\u2019t matter what corner of the world he\u2019s in right now, all he\u2019s thinking about is being back with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think that raises the question \u2018then why does he go away at all?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Max glanced at her. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s a tough one for a lot of the women.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to explain it. Perhaps he knew it was like what Gayle had implied to her. If a person didn\u2019t intuitively understand it, they never would.</p><p>Sliding across the seat, she laid her head on his shoulder. Max shifted his arm around her, driving the deserted two-lane highway one-handed. The sun was rising, and the coffee Gayle had made gave the cab a pleasant aroma.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tried seeing how Amanda reacts to Dale, or one of the other SEALs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale\u2019s been to see her, and she likes him well enough. Aaron went with me a couple times as well. He lives up near Baton Rouge, but comes into New Orleans regularly to visit his mom when he\u2019s here.\u201d He squeezed her. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve ever tried to let one of them visit her without you, to see if she\u2019d be okay with them as a substitute, if you stayed away for a slightly longer period, like a week or two. That way, if you wanted to go somewhere for a week\u2019s vacation, you could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s me she looks for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s consistently visited her. If\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped. He hadn\u2019t said anything, but he\u2019d become more focused on the road, his fingers tightening on the wheel, despite the fact there was no traffic. Though he still had his arm around her, it was like she was leaning against a board. If there was one thing she recognized, it was a male shifting into defensive mode.</p><p>\u201cYou know her better than I do,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a thought. Would you like to listen to some music?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d His shoulders eased a fraction. Straightening, she moved back to her side of the truck to fiddle with dials, scrolling through his satellite radio options until she found a station that played a good mix of contemporary, alternative and oldies. Slipping her feet out of her canvas sneakers, she drew them up on the seat. She linked her fingers over them and glanced out the window at the passing scenery. The silence drew out, but she decided to let him be the one to break it, since the wheels of his mind were obviously creating a cacophony in his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me have it,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI know you\u2019re thinking something I\u2019d rather not hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really none of my business, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d At her blank look, he gave a half laugh. There was a trace of irritation in it, but something else as well. \u201cJanet, I haven\u2019t had a relationship since I left the SEALs. Hell, I\u2019ve barely had sex with anything other than myself since then. I\u2019m taking you camping. I\u2019m introducing you to the wives of guys I\u2019ve served with. I\u2019m letting you into my life because I want you to be a part of it, and not just as a passing thing. Maybe I\u2019m scaring the shit out of you, saying something like this when we\u2019ve been together less than a couple weeks, but in my mind it\u2019s been a lot longer. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, Max Ackerman.\u201d She was glad to see the rueful tug of his lips in response. Reaching across the seat, he closed his hand on hers, a firm grip. Then he released her.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. If we\u2019re going to have our first fight, let\u2019s make it a memorable one. Spit it out, woman.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI mentioned Amanda to Rachel. Not just her condition, which I don\u2019t know a great deal about, but also about the role you play in her life. I didn\u2019t do it to betray your trust. I spoke to her in confidence, as a medical professional, since she has access to a lot of doctors at the hospital where she does PT.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about that with you, Janet. I know you\u2019re discreet, and I also know Rachel. She\u2019s top quality in that department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d Janet paused. \u201cShe was told it\u2019s very common for the primary caregiver to convince themselves that no one else can do what they\u2019re doing, for fear that the person they love will not get every bit of the care they deserve. Yes, Amanda reacts badly if she doesn\u2019t see you every few days, but then again, other than you, it sounds like she doesn\u2019t see anyone else from the outside. Gayle mentioned the way the SEALs support one another. I noticed how you and Dale have a very similar demeanor, and I\u2019ll bet other SEALs carry that same feel to them. You\u2019re like an intense extended family. Wherever Amanda is in her head, I wonder if she would pick up on that intuitively.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, not seeing any change in his expression, but he was at least listening. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you\u2019d ever want to stay away from her longer than a week or two, but having the flexibility to do so would let you have a vacation, give yourself a breather. And you\u2019d be an even better caregiver for her as a result.\u201d She reached out now, touched his arm, briefly drawing the gray eyes to hers. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful with her, but it tears your heart out, Max. I can see it. You\u2019ve put yourself on a short tether, perhaps too short. It\u2019s also kept your focus on her situation, and the cause of it, in a way that may not be healthy. You\u2019ve put your life on hold.\u201d</p><p>The last two sentences snapped them back into sticky territory. His shoulders and mouth tightened. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat focus is going to stay front and center until it\u2019s settled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the one thing you can change about what happened? You can punish those who did it? Your mother won\u2019t be less gone, your sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d he ground out. \u201cShe\u2019s not gone, Janet. Not like she fucking went to Atlantic City or on a trip to see relatives. She\u2019s dead, beaten to death by three guys because she wouldn\u2019t move out of the way and let them rape her daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your single-minded determination to kill all of them may make you just as dead when all is said and done.\u201d Janet refused to back down. \u201cWhere does that leave Amanda then? Where does it leave me? You\u2019ve invited me into your life. \u2018Hey, look at me, I\u2019m this amazing guy who might be everything you\u2019d ever want\u2019. But because you have this fucking code of honor, I might get to identify your corpse before I ever pick out curtains with you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d proceeded calmly, rationally, but his anger unleashed the same in her, a barb festering from the conversation with Gayle, Dale\u2019s visit in Max\u2019s kitchen, what she herself was feeling about the man himself. He\u2019d been so straightforward. I\u2019m letting you into my life because I want you to be a part of it. Most men shied away from that, or if they said it, they hadn\u2019t really thought it through, a passion-of-the-moment kind of thing. She\u2019d been unbalanced by it, the fact she knew he meant it, had likely considered it from every angle. But the real shock was knowing how much she wanted the same thing. He hadn\u2019t been with a woman, more than a one-night stand, for several years. She hadn\u2019t had a relationship since getting away from Jorge.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the deal with me,\u201d he responded, fire in his eyes, a hard set to his jaw. \u201cI laid it out there for you. I can\u2019t change it, and I didn\u2019t take you for the kind of woman who would run from something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop the truck.\u201d The ice in her voice was pure Mistress, pure ball-busting admin of Matt Kensington. Max gave her a look. She knew he wasn\u2019t any more afraid of her than she was of him, but he did respect her. Whatever he heard in her tone had him pulling off the highway, on to a side road that made a straight shot into the endless flatlands, going all the way to the horizon and disappearing.</p><p>Pushing open her door, she slid to the ground. She collected her purse, her water bottle and an opened bag of crunchy Cheetos that she\u2019d carefully rolled closed to keep them fresh. He\u2019d bought it for her at a gas station on the way to Gayle\u2019s. She started to walk.</p><p>She could sense him watching her, probably trying to figure out what the hell she was doing. She had no idea herself.</p> <p>Separated from the side road by a split rail fence, the land to her left looked like a field that might be tilled for some purpose at another time of year, or was being left fallow for this season. The early morning sun wasn\u2019t hot, but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. She needed to walk.</p><p>She\u2019d gone perhaps a half mile before she thought to stop, look back at the truck. She expected to see him leaning against it, or still behind the wheel, keeping tabs on her progress, prepared to come pick her up when she was ready. Instead, he was about twenty paces behind her. So caught in her whirl of thoughts, she hadn\u2019t heard him. He wasn\u2019t letting her get out of his immediate range in this unfamiliar area. He was watching after her, even as he gave her space.</p><p>Fuck, she was so in love with the fucking idiot.</p><p>At her look, he lifted a shoulder. \u201cYou like keeping men on a short tether. I was just obliging.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Something eased in her stomach, and she shook her head. \u201cAss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d But the tone of his voice made it a warm caress. He tilted his head toward the split rail fence. \u201cI think this is someone\u2019s long-ass driveway. Which means we\u2019re trespassing. Want to sit on the fence until they call the cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t want to be on the fence with you. Metaphorically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that. I get a lot of things with you. It\u2019s like being around Dale and the others. I almost knew the things you were going to say before you said them, but they weren\u2019t things I wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that,\u201d she responded in kind, and now it was his turn to smile. When he held out his hand, she closed the gap between them.</p><p>Lifting her by the waist to sit on one of the rails, he leaned on the post next to it. \u201cI\u2019ll stay on the ground. I\u2019m pretty sure my heavy ass would break it, and then they really would call the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you need to work on that one hundred percent muscle mass. It\u2019s getting out of hand. I think it\u2019s crept into your brain.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face. \u201cI have thought about it,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMy whole life revolves around what Amanda needs, Janet, and that\u2019s the way it should be. But this was a man who raped a teenager and beat a woman to death, and he\u2019s still out there. What kind of man am I, if I don\u2019t do my damnedest to make sure he doesn\u2019t do it to anyone else\u2019s mother or sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale said he and the others would help.\u201d</p><p>Maybe one of them didn\u2019t have so much to lose\u2014a sister relying on him, or a woman in love with him. She didn\u2019t say it, knowing how unlikely and unfair that was, but the twitch in his jaw told her he probably understood where her mind was going on it.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is against the law, Janet. I\u2019m not pulling any of them into that beyond intel, no matter how much they say they don\u2019t care about the risks. This blood debt is mine to pay.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his, holding his gaze. \u201cYou invited me into your life, Max. Do you understand what that will do to me, if something happens to you? The only relationship I\u2019ve had outside the club sessions is a drug dealer who kidnapped me when I was in my teens.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d told him so baldly. It wasn\u2019t just during the time he\u2019d known her that she hadn\u2019t had a real date. His gray eyes digested it, showing the brief surprise, then a more emotional reaction. His jaw tightened, even as his hand closed over hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to finish it, Janet. It\u2019s not up for any kind of debate. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t want to hurt you with that, but I have to be honest about it. I don\u2019t want to lose you over it, Christ, I don\u2019t.\u201d She saw the anguish rise in his gaze. \u201cEven if you think it\u2019s too soon, I mean it. I\u2019m in love with you, head over heels, whatever you want to call it. Wherever you are during the day, I feel this connection between us, a pull, like a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTether?\u201d she suggested. His eyes crinkled at the corners.</p><p>\u201cIf you like.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not fair. If you need to end it between us, so you don\u2019t get in any deeper, you say the word. I\u2019ll turn around and take you home right now. It\u2019ll rip my fucking heart out of my chest, but I\u2019ll leave you alone until it\u2019s done. If you still want me when it\u2019s over...\u201d</p> <p>If he was around when it was over. She caught his wrist, held it tight in her grip. \u201cWhat I\u2019m worrying about is something different, Max. I need you to hear me.\u201d</p><p>He twisted his wrist gently, catching her fingers in his. \u201cI hear everything you say, Mistress. You know that. I just don\u2019t always obey.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced at his wry expression, suppressing the desire to box his ears. \u201cGetting away from Jorge was extremely personal to me. However, while I was planning for it, even doing it...it was like I was an entirely different person, because the environment, the focus, it was all about that goal. Your life is more than that now. K&amp;A, Dale, Amanda...me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut do you think about how it makes you different? I expect when you did missions, there was a certain detachment. Even when you went after the first two men, you were still close enough to that part of your life that you probably shifted into the protocol you\u2019d been trained to follow. It kept you detached, focused. In control. But think about all the time that\u2019s passed since then. Despite your appalling lack of home d\u00e9cor, you\u2019re living in a different world now. This is your life, not a mission environment.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze became thoughtful. \u201cYou think I\u2019m too close to this. I\u2019ve made it too personal, and I could make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cI understand you feel you have to go after him. But promise me you\u2019ll think about that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He would, and it wouldn\u2019t change a damn thing about his course of action, only how he approached it. But maybe that would help keep him alive. She had to hold on to that. Seeing a person who\u2019d been violently murdered was something that never left the mind, and it was far too easy to put Max\u2019s vacant staring eyes, his bloody face, on Jorge\u2019s body. She closed her eyes, folded her hands in her lap, even as she continued to lean against Max to keep herself balanced on the rail.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll also think about what I suggested, about Amanda. If you feel you must do this and something does happen, it\u2019s not a bad idea to make sure there are others in Amanda\u2019s life to take up the slack. She made a connection with me. I\u2019d be happy to be one of those...\u201d Her voice cracked, thinking of seeing those gray eyes in Amanda\u2019s face, but never again in Max\u2019s. She stiffened as he lifted a hand to touch her. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>He put the hand down, his face now expressionless. She\u2019d hurt him, but he was hurting her. It was only fair.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think it needs to be a handful of people. It might be better overall for her. Also, even if nothing happens to you...sharing the load helps share the pain.\u201d</p><p>They studied each other silently. \u201cDo you want me to take you home?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked down at where her hip pressed against his side. Despite not wanting him to touch her face, her body had betrayed her true desires, maintaining that contact. Sighing, she slid her fingertips down a fold of his shirt, feeling the heat and solidity of the man beneath. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more pointless than running away from someone because you think they\u2019re going to break your heart.\u201d</p><p>He closed his fingers over hers, his thumb passing over her wrist. It was a tentative touch for both of them, full of things unsaid. \u201cI\u2019m going to try like hell not to do that, Janet. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, tracing his knuckles. A few more moments passed between them, then he reached out with the other hand, tapping the opening of her purse where the bag of Cheetos was visible. \u201cCare to share some of those?\u201d</p><p>Janet gave him a look of pained amusement. \u201cDo you never stop thinking with your stomach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a growing boy, and they\u2019re right there and everything.\u201d</p><p>The air had shifted between them, the anger gone. What would be, would be. She rolled her eyes, pulled the bag out and withdrew one of the crunchy pieces, lifting it to his mouth. As he took it, he put his lips on her fingers, drawing them in. His hand closed around her wrist so that even when he let them go, he held on to her.</p> <p>\u201cYou turned my fingers orange,\u201d she accused, giving him a frown. He licked the powder off, then wiped her fingers on his T-shirt. She snorted at that, tried to pull away, but he held her, his other arm sliding around her waist to ensure she didn\u2019t pull back too vigorously and topple off the fence. It was literally impossible to stay furious with the man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen some of the Mistresses in the club do that,\u201d he said, nodding to the bag. \u201cFeed a collared slave at their feet. You\u2019ve done it a couple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s very moving, to have a man take food from your hand. Wine from your mouth.\u201d Retrieving the bottle of water, she took a drink of it, then curved her other hand around the back of his neck, bringing him to her lips. Mouth-to-mouth intimacy wasn\u2019t something she encouraged with her club hookups, but she did well enough now to transfer the water to his mouth without spillage and still get a nice taste of Max and the lingering flavor of the Cheetos.</p><p>He curled his fingers into her hips, pulling her closer to him, and then he abandoned the reserve of the past few moments. He took her off the fence, hiking her up his body so her legs wrapped over his hips and he had her propped against the post to brace them both. The functional exchange of food and drink became a deep, needy kiss, a reminder they hadn\u2019t had carnal knowledge of one another since they left New Orleans, an interminable amount of time. He made the kiss demanding and more than a little possessive, as if he was verifying his claim on her despite the near miss. In return she was a little angry, biting at his mouth, digging her nails into the bare skin beneath his collar.</p><p>He didn\u2019t retreat from it an inch, taking everything she inflicted and giving her back his desire, pushing himself firmly against her core. When he finally pulled back, his gray eyes were molten.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to that campsite,\u201d he said.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t made any decisions or resolved anything, at least not in words, but the kiss was the answer. Frustrated, stubborn, passionate and yearning all at once. Breaking it off with him wasn\u2019t going to be an option for her. Not anymore. It might nearly kill her, losing him, but it was as Gayle said. There was a point past which it was no longer on the table. Somehow, they\u2019d already passed that point.</p><p>When they reached the park, Max shouldered a backpack, which contained their tent as well as a few other items they\u2019d need for their overnight, and hoisted a cooler on his shoulder. Then he took her hand with his free one. In that manner, she experienced her first hiking-to-a-campsite experience. She looked over her shoulder toward the more populated area, which also included a bathhouse, but he just gave her that charming smile and told her being at a more remote location would outweigh the perk of a communal shower.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so sure about that, but the walk was beautiful, taking them across several bridges and open natural areas. It wasn\u2019t overly strenuous, and yet he refused to let her carry anything except the small tote containing her toiletries and a change of clothes. \u201cJust enjoy the scenery, Mistress,\u201d he said, giving her a wink. Since there were times when the trail narrowed to the point that he preceded her, she couldn\u2019t argue with the advice. Watching him bear the cooler on his broad shoulder, the shift of thigh and ass muscles under his jeans as he navigated the terrain, wasn\u2019t a hardship at all, though it made her even more eager for them to get to their campsite.</p><p>The spot he\u2019d picked out was in a birch forest. The trees were spaced widely enough to allow them a tent, and there was an appealing hushed tranquility. She was still thinking about that bathhouse, but seeing the location, she was more willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>She learned how to put up a tent with his help, observed with fascination while he made them a campfire. He was as comfortable living out in nature as she was in her colorful bedroom with its many comforts. He\u2019d provided a rollout foam mattress for the tent, complete with a couple pillows. When he camped alone, she suspected he was fine sleeping on the hard ground. Then she remembered his aversion to the cold and rethought that, noting he\u2019d brought three tightly rolled blankets.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think staying warm was going to be a problem, however. Not with the intense gazes they kept exchanging and that aura of heat she felt between their bodies, even on the trail. More than once she savored the memory of him wandering around shirtless doing Gayle\u2019s yard work. That kiss on the fence was still branded on her brain.</p><p>A freshwater stream gurgled less than fifty feet from their site, and while he went to fill a jug with water, she knelt on the foam pad in the tent, ran her fingers over it. She remembered that first night Max had slept at her place. In the morning, he\u2019d gotten up to go do a run. She chose to sleep in, trying not to hate him for his self-discipline, but when he left the bed, she automatically shifted into his spot, absorbing the heat he\u2019d left, his scent. He\u2019d paused over tying his shoe, head lifting to watch her.</p><p>Thinking of what Gayle said about sleeping in her husband\u2019s spot, she wondered if that was a common thing for SEAL wives. For military spouses, period. Had Max known about it, explaining his oddly pleased and touched expression? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was having a hard time dealing with the mere possibility of him going after a gang member. She wasn\u2019t sure she could be as strong as Gayle, dealing with her man being gone for months, not knowing if he was alive or dead, or what kind of things he was facing. But it helped her understand Gayle\u2019s patience with Jenny, as well as Max\u2019s compassion. Max hadn\u2019t been married, but he\u2019d know the toll his absences took on his mother and sister, even before the attack.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He was squatting in the tent opening, looking rugged and far-too-appealing in his jeans and T-shirt, his hiking boots. He ran a hand down her back. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She turned so she was folded on her knees, facing him. \u201cSo, what do you propose for dinner? If you plan to kill something that I have to de-fur or de-scale, I will take your truck keys and head for the nearest hotel.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned, reaching over her shoulder to capture her braid. She\u2019d plaited her hair this morning, assuming it would be the easiest style to manage for camping requirements. \u201cBut I have this mountain man-squaw fantasy, and you already have your hair done right for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your keys.\u201d She made a lunge for his pocket and he caught her about the waist, holding her closer to him with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cGayle packed us meals. It was the deal I worked out with her in exchange for my extensive manual labor skills.\u201d He winked. \u201cShe\u2019s a great cook. Tonight it\u2019ll be her lasagna. She also put a couple salads in the cooler, and I brought a bottle of wine. You prefer red, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed it at the Christmas party.\u201d</p> <p>A party that had been months ago. She shook her head. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to impress me, it might be working.\u201d But when his arm loosened, thighs tensing as if he intended to leave the tent, probably to go check on her dinner, she hooked her fingers in the collar of his T-shirt. \u201cWhat I want right now isn\u2019t food. Not exactly.\u201d She tilted her head toward the foam bed. \u201cI want you to stretch out there. No clothes. Now.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze. \u201cHow about you in no clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. If you please me.\u201d</p><p>Another weighted moment, then he inclined his head. When she released him, he backed out of the tent so that he could stand, pull the shirt over his head. No more questions, no hesitation. It fired her blood, made her wet her lips, especially when that muscular terrain rippled before her avid gaze. He unbelted the jeans, opened them, then bent to untie the hiking shoes. He toed them off, gaze returning to her as he got rid of them and then the rest of his clothes, dropping them in a pile on the shoes.</p><p>\u201cStand there, just like that.\u201d</p><p>There was a pure beauty to a man in superior physical condition. Not bulges of muscle, but hard curves meant to support stamina, endurance...combat conditions.</p> <p>\u201cDo you keep in the same shape as you did for the SEALs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. It\u2019s a good routine. Makes me feel connected to them.\u201d</p><p>It also kept him in condition for what was ahead. But she didn\u2019t want this moment to be about that. \u201cTurn around. Face away from me.\u201d</p><p>He complied, hips shifting. As he turned, her gaze drifted over the skull trident, then slipped back down to his fantastic ass, the muscular thighs. Rising to her knees, she put her hands on his buttocks, molding her palms over them. She slid her thumbs down to his thighs, causing him to widen his stance at the implied command. Making a noise of approval, she slipped her fingers between his legs to caress that sensitive joining point of the balls, then cupped them to squeeze. Leaning forward, she teased the seam between the cheeks with her tongue, nipping at him as he suppressed an oath. She suspected he would have turned then, but when he made to shift, she tightened her grip.</p><p>\u201cUnh-unh. All mine.\u201d She whispered it against his flesh. \u201cMine to do with what I want. And what I want is you to keep this fine ass still.\u201d</p><p>He strangled on a half chuckle, and then his back muscles tightened as she kept idly tracing that line. She was aware of the responsive nerve endings she\u2019d find deeper in the intimate crevice, around his rim. But to access that she\u2019d need both of her hands, and she liked holding his testicle sac in her palm, her fingers closed firmly over the solid weight. Well, there was no need to limit herself. She had a pair of hands at her command, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cReach back and spread your ass cheeks for me.\u201d</p><p>It took another bated breath, but then he complied. She was touched and delighted to find he\u2019d shaved his manly hair, at least in that region. It suggested he\u2019d thought about some of the things his Mistress might want of him, and what would please her. He might not be a sub, but he anticipated as well as one of the best.</p> <p>He\u2019ll treat her right, whether it\u2019s today or fifty years from now...</p><p>His fingers clenched on that delicious tautness as she ran her tongue over the crinkled area of his rim, then delicately pushed into his anal region, making him groan. He was going to leave bruising fingerprints on his own ass, and she had no problem with that. She\u2019d love adding her own marks over them. She continued to knead his testicles, run her thumb along the base of his cock as far as she could reach, while she teased his anus. His feet were pressed into the earth, his thighs like cement columns. She slid her free hand up over his right one, caressing his fingers on his ass cheek, then she drew back, a clear message that she wasn\u2019t inviting contact. Not yet. When he turned a hungry gaze on her, her libido growled in sympathetic response.</p><p>\u201cLie on the mattress. Face up.\u201d</p><p>She shifted out of the way so he could duck into the tent opening. He squatted at the base of the foam pad, moving into a very tempting position on his hands and knees before he turned and stretched out on the mattress. His cock was a stiff soldier, making her wet her lips again. She was still dressed, and that was the way she was going to stay, for now.</p><p>\u201cLegs spread so your ankles are as wide as the tent entrance. Arms above your head. Grab the back tent support, and don\u2019t let go. Not unless I say so.\u201d</p><p>The expression he locked upon her was the one that sent his power rolling over her, giving her that titillating feeling that she was in command of a wild beast who could overwhelm her with his strength in a heartbeat, but wouldn\u2019t. Not if she managed that delicate play of power exchange perfectly. He complied, body stretching to accommodate her desire.</p><p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d Though there was nothing boy-like about the body she was appraising, or the rigid planes of his concentrated face. She knelt between his legs, running her nails up his thighs. \u201cYour obeying my commands pleases me, Max. And you know about obeying commands, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit with flame, suggesting she was challenging the fighter in him further. But he was also very disciplined. His fingers tightened on the tent pole. \u201cI can give you pleasure, Mistress, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are giving me pleasure, Max. I want to take, on my terms. Your only job is to comply with my desires.\u201d</p><p>She closed her hand around his cock, began to slide up and down, working him in her loosely wrapped fist. It was a method and rhythm sure to get a response, and she did. His hips flexed, and when she bent to put her lips on his head, slide down his length, he jerked, his fingers tightening even farther on the tent pole. She didn\u2019t think that metal shaft could be any harder than the one in her mouth, and it was getting harder, blood filling and thickening it so he pressed against her tongue and teeth.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJanet....Mistress.\u201d</p><p>She dug her nails into his thighs, and he drew in his breath, shuddered. When she moved her hand to his stomach, she scratched him there as well, enjoying the score marks. She was tempted to draw blood, to put proof of her ownership on him. He said he was falling in love with her, and she viewed that declaration as synonymous with ownership, a giving of himself to her utterly.</p><p>The new part, to her, was considering such possessiveness a two-way street. She\u2019d seen it happen with each of the K&amp;A men. All of them hardcore Dominants, yet each man had found that one woman who spoke to his soul and captured his heart. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t much different. Max may have bided his time waiting for her to initiate, and she had taken that time herself, deliberately, but now, on this side of it, she realized they\u2019d both known it, felt it.</p><p>She would have liked to ease a finger up his rear passage to heighten the intensity of the climax she was going to give him, but her nails were too long. She didn\u2019t want the sharp edges to give him the wrong kind of pain. Even the toughest guy in the world had delicate anal tissues. She\u2019d keep that thought to herself though, since men like Max didn\u2019t like to hear that any part of them was less than battle tough. But the fragility of those tissues was also what made the rear entry so deliciously responsive.</p><p>She increased the suction of her mouth on his cock, the rhythm and flow of her grip, so he was bucking up against her like a bull in the chute, waiting to be let loose. She reveled in the sight of all that power, his arms stretched above his head at her command, him gripping the tent pole such that she hoped it was buried deep enough that he wouldn\u2019t yank it loose. But the idea of that, the canvas floating down, blinding them to anything but the physical sensations they were giving one another, wasn\u2019t unappealing.</p><p>The vein under her thumb made a hard convulsion, telling her he was there. \u201cCome, Max.\u201d</p><p>She spoke against his flesh, her mouth full of him to the throat, but he understood her. He let go with a harsh, needy sound, shoving hard between her lips. She held him taut at the base, reveling in the pump of heated fluid. She swallowed down the salty thick taste, letting some of it escape to lubricate his shaft further, wetting her fingers and giving him a full measure of the climax. He kept shuddering and jerking in her grip, every nerve ending oversensitized by the strength of his release. She brought him down slowly, squeezing, sucking, running her tongue over him, polishing and collecting every last bit of the climax she\u2019d commanded from him.</p><p>His hand landed on her shoulder, then the other, and he was pulling her up his body to lie fully clothed on him. He gripped her buttock, long fingers pressed intimately into her crotch, and held her tight against his cock, letting her feel that pulsing aftermath. Then he had her by the wrist and was cleaning her hand with his mouth, caring for her. Her throat tightened and she stroked his thick, soft hair with her other hand as he suckled each finger, licking her palm, her knuckles. \u201cMax,\u201d she murmured, a consecration. \u201cDear, sweet man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dangerous, loving, generous... His gaze turned to her then, his task done, and she saw all those things in his eyes as he put his hand in her hair, pulling loose her braid so her hair spread over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the squaw fantasy?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThis is part of it,\u201d he said, studying her every feature so she felt worshipped by his regard. His gray eyes moved to lock with hers. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019d be thinking about, when he was out hunting, checking traps...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing whatever mountain men do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparked with sensual humor. \u201cHe\u2019d be thinking about getting home to her. How she\u2019d have a meal ready for him, and then at night, he\u2019d unbraid her hair, brush it for her. He\u2019d spread it out beneath her as he laid her down before the fire.\u201d</p><p>So many times she\u2019d thought about cutting her hair, realizing that such long hair wasn\u2019t necessarily fashionable for a woman in her forties, but his expression when he saw it tumble down her shoulders, or fall against his bare chest as it did now, made her glad she\u2019d never given in to that impulse.</p><p>\u201cI want you under me,\u201d he rumbled. \u201cI want my cock plowed so deep inside you...\u201d He left that hanging, but that was the only image needed. Her body, already charged with arousal, her panties soaked, wanted that too. It wasn\u2019t a denial of her Mistress side, simply an understanding that she could be anything she wished with him. Like dancing with the perfect partner, who anticipated the flow of her movements with his own. No choreographing necessary, as if they shared the same soul.</p><p>She was getting fanciful, like the romantic girl she\u2019d once been. Only this was far more real, far more certain, grounded in the reality she was experiencing with him, not what she imagined the relationship to be.</p><p>\u201cI want that too. Whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>He rolled them, his arm banded around her waist, putting her under him with that effortless strength that could steal away the most cynical woman\u2019s breath. She wondered what all those who knew her would think of that. Janet Albright, Satan\u2019s Mistress, out of breath, her heart tripping like...a woman in love. For the first time in her life.</p><p>She managed to smile at him with her eyes, the weight of her heart too full and momentous. When she put her hand to his face, he turned his mouth to it, holding his lips against her palm. \u201cYou might need a little recovery time, sailor,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to pass the time,\u201d he promised, with a look that sent heat searing through every part of her that would benefit from that delay.</p><p>He started by opening her shirt, one button at a time, nuzzling her breasts over the lace of her bra, showing his appreciation of the delicate, thin fabric with a pleased murmur. He traced the curves, let his tongue dip into one cup to find a nipple, curl around it. The pressure of the bra added to the intense pleasure of the sensation. He released the front clasp, replaced the cups with his hands, and she was mesmerized by how it looked, his large hands cradling her, his thumbs passing slowly over the nipples. She watched the way they gave way beneath the pressure, then became tighter, more rigid under the stimulation. Her breath was making little catch noises in her throat, and he was registering all of it.</p><p>Moving down her body, he removed each of her shoes, fingers caressing her arches, then he opened her jeans, slid them off her legs, leaving her panties on, a match for the filmy bra. He could see the outline of her pussy beneath the undergarment. As wet as she was, the silky fabric had to be glued to her labia. Moving back up, he put his hand high on her thigh, thumb passing over that exact spot, so she arched into his touch with a sigh of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI love seeing you wet for me, Mistress.\u201d He cupped himself then, cradling his testicles for a moment before running his curled fingers up his shaft, his cock starting to rouse before her eyes as he masturbated himself, looking down at her, the bra open, panties wet. Her pussy contracted at the stimulus, her thighs quivering in reaction to the convulsion, and he logged it all, the SEAL who wouldn\u2019t miss a single detail.</p><p>Now he shifted again, bending so he could place his mouth on the damp area of her panties. She moaned, and his hands slipped beneath her, gripping her ass, kneading the curves as he suckled her, licked the fabric, a dragging friction that made her undulate harder. She was already so worked up, she wanted him inside her now. But she also wanted this gradual unfolding of pleasure to never end, so she said nothing, seeing where his clever mind took them both.</p><p>He pulled the crotch of the garment to the side to plunge his tongue inside her, and she cried out, locking her legs on his shoulders, heels pressed into his broad back. He took his time, settling down to play and tease until she was making helpless noises in her throat. Then he ducked out from beneath the hold of her legs. Before she anticipated what he was doing, he\u2019d turned her onto her stomach. He pressed his chest against her back, curling those powerful hands around her wrists, gently tugging her arms until they were out to either side of her. The stiffening evidence of his cock was against her buttocks, his thighs between hers, spreading her open to accommodate him. He kept the majority of his weight off her, letting her feel just enough of it to make her feel sheltered, pinned in the right way.</p><p>He kissed the back of her neck, the sides. He spent a great deal of time on her throat, the sensitive flesh beneath her ear, the line of the major artery, pumping fiercely beneath his heated mouth. Then he moved to the bump of spine at the nape, pushing her hair out of the way so he could tease the two slender bones that ran all the way to the base of her skull. He kept his hands on her wrists, thumbs caressing her thundering pulse. Now he was flexing against her ass, a teasing, coital rhythm that had her rising up against him in matching response, feeling him get harder, thicker, more ready.</p><p>She had her eyes closed as he moved to her cheek bone, her jaw, and she tilted it up to give him access to the soft skin beneath. \u201cYou are everything, Mistress,\u201d he murmured against her flesh. \u201cBeautiful. Fearsome. Perfect...\u201d</p><p>There was a word hanging in the air there, something she could feel him wanting to say. However, even in this charged, enchanted moment, he was mindful of her past, caring of her feelings. When two were cuffed, not just one, it made the possession even more powerful</p><p>\u201cPlease say it, Max.\u201d She trembled, hard, and he laid his cheek against hers.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy Mistress.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d said it spontaneously the first time. This time, she\u2019d requested it.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she agreed, closing her eyes. His hands tightened on her wrists, then he let go of one of her hands so she could turn it to meet his, palm to palm, fingers twisted together.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours too, Mistress. Always.\u201d</p><p>He let her go then, but only to slide that muscular arm around her waist, bringing her up to her knees as he tugged her thin panties down to her thighs. He came back down over her, pelvis flush against her ass, cock pressing against her tender flesh as he shifted his hold so his forearm was banded above her breasts. It allowed her to rest her chin on his forearm, press her cheek to his shoulder. He guided himself into her, sliding in slow. She moved her hips, accommodating, adjusting to his thickness and length, and made a tiny feminine noise as he came to a stop deep inside her. His free arm was braced next to her, the anchor point for them both as he began to move.</p><p>Usually, she needed some clit stimulation to come in this position, but her whole body had become an erogenous nerve center, ready to detonate. Plus, when he started to move with more demand, his testicles began to hit her clit with each stroke, the stretch of her labia to accommodate his thrusts sending little frissons of sensations to that rich nerve center. She curled her hands around his arm over her chest, wanting, needing to hold on to him as he took them both somewhere she\u2019d never gone before.</p><p>The climax was almost unbearably pleasurable, coiling up tighter and tighter, like the moment before a dancer bounded upon the stage in a dramatic grande jete, a leap for the heavens.</p><p>\u201cLet me hear you come, Mistress. Make my cock harder.\u201d</p><p>The words were like the stage manager in the wings, that dramatic whisper.</p><p>Go.</p><p>She made that leap, pouring all her energy and desire into it, breaking loose of every restraint, every binding and fear of the past to give him all of herself. To soar.</p><p>She cried out his name, mixing it with screams of pleasure as he kept thrusting, taking her over that cliff and sending her flying, a grande jete with no end, so she reached the heavens in truth. She bit his arm, and his fingers tightened on her shoulder, holding her with bruising strength now. He understood\u2014she wanted to feel his lust override his gentleness. Everything was primitive yet euphoric, animal demand meeting a profound, mind-numbing experience.</p><p>Toward the end, he came again as well, a tight, intense release that shot her into a series of rippling aftershocks. She reveled in his male groans against her ear, the jerk of his hips as he spilled his seed inside of her. Yes, yes, yes...</p><p>When the carousel came to a stop, they were clinging to one another, chests rising and falling in rapid counterpoint. His mouth was against her throat again, hers against his arm. She squeezed him inside of her and won a half-chuckle, half groan. \u201cJesus, that feels good.\u201d So she did it again, and a few more times after that, enjoying his grunt of response each time, but then she was out of energy.</p><p>He shifted them so he was curled behind her, giving her his heat against that Texas post-sundown coolness she was only now beginning to notice. He wrapped both arms around her, holding her close. She didn\u2019t feel a need to talk and apparently neither did he, the two of them listening to the night sounds outside and the slowing rate of their thundering hearts.</p><p>She remembered what Gayle said. Many of them eventually go into law enforcement, security, things where they can indulge that craving, the edge they need...</p><p>She closed her eyes. Whatever would be, would be. Maybe she couldn\u2019t bear it, but she couldn\u2019t bear being without him either. She\u2019d cope, make sure that side of the scale kept the upper hand. Maybe that was how Gayle did it. Love could be fragile, yet once it passed that \u201call clear\u201d sign, it became one of the strongest things on earth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now she wiggled her toes in the thick hiking socks he\u2019d left on her feet. Her bra had been cast aside, her panties at her knees. \u201cThis is a sexy look,\u201d she ventured. \u201cI predict the Victoria\u2019s Secret models will be walking the runway in their lingerie and knee-high camping socks at next year\u2019s fashion show.\u201d</p><p>He grinned against her jaw, sliding a hand down her belly to tease her mound with his long fingers, then tucked them between her legs, resting them against the slippery petals of flesh. \u201cFor the record, I find it a very sexy look. Much sexier than those stupid wings and New York fashion stuff they pile on them to detract from what us guys really want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She tightened her thighs on his fingers, rubbing her ass against his damp cock.</p> <p>\u201cStop that,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re going to kill me. Take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, women in their forties are just hitting their sexual peak. You better build up some stamina, sailor.\u201d</p><p>When he chuckled sleepily, she smiled against his biceps, pressed a kiss there. Then she became still against him, letting him ease into a light doze, content to be held by him as he slept. The current moment was all anyone was ever promised, after all. She wasn\u2019t going to waste it on worry about tomorrow.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to your fingers?\u201d Lucas asked, touching one of the Superman Band-Aids Janet had on the pads of two of her fingers. \u201cI like those, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>She examined the design. She\u2019d bought them to tease Max, but the way he\u2019d put them on her fingers, kissing them to take the hurt away afterward, had led to a different kind of teasing. \u201cMax showed me how to use a bow when we went camping this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there video? I\u2019d pay good money to see that.\u201d Ben slid a hip on her desk. He peered at the Band-Aids as well, shook his head. \u201cSo did you take down a three-point stag? A forest ranger? Other campers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never harm an animal for sport,\u201d she informed him loftily. \u201cAnd other campers only if they were annoying. No, we were target shooting.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought of snipers as men with fancy, high-tech rifles, but she\u2019d learned that high-powered bows were also used by SEAL snipers, to take out targets without the muzzle flash that could give away their position. He hadn\u2019t brought one of those, of course, but a basic, decent-quality bow they could use for practice. They\u2019d done that, gone hiking, eaten Gayle\u2019s meals and enjoyed gorgeous scenery, special places Max knew from visiting the park before.</p><p>On the second night, when they were sitting by the fire, Janet had read to him. She\u2019d brought a couple books, a Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child thriller, as well as a biography of Margaret Thatcher. He\u2019d asked her to read to him from the thriller, stretching out on his side, teasing a lock of her hair, occasionally pressing a kiss to her hip where she sat on a log. When he noticed her shifting from the log\u2019s hardness, he changed their positions, putting her between his legs, becoming her chair on the soft forest floor, letting her lie back against his chest while he propped against the log.</p><p>He might make her a camper yet. It had been peaceful, in a very different, very pleasing way.</p> <p>\u201cYou will locate no YouTube footage of this trip,\u201d she informed Ben. \u201cAnd get off my desk. I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and rose. \u201cI told Marcie what you said, about helping her with the wedding. She\u2019ll probably be calling soon. Why a wedding needs to be planned this far in advance, I have no clue, but I\u2019m leaving it to you women. You all just tell me when to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pencil it into your calendar,\u201d Janet said dryly. \u201cAnd add a weekly reminder, so you don\u2019t plan anything over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Lucas snorted. The two men moved into Matt\u2019s office for their morning meet. It would be a short one, because in an hour they\u2019d all be at the airport, on their way to South America for the next three days to oversee the ownership transfer of a plant there. Max wasn\u2019t on schedule today, and she knew he was going to visit Amanda after dropping Dana off at her church. She wondered if he\u2019d come back by the office to have lunch with her, but Dana might pull him into doing some volunteer task at her place. Or maybe he had some other errands to handle, or something going on with Dale. She\u2019d just spent several days with him, for Heaven\u2019s sake. They weren\u2019t at the point they were reporting schedules to one another, after all, and she was both amused and irritated at herself for thinking along those lines.</p><p>Get a grip, Janet.</p><p>Still, when lunchtime came, and the office was quiet without any of the K&amp;A men around, she decided to take the trolley to Dana\u2019s church. Ben and Marcie wanted Dana to officiate, so she and Janet could go ahead and discuss some early details. It was a gorgeous afternoon in New Orleans and she\u2019d enjoy the stroll from the trolley to the church, as long as she wasn\u2019t mugged in the dubious neighborhood where it was located. The Taser in her purse was there for backup, but usually her direct, icy stare told any idlers she wasn\u2019t an easy target.</p><p>When she entered the church through the office area, the church secretary told her Dana was in with the minister. \u201cBut if you want to wait in the nave, Ms. Albright, I\u2019ll send her to you when she comes out of the meeting. Probably about fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Janet nodded. \u201cIs Max Ackerman here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo ma\u2019am. He was out at the basketball court earlier, but I think Dana said he had to run an errand.\u201d</p><p>Janet nodded, then followed the hallway to the main body of the church, taking the side door into the cool chamber. As she moved down the aisle between the pews, she absorbed that universal hush, the sense of peace, that all churches seemed to contain. It made her think about their birch forest, how similar the two places were.</p><p>She\u2019d never considered herself much of an outdoorsy person, but there was something to be said for camping with a man who knew how to care for a woman, cushioning her from the more unpleasant aspects of outdoor living. He\u2019d had bug spray, toilet paper, wine, homemade lasagna...the man was a treasure.</p><p>She slipped into the second pew from the front, studying the altar. The wooden crucifix had been carved by one of the parishioners, primitive and moving at once, the stretch of Jesus\u2019 arms, the agony of his lean body, contrasting with the acceptance on his face. If a person chose to believe the story, he\u2019d seen both the good and evil in men\u2019s hearts and loved all of them anyway.</p><p>She thought of Jorge, the things he\u2019d done to her, to others. The world he\u2019d inhabited had been a world of violence and blood. Yet at one time, he\u2019d been a baby in some mother\u2019s arms. Had his mother hoped for good things for him, the way Max\u2019s mother had hoped for her son? What would Mary have done if the angel had told her the whole story? Yes, her son would bring hope to the world, but he\u2019d also be betrayed and crucified. He\u2019d die an excruciating death when he was barely in his thirties, because of the message of peace and hope he\u2019d brought.</p><p>What would Jorge\u2019s mother have done if she was told the baby in her arms would beat a woman\u2019s legs into broken kindling, smash her face, all to keep her with him?</p><p>Rising, she moved to the altar. While Dana\u2019s church wasn\u2019t Catholic, she\u2019d suggested the tradition of having candles available so people could light them for loved ones, to add to the strength of their prayers. Peter\u2019s wife didn\u2019t hesitate to mix religious traditions to capture the interest and needs of her parishioners. Janet picked up the taper, put it in the flame of one of the lit candles. Her hand was trembling, she noticed, her chest tight, but she firmed her grip, took a breath and touched the taper to an unlit candle.</p><p>All these years, and she\u2019d spared no thought to Jorge, blocking him out of her mind, trying to get ahead of the horror he\u2019d inflicted upon her, trying to keep it contained. Perhaps they were right, that love opened unexpected rooms in one\u2019s heart, because for the first time, she gave an ounce of her compassion to the man he might have been. To the mother who bore him, the hopes she\u2019d harbored for him. She also lit the candle as hope that maybe there\u2019d be a day when every heart would embrace love over hate.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go further with it than that, but it was far more than she\u2019d ever given. She also asked forgiveness for taking a life. She couldn\u2019t have done it differently, wouldn\u2019t have, but she could feel regret over the act itself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured to the still air. Sorry could cover a lot of things, and it felt better saying it, as if a small weight was lifted off her heart. Yes, falling in love could suck. But it could also bring better things.</p><p>\u201cJanet?\u201d</p><p>Swiping away the small tear that had escaped her eye, Janet turned to see Dana at the entrance to the sanctuary, her fingertips resting on the doorframe. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Dana came down the aisle, sweeping her cane ahead of her, comfortable enough with the surroundings that it appeared mostly a precaution. \u201cThis is an unexpected surprise. Were you getting too much work done without them underfoot? You needed spiritual counseling to handle the shock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d Janet laughed. \u201cNo, I thought it was a nice day to be out, and I figured I\u2019d stop by and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if Max was here. Since he\u2019s not, you\u2019ll tell me you came to talk about the wedding so he doesn\u2019t find out you\u2019re stalking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m starting to understand why Rachel pinches you all the time.\u201d</p><p>Dana grinned, gesturing to the pews nearest them so they could both take a seat. \u201cMax was here earlier this morning, repairing the basketball goal, but he headed out about midmorning. One of the kids said the goal\u2019s not fixed yet, so I assume he needed another tool and got tied up with something else. Since he\u2019s picking me up this afternoon, he\u2019ll likely come back in time to finish the goal and take me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d Yet Janet glanced down at her phone, her brow furrowing. Max often sent her texts throughout his day. She hadn\u2019t had one since he\u2019d left her bed this morning. She\u2019d gotten busy with the guys, had thought about sending him one on the trolley, but figured if she was going to be seeing him... She admitted part of the reason she hadn\u2019t sent one was she enjoyed the messages he devised to coax her to text him back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quelling the desire to send him a clingy text like Where the hell are you? I haven\u2019t heard from you every hour on the hour, just like a cuckoo clock, she turned her attention to her very valid reason for being here. Even if it was an excuse.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to touch base with you about Marcie and Ben\u2019s wedding, to see if you\u2019re going to need anything from Ben regarding the ceremony or the vows. That way I know when to start badgering him, make sure he has it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Dana beamed. \u201cI spoke to Cass the other night. She\u2019s doing the big-sister thing. She isn\u2019t really sure if it\u2019s good for Marcie to get married so young, but the fact they\u2019re waiting until spring helps.\u201d</p> <p>Janet suspected Cass worried that Ben hadn\u2019t yet made enough progress in dealing with the debris of his past to make a good husband, but he would be. He was an impossibly strong-willed man, but all five of the K&amp;A men were. They were also incapable of ignoring their primary imperative\u2014the well-being of the women they considered theirs.</p><p>\u201cWe all expected they\u2019d marry,\u201d Dana continued, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d be the type to go on for years before making the decision. I expect Ben would have done just that, he\u2019s so new to all the relationship stuff, but Marcie probably threatened to date other guys if he didn\u2019t marry her within a year of her moving in.\u201d</p><p>Janet could well believe Marcie would pull such a move. What had Ben said? \u201cShe made me agree to marry her\u201d, not \u201cI asked her to marry me\u201d. Ben was the most hardcore of all of them, a sexual sadist definitely not for the fainthearted submissive, but Marcie embraced and even craved that side of him. \u201cI think she\u2019d better remember he has the resources to create an actual dungeon beneath his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would only excite her,\u201d Dana said, confirming Janet\u2019s thoughts. Since the minister didn\u2019t wear her sunglasses in the church, Janet saw her pale green eyes twinkle. Then Dana put a finger to her lips, a self-admonishment in deference to their surroundings. \u201cBut anyhow, yes, there are a few things you can put on his calendar. They\u2019ve agreed to a series of sessions to discuss the significance of marriage with Reverend Morris, and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReverend Dana? There she is. Yo, Reverend Dana.\u201d</p> <p>Two teenagers had appeared at the entrance to the nave. The one who\u2019d spoken came down the aisle at a trot, dragging a slighter boy behind him. They were both dressed in oversized jeans and T-shirts, a hoodie flopping off the narrow shoulders of the one being dragged.</p><p>\u201cJimmy, slow down. This is a church, not a gymnasium,\u201d Dana scolded, but she had her hand out as they came to her. \u201cWho\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerence. He\u2019s got something he needs to tell you, right now.\u201d Janet saw the slighter boy\u2019s cheeks had dried tear tracks. Dana picked up on his distress, because she rose, settling her hands on his shoulders. Despite his age, he was still a few inches taller than her. The other boy towered over them both. \u201cC\u2019mon, man, tell her fast. He don\u2019t have time for you to dick around. To waste,\u201d he corrected himself, casting an apologetic look toward the altar, much as Dana had when she was referencing Marcie\u2019s sexual preferences.</p><p>\u201cYour driver, the big dude...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d Janet spoke before Dana could, stepping up beside her. That faint unease in her gut was suddenly doing a meringue across her vitals. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>Terence\u2019s eyes slid to her. Dana\u2019s hands tightened on him, however. \u201cShe\u2019s all right. You can trust her. Tell us, Terence. What\u2019s happened? Is Max all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s totally fucked, is what,\u201d Jimmy said, then winced as Dana sent him a searing look. \u201cSorry, Reverend D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to find out something for him,\u201d Terence blurted out. \u201cA few months ago. I almost forgot about it, and I wish I had. But I gave him the info this morning, and he left. But it wasn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He burst into tears then. It shattered the street toughness, made it clear he was barely in his teens. Even so, Janet had to restrain herself from shaking the rest out of him. Dana caught that vibration, because now she had one hand on Terence, one on Janet\u2019s forearm. \u201cSome guy gave me money to tell Max something,\u201d the boy continued, \u201cbut that\u2019s just like Judas, isn\u2019t it? I needed it for my mom, but when I told her how I got it, she said I had to come tell you, and I know it was wrong, but I can\u2019t take it back...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that now. Tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax wanted to know if this particular dude came back to the neighborhood. A Mexican guy called Dino. A long time ago, he used to be hooked up with the 9th Streeters, ferrying their shit to them. He hasn\u2019t been around in a really long time, but he showed back up. I don\u2019t know how he knew I was on the lookout for him, but one of Dino\u2019s guys came to me, told me if I\u2019d tell Max he\u2019d be at this one place, he\u2019d give me a grand in cash. But Max couldn\u2019t know that we\u2019d talked. It had to be like Max would think he was surprising Dino, but that means they were gonna be the ones doing the surprising.\u201d</p><p>The kid was sobbing. \u201cI knew it was wrong, so I went asking around, but it was too late. He went straight there. I talked to some homeless dudes and they said Dino\u2019s guys carried something out in a sack. Something the size of a guy like Max.\u201d</p><p>Janet\u2019s heart faltered, her vision getting skewed, but she dug her fingers into the top of a pew, holding fast as Terence kept talking.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to hold him somewhere until Dino gets in tonight, to deal with him himself, settle some score he has with Max. Nobody \u2019round there knew where he\u2019d been taken though. He\u2019s gonna be dead, Reverend Dana. And it\u2019ll be all my fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you tell Max to meet Dino?\u201d Dana asked firmly, giving him a shake to keep him on track.</p><p>As Terence relayed the location of a derelict building in the warehouse district, Janet already had her cell phone out. When the man answered on the other end, she took a breath. \u201cDale, we need your help. Max may be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Dale came to the church. Marcie arrived about the same time, with a zippered black duffle bag almost bigger and heavier than herself, but the lissome, athletic blonde carried it easily. Dana had called her right after Janet spoke to Dale. Janet had also called Alice, managing to tell her in a calm voice she\u2019d decided to take the rest of the day off to get some errands done. She\u2019d given her direction on FedExing out several contracts and disconnected. She didn\u2019t want Alice involved in this.</p><p>\u201cSo explain to me why we\u2019re not calling the cops?\u201d Marcie asked, putting down the bag. They\u2019d moved to an activity room at the back of the church where it was quiet. Dana had sent Terence and his friend to talk to the minister, so it was just the adults now.</p><p>\u201cBeyond the fact we don\u2019t have a location at this point, when we do, if the bad guys hear sirens, they\u2019ll just kill him and cut out. There are also too many questions that\u2019ll be raised about why they took Max in the first place. There\u2019s a reason Dino has laid low as long as he has. He knows Max took out two of his buddies and has been on the lookout for him for a while.\u201d</p><p>Dale spoke bluntly, but Janet had told him everyone in the room could be trusted. The fact he took her at her word meant he\u2019d gauged her character at their one meet and found her to be someone he could trust. Any other time she\u2019d been flattered by it, but all she felt was a pounding urgency to get moving, to do something. But she had to trust him as well.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kept him scared enough to stay in the shadows, but time blunts fear. There\u2019ve also been some power shifts happening in his cartel, so that\u2019s probably why Dino popped back on the grid. He\u2019s ready to move back into the limelight with the 9th Streeters, capitalizing on his old contacts with them. Max is a loose end in the way of that.\u201d Dale propped a hip on a table. \u201cI\u2019ve already gone by the warehouse where the kid sent Max. Saw evidence of the scuffle, but no one\u2019s there. If they put him on a boat, we\u2019d likely be screwed, but my guess is they\u2019re not going to take him far. It sounds like Dino has a vested interest in making the kill here, so he can reestablish his power base.\u201d</p><p>Janet parsed the words, boxing up \u201ckill\u201d so it had nothing to do with Max. She concentrated on Dale\u2019s information, on what needed to be done. Dana had made a good call with Marcie. Though the young woman blinked at the information, pressing her lips together, she held firm.</p><p>\u201cI have feelers out to figure out where they took him,\u201d Dale said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t take long. Wherever they hold him, it will be a defensible position, with lookouts outside, anticipating any trouble, and more watching him inside. Some crews like the impressive show of numbers, but I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll luck out and it will be more low key than that.\u201d</p><p>He tapped the cellphone on his hip. \u201cI have reinforcements coming. Four operators are near enough to be called into action. They\u2019re on their way. Once they get here, we\u2019ll figure out a way to get eyes on the inside, create a distraction, and then make our move from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat evidence?\u201d Janet asked. When Dale\u2019s gaze turned to her, she firmed her chin. \u201cYou said there was evidence of a scuffle? Blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, blood. Broken crates, what looks like a fist plowed into the wall of the warehouse.\u201d</p><p>Blood. Why had she asked? Max\u2019s face, his torso, all those perfect lines of muscle, flashed through her mind. An empty corpse, lying in a pool of blood.</p><p>\u201cBut no body, Janet.\u201d Dale gave her a hard look. \u201cKeep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said shortly. And she was. Ice was flowing through her veins, a simmering rage. At Max, at Dino, at Dale, at the whole situation. She needed to get a grip on it. She could tell Dale registered her tension, and she couldn\u2019t be less than invincible right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got surveillance equipment to help with the eyes inside stuff,\u201d Marcie spoke. \u201cAnd I stopped at your house to get the things you wanted.\u201d She directed that to Dana. \u201cIt was tough to leave the assault rifle behind. That was sweet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s hard to conceal,\u201d Dana said dryly. \u201cAs long as you have the handguns and the Tasers, we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guys will come geared,\u201d Dale said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for you,\u201d Dana responded. \u201cYou need eyes inside and a distraction, right? If you\u2019re right, there\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s going to get you through the outer perimeter and inside, and it\u2019s not a bunch of strapping guys who are obvious military. If you pose as a homeless derelict stumbling into their lair, they\u2019ll shoot first and dump the body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what are you proposing?\u201d Dale raised his brow. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m taking civilians into an op like this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we called you, so technically it\u2019s our op.\u201d Dana\u2019s expression hardened. If Janet hadn\u2019t known of Dana\u2019s military background before, she\u2019d have been forcibly reminded of it now, because her expression mirrored Dale\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m a combat veteran, Marcie is MMA trained and has used it\u2014more than capably\u2014for her job in corporate investigations. She also knows her firearms.\u201d</p><p>Marcie nodded. Her brown eyes were cool, her hip cocked and arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cAs for Janet,\u201d Dana tilted her head toward her, \u201csome of her nicknames at K&amp;A include Ice Bitch and Scybo. It\u2019s an acronym for She\u2019ll Cut Your Balls Off. Sorry if you didn\u2019t know that, Janet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You left out Dragon Lady. HR likes that one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry to be rude, but you\u2019re blind, soldier.\u201d Dale reached out, tapped Dana\u2019s forehead with one finger.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the newsflash. The blind have over-developed proximity senses. Consider it like the Force. I could have caught hold of your wrist just now and broken some shit, but didn\u2019t want to mess up your trigger finger.\u201d</p><p>Dale set his jaw, but before he could say anything else, Janet stepped forward. \u201cI get it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel comfortable with this. But they\u2019re right about the eyes inside and distraction, aren\u2019t they? It would be ideal if all three of us had your training, but perhaps that\u2019s not what this moment requires. It simply requires the ability to stay cool under pressure, to play a role no matter what stressors occur. The firepower, the strength, the accuracy, the response\u2014that will be your area, yours and your guys. Dana isn\u2019t overestimating our abilities. There are women who work as cultural support teams to SEALs, women with military training, aren\u2019t there? This is like that.\u201d</p><p>This was how she accomplished things for Matt. Lay out the facts, the logic. Though she\u2019d never compared meeting arrangements, legal documentation and handling the schedules of five busy men to planning a military op, she expected some of the same advance planning skills and anticipation of contingencies were needed. As well as a cool, level head. She could do that. Because if she looked beyond that, there was terror, trembling...the smell of blood permanently embedded in her nose.</p><p>Dale blew out a breath. \u201cMax said you\u2019d been watching way too many SEAL training videos. Okay, soldier,\u201d he directed that to Dana, \u201ctell me the plan. But let me make one thing clear.\u201d</p><p>He swept a hard gaze over all of them. \u201cI am in charge of this op, which means you follow my orders from beginning to end. If you don\u2019t convince me that what you\u2019re thinking is a sound plan and our best chance, then you\u2019ll obey my order to stand down and let me and my men handle this. The objective is to get Max out of this alive. You have to trust me to know the best way to do that. All right?\u201d</p> <p>Dana and Marcie didn\u2019t speak. Instead, they looked toward Janet, and she saw Dale did the same. By stepping forward, she\u2019d taken the leadership role, and Dana and Marcie had deferred to her. Though Janet knew she had formidable organization skills, she didn\u2019t think that topped their tactical skills. They were deferring to her because they somehow realized she had the most to lose. That terrified place inside her trembled hard, and she clamped down on it like a pit bull. Reminding herself she was the Ice Bitch, she gave a short nod. \u201cFair enough. Dana, tell us what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>When Dana was done, Dale had grilled her twenty different ways on it, tweaking and refining. Janet and Marcie jumped in here and there to add additional details, which seemed to increase Dale\u2019s confidence in all of them. By the time he seemed satisfied, the others had arrived. Four strapping men was a good description, though it wasn\u2019t because of their size. Lawrence was no taller than five-seven yet stocky with muscle, and Neil had a rangy Jimmy Stewart build. Billy was closer to the size of Dale, and sounded like he\u2019d come straight out of the West Virginia hills. But they all had the same stamp she\u2019d noticed on Max. They were men trained to undertake dangerous jobs and not let anything stop them from succeeding.</p><p>The fourth man was Aaron, but rather than having him come to the church, Dale explained he\u2019d sent him to collect intel in the field.</p><p>The ticking clock in her head was going to drive her mad. Terence had been clear. They were to take Max, hold him for Dino, and the street intel said Dino wasn\u2019t coming in until after dark. It was closing in on five o\u2019clock now. Max had to still be alive, unless something had gone wrong on the snatch, and if that had been the case, Dale would have found his body. She swallowed over a jagged ball in her throat.</p><p>\u201cMaster Chief?\u201d Neil extended his cell phone to Dale. \u201cMight want to show them our target.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Dale turned the picture on the screen to them. \u201cThis is Dino\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelgado,\u201d Janet finished, staring at the picture. \u201cI know him.\u201d</p><p>The world had tilted. Dale reached out to steady her, Marcie slipping a hand around her waist. Janet\u2019s mind fought through the swimming hysteria. No. It\u2019s been over fifteen fucking years. I am not letting this control me.</p> <p>\u201cI was involved with a man in Mexico, years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was one of his associates. He was very low on the totem pole then, but obviously he\u2019s moved up.\u201d Probably due to the gap she provided by taking out Jorge.</p><p>\u201cSo does that help us or harm us?\u201d Neil asked.</p><p>\u201cHelps,\u201d she said, firming her chin. \u201cIt will make our cover more believable. We can adjust the plan like this...\u201d</p><p>The initial objections were fierce, because the adjustment put her at the front of the approach, but they couldn\u2019t argue with the logic to it, not when she laid it out as coolly as she did, pointing out flaws in any argument against it. After the strategy was mapped out thoroughly with all players, there was a moment of significant silence. Dale shook his head. \u201cMax won\u2019t forgive me if you get hurt, Janet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about his forgiveness. He\u2019s mine. I\u2019m getting him back. You said if the plan wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it, you\u2019d say so. You\u2019re not saying so.\u201d</p><p>The SEAL met her gaze, nodded. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s a sound plan.\u201d</p><p>He drew his men away, going over tactical issues relevant to their placement outside the potential location. Janet and Marcie looked at one another, Marcie reaching out to cover Dana\u2019s hand. \u201cOne of us needs to call Savannah,\u201d Janet said. \u201cTell her what we\u2019re doing, so if something goes wrong...she\u2019ll know what happened and can notify Matt, do damage control as needed. Know how to find us.\u201d</p><p>Anticipate contingencies, make sure the flow of information was adequate to keep all necessary parties informed. Who knew being a secretary would prove to be so useful on a special op?</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Dana said. \u201cShe\u2019ll bring Rachel into the loop. We might need her before the night is over. She can pave our way into medical facilities with few questions. Unless we\u2019re dead, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Marcie gave them her serious smile, though her brown eyes glinted. \u201cOn the plus side, if this goes well, Ben is going to be so pissed at me. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou twisted freak,\u201d Dana said with fond exasperation, but then she closed her hand on Janet\u2019s, linking the three of them. \u201cAre you okay, honey?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never been the type of person anyone would call honey. In fact, no one had ever used an endearment on her. Except Max. He called her Mistress, meant it like that. \u201cI can\u2019t lose him,\u201d she said tonelessly. She felt like an iron furnace, everything locked down yet containing hellfire. \u201cI just found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting him back,\u201d Dana said resolutely. \u201cCount on it. You knowing the target is going to be a big plus, Janet.\u201d</p><p>Marcie nodded, putting her hand on Janet\u2019s other arm, squeezing hard. Despite her joke, the young woman\u2019s eyes were sharp as a knife blade. She could handle herself in this environment. They all could. They\u2019d all been there, in one way or another. Janet thought of the blood on her hands, running down a sink, and closed her fingers into fists. She\u2019d killed Jorge when she was in her twenties. Now, in her forties, she could endure, handle anything. Except losing the man she\u2019d finally given her heart.</p><p>Dale had insisted on a thorough understanding of how she knew Dino. She hadn\u2019t told him she\u2019d murdered Jorge, because no one in the world but Matt and Max knew that, but she told him she\u2019d gotten away from Jorge and then heard he\u2019d been murdered by a competitor. All technically true, so she didn\u2019t feel it hampered their efforts to leave it like that. Going after a man who\u2019d been kidnapped, who might be killed, was one thing, and bad enough. Making Dale and the rest of them accessories after the fact to her crime was a whole other scenario.</p><p>As a result, she understood why Max had wanted to go after Dino on his own, to avoid putting his fellow SEALs in the position of breaking the law to come to his aid. Yet the day Dale had given her his cell number, his direct look had been a silent, clear message. That was Max\u2019s choice, but Dale had the right to make choices of his own. Just as Dana and Marcie had made the choice to be here with her now, the three of them risking their lives for Max.</p><p>\u201cGot him.\u201d Dale snapped his phone closed, turned around. He met Janet\u2019s eyes. \u201cAaron says they moved him to another abandoned warehouse right off the waterfront. It\u2019s a maze down there. Even better, it\u2019s the typical rathole where, if the cops ask, nobody sees anything. Got three guys on the outside, four inside. They\u2019re part of Dino\u2019s crew from Mexico, not locals. That works in our favor as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow is that?\u201d Janet asked.</p><p>Lawrence was checking his handgun. When he popped the slide, the stocky man glanced up at her with sharp green eyes.</p><p>\u201cNobody sees anything, that means they don\u2019t see us either. Not that we\u2019re easy to see anyhow. If they see us, we haven\u2019t done our job.\u201d He flashed a dangerous smile. \u201cAs far as them being from Mexico? Easier to get rid of out-of-town bodies, ma\u2019am. They don\u2019t belong here.\u201d</p> <p>At that, Marcie paled a little, and of course Dale latched right on to it. \u201cDana, I\u2019m going to say it again. Goddamn non-combatants shouldn\u2019t be a part of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to go over it again. We have a sound plan, remember?\u201d Janet interjected it sharply. Dale shot her a cold look, one she was sure could intimidate a whole platoon of SEALs, but she gave him a stone-cold bitch look right back. \u201cI know what could happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe you do. You have that look. She doesn\u2019t.\u201d He jerked his head toward Marcie. \u201cI\u2019m going to lay it out clear, kid. Lives are going to be taken on this op. Max has been hunting Dino for a while, and the guys with him are connected to a cartel. The only way we protect everyone here, and our families, is by not a one of them going home telling the story. Do you get that? You can stay home and no shame to it. I\u2019d feel a hell of a lot better if you did.\u201d</p><p>This time, Dana and Janet waited for Marcie, since it was obvious her response was what Dale was gauging. The young woman firmed her chin and, though she didn\u2019t have Janet\u2019s icy look, she met his gaze squarely. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill Max if we don\u2019t go in,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me if they aren\u2019t taken out, our families are in danger. That\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much Old Testament stock.\u201d Dana laid her hand on Marcie\u2019s arm, support and approval at once in the gesture, and tilted her head in Dale\u2019s direction. \u201cOnly we prefer a more proactive approach. Get them before they get us. Let\u2019s go take our boy back.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019d been no further discussion about it after that. It was clear Dale didn\u2019t like it, but they were out of time and the plan was the best they had. After that, the men fell into a seamless operational rhythm. Dale stayed in communication with Aaron via phone, the absent man relaying information back to the team at the church to fine-tune what they could tell from the satellite picture they called up of the location. They tweaked the plan accordingly, then turned their attention to ensuring the women were outfitted with the gear they needed.</p><p>Dana wore an earpiece inside one ear to hear Dale\u2019s communications, since with her blindness it passed as a hearing aid. Janet had both a camera and listening device as part of the pendant she was wearing. The special necklace was one Marcie had used when she worked with Pickard Consulting. It had remained part of her arsenal for her corporate investigation duties at Tennyson Industries. Since then, Jon had helped her re-design the already excellent technology it possessed, so Janet wasn\u2019t surprised that Dale pronounced it as more than suitable for their purposes.</p><p>Marcie and Dana had done a full costume change for the part they were supposed to play. After examining the choices Marcie had brought for all of them, and considering what she knew of Dino, Janet had decided to go with what she was wearing, making only a few adjustments. Using scissors, she\u2019d increased the back slit six inches, so the snug skirt showed a hint of the lace-top stockings she was wearing. She traded out her more comfortable pumps for a pair of chocolate-brown stilettos Marcie had brought. Fortunately, she and Marcie were comparable in shoe size. The pain of wearing the narrower heel on her misshapen feet was a small matter.</p><p>Taking off her cream-colored shell, she exchanged the demure lace bra beneath for a black lace one that had cups a size too small and pushed her breasts almost out of them. She put her suit jacket over it, the pendant teasing her bare cleavage. Taking her hair down, she brushed it out to its full glory. She enhanced her makeup, adding a cream gloss to her lips but keeping it classy.</p><p>One high-dollar escort to order, from head to toe.</p><p>When she came out of the bathroom, she was mildly gratified by the appraising glances of the four men, and Dale gave her an approving nod. \u201cSexy as hell, ma\u2019am. Should do the trick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo pun intended,\u201d Dana quipped. Janet ran her gaze over the other women. In comparison, they\u2019d gone for the cheap streetwalker look, heavy makeup and clothes just this side of the law. Marcie had teased up her hair in a sultry tangle around her face, wearing a miniskirt that barely covered her ass and a low-cut tank long enough to cover the waistband\u2014as well as the firearm she was carrying there. Dana\u2019s likewise skimpy attire was artfully arranged to handle the Taser. Despite her thoughts on choices and free will, Janet felt worry grip her. If either of them got hurt...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think like that. They were as prepared as they could be. Max might not want any of them to risk themselves for him, but that was too bad. He was just going to have to live with owing them for the rest of his life, which she hoped would be a long, long time.</p><p>The two men hanging around in front of the warehouse gave the dark four-door sedan a studied look as she drove up. Parking it about fifty feet away, Janet got out, making sure they saw lots of leg as she did. She tossed her hair back and sauntered their way, hips swaying.</p><p>\u201cBoys.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI was told to meet Dino here. Compliments of the 9th Streeters. They wanted him to have a welcome-home gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich 9th Streeter?\u201d The dark eyes of the taller man narrowed on her, but she noticed the other one was just enjoying an ogle of her body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my department, sugar. They called, wired three thousand cash to my handler, told her to give Dino everything he wants. I\u2019m everything any man could want.\u201d She took out her hand mirror, checked her lipstick and hair. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this game long enough to know how to curl a man\u2019s toes and leave him smiling. So where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t here yet, puta. And when he does get here, he\u2019s got business to attend. You go sit your pretty ass in the car and wait on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love taking care of a businessman.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI can wait in my rental. It\u2019s the nicest room in this house, for sure.\u201d She cast a disparaging look over their surroundings. \u201cBut do you mind if I take care of a ladies room need first? I drove up here from Houston.\u201d At their scowls, the protests rising on their lips, she sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what\u2019s inside. Dead bodies, drugs, whatever. I\u2019ve seen it all and I remember none of it. I used to be Jorge Alvarez\u2019s girl, after all. I only want a bathroom.\u201d</p> <p>The man\u2019s gaze narrowed on her. \u201cJanelle?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never met her, but she expected the name was remembered. She nodded. \u201cAfter Jorge got taken out, I had to split. Ended up with this nice operation out of Texas, taking care of boys on both sides of the border when you have needs. But my preference is still brown skin and those lovely, fuck-me-blind dark eyes.\u201d She gave him a feline smile, and his gaze slid down her body, back up again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you take care of us while you\u2019re waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, sugar. Got to have some professional decorum. You might muss the package Dino\u2019s expecting. But maybe if you\u2019re around afterward, you could buy me a drink and we\u2019ll talk. Bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bitch!\u201d</p><p>Janet turned to see two streetwalkers crossing the road toward her. They were arm in arm, weaving slightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you. This ain\u2019t your area, bitch, and you need to get your skank ass out of here before we kick it up into your throat.\u201d</p><p>She gave Dana credit. No one would guess those rasping, vicious words had just come out of the mouth of a minister. Marcie planted her feet about ten feet away and Dana held on to her arm even as she stepped out in front, shook a finger in Janet\u2019s direction. \u201cI may be blind, but I can smell that cheap-ass perfume a mile away. Now git.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitches better get yourself somewhere else,\u201d the second man said. \u201cThis is private hired entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOohhh...\u201d Marcie pursed her lips, gave him a sultry look from beneath her teased fall of hair. \u201cMaddy, I think he just called us common trash. Pussy is pussy, sweet boy. She might be sweeter-smelling, but I\u2019m waaay younger meat.\u201d She cast Janet a scornful look. \u201cI can pump your cock better too, even at half her price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave what crawling on it?\u201d the first man scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t nothing wrong with what I\u2019m offering,\u201d Marcie said indignantly. \u201cYou think high-priced is any cleaner than bargain? Use a glove, and it don\u2019t matter no how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re blind.\u201d The other man had stepped forward, and now he caught Dana\u2019s arm. She retaliated with a sharp kick to his shin that sent him hopping.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m blind, but don\u2019t be manhandling me, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCunt.\u201d He retaliated with a back hand that sent Dana stumbling into Marcie. Janet steeled herself not to move forward, but the black woman straightened quickly enough. Even gave him a sly smile through the split lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also not above playing rough.\u201d She sidled toward the man she\u2019d just kicked. \u201cGirl don\u2019t need her eyes to suck dick, does she?\u201d Her expression became even more provocative as she rubbed up against him. \u201cIn fact, I tend to rely way more on touch, sugar. You feel me?\u201d</p><p>Janet rolled her eyes, stepped past the first man. \u201cJust tell me where the bathroom is, sugar, and I\u2019ll leave you to deal with this trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo she ain\u2019t goin\u2019 in there. Not unless she want her ass kicked when she comes out.\u201d</p><p>As Marcie and Dana surged forward, the second man blocked them. The first one threw an exasperated look at Janet. \u201cFine. Go in that door. Tell Manny that Leo said you were fine and have him show you where the bathroom is. There\u2019s an upstairs office where you can wait.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Janet nodded. Slipping into the door, she tried not to worry about the sounds of a scuffle, Marcie\u2019s sudden cry of indignant pain as she was likely shoved back or hit, the way Dana had been.</p><p>She moved toward the main floor of the warehouse, trying to deaden every facial muscle she had so she wouldn\u2019t react to seeing Max. It was a good decision.</p><p>Chains were dangling from the ceiling above him, as if they\u2019d hung him there for a while. She could imagine it, his feet a few inches off the floor. She knew how the shoulders could scream in that position, how long before the danger of dislocation loomed. Right now, though, they had him stripped to his shorts and bound in a chair. Blood was running down his upper body, caused by multiple cuts from some kind of blade. There was also bruising, where he\u2019d likely been punched. Given that they were supposed to save the worst of it for Dino, she shuddered to think what Dino had in mind for Max.</p> <p>The four guarding Max must be the ones who\u2019d taken him at the first warehouse. The stiff way a couple of them moved, the cuts and bruises on their faces, suggested he hadn\u2019t gone down easy. She felt a visceral satisfaction at it, though nothing could override the cold clutch in her heart at seeing Max bound that way. She knew he had to be alive, but it was still nigh unbearable, seeing him motionless, his head hanging down, indicating he was unconscious.</p><p>At her appearance, the men went on full alert, one of them even drawing his gun. She channeled every ounce of will she had into looking unconcerned about the bleeding man in the center of the room. \u201cLeo told me to look for Manny. I\u2019m a present for Dino from the 9th Streeters, but I really need a bathroom. He said I could wait in an office somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe gotta search you first,\u201d one of them said, giving her a leering appraisal.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, with the bored indifference expected. \u201cJust be careful handling the merchandise, sugar. I\u2019m sure Dino would like his present intact.\u201d</p><p>At the first word she spoke, she noted a tightening of Max\u2019s shoulders, a slight twitch of his head. He was awake then. There was a relief to that, and an opportunity. They\u2019d concocted a couple plans, including one involving his participation. It was on her to determine if he was in a condition to do that. That question was answered easily enough.</p> <p>When he slowly lifted his head, she was confronted with a steel-gray gaze that said exactly what he thought of her being here. It reminded her of a Hulk movie, only in this case mild-mannered Dr. Banner had embraced his anger with both hands, welcoming the beast.</p><p>Hold fast, Max. I\u2019m here because we have a plan.</p><p>She forced herself to stay relaxed as Manny nodded to one of the other men. When he approached her for the search, she gave him a scornful look, raised her arms like a ballerina and did a slow pivot on the balls of her feet before he reached her. The move would give Dale a panoramic view of the surroundings, show him where everyone was. She gathered up her hair, twisting the mass of it on her neck so it wasn\u2019t impeding the search.</p><p>The man was as zealous as she expected, his hands wandering with great familiarity over her breasts, under her skirt, squeezing her ass and rubbing against her pussy, but he was also thorough in his search for weapons. She gave him a teasing look and bumped him with her ass when he got too pushy with his fingers. \u201cYou go any further with those, sugar, you have to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a feral grin, but then nodded to Manny. \u201cShe\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn so many ways. Bathroom?\u201d</p> <p>The next moment, her cheekbone exploded with pain. Manny had closed the three steps between them and knocked her down with the back of his hand. Even as the agony rocketed through her, she knew it had been designed to set her down on her ass, not to do any harm. She\u2019d been beaten by Jorge enough to know the difference between an object lesson and uncontrolled rage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be acting like you\u2019re more than a whore around us, just because you\u2019re some fancy piece sent by the 9th Streeters. Shit, they owe us. When Dino\u2019s done, we\u2019ll all take a piece of you, and they can consider it a tip on their back rent.\u201d</p><p>She got to her feet, tossing her hair back. She didn\u2019t dare a look at Max, but when she fell, she thought she\u2019d heard the chair scrape, as if he\u2019d lunged against the bonds. Fortunately, no one else had noticed that.</p><p>\u201cSugar, if you\u2019re the kind of boy who\u2019s into the pain, I can bend you over my knee and have you begging for Mama to give you more.\u201d</p><p>The other men snorted with laughter. Even Manny\u2019s expression eased. As she suspected, it had been a simple dominance gesture, nothing personal to it. \u201cBathroom\u2019s up that way.\u201d He pointed to the mezzanine behind Max.</p><p>All the better. She sauntered that way, but then she deviated on her track, bending down a couple feet away from Max to tsk him in a mocking voice. \u201cYou\u2019re having a bad, bad day, sugar, aren\u2019t you? Working for Jorge, I could have told you that Dino\u2019s the wrong badass to cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be...you knew Jorge?\u201d Manny\u2019s gaze sharpened on her.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She straightened. \u201cI used to be one of his. I told Leo that. When they cut him up, I came back here. But I wouldn\u2019t mind living South of the Border again. One of the reasons this job tonight interested me.\u201d She let her gaze pass over all of them. \u201cAnd why I\u2019m interested in seeing what I can do for Dino to make him appreciate me.\u201d</p> <p>Before they could stop her, she slid on to Max\u2019s knee, and ran the tip of her tongue over the blood at his temple. He was still playing unconscious, though he let out a grunt, his head trying to roll away from her as if he was disoriented. She caught his jaw to hold him fast. As she wet her lips with her tongue, she ran a provocative hand under her hair, letting it spill forward onto her breast, taunting him. \u201cHmm... You taste good, sugar.\u201d</p><p>She caressed his shoulder, let that hand drop to dig her nails into his bare back, hard enough he flinched, since she found a place they\u2019d already marked. She tightened her grip on his face, turning it so their eyes met. His were in half-slits. \u201cDino\u2019s going to kill you nice and slow for whatever nasty thing you did to him,\u201d she chided him. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have done that, you know. Shame. You\u2019re a pretty boy. Some mama\u2019s going to miss you terrible.\u201d</p><p>Standing up, she ruffled his hair like a schoolboy\u2019s. She licked away the blood on her fingers like cake icing. \u201cYou said the bathroom\u2019s upstairs?\u201d she asked Manny, her expression bored again.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re a bit of a twisted bitch, ain\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Janet smiled. She wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if there was frost coating her lips. She was made of ice, ice through her veins, even numbing the pain in her cheek. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She made her way up the mezzanine stairs with lots of hip action sure to draw attention. She heard the men chuckle among themselves, make comments about Dino either being a lucky bastard or one deserving their pity. In her peripheral vision, she could tell Max had lifted his head again. She couldn\u2019t look at him. She\u2019d worn the honeysuckle gloss he liked so much, a light layer over her lipstick. He would have smelled it, and she\u2019d left it on his skin, marking him. Hers. He was hers.</p><p>When she reached the top of the mezzanine she turned. \u201cManny, do you mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, and that was when the shot took him straight through the head, accompanied by the plink of broken glass from the window above her left shoulder.</p><p>Janet felt time slow down. A stunned expression crossed two of the men\u2019s faces in that elongated moment, but the third man never had time to register it. Another shot dropped him. Then things sped up, like a fiery star streaking across the heavens.</p><p>Max surged out of the chair, the zip ties on his wrists cut by the short knife she\u2019d given him when she\u2019d trailed her hand down his back, delivering the blade beneath her hair to his waiting hands. He used the blink of time when shock gripped his enemies to cut his ankles free and launch himself. Since the two men were standing next to one another, he hit them like a bowling ball hitting pins. They both went down, but one made a faster recovery. It didn\u2019t matter. From where Janet stood, he never had a chance. Max killed him with an eerily efficient blow to his temple. She knew he\u2019d killed him, because when he shoved him away, the man\u2019s body fell and rolled face up below the mezzanine. Life died out of his eyes as he stared up at her frozen visage.</p><p>The other man bolted, headed for the door. When he got there, it hit him in the face, because Dale bounced the heavy metal off his forehead, dropping him like a stone. Max stopped in mid-pursuit, his expression settling when his former master chief gave him a nod. \u201cAll clear. Aaron and Billy took out the guy watching the back entrance.\u201d</p><p>Janet watched Max brace himself with hands on his thighs, drawing a breath, then he straightened, nodded back. Dale pushed open the door for Neil and Lawrence, who were dragging in an unconscious Leo and his companion, as well as a third man. The man watching the back, she assumed. Marcie and Dana were helping. When Billy and the invisible Aaron didn\u2019t come in, she assumed they were continuing to stand watch. Dale confirmed it, touching his earpiece and acknowledging they were in a concealed position outside.</p><p>She jumped at the short, crisp puncture sound of three shots, muffled by a silencer, and Lawrence emerged from behind a stack of crates. It was where they\u2019d dragged the three unconscious men. Janet wondered if he\u2019d have done it right there in the open, if \u201ccivilians\u201d hadn\u2019t been present.</p><p>She was feeling intangible, as if her mind was floating above all this. Max was free. She should be running to him. Yet something in her was silent, unresponsive. She stood at the rail, held on to it, stared down at the scene as if she was watching a play.</p><p>Dale raised a brow, sweeping a glance over Max\u2019s mostly naked body. \u201cYou\u2019re underdressed. There are women present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd one of us can\u2019t take advantage of the view, damn it all,\u201d Dana said. Though she spoke with her usual sense of humor, her tone was strained. She had her arm around Marcie, and Janet saw Marcie was limping, as if she\u2019d turned her ankle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNext time, remind me to wear my hooker Nikes instead of my hooker stilettos,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>\u201cIt was your own fault,\u201d Dana snorted. \u201cYou just had to be sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got my vote,\u201d Neil said. \u201cShe looked hot as hell when she throat-punched that guy. Like Kate Beckinsale in latex, only blonder. I like blondes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t even try it,\u201d Dana advised. \u201cYou may be a badass SEAL, but her fianc\u00e9 is a complete motherfucking psycho. In a really good way, but you still don\u2019t want him to think you\u2019re hitting on his girl.\u201d</p><p>There was some more banter back and forth. All with dead bodies lying around them, others executed behind crates. She shifted her gaze back to Dana and Marcie. They seemed fuzzy to her and she focused, harder. Except for the limp and Dana\u2019s cut lip, both looked okay, though Marcie was pale and her participation in the banter was more limited. It made sense. The girl was tough, but she probably felt like a rookie cop dealing with her first homicide, up close and personal.</p><p>Neil had found Max\u2019s clothes, and he\u2019d pulled on the jeans. Dana said something to him, but Janet didn\u2019t make out his reply. Marcie reached out to him, touched his bloody shoulder, and he gave her a short, reassuring nod. He was formal, all business though. No time for sentiment or niceties. Not in this place.</p><p>\u201cBilly said it looks like Dino\u2019s on his way,\u201d Dale said, tapping his earpiece. \u201cBoat just pulled up to the dock, and a couple more assholes like these jumped off, tying it up. Looks like he\u2019s traveling low key, just him and those two, not wanting to attract attention. He\u2019s expecting his reinforcements here. They got him into a car before Billy could pull off a shot, but I figure we don\u2019t want to use the sniper option outside this building anyway if we can avoid it. No telling what eyes we got out there. ETA probably five minutes. You want to stay in place, Max, keep him off guard until the last moment?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes were still wild, but Janet could see him pulling it together. It was remarkable that anyone could switch gears that fast, but he did, the muscles across his shoulders rippling as he squared them.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that seems the best play. How you want it to unfold, Master Chief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to get the civilians, capable as they are, out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d Dale gestured to Marcie and Dana. \u201cHow about you go up there on the mezzanine with Janet? Neil, Lawrence, let\u2019s get these bodies up there, prop them up in the office so when Dino first comes in, it\u2019ll throw him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Max picked up on his line of thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s a metal building, so he\u2019ll think that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t get his advance call that he\u2019d arrived.\u201d</p><p>Dale shrugged. \u201cNot foolproof. He may still spook, in which case we have Billy out there, and can go the sniper route. But if he comes into the building, he\u2019ll see them up in the office and be ready to hand out an ass whipping, thinking that they aren\u2019t watching his back or overseeing the prisoner the way they should. He\u2019ll also think the blood on the ground is yours, especially if we go ahead and grab these tarps, throw them down over the worst of it...\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought about phase two. She\u2019d only thought of what would be needed to get Max out of here. But it made sense. It would end here, tonight. Suddenly, she felt sick. Turning, she rushed into the office where Manny had said she\u2019d find the bathroom. Manny who now had a bullet through his head. She made it to the toilet just in time, dropping to her knees over a non-working bowl of dubious cleanliness, but it was better than throwing up on the floor, since that was where she ended up. When she finished, she closed the lid, pushing away from it so she was on her backside against the wall. Hearing Marcie and Dana coming, she scrubbed her hands over her face. Pull it together. Ice, ice, ice.</p><p>It must be working, since that felt like what she\u2019d thrown up, icy shards gouging out her insides. There was no time for anything, and she hadn\u2019t spoken to Max. He hadn\u2019t looked toward her. No...no, he had. A quick glance, verifying she was okay. That was all there was time for right now, really. Right? But what if Dino was more prepared than they expected? What if he got off a lucky shot? What if...</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d Dana came into the bathroom, helping Marcie hop over the threshold. \u201cDale says we stay down until he gives us the all clear. It should be over pretty quick.\u201d She slid down on one side of Janet, Marcie the other, and they each took one of her hands. \u201cJanet, you\u2019re so cold, honey.\u201d Dana chafed her hand between two of her own, which felt warm as a furnace in contrast. But it was a distant revelation.</p><p>\u201cDana, I didn\u2019t talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a few minutes, you\u2019re going to have a lifetime to talk to him, and now\u2019s not the time. We barely said two words to him either. His head\u2019s still in the game. He made sure you were okay, and that\u2019s all he\u2019s going to process until it\u2019s all over. Sshh, now.\u201d Dana rubbed her cold fingers some more. \u201cLet me tell you, I wish I\u2019d had eyes to see Marcie drop that piece of shit outside. Hit the ground like a sack of oranges. Girl, you have mad skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d Marcie squeezed Janet\u2019s hand. \u201cLot of bodies though. I knew...I didn\u2019t really expect Lawrence to do that. You know, shoot them like that. I get it, why he did it, but still...too many bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay. Put it away for now. We deal with it later.\u201d</p><p>Given how out of it she felt, Janet suspected Dana\u2019s firm reassurance was probably directed to both of them. In Marcie\u2019s voice, Janet heard what was echoing against her hollow insides. She and Marcie were the only ones not military-trained, and on top of that, Marcie was twenty-three years old. She\u2019d likely never seen a body in her life. Let alone chopped one\u2019s head off on purpose.</p><p>Janet choked on a giggle that sounded like it should come out of a clown\u2019s mouth in a Stephen King novel. She pressed a fist against her lips. Hold tight, hold tight. Ice, ice, ice. Like a cheerleader. She\u2019d thought about being a cheerleader in junior high, but dancing consumed her, and she was in a school for the arts before the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>Max. Max. Max. She thought of the blood on him, the bruising, the murderous light in his gray eyes. Her hands tightened on Dana\u2019s and Marcie\u2019s as if she was holding him, but she wondered if imagining it was all she was really capable of doing at the moment. She didn\u2019t even feel as if she could lift her arms. Marcie gave her an extra squeeze but then let go, shifting across from them, positioning herself behind the toilet. She had Dana\u2019s nine millimeter and cocked it. Though she kept the nose up, her body was angled toward the door. Prepared, just in case.</p> <p>When Dino came in, he wasn\u2019t happy. His gaze flitted over Max, bloody and bound in the chair, barely conscious, the tarps around him spattered with body fluids. That made him feel somewhat better, but his attention shot up to the office where he saw Leo\u2019s profile, the other guys bent over a table with him like they were playing cards. Which meant Manny and Javier were jerking off somewhere instead of watching the door. If he didn\u2019t kill them, he was at least going to fucking fire them. \u201cLeo,\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Max stood, snapping up the muzzle of the gun he\u2019d been holding behind his back. He took out Dino with a tight grouping to the chest, a final one to the head. Dale\u2019s shot dealt with the other man. As Max moved to pull the gun from Dino\u2019s belt, he sat back on his heels, watched him die. The man gave him a final sneer, but Max saw the fear. Then he was gone. It was done.</p><p>Well, the killing was done. It was going to be a hell of a clean-up job. Dale was already on his radio, having Billy and Aaron bring the van to the shipping entrance where they could pull it all the way inside. The scene here would be scrubbed, visible blood washed away, and another layer of grime would cover anything else in no time.</p><p>In the meantime, the bodies would be loaded up, taken to the border and dumped where cartel disputes were commonplace. The bullets would be dug out of them. By the time they were found\u2014if they were found\u2014the coyotes would have reduced any forensic evidence to nothing, and it would look like just another dispute between warring drug factions. Maybe it would motivate Dino\u2019s crew to take out a bunch of guys from the rival group. A win-win.</p><p>\u201cYou look like crap,\u201d Dale commented. \u201cWay you\u2019re moving, I\u2019m betting they cracked a couple ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Even so, Max kept staring down at the body. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you all to be part of this. Didn\u2019t intend for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you being dead and this POS still being on the loose is a better scenario for everyone. We\u2019ve saved one another\u2019s asses plenty of times. This is just another of those times, bro. The team succeeds where the individual fails, remember?\u201d</p><p>Neil nudged Max\u2019s haunch with the butt of his rifle while Lawrence gripped him under the arm to give him a lift to his feet. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a drama queen, Ack Ack,\u201d the shorter man said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it for you. We did it for your hot friends. Too bad they\u2019re all taken. Though if you don\u2019t stop being such a pussy, the one that\u2019s yours is going to start looking at me. I think I already caught her staring at my ass...\u201d</p><p>Janet. Oh fuck, Janet. It was like his mind suddenly re-engaged to full throttle, with a painful grinding of gears. He left Dale and Lawrence, was running up those stairs, holding his side to make it as fast as possible. He almost tripped over Marcie at the bathroom door, saw her check the gun with a startled oath.</p><p>\u201cAll clear,\u201d he managed, but he was looking for one person only. Since the bathroom was so small, Marcie did her best to get out of his way gracefully, wiggling past him in the small space to step out into the hallway. Reaching in under his arm, she grabbed hold of Dana\u2019s hand, guided her out as Max practically vaulted over the petite black woman to get to Janet.</p><p>She was sitting on the floor, looking down at her hands. He remembered that look too well, from the hospital, from the times the past grabbed hold of her and wouldn\u2019t let go. He put his hands over hers, covering them. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have, because his had blood smeared on them. Her eyes lifted to his. Held. His Mistress began to cry, but she seemed unaware of it, her gaze so unblinking, tears running down her cheeks, her hands limp inside the grip of his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he said, and he heard the hoarseness in his own voice. Exhaustion would hit him later, along with a lot of pain, because they\u2019d beat on him like a frigging pi\u00f1ata, but for now, there was this. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d She started to get up, and when he helped her, he thought she was like a mannequin, stiff and rigid. She shifted her gaze to the door, where Marcie and Dana stood by the mezzanine rail, watching them. \u201cOne of you should call Rachel. Tell her we\u2019re on our way. Hopefully neither Max nor Marcie will need hospital care, but if you do, we\u2019ll figure out what to tell them. Luckily, no one was shot, because the police...\u201d Her voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cJanet.\u201d Max closed his hands over her shoulders. \u201cLook at me. Janet.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, put both palms on his chest. Closed her fingers on his flesh, digging into his chest hair, the chest hair he knew she liked. Then she was tugging, clawing, striking, her face screwing up in pain and rage, like an oncoming tornado.</p><p>When Marcie murmured to Dana, and Dana began to step forward, he spoke sharply. \u201cNo. Let her go. Get out of here. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how they responded to that, because everything but Janet disappeared for him as she started screaming at him. Incoherent but terrible sounds, accusing, enraged, despairing. She punched at his face, his torso, hitting bruised ribs, but he didn\u2019t let her go, kept grimly hanging on as she fought him, hammered on him.</p><p>Her screaming became a cry of rage so visceral it reminded him of a savage creature, driven mad by pain. Until one word slipped out. \u201cWhy. Why. Why...\u201d</p><p>Why did she keep ending up to her elbows in blood? Why had any of it happened? Why did he insist on this? He didn\u2019t know. All he could do was let her punish him the way she needed to do, until she was sobbing. That one word had broken something inside her. Now he could bring her to his chest, hold her there. Despite the pain she\u2019d just exacerbated, he couldn\u2019t imagine any balm sweeter than her body against him, especially as the rage drained from it. But she was still tense, rigid. He held on to her anyway, unable to let go.</p> <p>\u201cNo more, Mistress,\u201d he murmured against her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s done. I\u2019m all yours. I promise. Forever. Long as you want me.\u201d</p><p>The hard ball in his gut told him there\u2019d be a fuckload of fallout to handle from this night though. He owed all of them, big time. It had been way the hell over a line, even for what SEALs did for each other. And Marcie...Dana. Fuck, Peter and Ben were going to fucking kill him. Matt would take his own piece of flesh for putting Janet in harm\u2019s way, no matter that she\u2019d chosen that course herself. To say he was fired was probably going to be the least of it. He might be sharing a shallow grave with Dino.</p><p>But she was all right. That was what mattered. His heart had nearly choked him when she\u2019d walked into that warehouse, cool-eyed and calm. It was as if she could put on any mask needed, even that of a sociopathic whore who would taste the blood off his forehead, wiggle her ass against his thigh, while the woman inside that mask, the woman he loved, dropped a knife into his hands.</p><p>Now that same woman was shuddering, face pressed to his chest, hands still gripping him there. He wanted to scoop her up, carry her down the steps and out of this place, hold her cradled in his lap until she stopped shaking, but his ribs weren\u2019t going to let him do that. He\u2019d probably drop her down the steps, and that was no way to impress a girl.</p><p>He\u2019d been in a lot of ops far more intense than this, but this one had been the most personal. She\u2019d warned him of that, hadn\u2019t she? But he hadn\u2019t expected her to be part of it. They were like two leaves on a thin branch, shaky as hell. Lawrence might be right about the pussy part, at least on Max\u2019s side of things. His Mistress had balls of steel.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get us all to Rachel\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cThough we might have a problem. I think Dana\u2019s in the best shape to drive us.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded without a smile, wiped at her nose with her bloodstained knuckles. He pressed a kiss to her forehead, held her close. \u201cYou are the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever met. And considering the women I know,\u201d he thought of his mother, Marcie, Dana, all the K&amp;A women...Amanda, \u201cthat\u2019s saying something.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>In fact, he might say technically it was the last time she spoke to him. Really spoke to him. Rachel had taped his ribs, recommended an x-ray, which he\u2019d declined. Marcie had a bad sprain, but beyond that and a little bruising that she and Dana had sustained in their scuffle with Leo and his buddy, all was good. When Rachel had turned her attention to Janet, Janet shook her head, that cool look fixed on her face like a vacuum-sealed jar lid. \u201cI wasn\u2019t injured.\u201d</p><p>After a searching look, Rachel had made her tea instead and slipped a warm blanket on her shoulders. She\u2019d also recommended a hot shower and that Janet sleep at her and Jon\u2019s place for the night. Janet had accepted the offer with a simple \u201cthank you\u201d. Max followed her up the stairs, but at the guest bedroom door Janet turned, her expression anything but welcoming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, Max.\u201d Though she was staring into his face, he didn\u2019t feel like she was connecting to his gaze. It was more like he was transparent, or she was blind like Dana, aware of him but not focused on his features. \u201cBut I\u2019ll need space for a while. I\u2019ll do what I can with Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shut the door in his face, and he heard the lock turn. He stood there, vibrating with helpless frustration, and turned to see Rachel at the top of the stairs. The blonde with compassionate hazel eyes gestured to him to come back to her, away from Janet\u2019s door. \u201cI\u2019ll watch over her, Max,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI promise. As self-possessed as she seems, she\u2019s in shock right now. Overwhelmed. You all saw a lot tonight. Marcie is pretty shook up as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it. Can I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Rachel assured him. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Marcie\u2019s a good match for Ben,\u201d she added. \u201cThe death and killing was new for her, and would put anyone in a tailspin, but she\u2019s a Southern girl through and through. Taking out drug dealers to protect someone she considers her family is something she can live with.\u201d</p><p>But she shouldn\u2019t have been put in that position. He understood what Rachel was saying, even agreed with it, knowing what he knew about Marcie. But he also knew exactly what every decent person went through to learn to live with things like that. If he could do it over, he would have made them kill him right off, rather than making her and Dana a part of this. And then there was Janet, who\u2019d been there before, who\u2019d tried to leave it behind... Fuck.</p><p>He lowered himself to the top step, not yet willing to be that far from her. Rachel sat down on the step next to him, putting a hand on his shoulder. He felt the strong nurturing vibration in the touch, a woman who was a healer in a lot of different ways, but he was afraid what was wrong with Janet was beyond her influence. \u201cShe went through something once, Rachel. Something she got through by locking everything down until it was over. Do you think...can you get stuck that way?\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s brow creased. \u201cNot knowing her circumstances, I can\u2019t say for certain, but if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, you need to give her time to break out of it.\u201d She ran a soothing hand down his arm. \u201cI suspect, when things are calmer, she\u2019ll come out of it on her own, or you\u2019ll have a better sense of how to help her out of it. Tonight is not the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d just started...\u201d He looked up toward the closed door and felt the ache of it then. What price had he paid for finally ridding the world of Dino? For settling his need for justice...for vengeance. It had put the woman he loved in the middle of something violent and dangerous, but more than that, he\u2019d put her back into a scenario she\u2019d spent years trying to put behind her, to control her environment and life so bloody chaos wouldn\u2019t be part of it anymore. In order for her to get past it again, would he be left behind as a casualty? Christ, she\u2019d been standing right above him when he killed that one guy.</p><p>Rachel tightened her grip on his arm. \u201cI know. Give it time, Max. Why don\u2019t you bunk down here\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go on home. Check in with Dale and see if he needs anything. Truly.\u201d</p><p>If he stayed, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it. He\u2019d push, and he remembered what had happened the last time he did that. He knew Rachel was right, even if another part of him howled against it.</p><p>He put his hand over hers as she began to protest. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks to your nursing skills.\u201d He glanced around at the tranquility of the home she and Jon shared. The Japanese maples, the quiet fountains, the clean, simple layout. Clean and simple. Something he hadn\u2019t thought about having in so long, and tonight he might have killed any hope for it.</p><p>Janet had said he had great intuition. The weight on his chest told him this wasn\u2019t just shock for Janet, but something deeper. It brought back the helpless feeling he\u2019d faced when he realized his mother was gone, and Amanda was never going to get any better, barring a miracle.</p><p>No. He wasn\u2019t losing Janet like that. Even if it had gotten fucked up because of him, he was going to figure out how to fix it.</p><p>\u201cI have Dale\u2019s truck. I\u2019ll take Marcie back to Cass\u2019, get it back to him and then head to the office. My vehicle\u2019s there.\u201d In fact, it was likely he\u2019d sleep in it, unrolling the camo quilt and lulled to sleep by the drip through the parking deck ceiling pipes. Tomorrow was a freaking work day, wasn\u2019t it? The guys weren\u2019t back until Friday, so it was fairly light duty, unless Janet needed him to run an errand. But he\u2019d lay good money she wasn\u2019t going to be back tomorrow either.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t. In the morning, he decided to go home for a scalding hot shower and half a bottle of aspirin. Headed out of her office, he ran into Randall. The security chief had given the cuts and fist marks on his face a close look, but Max had discouraged questions and the man had fortunately respected his privacy. On the way to his house, Max tried Janet\u2019s cell, received no answer. Checking in with Rachel, he found out Janet had gone home about an hour ago. But she\u2019d left him a message\u2014through Rachel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jon\u2019s wife had hesitated, then delivered the message that even the kindness in her voice couldn\u2019t soften. \u201cShe asked that you not contact her. For the foreseeable future, she said she needs to go back to the way things were. If she wants to talk to you, she\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>That weight in his chest became a fucking anvil. He took his shower, sat at his crappy kitchen table, stared out into the yard that was pretty much just bare patches and mowed weeds. Then he wrote up his resignation. He\u2019d said he\u2019d be the one who backed off if the shit hit the fan, right? This was her job, her world. He could make a new world elsewhere, give her the space she needed. And maybe, in time, she\u2019d...</p><p>Or maybe not. When all was said and done, he was just a limo driver and a guy who used to be a SEAL. Damn it, he wasn\u2019t giving up on her. But all night, when he\u2019d barely slept, he kept seeing her dead eyes, felt her rigid body beneath his hands. He\u2019d done that to her. What right did he have to shove himself in her face right now?</p> <p>He could have used the resignation as a way to see her, but whatever he decided to do or not do, he knew it was too soon. Instead, he drove out to Matt\u2019s house early Saturday morning. He didn\u2019t know how Dana and Marcie had spun it, but he understood enough about the Dom/sub thing now, and how deep it ran for them, to know they\u2019d likely told the complete truth to explain the bruises, Marcie\u2019s ankle. But honesty didn\u2019t always make things better. He\u2019d never lied to Janet about anything, but they\u2019d ended up here anyway, right?</p><p>He could have come by Matt\u2019s house Monday morning before the K&amp;A CEO left for work, but a soldier didn\u2019t dodge his commanding officer, putting off the ass chewing. When he pulled up in the driveway, Matt was sitting in a chair on the side lawn, next to a cup of coffee and the remains of his breakfast. Max didn\u2019t see Savannah, but maybe they took turns with the baby\u2019s morning routine, letting the other sleep in on weekends. That\u2019s what married people did, nice things for each other like that. The way it was supposed to be, right?</p><p>Angelica was on a blanket at Matt\u2019s feet, playing with some toys. She looked up as he crossed the lawn to them. Matt folded his paper, set it to the side, fixed his gaze on him. No smile of welcome, just those measuring hawk eyes.</p><p>Oh yeah. They knew.</p><p>Max cleared his throat, extended the envelope. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb your breakfast, sir, but I thought it might be best to get this done first thing. I\u2019m resigning, effective immediately. I brought Wade up to speed on things these past couple days, and I\u2019ll be available to him for anything he needs. I know you\u2019ll decide who you want in the position, but I figure he\u2019s the best to step into my shoes until you do that. He\u2019s a good man though. He can handle the job.\u201d</p> <p>Matt put the envelope on top of the paper. Still said nothing. Max forced himself not to squirm.</p><p>\u201cSir. If, at any time, I\u2019d ever thought my presence would endanger a member of your family, I never would have accepted your job offer. I know I should have foreseen it, anticipated it. There\u2019s nothing that excuses that lack of judgment, but I wanted you to know it was never an intentional decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Max.\u201d</p><p>If someone told Max that Matt Kensington had the ability to laser a man\u2019s torso into three pieces with the look he was giving him now, he\u2019d well believe it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, but I need to ask if you\u2019ve heard from Janet. If she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Angelica cooed, shook her rattle at Max, but he couldn\u2019t summon a smile. Matt took his eye off Max long enough to lean forward, close his fingers gently on the top of the rattle and engage in a playful tug-of-war with her. She beamed at her father, giggled.</p> <p>Something hard and ugly twisted in Max\u2019s chest. He needed to go. He\u2019d find some work in the Baton Rouge area. Amanda\u2019s facility was on that side of the outskirts of New Orleans, so the commute back and forth wouldn\u2019t be bad. And he was going to take Janet\u2019s advice, see if he could integrate more people into her life. Maybe he\u2019d get a nice two-bedroom apartment, talk to Gayle about having Jenny come up and stay with him a couple weeks after her baby came. He could help with the kid, show Jenny a good time around New Orleans and maybe prevent what everyone figured was pretty inevitable, that she didn\u2019t have the strength to deal with what her husband was. It wasn\u2019t for everyone. But maybe Max could tip the balance, make the impossible seem possible to her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sir. I don\u2019t have a right to know, I get that, but please make sure Janet\u2019s okay. I know you will anyway, but I\u2019m worried this maybe opened up some bad memories for her. She might need someone close to her for a while, and she\u2019s not letting me...I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t let me be that person.\u201d</p><p>It ached like a fucking wound to say it out loud. He wanted to sleep beside her, hold her through the nightmares. Share break time with her, make her smile. Bring that warm flush to her cheeks when he called her Mistress. Give her foot massages that made her moan in that soft, amusing, arousing way...</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything, sir.\u201d</p><p>He pivoted, a fucking rash burning in his lungs. He\u2019d managed five strides when Matt spoke.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to her last night, Max.\u201d</p><p>Max stopped and turned, heart in his throat. Matt still had the same look, but he was talking about her, so that was fine.</p><p>\u201cShe indicated that you had no control over their participation\u2014hers, Dana\u2019s and Marcie\u2019s. Knowing all three of the women in question as we do, we were well aware of that. But she asked, as a personal favor\u2014the second one she\u2019s requested from me in all our years together\u2014that there be no repercussions against you, that you keep your job. She also called and spoke to Peter and Ben, making clear what Dana and Marcie, respectively, also made clear to them. That you are not to be blamed for the situation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith all due respect, that\u2019s bullshit, sir. And I don\u2019t hide behind women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d need to hide behind your SEAL team if I relayed that second comment to them.\u201d Though the comment was dry, nothing about Matt\u2019s visage suggested humor. \u201cBut I agree with your first one. You understand there are consequences to your actions that no friend, foe or family member can exonerate. Which I expect explains this.\u201d He put his hand on the resignation, and his gaze sharpened, such that Max almost did feel the laser cut of it across his sore ribs. \u201cYou understand our code. That no matter what was outside of your control, three women I consider mine to protect, two of whom also belong to men of my family, were put at serious risk because of your situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, should anything about this matter ever come to light, they are accomplices to murder.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d cop to the death of every one of those bodies under oath to take the full heat of that, but that wasn\u2019t Matt\u2019s point. Max nodded again, swallowing hard.</p><p>Matt inclined his head. \u201cI accept your resignation. For now.\u201d</p><p>Max blinked. \u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you accept the consequences of your actions, then you accept responsibility for healing what you\u2019ve injured. My trust, the trust of my team. Janet\u2019s heart. You\u2019re used to situations where you go on missions, and then you come back home, two totally different theaters. When you were pursuing Dino, you weren\u2019t in that kind of vacuum. You built relationships. Dana, Marcie and Janet all came into that situation because that is what happens when you create a family. They would no more allow you to face what you faced alone than you would have allowed them to do so if they faced something similar.\u201d</p><p>That same nail, being hammered into his head once again. Hadn\u2019t Janet as much as said that to him? This isn\u2019t a mission environment. This is your life.</p><p>\u201cSo I understand the guilt you are carrying,\u201d Matt continued, \u201clikely far better than they do. You know it was your fault that they were there. However, the answer is not abandoning your family. We know what lengths you\u2019ll go to avenge them. Show me what you\u2019ll do to keep them, heal them. Now, come shake my daughter\u2019s rattle to prove to her that she utterly captivates every person who sees her. I only have a few more weeks to spoil her. Then she\u2019ll be walking and she\u2019ll have to learn about rules and manners.\u201d</p><p>Max dutifully came back across the grass. When he squatted by the blanket, he managed a stiff smile as Angelica looked at him with her mother\u2019s liquid blue eyes. But the dark hair, the determination in her delicate features, that was Matt. She was going to be a scary heartbreaker. He touched her small hand, and she ended up being the one who shook the rattle at him, which made her burst into another fit of baby laughter that couldn\u2019t help but make him smile a little more naturally, despite the ache it increased in his chest.</p><p>He looked down at the design of the baby quilt. There was embroidery on every other panel, a mouse and rabbit dancing together in a field of flowers on one, taking a nap together in another, and so forth. Between each panel was a quilted blue square. With all the horrible things he\u2019d seen, it always bemused him that such things existed in the same dimension, let alone on the same planet. He wondered how long Janet had felt like that after Jorge. Probably quite awhile. And he\u2019d driven that schism back into her world again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to break through, sir,\u201d he said miserably. \u201cShe\u2019s shut me out. It\u2019s like an ice wall. I could go beat on her door, force her see me, but I know that\u2019s not going to break it.\u201d She\u2019d just stand behind that wall of ice and stare at him, tell him to go away. \u201cI know it\u2019s only been a day, but I know what my gut tells me. Something\u2019s really wrong, something that time\u2019s not going to help.\u201d Or at least, by the time it got resolved, she\u2019d have him completely cut out of her life. If he wasn\u2019t a selfish bastard, he\u2019d accept it, accept she was maybe better off without him, but he couldn\u2019t let go of her. He just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around SEALs for a while, Max. First through my father\u2019s acquaintances, and then you. The one thing I know is you don\u2019t give up. You figure out how to win, and there\u2019s no strategy you leave unturned. So figure it out. If you can\u2019t break the ice, melt it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angelica had hold of one of Max\u2019s fingers now and was examining it with great interest. Keeping himself in her grasp, Max looked over his shoulder at the CEO. \u201cAny intel to help with that, sir?\u201d</p><p>Matt was totally within his rights to tell him to go to hell, he knew it, but Max wasn\u2019t above pressing an advantage. The CEO gave him a cool look. \u201cYou know her vulnerabilities, her needs, Max. You know the way in. The question is to what lengths you\u2019ll go to get there, what sacrifices you\u2019ll make. That\u2019s what it\u2019s always about. The willing sacrifices we make for those we love.\u201d</p><p>Matt picked up his paper, indicating their meet was at an end. Giving the baby a brief stroke of her absurdly soft hair, Max straightened. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p> <p>Matt offered one more of those withering glances before he shifted his attention back to the financial section. \u201cBe aware\u2014at some point, Peter and Ben are planning to subject you to a vast amount of blunt-force trauma. On general principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, sir.\u201d</p><p>When gathering intel, there were a lot of routes to take. He made a few test runs, trying to shake something out. He didn\u2019t respect her request about contacting her, at least at a distance. He texted her. He left messages on her phone. He sent her flowers, whimsical trinkets. Small gifts and gestures that he hoped she received, because he received no response. Not to any of it.</p><p>He was certain the key was in his mind, in what he knew of her. She was a Mistress. Not necessarily the hardcore, whips and leather boots Dominatrix type, but there was a core to her that was about possessing another, winning their trust and surrender. Had he damaged that trust? What had happened that night to shut her down so firmly? Since he continued to volunteer at Dana\u2019s church, he learned from the blind woman that Janet was back at work and doing her job as efficiently as ever.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s different. Alice says it\u2019s like she\u2019s on autopilot. Right smiles, right catty remarks at the right moment, but no feeling. Like a doll. Matt\u2019s tried to talk to her, and so have I. She just says she\u2019s fine, smiles and squeezes my hand like I\u2019m worrying over nothing, and then Janet-bot goes back to work. Matt would push harder but...\u201d</p> <p>Dana had paused then, her blind eyes searching for something, but Max filled in the blank.</p><p>\u201cHe knows that\u2019s my job. He\u2019s waiting for me to figure it out. Figure her out.\u201d</p><p>He had plenty enough money to live on for a while, so rather than seeking another job, he\u2019d thrown himself into more demanding projects at Dana\u2019s church, helped Dale landscape several of his neighbors\u2019 yards, and continued his regular visits with Amanda.</p><p>He also took Dale to see her, as well as Lawrence. Janet had been right, no surprise there. Amanda was initially wary, but just as she\u2019d demonstrated with Janet, she seemed to gravitate toward those who had a strong connection to him, almost as if they bore his scent or some piece of his soul. In Janet\u2019s case, that was the truth.</p><p>He was going fucking insane. He missed her like a vital organ, as clich\u00e9 and stupid as that sounded. It was still as true as a knife blade plunged in the right place was fatal. No ifs, ands, buts or passing go.</p><p>You know the way in...</p> <p>The purpose of the hellish first few weeks of BUD/S training was to ensure full commitment. To verify that each man had what it took to not only endure but accomplish the missions they would face. They were broken down, subjected to unimaginable levels of physical and psychological hardship. Maybe to get into the head of a Mistress, figure her out, he had to do the same, so to speak.</p><p>He knew he had a good body, fit, hard, the kind that drew women\u2019s eyes. With the right look and attitude, he could take a deeper step into her world, see if he could figure it out from the inside. She\u2019d taught him the way of it, the mannerisms, the codes.</p><p>So Friday night, he shaved and cleaned himself up, slapping on a light cologne. He put himself in a pair of black jeans, a snug T-shirt, boots. Then he gave himself a critical once-over in his cracked mirror\u2014lucky he wasn\u2019t superstitious, at least not that way\u2014and took a breath. He was going to Club Progeny. Time to use that guest membership again. On his own this time.</p><p>Janet sat out on her balcony, watching the evening dogwalkers go by on the sidewalk. Poodle...English Springer Spaniel...Great Dane. She\u2019d thought about getting a dog at one time, but she had a feeling she and a cat would see more eye to eye on things. For almost a year, a feral tom had been hanging around for the scraps she gave him. Sometimes, in the heat of summer, he\u2019d lain in her bird bath to cool off, the mockingbirds fussing at him from the trees.</p><p>She looked at the book she hadn\u2019t cracked open tonight, though her hand rested on it with intent. But she knew if she started it, she\u2019d look blindly at the words and not internalize the story. No point. The routine of getting up, going to work, handling things for K&amp;A and the domestic requirements of her house\u2014that was all she was in the mood to do of late.</p><p>Yes, something was wrong, but she\u2019d been here before. After she came to the States, after Matt helped her get out of Mexico, she\u2019d been this way for months. It had taken awhile to break out of it, but one day, she had. She\u2019d started to feel, rather than pretending to feel. She\u2019d embraced the pleasure and freedom of that. But she wasn\u2019t sure what the catalyst had been then, any more than she could anticipate what would do it now.</p><p>When she laid her head back on the chair, closed her eyes, Max filled that darkness. His scent, his body, his steady gray eyes. Camping with her, lying on his truck. Before she could get much further than that, though, she saw chains hanging from a ceiling, his bruised and battered body slumped over in a chair. The distant, cold intent in his eyes when he killed the man just beneath her, his expression when he came to her, to tell her it was over, that it was done. The mission was done. He\u2019d be dealing with that feeling now, what to do, where to go from here.</p><p>She\u2019d been there as well. When a goal that big was accomplished, a person died a little death. They had to resurrect themselves to embrace the future. But she couldn\u2019t deal with that. She couldn\u2019t sustain any good memory to get past the bad one, so it was like Jorge. She had to package it all up, box it away. Put it away. Let it go.</p> <p>She pressed her fingertips to burning eyes and took a swallow of the wine she\u2019d poured herself. She might need something stronger tonight, and thought about cracking open some of the rich bourbon she had for holidays. Just a shot glass should be enough to put her to sleep.</p><p>Her cell phone buzzed. She kept it with her, despite the fact she deleted all of Max\u2019s texts without reading them, the voicemails without listening to them. She couldn\u2019t go that route, had to box him up with all the rest.</p><p>She glanced at it and her brow furrowed. She had an excellent memory for numbers, but she had to stretch to recognize that one, since she\u2019d only dialed it once in her life. Dale. It was Dale. Was Max calling from Dale\u2019s phone, hoping to get her to pick up? No, he wasn\u2019t like that.</p><p>She flipped open the phone. \u201cDale?\u201d She tried to make her voice sound cordial, pleasant. Detached. Like she hadn\u2019t shared an evening of murder and mayhem with him and his impromptu SEAL team.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down at Progeny, Janet. Max has signed up for a session with Mistress Sue. I called up the form he submitted on himself for Dom review. He\u2019s representing himself as a Level Ten. No holds barred on pain, no limits in terms of being shared with other Doms or subs. Male or female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin two seconds of being around him, no Mistress in her right mind will believe that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has the training to do and be whatever\u2019s necessary to get the job done,\u201d Dale said evenly. \u201cAnd you know no one can stretch a Level Ten like Sue. She\u2019ll break him down like a set of Legos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he thinks...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m calling you. I think he\u2019s trying to figure things out about you. Like BUD/S training. Full immersion. So this call is a lot like the one you made to me a few weeks ago. Max may be in trouble. If that concerns you, you have until ten o\u2019clock to make an appearance and do something about it. That\u2019s when his session with her is scheduled to start.\u201d</p><p>She waffled, she struggled with herself. Getting dressed to go to the club almost defeated her. She didn\u2019t want to leave her solitude, the comfort of her nest. By the time she appeared in the foyer of Club Progeny, it was quarter to ten. She\u2019d wasted five more minutes debating on whether she was going to get out of the car. She was angry at Dale for calling her, angry at Max for doing this. She was just angry, but in a passive, badger-down-its-hole way. She wanted someone to stick their hand within biting range so she could take off a few fingers, almost as much as she wanted to stay unmolested.</p><p>Dale was watching for her in the public sitting area visible from the lobby. She showed her ID to the hostess, barely pausing for the hand stamp before she came to him. He was alone, so to speak. A female submissive knelt on the floor next to him, her head on his knee while he stroked her hair. She was still perspiring from the session they\u2019d shared, the lash marks on her bare back and pretty buttocks visible because she was naked except for a silver collar and leash. She was holding on to his leg as though she couldn\u2019t let go. Since she seemed to be spiraling down from an intense subspace, Janet had a feeling his leg was her anchor.</p><p>The sight of the girl\u2019s devotion, her response to Dale\u2019s mastery of her, made things clutch in Janet\u2019s throat, her stomach start to hurt. No, she wasn\u2019t ready to feel. Was she? Or maybe she should have come here sooner. But not when Max was here. Not like that.</p><p>\u201cPublic floor,\u201d Dale said, nodding in that direction.</p><p>Janet\u2019s gaze sharpened on him. \u201cYou said ten o\u2019clock. It\u2019s not ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you at eight. He approached Sue about letting him \u2018warm up\u2019 for her, and she obliged him. She\u2019s had him on display for an hour.\u201d</p><p>Though there was no reproach in Dale\u2019s tone, Janet felt guilty. It irritated her tremendously. Max made his own choices. He didn\u2019t know she was here. She had no need to rescue him. It wasn\u2019t like anything unsafe would happen to him. He was just going to learn that a hardcore Mistress was no one to fool with. To fool, period. If Sue thought he was Level Ten that\u2019s how she\u2019d treat him, unless he used a safe word. And the chances of that happening... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Setting her jaw, Janet went toward the public floor. Dale motioned to a slim Goth sub in dog collar and stressed jeans. The young man came over immediately. \u201cYes Sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, watch over Debbie for a few minutes. I need to handle something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Noah slid into the booth on the other side. Dale shifted his charge across the floor with easy strength, transferring her hands to Noah\u2019s leg with tender firmness. Debbie blinked at both of them hazily, and Dale touched her face. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You stay with Noah and behave for him. I wouldn\u2019t want to have to whip you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Master.\u201d</p><p>Noah resumed stroking her head, just as Dale had been doing. He\u2019d probably be cuddling her on his lap like a kitten when Dale got back. The boy had a wide nurturing streak. He could also use his vibrating tongue stud with diabolical effectiveness. Maybe he\u2019d have Debbie suck him off while Noah lay on his back between her spread knees and took her to the screaming edge of a climax. Dale\u2019s focus had been taking Debbie into that subspace zone, rather than coming himself, but a release would feel damn good.</p><p>First things first though. Best to stay close at hand to prevent a possible homicide. Max had done something misguided, but Dale didn\u2019t think it was a capital offense. Janet might feel otherwise, and he suspected her ire was going to be like an IED\u2014aimed at anyone who tripped her wire.</p><p>Janet slid through the crowd. She didn\u2019t have to go far to find Max. He was the subject of a lot of attention. Sue had him in a full headmask, only the mouth open to allow breath. That explained the rigid state of his muscles. He was surrounded by people, noises, things he couldn\u2019t identify, and she had him bound face forward\u2014legs, arms, torso and throat\u2014against one of the cages.</p><p>Inside the cage was a trio of female subs, dressed in strips of black leather and lots of black eye makeup that made them look like a trio of succubae straight from Lucifer\u2019s harem. Six hands were greedily caressing his flesh, two of the women on their knees to nip, lick and suck his cock. With his hips strapped firmly to the cage bars, he had no ability to pull back, and his buttocks were flexing in helpless struggle against their stimulation. There was a big ring around the base of his shaft to keep him from coming, but Sue also had a vibrating dildo shoved up his ass, tormenting him further.</p><p>Max had never taken anything up his ass but the slim probe she\u2019d used with Rita. What was inside him now had the girth of a well-endowed male, so Janet knew it had to be burning like a son of a bitch, no matter how much lube Sue had used to ease it in properly.</p><p>Every visible muscle in his neck, shoulders, back, ass and legs was tense as a board. Not like a sub fighting against the inevitable, but like Prometheus grimly chained on his rock, being disemboweled by an eagle. Could Sue not see it? Of course she probably could, but as long as he wasn\u2019t using the safe word, and he was in no physical danger, there\u2019d be nothing to trigger ending it.</p><p>The Mistress in question, a voluptuous woman in a short black bob wig and beautifully tailored red corset, was sitting nearby, playing with the cock of a handsome slim man she\u2019d bound onto a wheel while an additional submissive slowly rotated him, Sue had volunteers playing a game of rings with his erect member. Anyone who succeeded was given a prize, little trinkets. Sue was a versatile and creative Mistress. Janet curled her lip.</p><p>As Janet suspected, Sue was keeping a careful eye on Max, but she wasn\u2019t seeing what Janet was seeing. However, she was a good enough Domme to pick up weird vibes, because Janet noted Sue was keeping that eye trained on him even a little more closely than usual.</p><p>Dale had called it immersion, like BUD/S training, trying to figure out what Janet needed. Maybe that was part of it, but as Janet shifted to view Max\u2019s profile, she recognized it as more than that. This was penance. Max had put Level Ten because he wanted everything Sue could dish out. When the real session started, Janet would lay money he\u2019d push the voluptuous Mistress until she\u2019d done everything to debase and humiliate him. He was punishing himself.</p><p>No one but his Mistress had the right to do that.</p><p>Goddamn Dale, goddamn Max and goddamn herself, for this frozen wasteland of her heart. But when Sue glanced at the clock and rose, reaching for her single tail, Janet was already pushing through the crowd toward her.</p><p>Sue had just positioned herself on the platform, within range of Max\u2019s unmarked back, when Janet stepped on to the platform with her, shifting between the two of them. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to touch him,\u201d Janet said. \u201cNot now, not ever.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s head snapped around as much as his bonds would allow, but Janet ignored the reaction, her attention on the other Mistress. She knew it wasn\u2019t Sue\u2019s fault, that the woman hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, but it didn\u2019t make the threat in Janet\u2019s voice any less vehement, the emotions surging forth in her breast any less violent.</p><p>Sue blinked, brought the single tail down. \u201cMistress J,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what...\u201d</p><p>Dale appeared at Sue\u2019s side. Resting his hand lightly on the boning at her waist, he spoke in her ear. Janet stood there, vibrating with...rage, anguish...she didn\u2019t know what. She spun around, eyed the three subs in the cage. \u201cGet back. Get away from him. Now.\u201d</p><p>They complied immediately, lifting their hands like they\u2019d been caught at a crime scene. She shot a glance at the nearest staff member, an assistant to Mistress Sue. It was one of the perks provided to her, since her public scenes were a major draw at the club. \u201cTake everything off him but the headmask and collar. I need a private room.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what Dale said to Sue, or what they said to the dungeon master who\u2019d appeared to see what was happening, but after a moment Dale gave her a nod, indicating that she was going to get the private room she wanted. Then a snarled oath, a strangled groan, jerked her attention away from him and back to Max.</p><p>When the staff attendant removed the vibrating plug and the cock ring, Max was too close to the edge. Just that bare amount of stimulation pushed him into orgasm.</p> <p>He caught hold of the cage bars, the force of his reaction driving him down to one knee. His hips jerked as he spewed into the condom that had been rolled onto him. Since he wore the mask, she couldn\u2019t see his face, but from the rigidity of his torso, she imagined the rictus of mortification, his embarrassment. All in all, he was a fairly private man. Yet he\u2019d subjected himself to this. The complete moron.</p><p>It broke her heart open, and the pain of it nearly drove her to her knees. She moved to stand between him and the crowd, an ineffectual screen but one that allowed her to put a hand on his nape. He shuddered under her touch, and she knelt over him, her lips on his shoulder, her arm over his chest. She sheltered him, told him with the press of her body she was here, and she was the only one who mattered.</p><p>When he was done, his head was hanging low, mouth against her forearm, chest heaving. She slid away and he caught her wrist blindly.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, Max,\u201d she ordered, her voice harsh. His fingers slipped away reluctantly, his mouth tight.</p><p>She took a tether from the staff member, clipped it to the wide collar around his throat. His body was quivering like a plucked bow string. Putting her hand on his chest, she exerted enough pressure to make him rise on shaky legs.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d she said.</p><p>She took him through the watching crowd, away from the main floor. They\u2019d believe it had been orchestrated as part of the scene, and that was fine. No one knew what was truth or fantasy here except the Dom and sub, and sometimes the staff. But in the end, truth and fantasy always overlapped.</p><p>The room they\u2019d given her was a small one, probably the only one available on this busy night. It had nothing but a chair and a sink. A Picasso-style mural on the wall showed a primitive and colorful scene of copulation between whimsically distorted human figures. She guided him down into the chair, unsnapped the tether and stepped away from him, placing herself against the wall. His head tilted, following her movements through the scrape of her boots on the tile floor.</p><p>The chair wasn\u2019t a good idea, for the moment she saw him in it, she was transported to the warehouse again, seeing him slumped down, sitting under those dangling chains. She could tell his ribs were still tender, but the bruising was gone. The knife cuts were now pink, shiny scars.</p><p>\u201cI want to take off the mask,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave it on until I say so,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the hell was this? What were you trying to prove?\u201d</p><p>When his lips tightened again in stubborn reaction, her anger surged forth, hot and uncontrolled. It was out of proportion with the moment, but she didn\u2019t care. She took a step forward and swung at his face, a sharp slap.</p><p>He caught her wrist before she could draw back. He dragged her onto his lap, holding her stubbornly while she squirmed against his hold. He just held her tighter, pressing his face against her flesh. She hated the feel of the mask. Finding the fastener, she unlocked it, unzipped the back and yanked it free of his flushed face, his spiked short hair.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, holding her even tighter. \u201cNo, Mistress. I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d She shouted at him, struggled harder, hitting him wildly like she had that night. He kept his face pressed to her breasts to protect his eyes, so she didn\u2019t realize he was answering her until she felt the force of his hot breath through her shirt, the vibration of the words.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Please. Janet. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She jerked his face up with trembling hands. \u201cDo what? What the hell am I doing to you?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. When he did, the tears he was struggling to keep from falling glinted, driving into her heart like shards of clear glass. \u201cJust don\u2019t,\u201d he said miserably.</p><p>She fought for control, to make some sense of her rage, the storm within her. \u201cTell me,\u201d she said. \u201cGoddamn you.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, and she couldn\u2019t help herself. She gripped his face, pressed her forehead hard against his. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t mean it. Tell me. Just tell me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he spoke, it was a low rumble, a half breath, like it was cracking his ribs all over again just to say it. She shifted her head so her cheek was pressed to his and he was speaking into her ear, each of them staring at the opposite wall. If there were mirrors, they would have seen endless versions of themselves.</p><p>\u201cI came home,\u201d he said, \u201cand there was no home. My sister was there, but she was no longer... We\u2019ll never be able to connect, love one another the same way. If I ruined that for us, Janet, if you\u2019re... I\u2019d do anything to go back to that day.\u201d</p><p>He drew his head back, stared at her. His gray eyes were raw, tormented, and she found looking at them was like looking at the sun. Too bright and painful, risking permanent damage, but she couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cThere\u2019s this diving term we use. \u2018Reset point\u2019. It\u2019s when you choose a familiar underwater object to orient yourself if you lose direction. I realized\u2014too late\u2014that you\u2019re that point for me.\u201d</p> <p>He swallowed. \u201cIf I could do it over, I\u2019d say the hell with the code, my need for vengeance or justice. I\u2019d just make sure I never sent you to that place in your head that\u2019s beyond where I can reach you. I need you, Mistress. I love you. Come back to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, the catalyst happened. An almost audible snap as everything tore loose, like a dam giving way. She hadn\u2019t figured out what broke her out of that self-imposed prison last time, but there was no doubt what had done it this time. Max.</p><p>His voice broke. She found herself wrapping her arms as tightly as she could around his head and shoulders, curving her body against his. And he reciprocated, banding his arms around her, rocking them both, because now she was crying too. The ice was thawing, even as it was cutting her, hurting her.</p><p>But she was tough, tougher than anyone had ever expected, right? She wouldn\u2019t let herself not love this man, this man who was afraid he\u2019d lost her. But things were tender, painful, bleeding. She didn\u2019t...she couldn\u2019t pull it together.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe, I couldn\u2019t feel, Max. I don\u2019t know why...I wasn\u2019t trying to punish you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I did. I forgot the most important mission. Protecting the people I love, giving them everything they need. Amanda, you.\u201d His voice stayed thick, even as he lifted his head so his gray eyes locked on hers. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing we learn called counterinsurgency techniques\u2014COIN. It\u2019s when you learn that taking out a target or kicking in a door isn\u2019t always the best route. Sometimes it\u2019s getting the village kids candy or playing soccer with them, or helping their moms or grandparents rebuild a door that got kicked in on a raid. You defeat the enemy by winning the hearts of people who have dealt with too much death and loss, show them there\u2019s some other way, showing yourself there\u2019s another way. I should have seen there was some other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cMax, you can\u2019t regret something like that. You were right. He won\u2019t harm anyone else. That has to be worth something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not worth losing you. I\u2019m sorry, Mistress. I won\u2019t fail you again. Just don\u2019t go away from me like that. It fucking killed me, these past few weeks...seeing you so far away, though you were so close...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, stop, stop...\u201d She rained kisses on his eyes, his wet lashes, his nose, his forehead, the strong jaw, and then she landed on his lips and held there, a deep, drowning kiss, filled with soft whimpers and needy moans.</p><p>Touch me, she thought, and he put his hands on her back, sliding down to her hips and up again, as if he was trying to touch her everywhere at once.</p><p>\u201cI need to be inside of you. Please.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t ask, show me. Make me feel how badly you want me. Don\u2019t just melt the ice. Turn me into a fucking tropical ocean.</p><p>Again, she spoke not a word, but within the first second of the thought, he was out of the chair, holding her by the waist with one arm, his hand plunged into her hair. He held the strands so tightly they pulled against her scalp while he dove even deeper into the kiss. He dropped to one knee and she kept her legs around him. When he shifted, for one breathless moment he was holding her parallel with the ground, her body wrapped around his torso, his one arm and his knees holding them both. Then he\u2019d laid her down beneath him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t dressed up, merely donning her last set of work clothes, a modest skirt and blouse combo, a pair of low-heeled boots. He tore open her blouse, doing the same to the bra beneath in one powerful motion.</p><p>He descended on her bared breasts, licking and biting, then fell to a deep suckling, as if he was nourishing himself from the contact. She bucked up against him, scoring him with her nails, drawing blood. He put his other hand between them, found her panties beneath her rucked-up skirt and yanked the crotch aside, tearing the seams as he drove into her.</p><p>He was rutting stag hard, and she squeezed her legs tight around him, welcoming the deep pain and pleasurable agony as he plunged, thrusting so hard he was moving them on the tile floor. She would hurt tomorrow, but it wouldn\u2019t matter. It would be the best kind of aching.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go away...mine...Mistress...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d She made the whispered oath against his flesh, her tears pressed against his skin. He felt them, because he slowed down. Seating himself even deeper, he lifted up enough to frame her face and kiss each tear away with slow, tender precision. Which caused more tears for him to kiss away. Those gray eyes gazed upon her in a you\u2019re-everything-to-me way that could melt even a Dragon Lady\u2019s heart.</p><p>He was finding his center again, that rock steadiness she needed. She was part of that center now. He\u2019d made that clear, and yet he\u2019d become the same for her. She couldn\u2019t have found her way out of the ice without him. He\u2019d done it in a shocking, quick and brutal way, exposing himself to this, but that wasn\u2019t the miracle. It was how seeing him under another woman\u2019s touch, how the first grip of his hands on Janet\u2019s body, had simply smashed that ice as if it would never have the power to hold her again. Not against her need for him. She was reeling from it. Reaching up, she touched his face.</p> <p>What happened when two sides surrendered everything to one another, when the love became more important than anything else? Maybe they found their own special paradise, peace in a sometimes ugly, scary world. She held that thought to herself, even knowing he\u2019d probably agree with it. She didn\u2019t hold her next thought to herself though.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Max. Endlessly, totally, completely.\u201d</p><p>As he pressed his face against her neck, a great sigh raised his shoulders. It settled his weight upon her, but she didn\u2019t mind. He didn\u2019t let it become too much, anyway, lifting up within a few breaths to begin moving inside her again. As he did, he slid an arm around her waist, palmed her buttock so that he handled most of the movement, most of the effort. His eyes glowed with heated pleasure as her cries became more insistent, her body arching to his, her hands gripping his biceps.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>She did, going over that edge with him. Even as they fell, she knew they\u2019d find that peace and paradise they\u2019d never expected to find alone. But together, the impossible became possible.</p><p>When they got their breath back, were ready to fly again, she was going to kiss every inch of his wonderful muscled skin, every inch she thought she might have lost, and she wouldn\u2019t stop until...</p><p>Fuck it. She wasn\u2019t ever going to stop.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>One month later</p><p>\u201cSo if he chickens out of this thing, do I still get to keep the gifts?\u201d Marcie eyed the pile of opened packages for her and Ben\u2019s engagement party. \u201cThat single-cup coffeemaker alone is worth marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get it for you at a discount, then you don\u2019t need him at all,\u201d Lucas advised. Ben shoved at his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWay to have a brother\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>Janet smiled at them as Ben brought Marcie to his side. The engaged couple enjoyed a warm kiss, followed by a moment of intent adoration. The two of them were so obviously wrapped up in one another it was bound to incite reaction from Marcie\u2019s younger brother.</p><p>\u201cI am so going to puke,\u201d Nate said, emulating a gag.</p><p>The family gathering was assembled out on the large sun porch at Lucas and Cass\u2019 house. Sitting on the foot piece of a lounge chair, Janet felt Max\u2019s hand brush between her shoulder blades. She glanced back at him. He straddled the chair right behind her, his knees splayed to accommodate her hips. Her hand rested on his knee. He had a beer balanced on the other one, but his eyes on her were warm, promising.</p><p>He knew exactly what he did to her when he looked at her like that.</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d she murmured, trying to look stern. \u201cOr I\u2019ll make you go sit in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he chuckled. Leaning forward, he pressed his lips to her shoulder. She turned her face to his forehead as he did it, held there, even realizing the two of them looked no less besotted than the guests of honor. And it hadn\u2019t escaped notice.</p><p>\u201cOh God, it\u2019s contagious. Now I\u2019m going to puke too!\u201d Ben made the same noises as Nate. The teenager barked with laughter as the K&amp;A lawyer pretended to throw up behind Marcie. She shoved at him and aimed a slap at Nate, which he dodged.</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, boys, and I\u2019ll take back that single-cup coffeemaker,\u201d Janet threatened.</p><p>As laughter swept the room, Janet looked around at all of them. Matt and Savannah sat across from them on a loveseat, Angelica asleep at Matt\u2019s foot in her portable cradle. Jon and Rachel were next to them, Jon on a chair, Rachel sitting at his feet, ostensibly to stroke and coo at the baby, but also because Rachel enjoyed subtle signs of her submission to him, something that brought her peace.</p><p>In fact, in this room, Janet saw many examples of how peace had been found, demons had been laid to rest. Ben probably fought the most in that regard, and yet she\u2019d never seen him look so happy. Lucas and Cass could see it as well, such that the worry Marcie\u2019s older sister had held about Ben was decreasing. Ben was going to be okay. Love could do that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze shifted to Peter and Dana. The big man who bore a distinct resemblance to Max was sprawled in a large easy chair and Dana was balanced on the wide arm. She\u2019d pulled her bare feet up onto it and crossed them at the ankles, Peter\u2019s arm snug around her hips, keeping her steady. It was hard to believe not too long ago Dana had come back from Iraq broken in body and mind, wishing she\u2019d died in the explosion that had taken her sight. Now she was a fully ordained minister, already beloved by her congregation, and of course she did the impossible\u2014reconciled that identity with her need to be Peter\u2019s hardcore brat submissive, challenging and loving his Mastery of her.</p><p>Janet\u2019s gaze went back to Matt, to find her boss\u2019s attention on her. She expected his mind was on something similar, because those dark eyes smiled. He lifted his drink in a subtle gesture of affection to her. He was pleased with her happiness, and his regard for her, his care, was obvious in his expression. She swallowed. Thank you.</p><p>He shook his head at the silently mouthed words and rose, leaving Rachel and Savannah overseeing his daughter. When he bent to Janet, he brushed a kiss over her mouth. His murmured words to her were covered by the animated discussions of the others.</p> <p>\u201cYou deserve happiness, Janet. You both do.\u201d When his attention shifted, including Max, her man pressed against her back, his hands lingering on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all your family here,\u201d Matt said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever forget that, and you\u2019ll never be lost again.\u201d</p><p>After they left Lucas and Cass\u2019 house, Max drove her out to a deserted road that gave them a vantage point to watch planes taking off at the New Orleans airport. Amused, she saw him pull a cooler out from the back of the truck. Flipping it open, he offered her a wine chiller and popped open another beer. Then he laid out a generous display of truffles, cheese and other treats from the party.</p><p>\u201cDoes Marcie know you made off with these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you tell. And if you eat any, you\u2019re an accomplice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm. Blackmailer.\u201d She picked up a truffle, tasted it, closed her eyes. \u201cMy God, Ben can cook. He really should run a restaurant.\u201d Then she leaned over, eyes still closed. Max slid the food out of the way so he could bring her up against his side, give her the kiss she was wanting. She tasted the flavor of the beer, enjoyed it with the truffle, the scent of Max wrapping around her.</p><p>\u201cSo why do you come out here?\u201d</p><p>He settled back against the windshield, shifting her between his thighs, cradling her. She rested her hand on his belt, idly tracing it, tugging at his dress shirt. Her ribs were pressed against his groin, and she liked the interested reaction she was getting there. It might be nice to make love here, while the planes went overhead. She wondered if the pilots would be able to see them, though she expected they weren\u2019t close enough.</p><p>\u201cSometimes when I close my eyes, I imagine I\u2019m up in the sky, about to do a HALO jump,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember the way it felt, leaping out of that plane, seeing the curve of the earth for a few seconds... It\u2019s a lot like I feel when you climax around me, when I see you get lost in it.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to look up at him. He had his eyes closed now. \u201cYou think about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJumping out of a plane? Or climaxing with you? Hell no to the first, all the time to the second.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cGetting married.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected that, and something tilted in a not-so-unpleasant way at the thought. Still, she kept her tone casual. \u201cSometimes. If some ancient Saudi sheikh asked me, and I could figure out a way to off him pretty fast and take all his money.\u201d</p><p>He cracked an eyelid, considered her. \u201cYou\u2019d probably need an accomplice to pull that off. I\u2019d take a fifty-fifty cut. We could go hide out in Belize together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty-forty. I\u2019m the one that has to sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have fifty-fifty if I agree to sleep with him too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d She looked up as the next plane passed overhead, found his hand. When his fingers curled around hers, she turned her head, let it rest on his shoulder. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve thought about it. But only recently. Which means I need a lot more time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be around. But just so you know, for you I might even endure a cold shower. You can ask Dale\u2014to a SEAL, that\u2019s the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be asking him, so you better not be lying.\u201d</p> <p>His lips brushed her temple then he touched her jaw, tilted her face up so that he could put his mouth on hers, a slow, deep, drugging kiss that had her sinking into the hold of his arms as he slid both around her. Cradled in his arms, held between his thighs, his heart thumping steadily against hers where she lay against his chest...there was no better place to be.</p><p>When he at last broke the kiss, she stared up into his gray eyes, so serious and intent on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already yours, Mistress. You want to make it formal, today, tomorrow or when I\u2019m as old as that sheikh, I\u2019ll be here. You ever want to cut me loose...\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were on his mouth in an instant, stopping his words.</p><p>\u201cNo. I never do. I never will.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved in that sexy, slow smile. She wasn\u2019t one for rash or impulsive declarations, and while this felt like both, the rarity of it reflected her true, deepest feelings. She would marry him. They both knew it, though neither one said it.</p><p>She lay back down in his arms. They watched the planes come and go, both of them content to be silent, holding the precious weight of truth...and each other. </p> </body></html>"]
