One of her hands rested at her temple, her fingers curling inward, her azure-painted nails gleaming in the golden glow of the lamp. Her nose was perfect in shape and size, her chin stubborn, and her lips the plumpest\u2014and reddest\u2014he\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>And her body...gods. Perhaps those made-for-sin curves were the reason she bore the name Scarlet. Her wickedly rounded breasts...the slender dip of her waist...the feminine flare of her hips...the lean length of her legs...every part of her was meant to lure, to ensnare.</p><p>Without a doubt, she was the most hauntingly lovely female he\u2019d ever beheld. A genuine sleeping beauty. Only, this beauty would come up swinging if he tried to kiss her awake.</p><p>The thought had him grinning in pure male satisfaction.</p><p>One look, and a man knew she was passion and fire underneath that snow-white skin. What most men didn\u2019t know, however, was that, like Gideon, she was possessed by a demon.</p><p>Difference is, I earned mine. She didn\u2019t.</p> <p>For-freaking-ever ago, he\u2019d helped his friends steal and open Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the evil inside. Yeah, yeah. A mistake. Hardly worth a second\u2019s thought, if you asked him, but the gods hadn\u2019t, so, as punishment, each warrior responsible was cursed to host a demon inside his own body. Baddies like Death, Disaster, Violence, Disease, yada yada.</p><p>There\u2019d been more demons than warriors, though, so the remaining fiends had been placed inside the immortal prisoners of Tartarus. Where Scarlet had resided her entire life.</p><p>Gideon was paired with Lies, Scarlet with Nightmares.</p><p>Clearly, he\u2019d gotten the short end of that demon-stick. She merely slept like the dead and invaded people\u2019s dreams. He couldn\u2019t utter a single truth without suffering. To tell a pretty woman that she was pretty was to fall to his knees, agony unlike any other exploding through him, cutting at his organs, acid spilling through his blood, draining his strength, even eroding his desire to live.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ugly,\u201d he\u2019d have to say instead. Most females would burst into tears and run the hell away. So, yeah, he was immune to tears.</p><p>But what would Scarlet do? he found himself wondering. And would her tears bother him?</p> <p>He reached out and traced a fingertip along the curve of her jaw. Such silky, warm skin. Would she laugh at him, unconcerned? Would she try and slice his throat? Believe him? Call him a liar?</p><p>Or would she haul ass like the others?</p><p>The thought of hurting her, angering her and ultimately losing her didn\u2019t sit well with him.</p><p>His arm fell to his side, hand fisting. Maybe I\u2019ll tell her the truth. Maybe I\u2019ll praise her. But he knew he wouldn\u2019t. Make that mistake once, fine. You were stupid. Make it twice, and you were proving Darwin\u2019s theory.</p><p>He\u2019d already made it once.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s greatest enemy, the Hunters, had captured him and told him that they\u2019d killed Sabin, keeper of the demon of Doubt. Now, Gideon loved that man like a brother\u2014boy could bitch-slap like no one else\u2014so he\u2019d erupted, screaming how much he hated them, how he was going to kill them all, and it had been the gods\u2019 honest truth, every word of it. Though it might take him years, centuries, to see the promise through, that didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d meant it and had been penalized for it, the anguish instantaneous.</p><p>After that, curled on the floor and writhing, he\u2019d been an easy target for torture. And torture him the Hunters had. Repeatedly.</p><p>After beating him so severely his eyes had swollen shut and several teeth had flown the coop, after shoving sharp pins under his nails, electrocuting him and carving the mark of infinity\u2014their mark\u2014into his back, they\u2019d removed his hands. He\u2019d seriously thought he\u2019d reached the end. Until a very much alive Sabin had found him, rescued him and carried him home (after doing some of that aforementioned bitch-slapping).</p> <p>Thankfully, both of his hands had finally regenerated. Something he\u2019d been waiting for. Very...patiently. So he could seek revenge, yes. Or rather, that had been the case at first. But then his friends had jailed this woman, this Scarlet, and she had claimed they were husband and wife.</p><p>His priorities had kinda switched at that point.</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember her, much less wedding her. But he had seen flashes of her face all these thousands of years. Mostly every time he collapsed atop a woman, sweaty but not truly replete because he was too filled with longing for something, or someone, he hadn\u2019t been able to name. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t outright deny her claim. And he needed to deny her. To prove her wrong.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have to live with the knowledge that he\u2019d abandoned a woman he\u2019d promised to protect. He\u2019d have to live with the knowledge that he\u2019d slept with other women while his wife suffered.</p><p>He\u2019d have to live with the knowledge that someone had fucked with his memory.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d demanded an explanation from Scarlet, but she was stubborn to her core and had refused to tell him anything more. Like how they\u2019d met, when they\u2019d met, if they\u2019d been in love, happy. How they\u2019d split.</p><p>To be honest, he couldn\u2019t blame her for keeping the details a secret. How could he? She had been as much a prisoner to the Lords as he\u2019d recently been to the Hunters, and he hadn\u2019t talked to his captors, either. Even during that oh, so pleasant hand extraction.</p><p>So, he\u2019d come up with a plan. For Scarlet to open up to him, he would have to take her somewhere else. Just for a little while. Just until he had answers. Then, this morning, he\u2019d done it. While his supposed wife slept, oblivious to the world around her, he\u2019d kidnapped her from his home and carted her fireman-style to this hotel in central Budapest.</p><p>Finally, he would have everything he wanted.</p><p>All she had to do was wake up...</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>A few hours earlier...</p><p>LET\u2019S GET THE PARTY STARTED, Gideon thought with unparalleled determination as he stomped through the renovated hallways of his Budapest fortress.</p><p>The demon of Lies hummed inside his head, heartily in agreement. Both of them liked Scarlet, their alleged wife, but for different reasons. Gideon liked the look of her and the saucy, forked-tongued comments she made. Lies liked... Gideon wasn\u2019t sure. He only knew that the beast purred in approval every time she opened her beautiful, I-can-do-things-you\u2019ve-only-dreamed-about mouth.It was a reaction usually reserved for pathological liars. Except, the demon couldn\u2019t actually tell if she fibbed or not. Which meant beneath all that affection for Scarlet, Lies was frustrated, sensitive to every word that left Gideon\u2019s mouth. And that made Gideon\u2019s life frustrating as hell. He couldn\u2019t even call his friends by their own names anymore.</p><p>Was she or wasn\u2019t she a filthy freaking liar? And yeah, he was well aware of the irony. He, a man who couldn\u2019t utter a single truth, was complaining about someone who might be feeding him a big, heaping bowl of shit. But were they or weren\u2019t they? Had they or hadn\u2019t they? He had to know before he drove himself insane, puzzling over everything she\u2019d ever said and everything he\u2019d ever done and thought.</p><p>His request that she just lay out the facts, black and white, boom, done, over had been ignored for the last time.</p><p>He was finally taking action.</p><p>Hopefully, pretending to rescue her from his own dungeon would cause her to trust him. Hopefully, trusting him would cause her to open the hell up and answer his godsdamn questions.</p><p>Oops. His frustration was showing again.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this, Gid,\u201d Strider, keeper of the demon of Defeat, said, suddenly keeping pace beside him.</p><p>Fuck. Anyone but him.</p><p>Strider couldn\u2019t lose a challenge, any challenge, without suffering as Gideon suffered when he spoke true. Including Xbox, and that was seriously screwing with Gideon\u2019s \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u201d mojo, because yeah, Gideon had challenged him, trying to distract himself and work out the stiffness in his new fingers.</p><p>Anyway. Always, without question, he and Strider guarded each other\u2019s backs (video games aside). So, he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that his friend was here, resolved to save him from himself. Didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d roll over and play dead.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Strider added. \u201cA walking blade through the heart, dude.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was. She invaded dreams, presented sleepers with their worst fears and fed off the ensuing terror. Hell, a few weeks ago, she\u2019d done it to him. With spiders. He shuddered, momentarily sick to his stomach as he pictured the hairy little bastards crawling all over him.</p><p>Pussy. Suck it up. He\u2019d faced countless swinging swords without flinching\u2014as well as the monsters wielding them. What were a few spiders? Another shudder. Revolting, that\u2019s what. He knew what they were thinking every time their beady eyes landed on him: tasty.</p><p>But why hadn\u2019t Scarlet invaded anyone else\u2019s dreams? He\u2019d wondered about that almost as much as he\u2019d wondered about their \u201cmarriage.\u201d The other warriors, their female companions, she\u2019d left alone. Despite the fact that she\u2019d threatened to slaughter every single one of them. Something she truly could do.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. Stop ignoring me,\u201d Strider growled, punching a hole in the silver-stone wall seconds after they passed a closed bedroom door. \u201cYou know my demon doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Dust and debris plumed the air, a loud crack echoing. Great. Soon, other warriors would be up and running to find out what had just happened. Or maybe not. As temperamental as members of this household were (cough too much testosterone cough), they had to be used to unexpected, violent noises.</p><p>\u201cLook. I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d Gideon flicked his friend a glance, taking in the blond hair, the blue eyes and the deceptively innocent features that were somehow perfect for his he-man build. More than one woman had called him \u201cbeautifully all-American,\u201d whatever that meant. Those same women usually avoided looking at Gideon, as if even roving their gazes over his tattoos and piercings would blacken their souls. For all he knew, they were right. \u201cBut you\u2019re correct. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which meant that Strider was wrong and, yes, Gideon damn well could do this. So suck it!</p><p>Everyone who lived in this fortress\u2014and godsdamn, there were a lot of people, the number seemingly growing by the day as his friends each hooked up with their \u201cone and only\u201d (gag)\u2014was fluent in Gideon Speak and knew to believe the opposite of whatever he said.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Strider said tightly. \u201cYou can. But you won\u2019t. Because you know that if you take the woman out of this home, I\u2019ll go gray from worry. And you like my hair the way it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStridey-man. Are you hitting on me? Trying to get me to run my fingers through those mangy locks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShithead,\u201d Strider muttered, but his anger was clearly defused.</p><p>Gideon chuckled. \u201cSweetie pie.\u201d</p><p>Strider\u2019s lips even twitched into a grin. \u201cYou know I hate when you get mushy like that.\u201d</p><p>Boy loved it. No question.</p> <p>They snaked a corner, bypassing one of the many sitting rooms the fortress possessed. This one was empty. As early in the morning as it was, most of the warriors were still in bed with their women. If they weren\u2019t weaponing-up at that exact moment, of course.</p><p>Out of habit, he scanned the area. In this particular room, portraits of naked men littered the walls, courtesy of the goddess of Anarchy whose warped sense of humor rivaled Gideon\u2019s own. There were red leather chairs (Reyes, the keeper of Pain, sometimes had to cut himself to quiet his demon, so red came in handy), gleaming bookshelves (Paris, keeper of Promiscuity, enjoyed romance novels), and weird silver lamps that twisted and curved over the chairs; he had no idea who those were for. Fresh flowers bloomed from vases, sweetly scenting the air. Again, he had no idea. Fine. He\u2019d requested those. That shit smelled good.</p><p>Gideon breathed deeply of that fresh, delicious air. Except he ended up inhaling a nose full of guilt. Sadly, that happened all the time lately. While he luxuriated in this, his would-be wife rotted below in the dungeons. Before this, she\u2019d spent thousands of years in Tartarus, so that made him doubly cruel for leaving her down there.</p><p>Really, what kind of man allowed such a thing? An asshole, that\u2019s who, and he was certainly king of them. After all, he was going to return Scarlet to the dungeon once his questions were answered. For, like, ever. Even if she was\u2014or rather, had been\u2014his wife.</p><p>Yes. He was a bad, bad man.</p><p>She was simply too dangerous to be permanently freed, her ability to invade dreams too destructive. Because when you died in one of Scarlet\u2019s nightmares, you died for real. That was it. The end. And if she ever decided to aid the Hunters, which could happen, scorned women and all that, the Lords would never be able to sleep soundly again. And they needed their beauty rest or they became snarling beasts.</p> <p>Case in point: Gideon. He hadn\u2019t slept in weeks.</p><p>Slow down, his demon suddenly instructed. Moving too fast.</p><p>Usually Lies was merely a presence in the back of his mind. There, but silent. Only when the demon\u2019s need was great did he speak up. But even then, he had to say the opposite of what he wanted. And now he wanted Gideon to hurry up and reach Scarlet.</p><p>Give me wings and it\u2019s done, Gideon replied dryly, but damn if he didn\u2019t quicken his step. He could and did think what he meant. Always. He never lied to himself or the demon during these private moments. Maybe because he\u2019d had to fight savagely and without mercy for such moments.</p><p>Upon possession, he\u2019d been lost to darkness and chaos, a slave to his soul-companion and his evil cravings. He\u2019d tormented humans just to hear them scream. He\u2019d burned homes to the ground, as well as the families inside them. He\u2019d killed indiscriminately, and taunted while doing so.</p><p>It had taken a few hundred years, but Gideon had finally clawed his way to the light. He was in control now, and had even managed to tame the beast. For the most part.</p><p>Strider heaved a sigh, regaining his attention. \u201cGideon, man, listen to me. I said it once, but I\u2019ll say it again. You can\u2019t take the female outside these walls. She\u2019ll run from you, you know she will. Hunters are in the city, we know that, too, and they could catch her. Recruit her. Use her. Or, if she refuses them, even hurt her like they hurt you.\u201d</p><p>One, Strider was speaking as if Gideon couldn\u2019t hold on to the wily temptress for a few days. And he could. He knew how to kick ass and take names with the best. Two, Strider was speaking as if Gideon would be unable to find her if he did indeed lose her. And three, Strider was probably speaking correctly, but that didn\u2019t soothe Gideon\u2019s sudden burst of anger. He may not be the smooth operator that Strider was, but he had some skills with the ladies, damn it.</p> <p>More than that, Scarlet herself was a warrior. An immortal. She could surround herself with darkness. A darkness so thick no human light, and no immortal eyes, could penetrate it. Losing her wouldn\u2019t be as disgraceful as losing, say, an untrained human.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d lose her, he told himself again, and not that she would want to run. He was going to seduce her. Was going to pleasure the energy right out of her and make her desperate to stay with him. Which shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. She\u2019d liked him enough to marry him, right? Maybe. Damn it!</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Strider said after another sigh. \u201cIf she escapes you, so what? You\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d He had thought that, yeah, but he\u2019d soon discarded the idea. So there. What are you? A girl?</p><p>\u201cWell, what happens to her while you\u2019re looking for her? During the day she needs protection, and if you\u2019re not with her, who\u2019s going to protect her?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Good point. Scarlet couldn\u2019t function during daylight hours. Because of her demon, she slept too deeply. So deeply that nothing and no one could wake her until sunset, a fact he\u2019d discovered after nearly giving her a brain aneurysm while trying and failing to shake her into consciousness.</p><p>He had been shocked when, a few hours later, her eyes had popped open and she\u2019d sat up as if she\u2019d just taken a ten-minute power nap.</p><p>Which had raised other questions. Why did her demon sleep during the day, when the people around her were awake? Didn\u2019t that defeat the purpose of creating nightmares? And what happened when she traveled and the time zone changed?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky we found her when we did,\u201d Strider continued. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t had Aeron\u2019s angel on our side, we would\u2019ve died trying to secure her. Setting her free, no matter the reason, is stupid and danger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said that before.\u201d Over and over again. \u201cBesides, Olive\u2019s no longer on our team.\u201d Meaning, she was. \u201cShe can\u2019t help us again if needed.\u201d Meaning she could. \u201cNow, I hate you, man, but please keep talking.\u201d I love you, but shut the hell up! Seriously.</p><p>Strider growled his renewed frustration as they pounded down the steps that led into the dungeon, stained-glass windows giving way to crumbling, bloodstained walls. The air became musty, tainted with sweat, urine and blood. None of it was Scarlet\u2019s, thank the gods. His guilt couldn\u2019t have handled that. Fortunately\u2014or unfortunately, depending on whom you asked\u2014she wasn\u2019t the only being locked away. They had several Hunters awaiting payback, aka interrogation, aka torture.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she was lying to you?\u201d his friend asked. The man didn\u2019t know when to quit, and yeah, Gideon knew Strider couldn\u2019t quit. Which was why he didn\u2019t simply punch his friend in the face and beat feet. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s not really your wife?\u201d</p><p>Gideon snorted. \u201cForgot to tell you. Sifting through truth and lies is difficult for me.\u201d Except with her, but he wasn\u2019t going to issue that reminder just then.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you also told me you don\u2019t know with her.\u201d</p><p>One of them had a perfect memory. Excellent. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she can be my wife.\u201d The chances were slim, but yeah, they were there. \u201cI don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>When Scarlet had first invaded his dreams and demanded he visit her in this dungeon, he\u2019d been helpless to do otherwise, filled with a need to see her, some part of him recognizing her on a level he still didn\u2019t understand. When she\u2019d alleged they\u2019d kissed, had sex, even wed each other, that same part of him had hummed in agreement.</p><p>Even though he didn\u2019t fucking remember her.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he remember her? he wondered for the thousandth time.</p><p>He\u2019d been playing with several theories. The first: the gods had erased his memory. But that raised the question of why. Why would they not want him to recall his own wife? Why had they not erased Scarlet\u2019s memory, as well?</p><p>The second theory: he\u2019d suppressed the memory himself. But again, why would he have done so? How would he have done so? There were a million other things he\u2019d actually like to forget.</p><p>The third: his demon had somehow erased the memory when they were paired. But if that were true, why did he recall his life in the heavens, when he\u2019d been a servant to Zeus, tasked with guarding the former god king at every moment of every day?</p><p>He and Strider stopped at the first cell, where Scarlet had resided the past few weeks. She was asleep on her cot, as he\u2019d known she would be. And as he\u2019d done each time he\u2019d seen her, he sucked in a breath. Lovely. But...</p><p>Mine? Did he want her to be?</p><p>No, of course not. That would complicate the hell out of everything. Not that he\u2019d let it matter. He couldn\u2019t. His friends came first. That\u2019s the way things were, and the way they would always be.</p><p>At least she was clean; he\u2019d made sure she had enough water to drink and to bathe. And she was well fed; he\u2019d made sure food was delivered three times a night. He would do the same when he ultimately returned her. That would have to be enough.</p><p>Don\u2019t hurry, Lies cried, practically jumping from one corner of his skull to the other. Don\u2019t hurry!</p><p>Cram it, buddy. I\u2019ll handle this. But he couldn\u2019t force himself to move just yet. He\u2019d been waiting for this moment forever, it seemed, and wanted to bask in it.</p><p>Bask? He really was becoming a woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Look away before you get an erection, he told himself. All right, now that was more manly. He purposefully shifted his gaze. The walls around her were composed of thick, impenetrable stone. Therefore, she could never see the Hunters imprisoned beside her. Actually, Gideon didn\u2019t care about that. He didn\u2019t want the Hunters seeing her.</p><p>Yeah. He wanted mine. At least for now.</p><p>Speaking of the Hunters, they spotted the warriors through their own bars and shrank into the shadows, their murmurs tapering to quiet. They might have stopped breathing as well, so afraid were they of being singled out. Good. He liked that his enemy feared him.</p> <p>They had every reason to do so.</p><p>These men had imprisoned and raped innocent, immortal women in hopes of creating half-breed children they could raise to hate and fight Gideon and his friends. Children who would\u2019ve been able to help the Hunters find Pandora\u2019s box before the Lords could, all in hopes of using the artifact to separate each demon from its host. An act the warriors wouldn\u2019t survive, as man was now bound irrevocably to beast.</p><p>That, too, was part of their punishment for opening that stupid box.</p><p>Gideon withdrew the key to Scarlet\u2019s cell, his new fingers stiff and shaky from disuse, and reached out.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Strider placed a hard hand on his shoulder, trying to hold him in place. Gideon could have shaken free, but he allowed his friend the illusion of winning this small battle of wills. \u201cYou can talk to her here. Get your answers here.\u201d</p> <p>But they had an audience, which meant she couldn\u2019t relax. And if she couldn\u2019t relax, she wouldn\u2019t allow him to touch her. Degenerate that he was, he wanted to touch her. Besides, how else was he going to seduce information from her? By telling her how ugly she was? By telling her what he didn\u2019t want to do to her?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ease off, man. Like I haven\u2019t told you countless times, I have no plans to bring her back when I find out what I don\u2019t want to know. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can bring her back. We discussed that little problem already, too. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Kinda hard to forget. Unfortunately. \u201cI won\u2019t be careful. You don\u2019t have my word. But I don\u2019t need to do this. It\u2019s not important to me.\u201d</p><p>That hard hand never left him. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to leave us. We have three artifacts, and Galen\u2019s pissed as hell. He\u2019s gonna want revenge for the one we took from him.\u201d</p><p>Galen was leader of the Hunters, as well as a demon-possessed warrior. Only, he looked angelic and was paired with the demon of Hope, so all of his human followers thought he was, indeed, an angel. Because of him, they blamed each of the Lords for the world\u2019s evil. Because of him, they expected a future free of that evil, and fought to the death to achieve it.</p> <p>Aeron\u2019s new woman, Olivia, who actually was an honest-to-her-God angel, had stolen that third artifact from the bastard. The Cloak of Invisibility. As there were four artifacts needed to lead the way to Pandora\u2019s box\u2014the All-Seeing Eye (check), the Cage of Compulsion (check), the Cloak of Invisibility (as stated, check) and the Paring Rod (check coming soon)\u2014Galen was desperate to win back the Cloak, as well as confiscate all the others.</p><p>Which meant their war was really heating up.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, though. Nothing was going to deter Gideon from his present course of action. Mainly because part of him felt like his very life depended on this. \u201cGid. Dude.\u201d</p><p>He flicked his friend a narrowed glance, lips pulling back in a snarl. \u201cYou\u2019re begging to be kissed.\u201d Beaten to hell.</p><p>A moment passed in heavy silence.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Strider finally muttered, raising his arms, palms out. \u201cTake her.\u201d</p><p>Jeez. \u201cWasn\u2019t planning on it, but many thanks for the approval.\u201d But why wasn\u2019t Strider collapsed on the ground, out for the count? He\u2019d just lost a challenge, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cWhen will you return?\u201d</p> <p>Gideon shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking...a week?\u201d Surely seven days was plenty of time to soften Scarlet toward him and get her to open up about their past. Right now, she seemed to hate his guts. He didn\u2019t know why, but he would. It was a vow. But still. She clearly preferred dangerous men. Why else would she have supposedly married him? So he fit the bill.</p><p>\u201cThree days,\u201d Strider said.</p><p>Ah. Negotiation time. That was why Strider hadn\u2019t fallen to his demon. He wasn\u2019t defeated, merely trying another strategy. Gideon could dig. He felt just as guilty about leaving his boys behind as he did about leaving Scarlet in this cell. They needed him, and if they were hurt while he was gone, he would completely flip his lid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thinking five now,\u201d he compromised.</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo deal.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Strider nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>So. He had four days to soften Scarlet. He\u2019d fought more difficult battles in less time, he was sure. Funny that he couldn\u2019t recall them at the moment, though.</p><p>Hell, maybe he just suffered from selective memory loss. Maybe fights and Scarlet\u2014whom he\u2019d probably fought with a lot, since she was opinionated, bossy and mouthy as shit\u2014were the biggest casualties of that loss.</p><p>He would\u2019ve liked to remember the sex, though. Mind-blowing. He just knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll inform the others,\u201d Strider said. \u201cBut in the meantime, I\u2019ll drive you to wherever you want to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Gideon finally inserted the key and unlocked Scarlet\u2019s cell, the door swinging open with a whine. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna drive her myself. I want everyone to know where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Strider gave another growl, this one just as frustrated but now laced with anger. \u201cStubborn jackass. I have to know you made it safely to wherever you\u2019re going or I won\u2019t be able to concentrate enough to kill anyone. And you know I\u2019m on a strict, at-least-one-Hunter-a-day diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you won\u2019t be getting a phone call from me.\u201d Gideon approached Scarlet\u2019s still-sleeping form. She no longer surrounded herself in that impermeable darkness while she slept. As if she wanted Gideon to always be able to see her. As if she trusted him not to hurt her.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what he told himself.</p><p>\u201cGods. I can\u2019t believe you talked me into this. Did I tell you already that you\u2019re a shithead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Gently he scooped Scarlet into his arms.</p><p>Sighing, she rubbed her cheek against his heart. A heart that was now beating against his ribs like a sledgehammer. She must have liked the erratic rhythm, because she cuddled closer. Nice.</p><p>She was five-nine to his six-three, slender, but leanly muscled. She had refused the clothes he\u2019d offered her, so she wore the T-shirt and jeans Aeron had found her in.</p><p>Gideon inhaled deeply again, but this time there was no guilt. She smelled of floral-scented soap, and it consumed him. What had she smelled like all those years ago, when they\u2019d supposedly been married? Flowers, like now? Or something else? Something more exotic? Something as dark and sensual as she was? Something he would have enjoyed sucking into his mouth as he tongued her from head to toe?</p><p>Head out of gutter. Now wasn\u2019t the time to indulge such thoughts.</p><p>He turned with her clutched tightly to his chest, a treasure he would protect while they were outside the fortress walls. Even from his friends. He knew he was contradicting himself, thinking of her in such romantic terms and so ferociously, when his intentions were neither pure nor honorable, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. Stupid lust.</p><p>Strider\u2019s expression was wary, but accepting, silently telling him no defensive moves would be necessary. \u201cGo. And be careful.\u201d</p><p>Gods, he loved his friends. They supported him no matter what. They always had.</p><p>\u201cBy the way. You look like you\u2019re a cat, and you just found a bowl of cream,\u201d Strider said with a shake of his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not comforting. You have no idea what you\u2019re getting yourself into, do you?\u201d</p><p>Maybe not. Because he hadn\u2019t looked forward to something this intensely in a long time, and he probably should\u2019ve been wary. Having his idiocy pointed out, though... \u201cI\u2019m not showing you a finger in my mind. Do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s your index finger and you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m number one.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Something like that.</p><p>\u201cFour days,\u201d his friend reminded him. \u201cOr I come find you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon blew him a kiss.</p><p>Strider rolled his eyes. \u201cYou wish. But listen. I\u2019ll be praying for you to return to us alive. And with the girl. And that she\u2019s alive, too. Oh, and that you\u2019re satisfied with what you learn. And that she satisfied you in other ways, so you\u2019ll forget about her like you\u2019ve done all the other women in your life.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was a lot of prayers. \u201cThanks. A lot. I really mean that. So when didn\u2019t you become a priest? And when did the gods decide they liked answering us?\u201d Strider had never wasted his time on prayers before, and the gods actually adored ignoring their requests.</p><p>No, not true, he corrected himself. Cronus, the newly crowned Titan king, now liked to visit the fortress without an invite and make all kinds of shitty demands Gideon and the others were forced to obey.</p><p>Like killing innocent humans. Like choosing to save either your woman or your friend. Like begging to be told where your friend\u2019s spirit had been sent when the friend in question had had his head cleaved from his body. Yeah, that had happened. Aeron had lost his head to a warrior angel and at Cronus\u2019s behest, Gideon had begged (in his way) to know where the man\u2019s spirit resided, tears streaming down his face. Actually, all of them had begged and sobbed like babies.</p><p>But in the end, Cronus had still refused to tell them. Because they\u2019d needed a lesson in humility, the bastard had said.</p><p>Then, of course, Aeron had returned on his own. Or rather, with his sweet Olivia\u2019s help. He\u2019d been restored to his body, minus his demon, and once again lived here in the fortress. But Gideon had yet to forgive Cronus for his disregard, so prayers weren\u2019t something he would be offering anytime soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPriest.\u201d Strider\u2019s head slanted thoughtfully. Of course, he ignored Gideon\u2019s questions. Him, though, Gideon easily forgave. \u201cI like it. I mean, it\u2019s practically true. I have sent many women through the gates of heaven.\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t they all?</p><p>And Scarlet would be no different, he assured himself.</p> <p>Grinning now, Gideon carried his woman away.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>SCARLET AWOKE with a jolt. But then, she always did. The moment her demon\u2019s required time in dreamland ended, awareness would slam into her brain, as if she\u2019d been hooked to a generator and the switch had been flipped.</p><p>Panting, sweating, she sat up, wild gaze roving though not really seeing. Yet. The screams she and her demon had garnered from their victims were already fading, but the images they\u2019d projected into those sleeping minds remained in hers. Crackling flames, melting flesh, black ash wafting and dancing in the breeze.The night\u2019s terror du jour had been fire.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t control the demon while she slept, as he searched out anyone he could find, wreaking what havoc he could. She could, however, make suggestions, urging him to attack certain people in certain ways. And he usually rushed to do so. Not that she\u2019d made any suggestions lately.</p> <p>Ever since the Lords of the Underworld had captured her, she\u2019d been operating on autopilot, her thoughts consumed with one warrior in particular. The blue-haired, gorgeous, utterly frustrating Gideon.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he remember her?</p><p>As always, recalling his selective amnesia had every muscle in her body tensing on bone. Her hands fisted; her teeth gnashed together, little pains shooting through her jaw. But most of all, a savage need to kill someone, anyone, consumed her.</p><p>Anger isn\u2019t good for those around you. Calm down. Think of something else.</p><p>She forced her mind to return to her demon; sadly, death and chaos were a much safer topic than that of her husband. During their hours awake\u2014which amounted to twelve each and every day, though not always the same twelve\u2014she pulled the strings. She could summon the darkness, and she could garner the screams. The demon could urge her, and she often heeded those urgings. Turnabout was fair play, after all. And usually, Nightmares liked to urge. Scare him... Make her scream...</p><p>But right now, her demon was strangely content.</p> <p>We\u2019re out of the dungeon, Nightmares said, seeing their surroundings before she could.</p><p>Aw. No wonder.</p><p>The flames finally died, and Scarlet scanned the area. She frowned. Okay. So. Where the hell was she now?</p><p>She\u2019d been locked in that dungeon for several weeks, enclosed in crumbling stone and iron bars. Pained moans had constantly drifted from the other cells, and all kinds of pungent, acrid scents had taken up permanent residence inside her nose.</p><p>Now...decadence. Floral paper decorated the walls, and dark velvet curtains hung over the bay windows. There was a glistening, violet chandelier over the bed, the lights shaped like bundles of grapes. And the bed, well, her gaze slid along every inch of it. Large, with soft blue sheets and four hand-carved posters.</p><p>Best of all, the air smelled sweet, like those hanging grapes mixed with apples and vanilla. She breathed deeply, savoring. How had she gotten here? Without her knowledge?</p><p>Clearly, she\u2019d been carried while she\u2019d slept like the dead. Something she usually despised but couldn\u2019t this time because it meant she\u2019d been set free, just as she\u2019d hoped. Yes, hoped. She hadn\u2019t wanted to remain in that fortress, just to be near Gideon. Really.</p><p>Still. While she was lost to the dreams of others\u2014and yeah, no matter what time she slipped into that realm of darkness and turmoil, someone, somewhere was sleeping, the demon feeding off their terror\u2014anyone could attack her, and she would be unable to defend herself. Anyone could do anything to her, and she would be powerless to stop them.</p> <p>Being moved while she was helpless irked.</p><p>Usually she protected herself from just such a situation with shadows. She had only to crook a mental finger just before she drifted and they would envelop her the entire time she slept, making it impossible for anyone to see her. But once she\u2019d realized she was inside Gideon\u2019s home, she\u2019d stopped summoning those shadows.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d wished, on some level, that watching her while she slept would revive his memory of her. Perhaps she\u2019d wished he would grow to desire her again and beg to be a part of her new life. Which was stupid. The bastard had left her to rot inside Tartarus; she shouldn\u2019t want his desire.</p><p>She should want his ruin.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. I\u2019m so upset you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his voice, deep and rumbling, Scarlet stiffened, gaze once again roving. Then, she spotted him, and her heart stopped abruptly. He stood in the bedroom\u2019s doorway, muscled arms hanging loosely. He was a warrior whose wicked face promised incomparable nights of sinful pleasures, his eyes bright with anticipation and contradicting his casual pose.</p><p>Gideon. Once her beloved husband, but now a man who deserved only her scorn.</p><p>Her heart kicked back into gear, quickly gaining speed, and her blood heated with tendrils of awareness. The same reaction she\u2019d experienced the first time she\u2019d seen him, thousands of years ago.</p><p>Not my fault, then or now. There was no man more beautiful, part angel, part devil, and all the more masculine for it. No man who tempted even as he repelled, someplace deep inside a woman warning her of the dangers that awaited her should she succumb to his allure. Dangers she couldn\u2019t help but crave.</p><p>He wore a black T-shirt that read \u201cYou Know You Want Me,\u201d black pants that bagged just a little and a silver chain belt. There were three piercings in his right eyebrow, and now one in his lip. A hoop. Silver. To match his belt, she thought snidely.</p><p>He\u2019d always cared about his appearance, and hadn\u2019t liked being teased about it. Something that had once amused her, for it had showed a softer side of him. A hint of vulnerability.</p><p>Today, however, she couldn\u2019t summon any joviality. While he stood there looking as edible as a chocolate truffle dipped in caramel, she probably resembled a gutter rat dipped in sewage. She\u2019d only been able to scrub herself with the water the Lords brought her each evening, so her clothes were wrinkled and dirty and her hair a mass of tangles.</p><p>\u201cGot lots to say, huh?\u201d he muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, then.\u201d</p><p>She knew he could only speak lies, so she knew exactly what he meant. He wanted her talking. Keep it cas. Don\u2019t let him know how he affects you. She arched a brow, donning what she hoped was an unconcerned expression. \u201cRemember me yet?\u201d Good. There hadn\u2019t been a single spark of hurt in her tone.</p><p>His eyes drained of emotion, making those crystalline orbs look as hard as diamonds. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>So, no. He didn\u2019t. Bastard. She didn\u2019t allow her expression to change, wouldn\u2019t let him know how much he upset her. \u201cThen why did you take me out of the fortress?\u201d Slowly, purposefully, she traced a finger down the column of her neck, between her breasts, wondering if\u2014yep. His gaze followed the entire way. Did some part of him still find her attractive? \u201cI\u2019m a very dangerous woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t been warned about that already.\u201d The words were broken, emerging on a rasp of breath. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t remove you to talk comfortably, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Not because he\u2019d wanted her, then, but just to appease his curiosity. Her hand fell to her lap. She was not disappointed. This was more of the same, and she\u2019d steeled herself against the mental anguish countless times already. One more time should hardly make a difference.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you thought a change of scenery would loosen my tongue.\u201d</p><p>Though he remained silent, a muscle ticked in his jaw. He was clearly perturbed.</p><p>She offered him a sugar-sweet smile, determined to enjoy the moment. And there was something satisfying about leaving him in the dark, keeping him guessing the way he\u2019d kept her guessing about his whereabouts for thousands of worry-filled years.</p><p>Reminded of her worry, that soul-deep, ever-present worry, she couldn\u2019t stop her smile, fake as it was, from vanishing. She even had to press her tongue to the roof of her mouth to stop herself from chomping on it in fury.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back for you,\u201d he\u2019d told her one night. \u201cI\u2019ll set you free, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t leave me here.\u201d Gods, she\u2019d been so whiny back then. But she\u2019d been a prisoner, and he\u2019d been her only bright light.</p><p>\u201cI love you too much to be without you for long, sweetheart. You know that. But I have to do this. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him after that. Not until the Titans escaped Tartarus, a prison for immortals, and wrested control of the heavens from the Greeks. Not until she\u2019d come here to Earth and searched...only to find him carousing for tail at some skanky nightclub.</p><p>The fury expanded, dotted her line of vision with red. Deep breath in, deep breath out. Slowly the dots dissipated.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done here,\u201d she said, though she remained still, gauging his reaction. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting what you want, and you\u2019re certainly not keeping me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free to run from me.\u201d He crossed his arms over his massive chest, pulling the fabric of his shirt tight across his pecs. \u201cYou won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Again, she knew what he meant. Run, and he would ensure she suffered. But she said, \u201cSoon as I stretch, I\u2019ll take you up on that offer and run. Thanks for the suggestion, by the way. I never would have thought of it on my own.\u201d</p><p>He growled with frustration and anger, all hint of casualness gone. \u201cI was cruel to bring you here. You don\u2019t owe me a favor in return, so you had better not stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in agreement. You\u2019re cruel, and I don\u2019t owe you anything, so I won\u2019t feel obligated to remain.\u201d</p><p>Another growl. She tried not to laugh. Damnation, he was still fun to tease.</p><p>Fun? Her grin faded a second time. She should hate that he could only speak in lies, not enjoy it. That deceitful tongue of his had once shattered her already fragile heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s so not enough from you,\u201d he sniped.</p><p>\u201cWow. Already begging for more.\u201d Once, she\u2019d thought him special. But he\u2019d proven himself exactly like the others. Her mother, her king, her supposed friends. They should have cared about her, but they had betrayed her, each and every one of them.</p><p>They\u2019d been criminals, sure, but even criminals could love. Right? Right. So why couldn\u2019t they love me?</p> <p>She\u2019d spent her entire life locked inside Tartarus because her mother, Rhea, wife to Cronus, had had an affair with a mortal just before the queen\u2019s imprisonment and had eventually given birth to Scarlet inside her cell. A cell she\u2019d shared with several other gods and goddesses.</p><p>Scarlet had been raised among them, and at first, they\u2019d liked her. As she\u2019d aged, however, jealousy had sprouted in some. Lust in others.</p><p>Captivity, hatred and bitterness had soon become her only trusted companions.</p><p>Until Gideon.</p><p>He\u2019d once been an elite guard to Zeus and every time he\u2019d brought in a new prisoner, their gazes had met. She\u2019d waited for those moments, desperate for them. He\u2019d enjoyed them, too, because he\u2019d begun to visit Tartarus regularly. Not to lock up another criminal but simply to see her, to talk to her.</p> <p>Don\u2019t think about your time with him. You\u2019ll soften toward him. And you can\u2019t soften, you idiot.</p><p>After gaining her freedom, she should have stayed in Olympus, which was now renamed Titania, thanks to Cronus, and found a nice god to settle down with. But nooo. She\u2019d had to see Gideon one last time. Then, having seen him, she\u2019d had to remain near him. Then, having decided to remain, she\u2019d just had to convince herself to warn the Lords away from her, since she\u2019d heard that they were tracking every immortal paired with a demon from Pandora\u2019s box, with the intention of recruiting them...or killing them.</p><p>Bastard, she thought about Gideon again. Excellent. That\u2019s more like it. He\u2019s a filthy liar, a cold-blooded killer, and you hate him. He still planned to kill her after he got his answers; she knew he did. Because she would never aid him, and that made her a liability.</p><p>\u201cThis silence is awesome,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cGlad you like it,\u201d she replied. Annoyance bloomed over his expression, and she had to fight another grin. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m willing to give you a lot more of it.\u201d Another growl.</p><p>\u201cOh, and for your peace of mind, you should know that I\u2019m not going to run.\u201d Yet. She wanted to talk, too, though not to satisfy his curiosity.</p> <p>For too long, she\u2019d wondered if he\u2019d found someone new. Someone permanent. And it was past time she knew. Of course, if he had, Scarlet would have to kill the bitch. Not because she still cared about Gideon\u2014she didn\u2019t, she reminded herself\u2014but because he didn\u2019t deserve such happiness.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t vengeful of her. As his scorned ex, that was simply her right.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks for staying put,\u201d he said with a relieved sigh.</p><p>Thanks, he was saying. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome.\u201d Fuck you, she was saying.</p><p>Eyes narrowing, and making him look as if he wanted to stomp his foot in vexation like a child, he traced his tongue over his teeth. Score one for Scarlet. \u201cHow is it possible that we didn\u2019t marry, yet my friends know everything about it?\u201d</p><p>How had they married without anyone knowing? Easy. \u201cWe married in secret, dumbass.\u201d</p><p>This time, he didn\u2019t react to her taunt. \u201cWas I not ashamed of you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she could slap him for that. Of course he thought he\u2019d been ashamed of her rather than the other way around. She\u2019d been the prisoner, after all, and he the free man. Not that he remembered even that slight detail, but clearly he still thought very highly of himself.</p> <p>Bastard was too kind a word for him.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t ashamed of me, but you would have been killed if you\u2019d been caught associating with me,\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>He nodded, as if he now understood she was a Titan who had been locked in Tartarus by the Greeks, rather than an actual criminal. As if he now understood that those Greeks, the very ones who had created him, would have punished him in the worst possible way for \u201cdating\u201d one of their reviled enemies.</p><p>\u201cSo. If we haven\u2019t been married all this time, what name have you not been using?\u201d</p><p>Uh, what? He\u2019d already forgotten her damned name when she\u2019d told him the first time he\u2019d visited her in the dungeon? Only a few weeks had passed since then. \u201cMy name is Scarlet.\u201d You ass! \u201cBut I already told you that.\u201d Ass, ass, ass. Her hands fisted the cotton beneath her.</p><p>He waved in dismissal. \u201cDidn\u2019t know that already. What I don\u2019t want to know now is your last name.\u201d</p><p>That failed to calm her. Her grip tightened, and her eyes narrowed to tiny slits. Clearly, this was part of his excavation for information, not intimate curiosity, and he considered her dumb enough to fall for it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if she was a god or one of their servants. As a god, she wouldn\u2019t have a last name. As a servant, she would, for last names lowered status, as if you couldn\u2019t be distinguished by your first name alone. Like a human. Gideon was doing the process of elimination thing. Not that it would do him any good, for she was neither god nor servant. Nor human, for that matter. She was something in between them all.</p><p>\u201cMy last name changes pretty much every time I watch a movie and find new man candy,\u201d she said in a sugar-sweet tone that matched her earlier grin.</p><p>Now he popped his jaw, lip ring glistening in the lavender light. Irritated by that, was he? Didn\u2019t like the thought of his supposed wife eating up other men with her eyes, huh?</p><p>\u201cMan candy? Like something you\u2019d buy from a bakery?\u201d His tone was sneering, intent on shaming her.</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d And he clearly didn\u2019t think so, either, because he hadn\u2019t passed out from his words. He was irritated, then. Good. Finally. True satisfaction. Score two. \u201cYou know. Man candy. Men to lust after, men you want to lick, men you want to suck on and take a bite out of. Well, not you, but me.\u201d No way did she want Gideon thinking she\u2019d pined for him all these years. That she\u2019d lain awake, wishing for him, desperate for him.</p><p>No matter how true that was.</p><p>Those eyes narrowed farther, his lashes fusing together and obscuring the bright blue of his irises. \u201cYou\u2019re not a Lord. Not like me. You shouldn\u2019t call yourself Scarlet Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call yourself Gideon Lord?\u201d she asked. She hadn\u2019t known that. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cWell, then, I will never call myself Scarlet Lord.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t travel down that road with him again. She would not proclaim to this world and the heavens that she belonged to him.</p><p>If she shared anything with this man, it would be the tip of her dagger. Right through his black, forgetting, abandoning heart.</p><p>He bared his pearly whites in a fearsome scowl. \u201cI\u2019m not warning you to tread carefully. I\u2019m not dangerous when I\u2019m riled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one. But...wait for it...go fuck yourself.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the anger drained right out of him and his lips quirked into the semblance of a smile. \u201cNo spirit. I can\u2019t see why I would have chosen you.\u201d</p><p>Do. Not. Soften.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know who you\u2019ve named yourself after.\u201d He straightened from the door frame, though his arms remained crossed over his chest. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Casually asked, with that hint of amusement, yet there was now a sharp gleam in his eyes, as if he would close the distance between them, if necessary, and shake the answer out of her.</p><p>If he touched her, if those strong fingers closed around her arms... No, no, no. She couldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>She shrugged as if the information didn\u2019t matter. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been calling myself Scarlet Pattinson for several weeks. Have you seen Robert Pattinson? Hottest. Man. Ever. And no, I don\u2019t care if that makes me a cougar. He sings with the voice of an angel. Gods, I love when a man sings to me. You never did because your voice is terrible.\u201d She shuddered in distaste. \u201cI swear, it\u2019s like a demon running its claws over brimstone.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were digging into his biceps so savagely, bruises were already branching from under them. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re not going to tell me who you were before that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d dropped the \u201cplease.\u201d Excellent. She was getting to him again. But how far could she push him on this point? How much could his stupid male pride take before he did stomp over to her? Before he did shake her? And not for answers, but for an apology.</p><p>Once, she\u2019d known the answer to those questions. He would never touch her in anger. But he wasn\u2019t the same tender man she\u2019d fallen in love with. A man who had shown her that first taste of kindness. He couldn\u2019t be. She and all the other prisoners had heard stories about the Lords of the Underworld and their exploits. The innocents they\u2019d killed, the cities they\u2019d destroyed.</p><p>Besides, she knew what her own demon had done to her upon their pairing. The darkness, the terror, the absolute loss of control. She\u2019d been consumed, no longer human in any way. And that had lasted for centuries, she\u2019d been told, though there were gaps in her memory, the time seeming to have passed in a matter of days. Still. She was no longer the same person, either.</p><p>\u201cI was Pitt for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cThen Gosling. Then Jackman. Then Reynolds. I always go back to Reynolds. He\u2019s my fave. That blond hair, those muscles...\u201d She shivered. \u201cLet\u2019s see, who else? Oh. I\u2019ve been Bana, Pine, Efron and DiCaprio, as well. DiCaprio is another fave. And another blond, for that matter. Maybe I have a thing for blonds.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully the barb cut its mark. Gideon had black hair underneath all that blue.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I\u2019m not into girls,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut Jessica Biel could change my mind. Have you seen her lips? So yes, I\u2019ve even been Scarlet Biel.\u201d</p><p>Gideon did that jaw-popping thing again. And if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, the anger had returned full force, burning away the last vestiges of amusement. \u201cSo very few pieces of candy,\u201d he remarked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Apparently, she could push him pretty far. How had she thought him merely angry before? That was suppressed rage she was hearing in his voice...as well as deep thrums of arousal.</p><p>The latter was a sound she\u2019d once known well and never thought to hear again.</p><p>Do not smile. \u201cI like variety, what can I say? Maybe one day it\u2019ll even be my mission to bag and tag each and every one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Steam practically curled from his nostrils. Yep, rage. He straightened, stepped forward, stopped himself, and retreated back into the doorway. \u201cWe aren\u2019t done with that topic for now,\u201d he snapped. He turned as if to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She wasn\u2019t ready to end the exchange. Not yet. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked, shifting the focus off herself. Careful. \u201cAny girlfriends I should know about? Or better yet, another wife? If so, I\u2019ll have to have you incarcerated for polygamy.\u201d There. No way he could guess at her desperation. At her clawing need to know.</p><p>Slowly he spun back around. \u201cYes,\u201d he said through clenched teeth, the word barely scraping its way free. Meaning no, he had none. \u201cI have a girlfriend, and I\u2019m married to someone else.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet released a searing breath she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d been holding. Gideon was single. A male whore who tapped any ass he could get his hands on, yes, but he was still unattached. She began shaking. Not in relief, she was sure, but in disappointment that she wouldn\u2019t get to murder someone he loved right in front of him.</p><p>So...we\u2019re done here.</p> <p>She now had the info she\u2019d wanted; she could ditch him. Except, she threw her legs over the side of the mattress and stood. Without knocking him down and running away. Idiot. \u201cI\u2019m taking a shower and you\u2019re getting me food. Don\u2019t even think about arguing or I swear to the gods I\u2019ll fill your next dreams with countless spiders.\u201d At least, she thought she would.</p><p>For some reason, Nightmares didn\u2019t like to torment him. She\u2019d had to beg to get the demon to do so the first and only time, and the stupid beast had protested and whined every single moment. That had never happened before. Her demon was an equal opportunity tormentor.</p><p>Why did Nightmares like him? Him, of all people. Her demon didn\u2019t even know him, since she\u2019d become possessed after Gideon had abandoned her. But her demon had endured her constant complaints about him, so she would have placed good money on Nightmares wishing Gideon was dead, just so Scarlet\u2019s complaining would stop.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhy are you just standing there? Get moving.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s lips did that adorable twitching thing again. Trying not to grin? Odd man. Anyone else would have stomped away in irritation. Or threatened to stab her for such a haughty, commanding tone.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you desire, my sweet.\u201d</p> <p>Which meant he\u2019d be doing nothing. She\u2019d figured. He\u2019d always been stubborn and had never taken orders well, and that was something she used to like about him. Still. She couldn\u2019t leave him feeling satisfied with the conversation.</p><p>Satisfaction belonged only to her.</p><p>Which meant it was time to throw him for another loop.</p><p>As she strolled to the bathroom, stripping along the way, she said over her shoulder, \u201cOh, and, Gid. I\u2019ve been lying to you all along. We were never married.\u201d</p><p>DAMN IT, damn it, damn it! Gideon still couldn\u2019t detect when Scarlet lied, and that was really starting to annoy him. For some reason, every word out of her lovely lips still caressed his ears, and worse, that audible stroke was spreading to his entire body. How?</p><p>Fact: truth usually made his demon hiss. Fact: lies usually made the demon purr. With Scarlet Pattinson\u2014he nearly punched a hole in the wall of the hotel room as Strider had done at the fortress as his annoyance escalated\u2014it picked up only on her raspy voice, too lost in pleasure to care about truth or lie.He was going to have to stop that. Otherwise, he might never get his answers.</p><p>Leave her, Lies demanded.</p><p>Go get her? Hardly. I like my balls where they are, thanks. The kind of woman who would punch you for trying to kiss her awake would knee your testicles into your throat for peeking at her naked curves while she washed.</p> <p>Naked...curves... Hello, hard-on.</p><p>The bathroom door clicked shut, blocking every last inch of her from his sight. Bad, uh, good thing, too. She\u2019d been down to her bra and panties. Black, both of them. With lace. The bra had clasped in the front, just asking to be separated. That testicle ascension might be worth it, he thought, already striding forward.</p><p>His mouth watered, a lick of flame dancing over his body, heating his blood to scalding. Somehow, he stopped himself before hitting the door. Show some restraint, for gods\u2019 sake. It was just, holy hell, she was beautiful. Like a portrait come to life, all pale, rose-dusted skin and a fall of silky black hair. All dangerous curves and lean muscle, two things that didn\u2019t normally go well together. On her, however, they did. And exquisitely so.</p><p>Exquisite. The perfect word for her back and its tattooed canvas. Around her waist were the words TO PART IS TO DIE, and around the words were flowers. Lots and lots of flowers. Flowers of every color, shape and type, and he wanted to trace each of them with his tongue. Below the blooms, on her thighs, was a butterfly tattoo laced with all the jewel tones of a rainbow, glitter-bright and caught midflight, as if heading into those flowers. Ex-qui-site.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what had caught the bulk of his attention, though. TO PART IS TO DIE. He\u2019d had those very words and the flowers surrounding them tattooed around his own waist. Why had he done something so girly? That\u2019s what all his friends had wanted to know after laughing their asses off at his expense. He\u2019d told them he\u2019d wanted to prove that nothing could lessen his appeal.</p><p>The truth was he\u2019d done it because he\u2019d seen those words and flowers in his mind, over and over again. They\u2019d plagued him, and he\u2019d known, known they meant something, but not what they meant. Now he knew he\u2019d seen them on this woman. Which meant whether they were married or not, they had spent time together.</p><p>Why can\u2019t I fucking remember it?</p><p>I know, Lies replied, as if he\u2019d asked the demon.</p><p>Shut up. I like you better when you\u2019re quiet.</p><p>The sound of water hitting porcelain suddenly reverberated through the hotel room. Scarlet was probably naked now, he thought. Probably soaked in that water and moaning as it slid down her luscious body.</p><p>He moaned, scrubbing a hand down his face and hoping to wipe away the naughty images flashing through his head. Didn\u2019t help. He closed the rest of the distance, arm extending for the knob. Goodbye, testicles. We had a good run.</p><p>Just as before, he caught himself in time. He growled, backed away and planted his feet more firmly in place. No, no, and no.</p><p>At least he didn\u2019t have to worry about her escaping. Not successfully. While she\u2019d slept, he\u2019d placed tiny sensors on all the doors and windows and wired them to his phone. He\u2019d know the moment she tried to leave. And she would. Soon. She wouldn\u2019t be able to help herself. Fighting was clearly part of her nature.</p><p>So was annoying him.</p><p>How was he supposed to handle a woman who picked her last name based on who she was currently lusting after? Which was fine when she was lusting after other females. Sexy, even. Something to be encouraged, too. But the males? Hells. No. Not if there was a chance they were hitched, and not until they had things settled between them.</p><p>Still. He knew how he wanted to handle her. Skin-to-skin. Every part of him longed to step into that shower, lick her all over, tasting her. Then, oh, yes, then, he\u2019d sink deep inside her, feel her tug his hair and scratch his back. Feel her legs wrap around him and hold on tight. Hear her gasp his name and beg him for more.</p><p>Mini Me, his most beloved appendage, started weeping, and the twins begging, uncaring about potential loss.</p><p>Not gonna happen, men. Not yet, at least. She\u2019d resisted him more intensely than he\u2019d expected. Not that he\u2019d tried very hard. Hard. Ha. But maybe that was a good thing. As Strider had reminded him, Hunters were in Budapest and out for blood. Now that they could kill the Lords and pair the demons with people of their choosing, now that the Lords were close to victory, the Hunters were more determined and vicious than ever. If Gideon seduced Scarlet, he would forget about guarding her.</p><p>He could have taken her to another city, he supposed, and seduced her there. That would have been safer. But, no. He couldn\u2019t leave his friends like that. They needed him more than ever. Maddox was consumed with easing his pregnant wife; Lucien\u2019s girlfriend was planning their wedding; Sabin\u2019s wife was visiting her sister in the heavens, so the warlord was pretty much operating on a hair-trigger of emotion; and Reyes\u2019s woman had enough shit to deal with. As the All-Seeing Eye, she could peer into heaven and hell, and the things she saw were often far worse than anything Scarlet could manufacture in her dream-world.</p><p>Not to mention, Aeron, until recently the keeper of Wrath, was still recovering from his interlude with death. For the first time in centuries, his mind was his own, his demon no longer a part of him. As expected, he hadn\u2019t yet acclimated to the change.</p><p>Gideon wasn\u2019t envious as some of the warriors were. He actually liked his other, darker half. Together, they were more powerful. Together, they were stronger, smarter, and no one but Scarlet could lie to him. Okay, fine. A few others could, but only when he let his emotions get the better of him. Which wasn\u2019t often.</p><p>But speaking of being unable to tell truth from lies...I\u2019ve been lying to you all along. We were never married, Scarlet had said.</p><p>Damn her and her seductive wiles. Were they or weren\u2019t they? He had those flashes of her, yes, as if he had taken her to bed before. As if he had savored every inch of her and had already done all the things he now wanted to do. But those could very well be urges he\u2019d had, mere fantasies, rather than reality.</p><p>Gideon sighed and strode to the bed where Scarlet had lain. He lifted the sheets and pressed the still-warm cotton to his cheek, the scent of midnight orchids wafting to his nose. Had he experienced this warmth skin-to-skin? Did he know that scent? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scowling, he dropped the sheet as his cock wept a little more. Get out of here before you forget your good intentions and storm into that bathroom.</p><p>His demon liked the thought of storming. Don\u2019t enter the bathroom. Don\u2019t enter the bathroom right now!</p><p>Seriously. Shut it. Even though Gideon had told Scarlet in his roundabout, deceitful way that he wouldn\u2019t be fetching her any food, which he\u2019d meant at the time, he left and locked the room, rode the elevator downstairs, wrote out what food he wanted, then handed the receptionist the note.</p> <p>Lies prowled angrily through his head the entire time, hating the distance from Scarlet. Completely surreal.</p><p>The receptionist smiled and began typing. \u201cGive us an hour, Mr. Lord.\u201d He almost corrected her and said Pattinson. Anything to connect him to Scarlet. Instead he nodded and returned to the room. Scarlet was hungry. Therefore he would feed her. Wife or not. Because bottom line, he still had questions for her and she still had answers.</p><p>How he proceeded after this, as caveman or seducer, would be up to her.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>HAD SHE EVER felt this fantastically clean? Scarlet marveled as she brushed her hair.</p> <p>Gods, this was nice. Not a speck of dirt marred her. She now smelled of the same apples-and-vanilla fragrance that coated the air, along with the usual floral scent that coated her skin. Courtesy of her father? She\u2019d always wondered.Her sore muscles felt revived, her spirits restored. Well, kind of. Why was she still here? Why wasn\u2019t she running, as she\u2019d promised Gideon she would?</p><p>Nightmares didn\u2019t reply, the water having lulled the demon into a peaceful sleep.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. She already knew the answer. Gideon still intrigued her.</p><p>How many times do you need to be told? You can\u2019t let yourself develop feelings for him again.</p><p>Easy to think. Hard to actually prevent. Gideon had seen to everything. He\u2019d placed a toothbrush, toothpaste and hairbrush on the sink. Oh, yeah. And a freaking blue bow for her hair. Clean clothes had rested on the toilet lid, though they weren\u2019t what she would have chosen for herself. He\u2019d picked a flowing, barely there blue dress rather than pants and a T-shirt. High heels rather than boots. He hadn\u2019t given her a bra. Just blue panties.</p><p>Clearly, he had a fascination with blue. Why?</p> <p>She should know, and hated that she didn\u2019t. Was this a recent development?</p><p>Wasn\u2019t like it mattered, she told herself next. His thoughts and reasoning weren\u2019t her concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy waiting for you,\u201d he called through the door.</p><p>The sound of that rumbling voice caused goose bumps to break out over her entire body. She imagined him pacing back and forth in front of the door, and she wanted to grin. Patience had never been his thing. She\u2019d always liked that, mostly because he\u2019d been so eager to be with her.</p><p>He used to rush to her cell after every mission, kiss her face, hands roving, desperate to relearn her curves.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d he\u2019d said. Every damn time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me again.\u201d Always her reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stay in this cell with you if I could.\u201d A fleeting, sad smile, offered the very last time they\u2019d had this exchange. \u201cMaybe one day I will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She hadn\u2019t wanted that for him, no matter how much she craved being with him. \u201cJust...make me forget you were ever gone.\u201d</p><p>And he had. Oh, had he.</p><p>If he could have removed the collar that had been permanently anchored around her neck, he\u2019d always said, he would have done so and run away with her. But he hadn\u2019t possessed the ability. Only a few of Zeus\u2019s chosen had. So the golden collar had remained, seemingly glued to her skin and keeping her weakened, her demon\u2019s powers muted.</p><p>Besides, only a select group of immortals were able to flash\u2014to travel from one location to another with only a thought\u2014in and out of Tartarus, and Gideon hadn\u2019t been one of them. He would have had to sneak her through the entire realm, past the guards and to the gate. One, on its own, would have been difficult; together, they were impossible, even without the collar. But he\u2019d still wanted to try.</p><p>With the thought, she felt herself softening. Damn it! Fight it. You can\u2019t survive another heartbreak, and that\u2019s all he has to offer. Heartbreak.</p><p>She dropped the brush on the sink and as it clattered ominously, tugged the dress over her head. The soft material stroked her skin, and she moaned. She\u2019d never dressed herself this way, but maybe she should have. So decadent... The panties were equally soft, which elicited another moan. The heels, she left alone, donning her old boots instead. Better to beat a heartless man into submission with.</p><p>Finished, she turned, shoulders squaring, determination rising. One last encounter with Gideon, and then she was ditching him. But that was it, the end. She\u2019d finally have closure. For surely that\u2019s what she needed, what she lacked. Once she had it, she would return to the life she\u2019d begun building for herself. A life as a human mercenary. Or rather, a jack of all wicked trades.</p><p>Do it. Get it over with.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me with this?\u201d she said as she stomped from the bathroom and held out the bow. A cloud of sweetly scented steam followed her.</p><p>Immediately his electric gaze raked her, lingering on his once-favorite places. Something dark entered his eyes, and he gulped. \u201cWhat?\u201d The word was a croak. \u201cI thought it was ugly.\u201d Meaning he thought it was pretty.</p><p>And he wanted her to have pretty things. How...sweet.</p><p>Damn him!</p><p>He stood in front of a wheeled square table that hadn\u2019t been there before, arms once again crossed over his chest. To keep from throttling her?</p><p>\u201cSo you like women who dress like schoolgirls.\u201d She ignored the thundering of her heart and the heat spreading through her veins. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had such innocent fantasies,\u201d she said, then wanted to curse. She\u2019d sounded breathless. Maybe because her statement had raised a very naughty question. What did he fantasize about nowadays?</p><p>How did he like his sex? As gentle and consuming as he once had?</p><p>How did he like his women? As sweet as she\u2019d once been? Most likely.</p><p>He\u2019d shown only a few signs of attraction to her since discovering her inside his dungeon, and she was as hard as stone.</p><p>She had to be. Her life didn\u2019t allow for dresses like this one. She had to be prepared to fight, always. She was a child of Rhea, the god queen, and she would make an excellent hostage to ransom. Not that her mother would pay it. More than that, she had many enemies, for killing her would remove her half-mortal self from the line of succession.</p><p>The scent of fresh baked bread, chicken and rice suddenly hit her nose and her mouth watered. Forget the bow. Forget closure. Her hand fell to her side. \u201cYou brought me food,\u201d she said, dazed.</p><p>Another sweet gesture, the jerk.</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s all for me.\u201d He eased into the chair behind him. Steaming plate after steaming plate littered the surface of the table, that steam wafting around him and creating a dream haze. \u201cThat color looks terrible on you, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. Over the food, she told herself. Not because he liked the way she looked. Which was good. \u201cPayback is a bitch, you know. And you can count on the fact that I\u2019ll put you in this dress sometime soon.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, drawing attention to the wide girth of his shoulders, then held out one of the plates. The one with chicken, rice and veggies. She was walking to him, hands outstretched, before she realized what she was doing. After she claimed the plate, she plopped into the seat across from him and dug in.</p><p>So. Good.</p><p>\u201cSo...why don\u2019t you sleep during the day?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhen the people here aren\u2019t awake.\u201d</p><p>That, she didn\u2019t mind sharing. Even though she could guess his plan. Start her off with something light. Get her talking while she was distracted with food. \u201cSomewhere in the world, people are asleep when I am, and the demon finds them. Besides that, every day I fall asleep a single second later. And every night I awaken a single second later. The time always varies ever so slightly, ensuring we\u2019re able to target everyone at some point.\u201d In other words, fear us.</p><p>\u201cNot good to know.\u201d A pause, then, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know why you got the tattoos. I don\u2019t want to know who gave you those tattoos. And I most definitely don\u2019t want to know how things ended between us.\u201d</p><p>Yep. She\u2019d been right. \u201cI told you we weren\u2019t really married.\u201d She chased a deliciously flavored bite of buttered carrots with a glass of red wine. Even. Better.</p><p>\u201cAnd I believed you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, mimicking his nonchalance. \u201cI\u2019ve answered enough of your questions tonight. And I know that\u2019s why you brought me here. To relax me, lower my guard and find out everything you\u2019re dying to know so you can lock me back up.\u201d And worse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said, reaching out and cupping her hand with his own. He brought it to his lips and pressed a soft kiss into her suddenly burning flesh. \u201cI just wanted to spend time with you, to get to know you, the world around us forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Softening...again... They were words she\u2019d longed to hear so badly she\u2019d often ached physically. Hearing them now...</p><p>And realizing they were a lie...</p><p>The softening instantly ceased. Suddenly she wanted to remove the invisible knife he\u2019d left in her back and stab him with it. Since he wasn\u2019t crumpling into a heap of pain, as she\u2019d heard he did when he spoke the truth, she knew he\u2019d just told a whopper.</p><p>He was playing her, and she\u2019d almost let him. Harden up. You\u2019re a bitch. Act like it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you, isn\u2019t it? Forgetting the world around you, I mean.\u201d Bitterness crept through her tone, and there was nothing she could do to defuse it. \u201cYour poor, sad memory.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and his hand fell away.</p><p>She wanted to shout. With frustration. With a demand that he touch her again. With fury that she wanted him to touch her again. Instead, she remained quiet and finished her meal, consuming every last crumb, every drop of wine, and leaving nothing for the man across from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you so...not stubborn about this?\u201d he asked with what seemed to be genuine curiosity. \u201cAbout keeping me in the light?\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d spent thousands of years wondering where he was, what he was doing and who he was doing it with. Wondering if he ever thought of her, wondering why he never returned for her. Wondering if he was even alive. Each day had been worse than the last, a constant churning in her mind, her emotions rolled out, flayed and left raw.</p><p>But she\u2019d known with gut-wrenching intensity that he loved her, so she\u2019d finally had to accept that he hadn\u2019t returned because he\u2019d been killed. Death was the only thing that could have kept him away. So she\u2019d mourned him, crying so forcefully, so intensely, she\u2019d actually shed tears of blood.</p> <p>And when she\u2019d finally discovered that he lived...Oh, the pain. Pain that still haunted her, a constant shadow in her heart.</p><p>In contrast, he\u2019d been wondering about her for a few weeks. He didn\u2019t cry himself to sleep about it. He didn\u2019t throw up because the worry and the heartache were too much to bear.</p><p>Her hands clenched so tightly, the glass she held shattered. Beads of crimson sprang up all over her palm, but she didn\u2019t flinch at the ensuing sting. This was nothing compared to what she\u2019d once endured. Nothing. She no longer cried about anything.</p><p>Gideon sighed and wrapped his fingers around her wrist, inspecting the damage. \u201cLove to see you injured. Don\u2019t want to make it all better.\u201d Truth.</p><p>When he had strode into his fortress\u2019s dungeon and she\u2019d seen his beautiful face, the only thing she\u2019d truly felt at the time was awe. He was alive. He was with her again. But then the anger had sparked. Followed by the resentment and the consuming urge to hurt. None of those compared to what she felt just then, however.</p> <p>Rage. So much rage.</p><p>How dare he. How fucking dare he care about such paltry wounds! He was sitting there, calm as could be, poking at her emotions like a child with a stick because he could. Because she was a big, fat question to him. That was all. He wanted answers. Not her. Not her forgiveness. He couldn\u2019t care less about easing her real injuries and making her \u201call better.\u201d</p><p>Had she been nothing to him, even all those centuries ago? Yes, he\u2019d wed her, but he\u2019d left her soon after. Left her, she now knew, to steal and open Pandora\u2019s box. She also knew he\u2019d been paired with his demon and shoved out of the heavens soon after that. But she\u2019d been possessed that same day, still locked inside her cell.</p><p>After those centuries spent in darkness\u2014what oddly seemed like a mere blink of time for her whenever she looked back\u2014had passed and she\u2019d once again had control of her mind, she\u2019d remembered Gideon. Realized he\u2019d been given a demon, too, and figured he had gained control of himself, as well. So she\u2019d waited for him to return for her. And waited. And waited, for so damn long. Then all those questions began swirling in her head. And then the worry had set in, followed by the grief that he hadn\u2019t survived.</p><p>And in that grief, she\u2019d done things that had shocked even her demon. Terrible things. None of the gods and goddesses sharing her cell\u2014the one she\u2019d been moved to, away from the tender hand of her mother\u2014had survived her rampage.</p><p>The Greeks had nearly executed her for those actions, but in the end, Zeus had preferred to parade her in front of Cronus, his own father and greatest foe, enjoying the fact that she was proof Rhea had cuckolded him. Anything that tormented the deposed Titan king was worth keeping alive, the Greek sovereign had said, no matter how dangerous that thing was.</p> <p>And then the Titans finally won their freedom. Cronus and Rhea would have liked to leave her behind, she knew, but they\u2019d needed her skills to help defeat the Greeks.</p><p>Once the screams had faded and the blood had stopped flowing, she\u2019d scoured ancient scrolls for information about the Lords of the Underworld, hoping to find them and ask how Gideon had perished. Where his bones rested. She\u2019d intended to give him a proper burial, pray over him, say goodbye.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d discovered her husband was still alive.</p><p>Her relief had known no bounds. But then, neither had her upset, for that\u2019s when other questions had begun plaguing her. Why hadn\u2019t he come back for her? Why hadn\u2019t he sent word that he\u2019d survived?</p><p>She\u2019d sought him out to ask him. And yes, to throw herself back into his arms. To feel him surrounding her, sliding in and out of her, once again. Finally. The way she\u2019d been dreaming about for so many years.</p><p>She\u2019d found him in that bar in Buda. She\u2019d walked past him. Except, he hadn\u2019t noticed her. Glanced at her, yes. Moved his gaze away as if she were of no consequence, yes, that, too. He\u2019d been too busy crooking his finger at a human female, and then having sex with that female right there in the club.</p><p>Scarlet had left, heartbroken all over again. As she did her best to learn about modern human society by watching TV, all the while secretly hoping Gideon would find her worthy when she did so\u2014her, a woman who had been raised among criminals, who had never been wanted by her mother, had never known her father, and who had a wretched demon trapped inside her\u2014she\u2019d kept her ear to the ground, always curious about Gideon and what he was doing.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d purposely allowed the Lords to capture her. Without consciously admitting that she craved a moment like this. A moment to see what a shit Gideon truly was. A moment to finally, blessedly cut him from her thoughts. Which, even now, was completely against her nature and something she\u2019d sworn never to do. Captivity was something she despised. Yet she\u2019d stayed in that fucking dungeon and hadn\u2019t tried to escape. For this man who didn\u2019t remember her. A man who had no problem using her. Hurting her. Tearing her down.</p> <p>He. Needed. To. Suffer.</p><p>Scarlet jumped to her feet, plate in hand. A plate she tossed at Gideon without warning. It crashed into his face and shattered just as her wineglass had done. And just as her hand had beaded with blood, so did his face. Not enough.</p><p>Scowling, he jumped up, as well. \u201cThat was nice. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already launched another plate, and this one slammed into his chest. It, too, broke apart, slicing past his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kicking your ass. I\u2019m not hating your guts. I\u2019m not thinking you are the biggest ass the gods ever created. How\u2019s that? Did I speak a language you can understand?\u201d Kill him. She wanted to kill him.</p><p>\u201cI may remember you, Scarlet,\u201d he bellowed, backing up when she grabbed her fork and held it out like a dagger. She\u2019d murdered men with less. Even immortals. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t haunted me.\u201d Motions stiff, he raised his shirt. Amid the cuts, above his heart, was a tattoo of eyes. Dark eyes. Like hers. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? You...haven\u2019t...haunted...me.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie, like him. It had to be.</p><p>\u201cThat proves nothing! Thousands of people have dark eyes.\u201d</p><p>He slanted his head and brushed the hair from the back of his neck. There, she found a tattoo of bloodred lips in the shape of a heart. Like hers. Then he turned and raised his shirt again. On his lower back were flowers, all kinds of flowers, and the words TO PART IS TO DIE.</p><p>It was an exact replica of her own tattoo. He\u2019d shown it to her once before, the first time he\u2019d entered the dungeon, but seeing it again was still like being punched in the chest.</p><p>\u201cI just want to make no sense of this,\u201d he added softly. He pivoted, facing her once again. \u201cDon\u2019t help me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Seeing those tattoos didn\u2019t lessen her fury. No, seeing them increased it. He\u2019d imagined her, but he\u2019d still slept with all those other women. He\u2019d still continued on with his life, not seeking out the source of those images.</p><p>\u201cYou think that makes everything better, you uncaring bastard? While you were down here whoring around, loving life, I was in Tartarus, a slave to the Greeks.\u201d One step, two, she eased around the table and approached him. Warrior that he was, he remained in place. \u201cWhat they wanted me to do, I had to do. Whether I wanted to or not.\u201d Parading around naked for their enjoyment. Fighting with other prisoners while they bet on the winner. Scrubbing other people\u2019s filth on her hands and knees. \u201cYet you left me there. You never came for me. You promised you\u2019d come for me!\u201d</p><p>Seething, panting, she stabbed the fork into his chest and twisted with all her strength.</p><p>Surprisingly, he didn\u2019t try to stop her. Didn\u2019t try to defend himself. Rather, he stood there, his eyes narrowing. In his own fury? And if it was in fury, who was he pissed at? Her? Or the Greek gods who had forced her to do those vile things?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. This was just the beginning of his punishment.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know what else?\u201d Her fingers clutched the fork so tightly, her knuckles screamed in protest. \u201cAfter I came here and saw you with another woman, I gave myself to another man. Willingly this time. And then another.\u201d Lies, all lies. She\u2019d tried. She\u2019d wanted to hurt him that way, but she hadn\u2019t been able to follow through.</p><p>And oh, how she hated herself for that failure. More than wanting to hurt him, though, she\u2019d needed someone to make her feel as he once had. Protected, loved, cherished. Like a treasure. That, too, had failed miserably. She\u2019d walked away from both encounters feeling hollow and sad.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s shoulders slumped, and all that dark emotion seemed to drain from him. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. I love that you felt the need to do such a thing. I don\u2019t want to kill the men you were with. Even though I remember everything about our time together. You still somehow do not affect me.\u201d</p><p>He was sorry, he loathed that she\u2019d done such a thing and wanted to destroy the men. Pretty words. For him. But she was having none of it. He was far too late. With a snarl, she jerked the fork out of his chest, the prongs dripping crimson, then stabbed him anew and twisted. He grunted.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d she snarled, \u201cdo you think that makes everything better? You think the fact that you\u2019ve forgotten me makes your actions any less painful?\u201d Shut up, shut up, shut up. She didn\u2019t want him to know how much he\u2019d damaged her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He frowned. Then he reached into his jeans pocket and withdrew his phone. His gaze quickly scanned the screen, and when their eyes next met, there was smoldering rage in those electric depths. \u201cWe don\u2019t have visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends of yours?\u201d She didn\u2019t ask how he knew. She could guess, loving modern technology as she did.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I adore Hunters.\u201d</p> <p>She could have struck him again, quickly jabbing both of his eyes, leaving him to deal with the uninvited guests injured and blinded. But he was hers to hurt, not theirs.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d she demanded, removing the utensil and switching the focus of her rage. Wake up, Nightmares. Your skills might be needed.</p><p>The demon stretched and yawned inside her head.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>So he was as clueless as she on that score. \u201cWhich door did they enter?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot the front.\u201d</p><p>She performed a quick inspection. There was a doorway that led out of the bedroom-slash-kitchenette into a vestibule. That vestibule branched into three hallways. No matter which direction the intruders came from, they\u2019d have to enter it. Perfect.</p><p>You ready, baby? Because Mama was wrong. No maybe about it. You\u2019re needed.</p><p>A purr of anticipation rumbled through her. Gonna be fun.</p><p>I\u2019ll handle the final blow. Okay?</p><p>Greedy.</p> <p>Yes. But then, she needed some outlet for the growing darkness inside her. And leave Gideon alone. I don\u2019t want him to see the things you show his enemies.</p><p>That earned her a growl. I would never hurt him.</p><p>It was a declaration she\u2019d never thought to hear, even with the creature\u2019s reluctance to scare the warrior in his dreams. Had the circumstances been different, she would have demanded to know why. Not that it would have done her any good. Nightmares was as generous with answers as she was.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed,\u201d she commanded Gideon. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d he said, unsheathing a sharp, gleaming knife and a small revolver from the waist of his pants. He\u2019d been armed this entire time, yet he hadn\u2019t defended himself against her. \u201cI relish the thought of you battling such sweethearts alone.\u201d</p><p>Macho men. They considered women a liability in situations like this. But this one would soon learn. She wasn\u2019t the same girl he\u2019d known in prison. Or rather, the same girl he couldn\u2019t recall.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here. I know they\u2019re here,\u201d someone whispered. A whisper, yes, but her ears registered every word as if the person were right beside her. A skill she\u2019d developed in prison. A skill that had saved her life on countless occasions.</p><p>\u201cIf we take him the girl, they\u2019ll have to let us in,\u201d another said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the guy?\u201d Yet another.</p><p>\u201cDies.\u201d</p><p>As Nightmares laughed, more than ready to begin, Scarlet shoved Gideon back into his chair. He landed with a huff as she lowered her internal guard and unleashed her demon. Darkness exploded from her, thousands of terrified screams threading through the impenetrable thickness. Even Gideon, powerful immortal that he was, wouldn\u2019t be able to see through it. She, however, would have no trouble drinking in every sparkling detail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d cover your ears, if I were you,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cScar,\u201d he began, as close to her name as his demon would apparently let him get, a hint of anger in the undertone. And oh, was his expression stony. He hated this. But whatever he meant to say was cut off as Scarlet pressed a finger against his lips, a silent command for no talkie-talkie. The enemy would hear.</p><p>A moment passed. The stiffness never left him, but Gideon nodded. He was graciously bowing out of the fight and letting her handle things. His surrender was completely unexpected. Why hadn\u2019t he jumped to his feet and foolishly demanded to help her?</p><p>Ponder it later. Frowning, she turned to face the intruders. There were four of them, all male, and all holding weapons.</p><p>Only four? They must think themselves stronger than they actually were. Or consider her and Gideon weaker than they really were. Or perhaps this was just the beginning. Most likely others were posted throughout the hotel, watching, waiting for the right time to strike.</p><p>As the men entered the bedroom, they encountered the darkness and the screams and stumbled to a halt, trying to orient themselves and figure out what was going on. But it was too late for that. Nightmares wove around them, a swirling, dark dancer, as graceful as he was lethal, holding them in place, even floating to their ears and whispering their deepest fears.</p><p>Pain.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Soon they were clutching their heads, moaning, images of the Lords of the Underworld strapping them down, torturing them as the Hunters had often tortured others, becoming all that they could see.</p><p>One of Nightmares\u2019s talents was sensing hidden fears and exploiting them. That\u2019s how they\u2019d known about Gideon\u2019s fear of spiders. Only problem was, they had no way of knowing what had caused those fears. And she was beyond curious about Gideon. He hadn\u2019t seemed to care about the bug while with her in Tartarus. He\u2019d even flicked the creatures off her when they\u2019d invaded her cell.</p><p>\u201cMake it stop, please make it stop,\u201d someone pleaded.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d someone else shouted.</p><p>No. Not nearly enough. Cold, uncaring. That\u2019s how she had to be. And really, she enjoyed this as much as her demon did. Enjoyed hurting those who thrived on suffering. For too long, she\u2019d been a victim herself. But no longer. Never again.</p><p>Smiling, she strolled toward the men, fork still in hand. She reached the nearest, his terrified moans like candy to her ears, and brushed his hair from his face. The soothing touch startled him, yet he leaned into it, as if seeking comfort anywhere he could find it. As if he assumed she was a friend.</p><p>Without any more warning, she jammed the fork into his jugular. He screamed, but that scream blended with all the others floating from her. A chilling but welcome music. Warm blood spurted from him, coating her hand as he collapsed. She eased to the next man, gifted him with that same gentle touch, the calm before the storm, then stabbed him, as well.</p><p>More blood sprayed, a river of the deepest scarlet, the very essence of her name.</p><p>She finished off the other two just as quickly and efficiently. Just as ruthlessly. Perhaps she should have played with them a bit. Oh, well. Next time.</p><p>Once the moans and movement ceased, she closed her eyes and tugged the shadows and screams back inside her. There they whirled like a tornado until she blocked them from her awareness, something she\u2019d learned to do over the years. Otherwise, she would have tumbled into insanity a long time ago.</p><p>Perhaps it was a blessing that she and Gideon would never be intimate again, she thought then. When she lost control of her body\u2019s sensations, she lost her hold on her demon, allowing the beast to have free rein even though she was awake. What she\u2019d done to those boys\u2014Hunters?\u2014would be done automatically to her lovers. Not the cutting, but the absolute dissolution of light, the cries of the damned ringing in their ears.</p><p>For a man, it was hard to stay, well, hard during something like that. Watching fear and disgust contort Gideon\u2019s features while his cock was buried deep inside her might just end her. Her pride, surely. Her will to live, maybe. Already, she existed on only an instinctual level. Breathe, eat, kill. That was it.</p><p>Mind on the task at hand. Gideon was sitting exactly as she\u2019d left him. Only, his expression was blank, a guarded mask as his gaze raked her, taking in the blood coating her hands. He traced his tongue over his teeth before looking at the men.</p><p>\u201cHarmed?\u201d he asked, still without any hint of emotion.</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Would a thank-you have been too much to ask? She\u2019d saved him from suffering a single injury. Well, besides the ones she\u2019d given him.</p><p>Blue eyes snapped back up, pinning her in place. \u201cYeah, I was talking about them. Not you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He wanted to know about her? Shocker. No softening. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Not a scratch on me. But we should probably go.\u201d Our separate ways, she silently added, ignoring the pang in her chest. \u201cI\u2019m sure more Hunters are on their way.\u201d</p><p>He offered no reply.</p><p>Do it. Leave, she commanded herself. She didn\u2019t. She remained in place like the idiot she was. Closure must not have been achieved yet. Not really.</p><p>What would it take?</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to sit there?\u201d she threw at him.</p><p>He stood, but still he didn\u2019t sheath his weapons. \u201cYou and utensils make a bad team.\u201d</p><p>Another pang speared her chest. \u201cNo more compliments, or I\u2019ll give you another firsthand demonstration.\u201d Just to taunt him, she held up the dripping fork and waved it through the air.</p><p>\u201cYes, please. Another demonstration would be nice.\u201d He bypassed her, unafraid, and crouched in front of her victims. With quick proficiency, he searched their bodies, even under their clothing. \u201cAll of them are marked.\u201d</p><p>Her arm fell heavily to her side. Hunters tattooed themselves with the symbol of infinity, their way of proclaiming they wanted a forever without evil. That these boys didn\u2019t bear the mark... Huh. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re just recruits. When they entered, one of them said something about being let in. Maybe he meant being let in to the Hunters Are Assholes club.\u201d</p><p>Gideon nodded as he stood, a lock of cobalt falling over his brow. \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m smarter than you are.\u201d She fought the urge to smooth the hair into place. Still no closure, but she forced herself to say, \u201cI guess we\u2019re done here, then.\u201d For real, this time.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He closed what little distance there was between them, putting them nose-to-nose, his heat enveloping her, his musky cologne fuzzing her senses. \u201cDon\u2019t listen carefully. I\u2019m upset you\u2019re okay.\u201d His lashes fell, oh, so slowly, before stopping, lingering, and she knew he was peering at her lips.</p><p>Thinking of kissing her?</p><p>She gulped. No. No, no, no. \u201cGideon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeep talking.\u201d Slowly, still oh, so slowly, he leaned toward her, as if he did intend to kiss her.</p><p>No. No, no...yes. Yes, yes, yes. Every muscle in her body tensed, waiting, ready. The blood inside her veins sizzled and snapped. Would he taste the same? Feel the same? She had to know. Then she could leave him. Then she would have closure and wouldn\u2019t ever have to look back and wonder.</p><p>But just before their lips touched, his fingers circled her wrist with a soft clink. No, not his fingers. Too stiff, too heavy and too cold. Frowning, she glanced down and saw that he\u2019d handcuffed them together. Understanding dawned. That...bastard...</p><p>A red haze shuttered over her vision. Not dots, but a full-on cloud. Tricked. The bastard had tricked her. Had never meant to kiss her. Had used her obvious desire for him against her.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re proud of yourself.\u201d That was all the warning she gave him. She jabbed the fork into his chest and rather than twist, she slammed her palm into the handle, pushing it deeper. This time, he couldn\u2019t contain his grimace. \u201cAnd I hope you know this will seem like child\u2019s play when I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re apart,\u201d he gritted out, \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>As long as...as long as... He needed to be together to be happy? Though part of her suddenly wanted to grin sheepishly, perhaps bat her lashes, she scowled up at him. Stupid softening heart. He\u2019d just betrayed her, and she almost melted when he tossed a few flattering words at her. Flattering words that meant nothing, because he still only wanted answers.</p><p>\u201cTell me. Does this make you happy?\u201d She kneed him in the balls.</p><p>He hunched over, gasping, but amid those gasps, she managed to make out a single word: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Good. \u201cSo where are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven.\u201d Another gritted admission.</p><p>Still. She easily translated. He planned to take her straight into hell.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>AFTER THE swelling went down in his balls, Gideon phoned Lucien, keeper of Death, asking for cleanup at the hotel, then dragged a protesting Scarlet outside, through the glass-covered atrium and along the brightly lit city streets to the Escalade he\u2019d hidden in a parking garage a few blocks away. Night was in full swing, the star-sprinkled sky framing the golden half-moon. Though he was prepared for anything, there were no other Hunters\u2014or recruits, as the case may have been\u2014waiting to attack.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how those four kids had followed him. Especially if they\u2019d had no training. He\u2019d made damn sure he\u2019d lost any tails. If there had been tails, that was. Which he would\u2019ve bet every cent of his, uh, Torin\u2019s money that there hadn\u2019t been. So either a god or goddess was watching him and reporting his whereabouts or the boys had simply gotten lucky and had happened to be at the hotel when he checked in.He didn\u2019t believe in coincidences, so the first was most likely. Cronus was helping the Lords and Rhea, the god queen, who was at war with her husband, had teamed up with the Hunters. But why would she send recruits to fight him, rather than actual Hunters? And would Gideon\u2019s location be compromised no matter where he went?</p> <p>Probably.</p><p>His hand clenched on the steering wheel as he threw the vehicle into Reverse, Scarlet\u2019s arm moving with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got your panties in such a twist?\u201d she asked conversationally.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t fooled. She was still pissed as hell at him.</p><p>Silent, he maneuvered them through the gloomy garage and back onto the city streets. Late as it was, traffic was light. His gaze kept returning to his rearview mirror, though, just in case.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re begging for another fork in your chest,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Again ignoring her, he shouted, \u201cCron!\u201d Stop. You\u2019re ticked at him. There has to be another way. But Gideon knew better, and wouldn\u2019t lie to himself. Not now of all times. \u201cI don\u2019t need you!\u201d</p><p>In the passenger seat, Scarlet stiffened. \u201cCron. As in Cronus?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>She hissed in outrage and jerked at the cuffs. \u201cWhat the hell do you want with him? I hate him!\u201d</p><p>Did she have a beef with everyone? \u201cNot answers, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can let me go and then chat with him.\u201d There was an edge creeping into her voice. One he\u2019d never heard before, even when she\u2019d stabbed him. Her struggles increased, and then she was kicking at the passenger door to pop it open. Was she...scared of the god? Couldn\u2019t be. Scarlet had faced down four potential Hunters without any hesitation.</p><p>\u201cMy reasons for...avoiding him are...not urgent.\u201d His stomach twisted. He\u2019d almost spoken the truth. Had almost told her that his reasons for summoning the god were indeed urgent. He\u2019d had to force out the lies. \u201cAnd those reasons aren\u2019t life-and-death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit!\u201d Slam, slam, boot against plastic. Crack. \u201cI don\u2019t want him here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. She was scared. Why?</p><p>Rather than ask\u2014he knew she wouldn\u2019t tell him if he did\u2014he changed the subject to give her a moment to calm down. If she kept pulling at him, he was going to lose a limb. Again. \u201cDid you have to leave those kids alive?\u201d She\u2019d killed them without any hint of mercy.</p><p>He would have done the same, sure, but he was a guy. Weren\u2019t girls supposed to be softhearted and shit? Well, besides Cameo, keeper of Misery. She could kill an enemy while filing her nails.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Scarlet\u2019s frantic bid for freedom slowed, then ceased altogether. She peeked at him over her shoulder. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? We could have pleasured them for information.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched as if she were suddenly fighting a grin. \u201cWhy, Gideon, I didn\u2019t know you swung that way. They were cute, though, weren\u2019t they? Especially the blond. Is that who you were imagining sexing up?\u201d Now that tone he recognized. Sugar-sweet and irritating as hell. But yeah, the blond had been cute from what he\u2019d been able to tell, and he hated that she\u2019d noticed. Actually, he hated that she preferred blonds. His wife should\u2014 You don\u2019t know that she\u2019s your wife. Not mine, Lies piped up. Not mine.</p><p>Meaning Lies was claiming her? Hardly. If anyone claimed her, it would be Gideon. If they were married.</p><p>And then what? he wondered. He still planned to return her to the dungeon, no matter what. Which meant she was going to hate him. As if she didn\u2019t already. As poorly as she\u2019d treated his man-parts, he suspected that she did.</p><p>His guilt returned, filling his nose, his lungs, then sweeping through his bloodstream. Has to be this way.</p><p>Yes. She\u2019s not mine.</p><p>Zip it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave them alive?\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Scarlet\u2019s seemingly delicate shoulders lifted in a negligent shrug. \u201cThey were there to hurt us. If I had let them live, they would have had the opportunity to come back for us. To poison others against us. And their determination would have been greater than ever.\u201d</p><p>What she said made sense, but it also caused his stomach to clench. The absolute conviction in her voice had given him a searing glimpse inside her psyche. One she would undoubtedly prefer he not have. Once, she\u2019d let an enemy go rather than kill him and that enemy had returned for her. Had hurt her. With others in tow.</p><p>How had the bastards hurt her? Raped her? Beat her? The steering wheel whined as it bent, nearly snapping in half, and Gideon forced himself to loosen his hold. If, after he\u2019d been kicked out of the heavens, he\u2019d gone back for her, as he once might have promised her, would such a fate have been prevented?</p><p>Gods. His guilt became a cancer, eating at him, leaving him raw and agonized. Again, he wanted to ask her for an explanation, but again, he knew she would tell him nothing. Until they reached their destination and he seduced her. Which he would do, guilty or not. Before their uninvited guests had arrived, she\u2019d looked ready to accept his kiss. Hell, she\u2019d looked ready to return it with equal passion.</p><p>He wanted that. Needed it.</p><p>\u201cNothing to say?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo lame reply?\u201d</p><p>Lame? He did the best he could, damn it. She\u2019s just frustrated, lashing out. But really, this wasn\u2019t entirely his fault, he reminded himself. Something had happened to his memories. Not that the knowledge eased his guilt.</p><p>Actually, his memories were another thing to discuss with Cronus.</p><p>\u201cCron!\u201d he found himself shouting a second time.</p><p>And just as before, Scarlet began struggling for freedom. \u201cI told you I don\u2019t want him here. I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>But the rest of her words were lost to him. One moment Gideon was at the wheel, cuffed to Scarlet and motoring down the long, winding roads, the next he was in the heavens, puffy white clouds surrounding him, Scarlet nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Trying not to panic, he spun, wild gaze searching for her. Only more of those clouds greeted him. There were no roads, no buildings and no freaking people. \u201cScar,\u201d he shouted, heart ready to burst from his ribs. He had to find her. Couldn\u2019t let her\u2014</p><p>\u201cRest easy, Lies. Time has momentarily ceased for your female. When I return you, all will be as you left it.\u201d</p><p>Another turn, and he was peering over at Cronus. His heartbeat slowed, even as he tried not to gape. The king looked younger every time Gideon saw him, but this...this... Too young, he thought with a shake of his head.</p><p>Gone was the silver hair. In its place were startling locks of honey-brown and pale gold. Gone was the wrinkled skin. Now he was unlined, his complexion smooth and sun-kissed.</p><p>A white robe that appeared as soft as the clouds draped him, and sandals wrapped around the veined, scarred feet of a warrior. He exuded so much power, Gideon felt the weight of every compelling wave hammering at his shoulders. Remaining standing required power of his own. A lot of it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you summon me?\u201d the king asked.</p><p>\u201cLastly\u2014\u201d first off \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t want your vow that all will be as you didn\u2019t say.\u201d Confusing, even to him, but important.</p><p>Like Scarlet, Cronus knew him well enough to discern what he was truly saying. Confusing or not. \u201cYou have my word. She isn\u2019t going to crash. She isn\u2019t even going to know you were gone unless you tell her.\u201d And, thankfully, Cronus wasn\u2019t upset by his demand. \u201cHappy now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A little irritated, perhaps, but not upset. Good. \u201cNo. Not happy.\u201d Every muscle in his body released its vise-grip on bone. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ve forgiven me for not telling you how to find Aeron\u2019s spirit?\u201d</p><p>No. Never. Rather than admit that to the king, however, he remained silent. Better silence than punishment. Even he was smart enough to know that. But the question explained the king\u2019s sudden patient benevolence.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I did,\u201d Cronus said, a little stiff now, \u201cI did for your own good.\u201d</p><p>Making Gideon beg and then denying him what he begged for had been for his own good? Yeah. Right.</p><p>\u201cYou are an immortal, not a god, so your understanding is limited. One day, however, you will thank me.\u201d As the words echoed between them, Cronus\u2019s nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cI cannot believe I\u2019m explaining myself to you. It\u2019s sickening, really, the way I must baby you. Where is the fearsome warrior I was told to expect?\u201d</p><p>Gideon barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes. Baby him? Ha! \u201cYou are not a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your tongue, Lies.\u201d Eyes of the darkest obsidian sharpened. How odd. Usually those eyes were the purest gold. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll lose it.\u201d</p> <p>He gave a rigid nod. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t so smart, after all.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Cronus clicked under his tongue, clearly satisfied his charge had been properly subdued. \u201cNow, I ask again. And for the final time. Why did you summon me?\u201d</p><p>To demand your wife\u2019s head on a dinner platter. No need for silver, either. Any metal will do. Not that he could say such a thing aloud. \u201cJust so you know, your wife...she\u2019s a real prize.\u201d He braced himself, expecting immediate punishment. Though he couldn\u2019t stop himself from reaching for a dagger. Instinct allowed nothing less.</p><p>\u201cIf you prize garbage,\u201d the king replied dryly, \u201cthen, yes. We agree.\u201d</p><p>A truth, even spoken in so disparaging a tone. Lies spat in distaste.</p><p>Gideon returned the dagger to its sheath. Astonishingly, he and the king were on the same page. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the thing. I don\u2019t suspect she\u2019s watching our every move. I don\u2019t suspect she\u2019s having us followed. And I don\u2019t suspect she\u2019s sending humans to kill us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve known for a while.\u201d Again truth. Cronus pinched the bridge of his nose, a man at the end of his rope\u2014without a blade. \u201cDamned female. She\u2019s always been more trouble than she\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can we encourage her?\u201d To stop, he silently added, wishing like hell he could just say what he wanted. \u201cShe\u2019s not causing all kinds of grief, and she\u2019s not going to have us murdered before we can save your ass from Gal.\u201d Or rather, his head from Galen.</p><p>Danika, Reyes\u2019s woman and the All-Seeing Eye, could do more than peer into heaven and hell. She could predict the future. She claimed Galen was going to behead Cronus. Which was the only reason Cronus was helping the Lords.</p><p>No, not true. There was another reason, one Gideon had only recently learned. Cronus was possessed by a demon. By Greed. Like Scarlet, he\u2019d been a prisoner of Tartarus and one of the lucky few chosen to host the \u201cextra.\u201d</p><p>Back and forth Cronus paced in front of him, the power he emitted intensifying, crackling the air. \u201cAfter what happened to your cohort Aeron, I had amulets made. One for each of you. When worn, they will prevent her from watching you.\u201d</p><p>Truth. And wasn\u2019t that just a little bit of awesome? \u201cDon\u2019t give me.\u201d Now, now, now.</p><p>The pacing continued without pause. \u201cOnly problem is, they will prevent all gods from watching you.\u201d</p><p>Meaning himself. Bastard had to have his fingers in everything. \u201cHere\u2019s an unworthy news flash. The cons far outweigh the pros. So, don\u2019t give me,\u201d he repeated, holding out his hand and waving his fingers.</p> <p>A portion of his impatience stemmed from a desire to be hidden from the Powers That Be. Finally. But mostly, he just wanted to return to Scarlet. He didn\u2019t like being away from her, he realized.</p><p>Still the pacing continued, even gaining speed. \u201cWait just a minute. If I do this, I\u2019ll need daily reports. And if a single day passes without someone telling me what\u2019s going on down there, I will personally raid your fortress and remove the amulets from around your necks. After I remove your heads.\u201d</p><p>Gideon didn\u2019t point out that taking their heads would free their demons, possibly sending the crazed fiends on a ferocious rampage, something even Cronus would be cursed for doing. Which was why the king had let the warriors live when he\u2019d first assumed control of the heavens. Even though he\u2019d desperately wanted to destroy them.</p><p>And it was weird, thinking of the king of kings as being curseable. But, yes, it could be done. Apparently, Cronus wasn\u2019t the most powerful god in town. That honor belonged to the mysterious being who had saved Aeron\u2019s life. The being that had long ago defeated even death. The \u201cOne True Deity,\u201d Olivia called him.</p><p>Although, there was a chance Cronus wouldn\u2019t be punished for freeing the demons from their hosts, for they now knew a new pairing could be made. That\u2019s what had happened to his friend Baden\u2019s demon, Distrust. A new pairing.</p><p>Baden was dead, and Distrust now resided inside a Hunter female. A female Gideon wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to kill, even if she had a dagger pressed to his throat. Not that he minded killing women. He\u2019d done it before. Under Sabin\u2019s leadership, it was kind of mandatory to treat females as equals. In all things, even war. What bothered him was that a part of Baden swam inside that woman\u2019s body.</p><p>How could he play a role in his good friend\u2019s second defeat?</p><p>\u201cLies! Are you listening to me? I asked if you understood.\u201d</p><p>Wait. What? Gideon pulled himself from the dark mire of his thoughts. \u201cPlease don\u2019t repeat yourself.\u201d</p><p>Red suffused the god\u2019s cheeks, and the color wasn\u2019t from embarrassment. No, it was fury that decorated his expression. \u201cI will not repeat myself. You will either give me the daily reports I demanded, or you will not receive those amulets. Do you\u2014\u201d black eyes blazed \u201c\u2014understand?\u201d</p><p>The reports, the amulets. Of course. Was the temper tantrum really necessary?</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Finally Cronus stilled, nostrils flaring as he tempered his breathing. His golden gaze locked on Gideon. Gold again, he realized. Why the continual change?</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Cronus held out his hand, empty palm up. Azure lights sparked, pinpricks that dotted the endless expanse of white, before something began to crystallize against his skin. Two somethings, actually.</p><p>Gideon leaned forward for a closer look. He saw two silver chains, both with a butterfly dangling from the center. Studded throughout those jagged wings were small rubies, sapphires, a piece of onyx, ivory and even an opal. Each jewel or stone seemed alive, swirling with an inner fire he usually saw only in his dreams.</p><p>Pretty, but... \u201cI\u2019m gonna look so manly.\u201d The words were out before he could stop them.</p><p>A growl escaped the king, far more menacing than any that had come before. \u201cIs that a complaint, Lies? Because I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. No apologies. I don\u2019t want them.\u201d He snatched the necklaces before they could be taken away and anchored one around his neck. The metal was hot\u2014hot enough to blister his skin\u2014but he didn\u2019t remove it. The other he stuffed into his pocket. Somehow, he would trick Scarlet into wearing it. \u201cWhat about my enemies?\u201d My friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll visit the fortress and hand them out.\u201d</p><p>Truth. How accommodating the usually morose god was being. There had to be a reason, one that didn\u2019t bode well for Gideon. Still. He\u2019d take what he could get. \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait.\u201d The king had given him an opening, intentionally or not, and he jumped on it. \u201cScarlet didn\u2019t tell me that we were wed and I wasn\u2019t wondering if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScarlet?\u201d The gold once again disappeared from his eyes, the obsidian like a living entity. \u201cRhea\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>Gideon blinked. She was Rhea\u2019s daughter? She was a fucking royal princess? Did that mean... \u201cAre you not her father?\u201d he croaked out. That might explain their matching black gazes.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d So much disgust poured from that single word, Gideon could have drowned in it. \u201cNever speak such a blasphemy again or I will unleash a torrent of suffering the likes of which you\u2019ve never known.\u201d</p><p>Why the disgust? Why the warning? She was a beautiful, intelligent, brave female, damn it, and the bastard should be proud to call her daughter. Gideon\u2019s hands fisted, even as he told himself he wasn\u2019t angry. He was relieved that Cronus wasn\u2019t his father-in-law. Possible father-in-law, he hastily added.</p><p>Sabin\u2019s wife was Galen\u2019s daughter, and Gideon had seen the problems that little family connection had caused. No, thanks.</p><p>\u201cHer father was mortal, and her mother is a whore,\u201d Cronus continued, the disgust far from waning. \u201cThat\u2019s who\u2019s in your vehicle? Seems I haven\u2019t been paying enough attention to you lately, Lies. I knew you had the girl in your dungeon, but had not realized you had taken her out. Without my permission. I should punish you.\u201d Again, truth. Careful.</p><p>She\u2019s not mine, his demon suddenly piped up. A warning to the king. One Cronus couldn\u2019t hear, thankfully.</p><p>Not now. Don\u2019t push. \u201cNo apologies, Great One.\u201d That he wasn\u2019t bombarded with pain for the \u201cgreat one\u201d comment shocked him. Cronus had to know he meant the words as an insult. \u201cAs I wasn\u2019t saying, she didn\u2019t tell me that we\u2019re wed. Something I remember. I didn\u2019t want to trick her into thinking I was softening toward her so that she would tell me more. And I didn\u2019t plan to return her to the dungeon once I had those answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWed? You and Scarlet?\u201d Cronus frowned, head tilting to the side as he pondered. \u201cEveryone knew she was interested in you the first moment she saw you, but there was no hint that the two of you were seeing each other. Much less willing to wed each other.\u201d She\u2019d always been interested in him? Suddenly he wanted to puff out his chest and bang on it like a damned gorilla. She liked the look of him, and always had. Despite her purported adoration of blonds. Thank the gods. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surely he could sneak past her rage and ignite that interest again. Somehow, some way. \u201cDo you know of anyone who didn\u2019t have the power to erase thoughts of her from my mind?\u201d</p><p>A pause, almost oppressive in its intensity. Cronus licked his lips, suddenly uneasy. Then uttered a hesitant, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s demon purred. A lie. Cronus had just told a lie. He did know someone who possessed that kind of power. Who? \u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo more questions.\u201d The command was snapped, his tone aggravated now. \u201cJust...be careful with her. She\u2019s feral. Otherwise, I would have taken over her care myself.\u201d</p><p>You will not touch her, he wanted to scream, even as his demon gave another purr. Another lie. What had the king lied about this time, though? That she was feral, or that he would have taken over her \u201ccare\u201d? Or both?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter if she was feral. She was Gideon\u2019s wife, for gods\u2019 sake. Maybe. But either way, he was going to bed her. If that didn\u2019t return his memory of her, nothing would. At least, that made sense to him. And what if, afterward, she was willing to help him and his friends in their ongoing war with the Hunters?</p><p>Yes, of course. If she would help, he wouldn\u2019t have to return her to the dungeon, even though he\u2019d told Cronus he would. The king wanted to win the war, didn\u2019t he? Scarlet could destroy the enemy while they slept, eradicating the need for bombings, stabbings and gunfights.</p><p>That would be total win-win. No downside. Well, except for one, but it was minor, so it hardly bore mentioning. Thought you never lied to yourself. Gideon bit his tongue until he tasted copper. Fine. The downside was huge. Devastating. He would never be able to trust Scarlet because his demon couldn\u2019t read her. And after what he\u2019d done to her, she would never want to help him.</p> <p>Therefore, she had to return to the dungeon no matter how much she softened toward him.</p><p>\u201cI grow tired of your wandering mind,\u201d Cronus said on a sigh.</p><p>So did Gideon. The results sucked. \u201cDon\u2019t have one last thing.\u201d Hopefully the god realized he had something else to discuss after this. \u201cIn prison, did anyone not...hurt her?\u201d The last was croaked from him.</p><p>Something hard shuttered over the king\u2019s eyes, not just erasing their color but shutting down his expression and blocking all hint of his emotions. \u201cWe\u2019re done here. You have things to do. I have things to do. So...\u201d</p><p>Clearly, he wouldn\u2019t discuss Scarlet anymore. Damn him. Though everything inside Gideon screeched in protest\u2014including Lies\u2014he quickly switched the subject before he was sent away. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t something else I needed to know. Olivia didn\u2019t mention that you have Sienna.\u201d Sienna was Paris\u2019s woman. A woman who had died in the man\u2019s arms. A woman he still craved, apparently.</p><p>Gideon felt like he was always the last one to know these things. Paris certainly hadn\u2019t told him. But Olivia loved sharing the details of her life, as well as the details of everyone else\u2019s, and Gideon adored spending time with her. She had mentioned that Cronus had taken Sienna\u2019s spirit, kept the girl near him, and then, when Wrath was split from Aeron\u2019s body, the god had placed the demon inside the girl.</p> <p>The pain she must be in right now...the utter mental agony. That demon was probably urging her to do all kinds of despicable things. Things she would do; she wouldn\u2019t be able to help herself. Things that would haunt her for the rest of eternity.</p><p>\u201cI have her,\u201d Cronus admitted reluctantly.</p><p>Truth. Lies hissed.</p><p>Tread carefully, he reminded himself. \u201cMay I not look upon her?\u201d And report to Paris.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d No hesitation. \u201cYou may not. And now, we truly are done. I have shown too much leniency already, and look what it\u2019s gotten me.\u201d Cronus waved his hand through the air, and the next thing Gideon knew, he was back at the wheel of the Escalade, Scarlet cuffed to his wrist.</p><p>The change was so jarring, he accidentally jerked the wheel. The car swerved to one side, tires squealing. Another car was approaching from the other lane, headlights bright. Another quick swerve, and the car missed his. Barely.</p><p>Scarlet gasped. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Our conversation wouldn\u2019t be over just because I went flying through the windshield, you know.\u201d</p><p>His demon gave a contented sigh. Not mine.</p> <p>Gideon evened out, but didn\u2019t mention what had just happened in the heavens. As much as she disliked Cronus\u2014why?\u2014he couldn\u2019t be sure of her reaction. However, every woman liked receiving gifts, and now seemed the perfect time for a distraction.</p><p>Don\u2019t mess this up. \u201cSo, uh, I would hate if you reached into my pocket.\u201d</p><p>There was a suspended beat of silence. Then a dry, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a present for you.\u201d</p><p>Interest lit her dark eyes, but she remained still. Even suspicious. \u201cThe present wouldn\u2019t happen to be a hard cock, would it? Because if it is, I would have to return it. Minus a few inches.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched as he fought his amusement. And yes, his cock hardened. He only had to be near her for an erection to happen. Or hell, think of her. He liked her dirty sense of humor. \u201cYes, it is, but you won\u2019t find that, too.\u201d Now her lips twitched. That had happened before, yet he\u2019d never seen her smile.</p><p>Truly smile. And he wanted to, desperately. She would glow. He knew she would, could see her beautiful, smiling face inside his mind, lush red lips curved at the corners, teeth straight and white. Her eyelids would dip a little, but the wicked glint in her irises still would be visible.</p><p>He sucked in a breath. Was that a memory? A memory of her smiling over at him? Happy with him? Well-loved?</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she grumbled, but she couldn\u2019t hide the trembling in her hand as she reached into his pocket, careful to avoid the very thick length of him. Another gasp left her as her fingers clasped the too-hot metal. She even jerked.</p><p>Gideon had to press his mouth into a tight line to cut off his moan of pleasure. Her touch... She was so close to Mini Me, she had only to angle her wrist to reach it. And he wanted her to reach it as desperately as he\u2019d wanted to see her smile. But all too soon, and without angling her wrist, she removed her hand and studied the amulet.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Was that disappointment in her tone?</p><p>\u201cNot a match to mine, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to him as he flicked his own amulet out from under his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The disappointment, if that\u2019s what it had been, disappeared. \u201cWh\u2013why do you want us to have matching necklaces?\u201d</p><p>Now he couldn\u2019t tell if she was happy, upset or wistful. Or maybe she was simply a combination of all three. Like, the gift made her happy because it meant he\u2019d been thinking of her. Like, the gift upset her because he was giving it to her now, when he didn\u2019t remember her. Like, the gift made her wistful because he seemed hopeful of a future together.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prompted gruffly.</p><p>He forced a shrug, because he couldn\u2019t answer. Not without hurting his cause. To admit\u2014in his way\u2014that he hadn\u2019t bought it for her would hurt her. To admit that it wasn\u2019t a symbol of what they\u2019d once shared and could maybe share again would, what? Hurt her.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get it?\u201d</p><p>Again, he shrugged.</p><p>Angrily, she hooked the necklace around her neck and he wanted to shout with relief. There. Done, it was done. She was protected from prying eyes, and he hadn\u2019t had to force the issue. The night suddenly seemed brighter.</p><p>\u201cYou look stupid wearing yours, by the way. In fact, you look like a girl.\u201d</p><p>Or not. The words confirmed his earlier fears, but deep down he knew that she was merely lashing out, again, because she didn\u2019t understand him. How like her.</p><p>You know her so well, do you? He didn\u2019t have an answer for himself, either.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Yet another shrug. He honestly didn\u2019t know. He had three and a half days\u2014no, nights\u2014left to woo and win her. To learn about her and his past. So, someplace romantic would be best. But where? Clearly, he didn\u2019t know her, because he had no idea what she would find romantic. A secluded cabin? A fancy hotel? He sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me about someplace you\u2019ve always wanted to go but haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you want to talk now?\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Eyes narrowed, she turned on the radio and cranked up the music, a hard, pounding rock, before settling back in her seat and facing the window.</p><p>Message received. He could suck it. And not the good way.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>HOURS PASSED in silence. Well, not silence. The radio continued to blast Scarlet\u2019s favorite heart-pounding rock. Gods, she missed her iPod. With the buds in her ears, she could have closed her eyes and pretended she was at home. Not that she had a permanent home, but anyplace was better than such close quarters with the man she\u2019d both loved and hated for centuries. A man she still craved with such intense longing she couldn\u2019t deny it anymore.</p><p>Almost didn\u2019t want to deny it. But she would. No way would she give him another chance to shatter her so completely. To pleasure her and forget her. Shamefully, she had almost caved, though.He\u2019d given her a gift. The most beautiful butterfly necklace she\u2019d ever seen, and one that matched his own. When she\u2019d first reached into his pocket, she\u2019d been disappointed that he hadn\u2019t really wanted her to fist his cock. Then she\u2019d seen the necklace, and well, she\u2019d wanted to leap into his lap and kiss every inch of his beautiful face. She\u2019d wanted to lick each of his piercings and thrust her tongue against his. Wanted to feel his arms wrap around her and hold her tight. As if she meant something to him again. Wanted to hear him gasp his version of her name.</p><p>But he\u2019d seemed almost...uncomfortable about the whole thing. Guilty, even. Why? Only reason she could think of was that he hadn\u2019t wanted her to read too much into the gesture. Hadn\u2019t wanted her to leap into his lap and kiss every inch of his beautiful face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That seemed likely. Especially since the bastard hadn\u2019t tried to turn down the music and talk to her again. Maybe he was even relieved that she\u2019d closed their channels of communication. Which was dumb. He\u2019d sprung her from prison to talk to her, hadn\u2019t he? He should try harder. Not that she\u2019d cooperate. The moment she did, he\u2019d try to take her back to the dungeon and she\u2019d have to ditch him as planned.</p><p>Actually, she\u2019d do that tomorrow. His friends would probably be pissed that he\u2019d lost her, but that wasn\u2019t her problem. He\u2019d also have to make it back to a city littered with Hunters without her aid, but again, that wasn\u2019t her problem.</p><p>She had enough problems to deal with.</p> <p>One of which was fast approaching.</p><p>Gideon was still driving when the sun began to rise. She stiffened in her seat, dreading what came next but helpless to stop it. First, lethargy beat through her, draining her strength, making her limbs feel heavy and her head loll. Then her eyelids closed of their own accord, her lashes seemingly glued together. Then darkness wove through her mind, an incessant spiderweb\u2014spiders, Gideon hated spiders, funny that she thought of them now\u2014followed quickly by dissonant screams that overshadowed all else.</p><p>Her demon took over from there.</p><p>Laughing gleefully, Nightmares propelled her into a dark, misty realm where human and inhuman minds were like doorways. When a door was open, that meant the person was asleep and the demon could enter at will. Location didn\u2019t matter. Distance didn\u2019t matter. Time zone didn\u2019t matter. Adults, children, male, female, that didn\u2019t matter, either. Nothing mattered to the demon but feeding on terror.</p><p>With only a glance, she and the demon would know who each doorway belonged to, what kind of person they were and what they feared most. Like with Gideon and his silly fear of spiders, she thought, smiling again. He was a big, bad warrior who had killed thousands of people without a jump in his heart rate. But he almost peed his pants when an insect scampered toward him.</p> <p>She supposed she couldn\u2019t blame him. She hated the creepy little bugs. They\u2019d constantly invaded her cell in Tartarus, crawling from every shadow and wall crack. And every time she\u2019d awoken from her impenetrable sleep, she would find herself covered with bite marks.</p><p>Not to mention the bruises her cellmates had left behind. Until she\u2019d started invading their dreams.</p><p>Whatever she\u2019d done to them in this dark realm, real life had parroted, and they\u2019d awoken in puddles of their own blood, often missing limbs. Some had never awakened at all.</p><p>Who do we want? the demon asked her. The most frequently asked question between them.</p><p>Over the years, they\u2019d learned to work together. They even liked each other, relied on each other. At times, the demon had been her only friend.</p><p>\u201cA Hunter would be nice,\u201d she replied. Maybe they could scare the guy to death. That always put Nightmares in a stellar mood. Besides, she owed the Hunters. Not because she cared that they wanted to hurt Gideon, but because they\u2019d ruined a perfectly good meal for her.</p> <p>This will be fun. More gleeful laughter as the demon whisked them forward, the doorways blurring at her side.</p><p>When they stopped, they stood in front of an open doorway that was far larger than any she\u2019d seen before. Moans of pleasure echoed from inside, a decadent mix of male and female. There was a slap of flesh against flesh. Murmurs of \u201cmore\u201d and \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>An erotic dream, then.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>Galen. Leader of Hunters. Keeper of Hope.</p><p>Galen. She scowled. The warrior had led his army against the Lords because they were demon-possessed, and yet Galen himself carried a demon. The contradiction was baffling, but it didn\u2019t surprise her.</p><p>Galen had always struck her as more snake than man. A few times, he\u2019d helped Gideon bring a prisoner into Tartarus, and he\u2019d been all smiles while Gideon faced him, but the moment Gideon had turned away, Galen\u2019s glower had bored into his back.</p><p>When Gideon had told her that he\u2019d found a way to curry the gods\u2019 favor thanks to his pal Galen, and that for his reward, he would request her freedom, she had begged him not to do it, whatever he planned. Of course, he hadn\u2019t listened. He\u2019d been too assured, too hopeful, of his success.</p> <p>She\u2019d wanted to \u201cthank\u201d Galen for his part in Gideon\u2019s failure for a long, long time, but hadn\u2019t allowed herself to do so. That would have helped Gideon, and she hadn\u2019t wanted to do that, either.</p><p>Now, however, with that necklace burning against her chest, she no longer minded the prospect quite so much.</p><p>Ready?</p><p>Slowly she grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>They stepped through the entrance, a phantom unseen by the dreamer, and suddenly Scarlet was viewing the evidence of what she\u2019d heard. Galen was tall and muscled, with blond hair and blue eyes. Eyes that were peering down at a beautiful, pale-haired female. A female he had anchored against a bathroom sink, his majestic white wings outstretched, enclosing her in a feathered haven.</p><p>The woman\u2019s shirt was pushed to her chin, bearing her large\u2014really large\u2014breasts. He feasted on them eagerly. Her pants were around her ankles as Galen pounded inside her, hips shifting to produce maximum pleasure.</p><p>His pants were merely opened at the waist, so Scarlet saw very little of him. Too bad. She could have taunted Gideon with the size of his enemy\u2019s cock and the hardness of his ass.</p><p>So many fears, Nightmares said with awe.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d She spoke aloud, knowing dream Galen couldn\u2019t hear her unless she wanted him to.</p><p>Being alone. Being defeated. Helpless. Ineffective. Overlooked. Forgotten. Dead.</p><p>Weird. He carried the demon of Hope. Shouldn\u2019t he be more optimistic? No matter. Scarlet walked through the dream bathroom, Galen as oblivious to her presence as he was to her voice, and allowed Nightmares to re-paint the scene.</p><p>\u201cMake him sorry he was ever created.\u201d</p><p>My pleasure.</p><p>Suddenly, the writhing, moaning girl became a man. A human.</p><p>Galen stopped pounding. Even yelped and jumped away, wings shuddering with the movement.</p><p>Scarlet laughed. Oh, this was going to be fun. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom was replaced by a long, dark tunnel, and the human disappeared. Galen spun, wild gaze searching his new surroundings, the tips of those wings grazing the walls and scratching.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he rasped. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>His words echoed, but that was it, the only sound. Desperate for answers, he kicked into gear, racing forward. The tunnel stretched forever, no end in sight. His panic doubled, tripled, hot breath rasping from him and sweat pouring from his body.</p><p>Delicious. Nightmares laughed. Tastes so good.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Do you want the honors?</p><p>Sharing was caring, she thought. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Lead him to the edge, and I\u2019ll show him what might one day happen to him. Oh, his fear...none of the others will compare.</p><p>Scarlet allowed herself to materialize, though she didn\u2019t show the formidable warrior what she truly looked like. The image she projected was one of a little girl she\u2019d met inside Tartarus. For the single day the child had been allowed inside a cell. A little girl named Fate.</p><p>Everyone had been frightened of her, because everything Fate had spoken had come true. Everything. That\u2019s why the Greeks had so quickly put her to death, the poor thing.</p><p>But for that one day, she had been Scarlet\u2019s friend.</p><p>\u201cIf you believe what you see, you\u2019ll lose your husband,\u201d Fate had told her during their only conversation.</p><p>Of course Scarlet had believed what she\u2019d seen\u2014Gideon\u2019s absence\u2014so of course Scarlet had lost him.</p><p>Many, many years had passed. Perhaps Galen would recognize Fate, perhaps not. Either way...let the games begin.</p><p>As Fate, Scarlet wore a robe streaked with dirt, had big blue eyes, so innocent, and a mouth forever dipped in sadness. Red hair hung in tangles all the way to her ankles.</p><p>She appeared a few feet in front of him. \u201cCome,\u201d she said gently, and held out her small, mud-caked hand. \u201cYou must see what awaits you.\u201d</p><p>He tripped over his own feet but stopped before he hit her, still panting, still sweating. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>As forgetful as Gideon, then. But sometimes ignorance served her best. What people imagined was often far worse than anything she could tell them.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou must see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Yes. All right.\u201d Galen shakily placed his palm against hers.</p><p>Down the corridor she ushered him, Nightmares practically jumping around in her head. Finally, because she willed it, a light appeared, and the significance of that light was not lost on him. Once again, his fear spiked.</p><p>He even tried to pull away from her, but she tightened her grip, stronger than she appeared. \u201cYou must see,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou must know.\u201d</p><p>They reached the light, which just happened to be a cliff ledge that overlooked a battlefield. On that battlefield was man after man, woman after woman, an ocean of death and destruction, for each body was bloody, motionless. And on each of their wrists was a tattoo of infinity. The mark of the Hunter.</p><p>There, in the center, was Galen. He was still standing, though he, too, was bloody and wounded. His white-feathered wings were outstretched but clearly broken. His strength was drained, his knocking knees threatening to give out.</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d Beside her, a shaking dream Galen did drop to his knees, dust pluming around him.</p><p>On the battlefield, Gideon strode toward him, as menacing as ever. His blue hair danced around his face in the strong wind, and his piercings gleamed in the sunlight. There was a trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth where his lip ring had been ripped out. In one hand, he gripped a long, sharp sword. In the other, he clutched a gun.</p><p>Laughing, he pointed the latter at Galen and fired. The leader of the Hunters flew backward, landing on his ass, unable to rise as Gideon continued to bear down on him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the Galen beside her shouted again. \u201cStand up. Fight him! I didn\u2019t survive that demon girl\u2019s poisonous bite only to die at the hands of my enemy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t, allowing Gideon to raise his sword and strike. Galen\u2019s head detached, leaving his body behind. \u201cNo! No!\u201d Sky-blue eyes found her, a well of despair. His face was pale, the blue veins underneath his skin arrestingly evident. \u201cTell me I can change this. Tell me this isn\u2019t my fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish me to lie?\u201d she said in that sweet little-girl voice.</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides, useless weapons against what awaited him. \u201cWhy did you show me this, then? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d</p><p>Scarlet came awake with a jolt, sitting up, panting as Galen had done in the dream realm. Damn it. She hadn\u2019t finished with him, but her time there had ended. And there would be no going back for twelve hours.</p><p>At least Nightmares was satisfied. The demon had fed on Galen\u2019s terror, terror so much more intense than what humans experienced, and now retreated to the back of her mind.</p><p>\u201cNot good. You\u2019re asleep.\u201d</p><p>Gideon.</p> <p>His voice floated over her, into her, burning her up. With anger, with lust. Goodbye fun dream world, hello hated reality.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she demanded, studying her new surroundings. She\u2019d fallen asleep in his presence\u2014again\u2014and he\u2019d clearly taken full advantage of the situation. \u201cSomeplace shitty.\u201d</p><p>Rather than a hotel room, she found herself in a forest, the sun setting in a violet sky. She rested atop a cool bed of moss, and there was a natural, bubbling spring beside her. She still wore the dress he\u2019d given her, but at least he\u2019d removed the cuffs.</p><p>Before she\u2019d jacked up the music in the car, he\u2019d tried to ask her what she found most romantic. She hadn\u2019t replied, so he\u2019d obviously taken a guess. And to her consternation, the bastard had guessed correctly. This was amazing. Night birds were chirping, the scent of wildflowers saturated the air and Gideon was gloriously bathed in that violet-tinted light.</p><p>Right now, he was sitting in front of her, only a few inches away, leaning against a tree trunk. A lock of hair had fallen onto his forehead, and just as before, she had to curb the urge to brush the strands back in place. His baby blues were all over her, perusing, lingering, savoring. Trying to remember?</p><p>His hands were fisted on his lap. Was he trying to stop himself from reaching for her?</p> <p>Gods help her, but she knew exactly what this man could do to her body. With his hands, his tongue. He could have her writhing, begging, in seconds.</p><p>Fight his appeal. \u201cYou might as well let me go.\u201d Or you yourself could, I don\u2019t know, finally ditch him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find any pleasure with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Sweet heaven. He truly thought to bed her. Was utterly confident in her capitulation. Why, oh, why was that so damn sexy?</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, lest he see the desire surely banked there. \u201cYou sprang me for answers, so why are you trying so hard to soften me romantically? You\u2019d have better luck working me over with your fists.\u201d Good. She\u2019d sounded angry rather than breathless.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think about that already.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought about hitting her? That\u2014that\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd I could absolutely bring myself to do it.\u201d Sweetheart.</p> <p>Gods, she really was an idiot, melting like butter because he\u2019d decided not to beat her up. Next she\u2019d be hearing angels sing because he decided not to fork her jugular. \u201cNo matter what you do, you\u2019re going to fail.\u201d Fingers crossed that wasn\u2019t a bluff.</p><p>\u201cEven if all I want us to do is relearn each other?\u201d</p><p>Yes. No. Argh.</p><p>Hey. No more softening. \u201cNothing wrong with forgetting each other, either.\u201d</p><p>He was grinding his teeth as he moved his legs, trapping her knees with his ankles and placing her feet dangerously close to his\u2014hard, growing\u2014penis. Tragically\u2014er, thankfully\u2014his pants prevented her from experiencing skin-to-skin contact. Therefore she despised\u2014loved, damn it\u2014those low-slung jeans.</p><p>\u201cSo who aren\u2019t you today?\u201d he asked, wisely changing the subject.</p><p>Hurt him. Make him stop this slow seduction. \u201cScarlet...Reynolds.\u201d She shivered as if the thought delighted her. \u201cYes. I\u2019m in the mood for a little Rye-Rye today.\u201d</p><p>Gideon popped his jaw, teeth bared for a second. \u201cAre we not married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we are,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in my mind I\u2019m cheating on you with Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Now the pink tip of his tongue peeked out from his lip, as if he meant to chew it off. \u201cYou\u2019re so freaking funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was joking?\u201d</p><p>Before she could blink, he was on her, pushing her into the moss, his chest pressed against hers, his weight pinning her. \u201cYou do not annoy the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>A tremor skipped down her spine, her nipples straining against her dress, trying to reach him. She could have knocked him off; she was strong enough, skilled enough, but she didn\u2019t. She fisted the collar of his shirt, holding him in place. Craving... \u201cWell, if you hadn\u2019t guessed, you do annoy the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>In and out he breathed, nostrils flaring. \u201cKeep talking, I don\u2019t dare you.\u201d</p><p>Shut up, he meant. \u201cOr what?\u201d He smelled so damn good, like musk and alluring spice. Warmth radiated from him and enveloped her, slinking around her in a sly embrace.</p><p>\u201cOr...\u201d His gaze dropped to her lips. The anger seemed to drain from him, something hotter, sultrier taking its place. Those rasping pants never slowed, and in between them, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re so unbelievably...ugly.\u201d The last was offered hesitantly, as if he feared she wouldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to tell her. \u201cYou don\u2019t make me ache. You don\u2019t make me hunger for so many things. Dirty things. Wicked things.\u201d</p><p>Kiss him.</p><p>No, don\u2019t you dare.</p><p>A war raged between body and mind. If she kissed him, she wouldn\u2019t be able to halt what was sure to follow. Once his lips met hers, she would be lost. His taste drugged her, his body addicted her. That\u2019s the way it had always been with him.</p><p>And now, she would want but she couldn\u2019t have. Not truly. But for one blissful night, she would belong to him again. Any price was worth that. Added bonus: she could forget her troubles, forget the lonely future that awaited her.</p><p>Forget. Wrong word. She stiffened, no longer having to talk herself into resisting. \u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hurt you,\u201d he whispered, heated breath dragging over her skin. \u201cTell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>Meaning, he wanted to pleasure her and all she had to do was give him the go-ahead. She shook her head in a desperate attempt to prevent what she still wanted, needed, but could never afford. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Wait. No, she wouldn\u2019t tell him to stop? Argh!</p><p>Slowly he smiled\u2014so wicked\u2014as if that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d hoped she would say, no matter her meaning. \u201cToo bad,\u201d he said. And then he fed a sizzling kiss straight into her mouth.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>SWEET GODS ABOVE, Gideon thought, dazed. This woman\u2014his woman\u2014tasted like perfectly ripe berries, felt like caged lightning against him, and the sounds she made as his tongue rolled and thrust against hers, those little catches of breath, were like heroin mixed with ambrosia. Addictive, mind-fuzzing, overwhelming.</p><p>He had her pressed into the ground, his legs between hers, his erection resting against the apex of her thighs. He wanted to knead her breasts. Gods, did he want to knead her breasts. But that would be too much too fast. For her, at least. So he did the only other thing he could. He captured her wrists and pinned them over her head, effectively pinning his own movements, as well.Mistake. That, of course, arched her lower back and closed all hint of distance between their chests, muscle to soft, luscious breasts. Her nipples were hard, so wonderfully hard, and they created the most delicious friction against his chest, catapulting him to a new level of awareness.</p><p>A dangerous level where her enjoyment and happiness were more important than his own.</p><p>He didn\u2019t release her, though. It was too late for that. He had to have more. So if he couldn\u2019t roll those nipples between his fingers, if he couldn\u2019t tongue them, he\u2019d have to settle for continuing to rub himself against them. As an added bonus, every little movement rammed his shaft into her core, causing them both to shiver and groan.</p><p>Kissing usually did nothing for him. Maybe because he could never ask for what he wanted; he had to lie and demand the opposite. He had to ask for sweet, innocent. He had to ask for gentle, tender. Yet, with Scarlet, he didn\u2019t have to ask for anything. She simply gave him hard and wet. Deep and intense. She bit at him, sucked on his tongue, scraped at his teeth. And he couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>He kissed her forever. He kissed her while the insects sang and the moon fought for its place in the sky. He kissed her until he lost his breath. Kissed her until she was writhing against him, her legs wrapped around him, squeezing him, her teeth nipping at him as she silently begged for more.</p><p>And yet, through it all, she seemed distanced. As if she weren\u2019t truly there with him. As if she held a part of herself back. Hell. No.</p><p>Distance, he wouldn\u2019t tolerate. He might not want to push her too far, but by the time this kiss ended, she would think of no other man but him. She would be happy she was wed to him. She would dream of him, crave him more than any other.</p><p>Was this what it had been like between them, all those centuries ago? Consuming need dipped in fervent heat then twined with unquenchable aches?</p><p>He released one of her hands, and she immediately tunneled her fingers through his hair, nails digging into his scalp. Enough to make him bleed. Yes, yes. More. Maybe he could push her a little further. But to do so, he\u2019d have to sacrifice the kiss. With their mouths pressed together like this, he couldn\u2019t think properly.</p><p>Moaning, Gideon wrenched himself away from her lips. She had her eyes sealed shut, as if she were in pain. Those lips were swollen and red, moist. Unable to help himself, he licked that moisture away before hiking her dress up to her neck, baring her panties, her stomach and lastly her breasts. He hadn\u2019t given her a bra. Too much had he liked the idea of her sitting next to him, a thin piece of cotton all that rested between his skin and her nipples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her breasts were perfectly sized, a little less than a handful, and those nipples were as red as her lips. His mouth watered as he lowered his head. And dear gods, sucking one of those little berries into his mouth was a religious experience. The moment his tongue made contact, his entire body felt as though it went up in flames from the inside out. His blood turned his organs to ash. His ashed organs liquefied his bones, and those liquid bones scorched his skin, leaving blisters.</p><p>She must have experienced the same melting sensation, because a scream of pleasure exploded from her. An honest-to-gods, I\u2019m-losing-my-mind scream of pleasure. He loved it, reveled in it. Except a thousand other screams followed hers. And those weren\u2019t forged by pleasure. Those reeked of fear and pain.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d she rasped.</p> <p>Once again, he raised his head. Her eyes were still sealed shut, only now her mouth was pulled tight in an agonized line. Thick black shadows were seeping from her ears, her mouth, and swirling around her head.</p><p>Her demon, he realized.</p><p>Since Gideon had gained control of his body and his actions all those centuries ago, Lies had been like a ghostly companion. There, but hardly noticeable. Well, until recently. Before Scarlet, the demon had rarely spoken to him outright or asserted its presence physically. Rather, his demon had mostly led him through compulsions.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a compulsion for her. This was an all-out manifestation. And he had no fucking clue what to do.</p><p>\u201cHow can I make this worse, devil?\u201d He tried to pull away from her, to ease her in any way he could, even if that meant no longer making out with her. But her eyelids at last popped open, her irises glowing bright red, and she grabbed his shirt, jerking him back.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d The words were a harsh growl, and all those discordant screams layered the undertone, a tide of malevolence. \u201cHear us well. If you dare stop, we will punish you.\u201d</p><p>Us. We. Her demon was that involved? That much a part of her? O-kay. Not his first three-way, but certainly his strangest. There was no time to marvel, however.</p><p>Scarlet dragged a finger down the center of his shirt, ripping the cotton, exposing his chest. She flattened her palm against his pierced nipple and licked her lips. \u201cMore,\u201d she moaned, arching into him.</p><p>Her cleft brushed his shaft, and the rest of the blood left his brain. The moist tip of his cock even pushed past the waist of his pants. The fact that the shadows were still drifting from her, the fact that those screams were still echoing between them, failed to faze him. His desire for her was simply too great. He, too, had to have more.</p><p>Not sex, he told himself. Not yet. He still thought it would be pushing her too hard and too fast. And he wouldn\u2019t have her crying foul later, claiming he\u2019d taken advantage of her and using that as an excuse to distance herself further.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just sitting there. Hurry!\u201d</p> <p>Complaints about his performance already when she was clearly passion-drunk. He\u2019d like to say that was a first, but couldn\u2019t. Many women had complained about his get in as fast as you can, get and give an orgasm and leave mentality. \u201cGideon! Obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure. Don\u2019t show me what you want first.\u201d He didn\u2019t leap into action, of course, but watched as Scarlet began kneading her own breasts, exactly as he\u2019d yearned to do. Strands of her silky black hair fell down her shoulders and curled around her fingers, as if tickling her.</p><p>Her eyelids closed to half-mast, and her teeth chewed at her bottom lip as she reached down with one hand, past her pretty blue panties and into the wet heat of her. Gods, she was sexy. Her stomach hollowed into the most sensual navel he\u2019d ever seen, and her thighs stretched into the hottest legs.</p><p>\u201cThat good enough for you? I showed you, damn it, now keep up your end of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he moved. He reached out and fisted her dress, lifting the material the rest of the way over her head and then tossing it aside. \u201cPress your knees closer together,\u201d he croaked out.</p><p>At first, she obeyed and closed her legs to him. When he applied pressure to her knees, urging them farther apart, she realized what she\u2019d done and dropped them open. Spreading herself, eager for him. Her hips arched forward, back, beseeching him to do something, anything.</p><p>For a moment, he luxuriated in the image of her. He\u2019d seen her like this before. He knew it, to his very soul he knew it. For this image didn\u2019t seem new, but somehow a part of him. Deep inside, hidden but there. Yet, when he tugged those panties aside, pushed her fingers from the place he wanted to be and lowered his head, when he traced his tongue up the slick heat of her, the taste of her was new. He had absolutely no memory of it.</p><p>And what a shame. Nothing had ever tasted as sweet, as heady. She filled his mouth, invaded each of his senses, branded his every cell.</p> <p>\u201cGideon. Please. Please, please, please.\u201d Scarlet. \u201cMore. Now!\u201d Her demon. Funny that he could tell the difference between them already.</p><p>But he needed no more urging. He lay on his belly, his face right between her legs, and did everything his fevered brain had been imagining since he\u2019d discovered her in his dungeon. He licked, he sucked, he nibbled, he tongued her in the sweetest possible way, sinking deep, savoring every drop of her.</p><p>When that wasn\u2019t enough, his fingers joined the play. First one, then two. Three stretched her, and he was afraid he was hurting her, so he took his time, letting her become used to him. And when she did, she rode those fingers with complete abandon, arching into him, tugging on his hair, clawing at his scalp. Again, he loved it. Couldn\u2019t get enough. Wanted it to last forever.</p><p>Wanted to do more. Do everything. Things he\u2019d only ever dreamed of doing to others but hadn\u2019t been able to do because of his demon. Wicked things, things most women would probably shy away from. Hell, things most men would probably shy away from. But he was a warrior who had seen and done things most people couldn\u2019t comprehend. He\u2019d lived for a long, long time and normal had grown yawn-inducing.</p><p>Perhaps Scarlet would have let him do everything he wished. Perhaps she even would have enjoyed it. She\u2019d lived a long time, too. But with her past, having spent so many centuries as a slave, she might have hated it. Either way, now wasn\u2019t the time, he reminded himself.</p><p>This was about getting each other off while reassuring her that he wouldn\u2019t do more until she was ready. Mentally as well as physically. That she could trust him. With her body. Her secrets.</p><p>A lie? Suddenly, he didn\u2019t know anymore.</p><p>\u201cGideon, Gideon. Yes, like that. Don\u2019t stop. What you\u2019re doing...gods, I love it.\u201d</p><p>More decadent words had never been spoken. She was getting close, her body tensing, readying for completion.</p><p>Not without me, he thought. Though he wanted her hand wrapped around his cock, stroking him, maybe even cupping and pulling at his testicles, he fisted himself. As he began licking her once again, he worked his shaft up and down, his grip strong, the glide sure and wet from her. Gods, yes. That was good.</p><p>He sank his tongue deep, just as he had done with his fingers, and just like that, she erupted. Her inner walls clamped down on him, holding him captive. Her knees squeezed his temples, hard, and he thought his skull might crack. He didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d done that to her; he\u2019d given her that pleasure. He\u2019d pushed her over the edge of control.</p><p>Pride and possessiveness poured through him as he tasted the sweetness of her orgasm. His strokes on his cock increased in speed, in intensity, and he shot up, over her, keeping himself from crushing her with one hand flattened beside her shoulder. Her eyes were still at half-mast, and she was panting. Sweat glistened on her brow, and there was a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of her swollen mouth. Her nipples were still hard, even though an air of absolute satisfaction radiated from her.</p><p>Mine, he thought, and then he, too, was hurtling over the edge, jetting hot seed onto her stomach. Perhaps he should have angled away from her, but he wouldn\u2019t have been able to turn away if a sword had been poised at his throat. His gaze was too busy drinking her in, and yeah, he liked the thought of his seed on her. Like a brand. It was only fair, after all. Her essence was inside him, swimming through him.</p><p>Now he collapsed on her, crushing her, unable to help himself, the last drop having emptied him out completely. He had no energy left. He couldn\u2019t quite catch his breath, and the only thing his mind wanted to do was to relive what had just happened. The sights, the sounds, the taste, the feel.</p><p>It was probably the same for her, her mind caught up in what had happened, her heart softening toward him. He could ask her anything now, and she\u2019d tell him the truth; he was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cGet off me, you big lug,\u201d Scarlet said, shoving him aside.</p><p>Wait. What?</p><p>Surprised by her vehemence, he rolled to his back, looking up at her as she stood. The shadows were no longer pulsing around her, and the screams of pain had died. She kept her back to him as she marched to the bubbling spring. It was too dark to see the nuances of her tattoos.</p><p>Next time, I\u2019ll kiss those tattoos. But oh, he could see the contours of her ass, and damn. Three words: Per. Fec. Tion. Firm, made for cupping. Why didn\u2019t I cup her?</p><p>He\u2019d concentrated on her fun zone, and lost focus on everything else. Next time, he thought again.</p><p>Without a word, she entered the water and sank to her shoulders. That\u2019s when she finally faced him, though her gaze never quite touched him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a, uh, slow recovery time,\u201d he told her. He sat up and scrubbed a hand through his tangled hair.</p><p>\u201cWell, there wasn\u2019t much to recover from,\u201d she replied tartly.</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed in affront. The little brat had really gone there, not so subtly telling him the experience hadn\u2019t been good for her. She was lying. Of course. And he didn\u2019t need his demon to tell him that. (Which the bastard did not.) She\u2019d enjoyed the hell out of herself. She\u2019d writhed and screamed. She\u2019d begged for more, damn it.</p><p>Scowling, he jumped to a stand\u2014and pretended he\u2019d tripped when his knees almost gave out. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t recovered. Motions stiff, jerky, he removed the tattered remains of his shirt and shoved his pants to his ankles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit, he thought, seeing himself. His anger drained. He was still wearing his boots. What kind of lover wore his boots when tasting a woman for the first time?</p><p>He kicked those off, nearly falling on his face again, and stepped out of his jeans. He removed his weapons, too, all ten thousand of them, it seemed, strapped over every inch of him. Naked, unabashed, he strode to the spring and settled in beside her. Steam rose, the mist like glitter as it danced in the air. The hot water caressed his tired muscles.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? You weren\u2019t invited.\u201d Scarlet swam to the other side, putting as much distance between them as she could. Yet nothing could have separated their gazes. They were now locked together in a heated clash of wills. At least her eyes were black now, rather than red.</p> <p>\u201cI could have done a lot less to you, you know,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cWhere\u2019s my no thanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour no thanks is right here.\u201d She flipped him off with absolute relish. \u201cAnd yes, I know you could have done a lot more to me.\u201d Her hand fell back into the water, and her head tilted to the side, her study of him intensifying. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d Soft, whispered.</p><p>A loaded question, and far worse than \u201cDo I look fat in these pants?\u201d There was no way to answer without damning himself. You weren\u2019t ready would be met with How do you know what I\u2019m ready for; you don\u2019t even know me. Or the lie I didn\u2019t want to do more, which was what he\u2019d have to give her, would be met with Neither did I or a thousand questions about whether or not he now remembered her.</p><p>Time to change the subject. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay there?\u201d As he spoke, he crooked a finger at her.</p><p>Stubborn, she shook her head. But she said, \u201cI will, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>A muscle ticked below his eye. He wanted to hold her, damn it. Wanted to wrap his arms around her and snuggle her close. He wanted to, well, bask in her. Because that would thaw her out. Of course.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know what I meant, Scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, strength weaving itself into her tone. Her butterfly necklace sparkled as a ray of amber moonlight fought its way past the canopy of leaves above them. \u201cWhat happened, happened. We can\u2019t undo it, but we can take steps to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>He could only gape at her. Why the hell would they want to do that?</p><p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t need to go down that road again,\u201d she continued, as if she were reading his mind. \u201cIt didn\u2019t end well the first time and it would only end worse the second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can know that for sure.\u201d He straightened, meaning to close the distance himself and shake her. She was too determined, too sure of herself.</p> <p>She kicked out a foot, flattening it against his chest, and stopped him. \u201cStay where you are.\u201d The red reappeared in her eyes, matching the glimmering ruby in her necklace.</p><p>So. The demon wasn\u2019t too far from the surface now, after all. But Nightmares had seemed to like him, and had certainly wanted him. Did that mean Scarlet was battling her body\u2019s\u2014and her demon\u2019s\u2014needs, even now?</p><p>Pensive, Gideon settled back against the rocks. But when Scarlet tried to remove her foot, he grabbed her by the ankle and held on.</p><p>\u201cLet me go. Oh, gods. Don\u2019t let go. Don\u2019t you dare let go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d pressed his thumb into her arch, massaging. If he couldn\u2019t shake her without a fight, he\u2019d settle for disarming her. Her head fell back against the rocky wall behind her, and the harder he worked, the more she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying here,\u201d he told her. Damn, but he\u2019d never tried so hard. \u201cTo remember, to make amends, to make something work.\u201d</p><p>While continuing to gasp in pleasure, she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me. Not really. You want answers.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deny it. He did want answers. But with every second that passed, he wanted her more. \u201cTo part is to die,\u201d he said, and because it was a lie\u2014though he almost wished it wasn\u2019t\u2014he wasn\u2019t struck with pain and weakness.</p> <p>\u201cStupid words that mean nothing.\u201d</p><p>He felt that way, yeah, a little bit, but her memories were intact. She shouldn\u2019t. He tried not to let his irritation and frustration show. \u201cGive me nothing.\u201d Something. \u201cJust a little nothing.\u201d Anything.</p><p>A long moment passed in silence. He continued to rub her foot, and she continued to enjoy, but she didn\u2019t speak. He thought she meant to ignore him. But then, finally, she sighed, so many emotions tangled in that heavy exhalation.</p><p>\u201cOnce, you were delivering a prisoner to Tartarus. An immortal who had tried to kill Zeus in order to claim the heavenly throne for himself. Before you could get him locked inside one of the cells, you noticed that I was fighting a goddess.\u201d Her brow furrowed. \u201cI can\u2019t remember who it was, only that she was tall and blond.\u201d</p><p>That could be any one of thousands. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was...winning.\u201d The furrow deepened, and Scarlet frowned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel right. I mean, in my mind I can see her holding me down and scratching me, but the image feels...wrong. I\u2019m not making any sense.\u201d She waved a hand through the air, droplets of water dripping off and splashing. \u201cAnyway, you noticed us and released the prisoner to rush to me. While you pulled the goddess off me and helped me to my feet, the new prisoner tried to escape. You ran after him, and all the gods and goddesses inside my cell tried to escape, as well. I held them back while you captured the male because I didn\u2019t want you to get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>Wow. She could have run herself, but she hadn\u2019t. For him, she\u2019d stayed. The knowledge was...humbling. If she spoke true, that is. Why the fucking hell couldn\u2019t Lies tell with her? \u201cAnd what didn\u2019t the gods and goddesses do in retaliation?\u201d They wouldn\u2019t have let that kind of betrayal go. She\u2019d stopped them from gaining their freedom; they would have punished her. Severely.</p><p>She shrugged, deceptively cavalier. \u201cI told you one thing, as you asked. That\u2019s all you get.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. The story had only whetted his appetite for more. \u201cSeems like you haven\u2019t endured a lot of pain to be with me. Why would you not do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d Once again, she didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand what he was saying and his respect and admiration for her grew. Along with his frustration.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, and I won\u2019t give you a boon. Anything you don\u2019t want.\u201d Without a doubt, she\u2019d ask for liberation. He\u2019d give it to her, because damn, he just couldn\u2019t lie to her anymore, and then he would catch her again. Lock her away as planned.</p><p>It was necessary, he reminded himself. She was dangerous, could destroy him and everyone he loved. He\u2019d remind himself of those facts until the word necessary was simply a part of him, as vital as breathing.</p><p>Her interest perked. \u201cA boon to be named later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She tugged her foot from his clasp and gave him the other one. He tried not to smile as he set to work, massaging this arch in turn. So quietly demanding. So adorable.</p><p>Necessary.</p><p>\u201cAll right, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d She licked her lips, averted her gaze and peered up at the heavens. \u201cJust...give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minute\u201d turned out to be eleven. Not that he was counting every damn second.</p><p>The suspense was killing him, though he suspected what she was going to say. I risked punishment because I loved you. Part of him wanted to hear the words, even if that made him a sadist. The other part of him really wanted to hear the words. Even if that made him a masochist. She didn\u2019t feel that way now, and it wouldn\u2019t end well for her if she did. A thought that left him hollow and sick.</p><p>Fucking necessary.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d she finally asked, hesitant yet hopeful. \u201cThe knowledge will change you, and not for the better.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t be \u201cI love you,\u201d then. Her expression was so troubled, he\u2019d never seen its like. Dread coursed through him and his fingers stopped moving. He sat up straighter, his gaze trying to burrow into her soul. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t tell me. Don\u2019t tell me now.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cGideon. We...you and I...we had...a son. We had a son, and his name was Steel.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>AMUN, KEEPER of the demon of Secrets, lounged in a plastic lawn chair in the middle of the thriving green forest surrounding his home. He had a battery-operated mister in front of him and a cooler of ice-cold beer beside him. Alcohol didn\u2019t do much for immortals, but he liked the taste anyway.</p><p>Overhead, the sun was shining so brightly, a few thousand amber rays managed to seep through the thick treetop canopy and directly onto his skin. And yeah, he had a lot of exposed skin. He\u2019d come out here clad in his swim trunks and a smile.When he closed his eyes, it was easy to pretend he was on a beach. Alone. He did this as often as possible; it was his time away from people and the secrets they could never hide from him, no matter how hard they tried. Secrets his demon was always desperate to unearth, always prowling through their heads to find, listening to their thoughts. Thoughts Amun then heard himself.</p><p>That was hard enough, but bearable. If that had been his only ability, he thought he might have been able to live a normal life. But his demon could also steal those memories, each new voice joining the thousands of others already floating through his head, increasing in volume until finally blending with his own, so that he could no longer distinguish which were truly his.</p><p>It was as if he had lived the life of the person whose memories he took. Whether that life was good\u2014or utterly horrific.</p><p>Swiping thoughts was something Amun hated to do, but sometimes it was necessary. Learning what your enemy knew and had planned could win a battle. Making that enemy forget could win a war. So, though he hated it, he would use his demon in that way without hesitation. And had, over and over again.</p><p>A woman\u2019s giggling snagged his attention, and he opened his eyes. He didn\u2019t have to see her to know who was approaching his hideaway. Olivia, the angel. Aeron was in hot pursuit of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amun could already hear their thoughts.</p><p>Gods, her laugh is sexy as hell.</p><p>If I use my wings, he won\u2019t be able to catch me, and I really want him to catch me. Almost...got...her...</p> <p>He\u2019s almost got me!</p><p>A panting, grinning Olivia broke through the bush, spotted Amun and grabbed the dagger strapped to the outside of her thigh beneath her robe. When she realized who he was, she stopped, relaxed and waved.</p><p>Not expecting her sudden pause, Aeron rushed through the bush a second later and slammed into her, propelling them both to the ground. Aeron twisted midway, taking the brunt of the fall. But Olivia\u2019s glorious white wings spread and flapped, easing their momentum, and they settled gently on a bed of leaves.</p><p>\u201cGot you at last, sweetheart,\u201d Aeron said with a mock growl, attempting to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d Olivia protested, gaze darting to Amun. \u201cWe have company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCompany?\u201d The warrior popped to his feet, already reaching for his own weapon, as well as flipping Olivia to her stomach, doubtless to protect her vital organs. When he saw Amun, he, too, relaxed. And, if Amun wasn\u2019t mistaken, he blushed. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Hey, Amun signed. He would have loved to greet his friend properly, would have loved to talk with him, but Amun knew too well the dangers of opening his mouth while all those voices fought for release. One word, and they would overrun him. They would smash through his defenses and become all that he knew. Everyone around him would then hear what he was forced to listen to on a daily basis.</p><p>He loved his friends too much to subject them to such poison. Besides, he was used to it. They were not.</p><p>Aeron helped Olivia to her feet and brushed the leaves and twigs from her gleaming white robe. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Again, Amun signed his reply.</p><p>Aeron just watched him blankly. The warrior was learning the language, but wasn\u2019t proficient yet. \u201cSlow down, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s on a mini-vacation,\u201d Olivia supplied.</p><p>Amun nodded to let Aeron know the female was correct.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go, then,\u201d Aeron said.</p><p>Stay. Please. Olivia had no secrets, no sins, something Amun adored about her. She was the most open, honest and innocent person Amun had ever met. And Aeron, well, Amun already knew all of his secrets. They were nothing new to his demon, therefore his demon remained dormant while in the warrior\u2019s presence.</p><p>Their thoughts, though, were another matter. Amun was helpless to do anything but listen to what went on inside their heads. To him, it was as if they were speaking aloud. Aeron thought, How can I get out of here without hurting his feelings? And Olivia thought, How sad Amun looks. I should cheer him up.</p><p>\u201cWe would love to stay with you,\u201d Olivia replied, and clasped Aeron\u2019s hand.</p><p>The former keeper of Wrath scowled at her. Clearly, he\u2019d wanted to spend the next few hours rolling around with her, naked, not talking with Amun.</p><p>Amun tried not to grin. If there was one thing he enjoyed more than this time alone, it was teasing his friends. He didn\u2019t get to do it often, as quiet as he had to be, so he worked with what he was given.</p> <p>Thank you. I would love to spend time with you.</p><p>\u201cThen we shall spend as much as you\u2019ll allow us,\u201d Olivia responded happily.</p><p>Aeron\u2019s scowl deepened, and Amun fought a laugh. As Olivia tucked her wings into her back, she led the shirtless warrior toward Amun\u2019s chair and gave him a little push.</p><p>He settled with a heavy sigh, his many guns and daggers clanking together. Once, Aeron\u2019s entire body had been a canvas of tattoos. Dark tattoos of death and violence to remind himself of the things he\u2019d done, and the things he might do again if he wasn\u2019t careful. But not too long ago, Aeron had been killed and miraculously brought back to life. His resurrected body was tattoo-free.</p><p>Or had been.</p><p>Aeron had already begun decorating himself again. This time, however, the images were almost comical. Olivia\u2019s name claimed the spot just above his heart, and her face was etched in perfect detail on his wrist. He even had black wings tattooed on his back, reminiscent of the wings he\u2019d lost during his transformation.</p><p>\u201cOh, is that beer?\u201d Olivia clapped excitedly as she settled on Aeron\u2019s lap. Her dark curls bounced around her shoulders, intermittently hiding and revealing the glittery flower petals woven throughout. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to try beer.\u201d</p><p>Amun shoved the cooler away from her, even as Aeron shouted, \u201cNo! No trying beer.\u201d Then, more calmly, \u201cSweetheart. No. Please.\u201d</p><p>Too well did they recall the last time Olivia had indulged with alcohol. Without a doubt, she was the world\u2019s saddest drunk.</p><p>A huff escaped her. \u201cFine. I won\u2019t taste it.\u201d</p><p>Aeron relaxed. Maybe because he had no idea she planned to guzzle it instead of taste it.</p><p>Before she could reach for a bottle, Amun clapped for her attention. You look very pretty today. And she did. Her cheeks were rosy, and her sky-blue eyes bright. Love radiated from her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied, beaming up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d Aeron demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I look very pretty.\u201d</p><p>The warrior\u2019s lips pursed. \u201cI told you that a few minutes ago and you ran from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was going to reward you when you caught me.\u201d</p><p>The warrior\u2019s narrowing violet eyes landed on Amun. Why\u2019d you have to be here? he thought, knowing Amun heard. Now I have to wait for my reward. \u201cSo. Do you come here often?\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>Trying to appear somber, Amun nodded.</p><p>That violet gaze shifted, perusing their surroundings. \u201cI can see why. It\u2019s nice here. Peaceful.\u201d</p><p>Which was one of the reasons Olivia had chosen to lead him down this path. She\u2019d wanted her man to forget his troubles, if only for a little while, and simply enjoy.</p><p>A paradise, certainly, Amun signed.</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you worried about Hunters sneaking up on you?\u201d Olivia asked, and seemed to sink into herself. Hate was not part of her makeup, he knew, but she didn\u2019t like the pain those men had brought her man.</p><p>Were you?</p><p>She blushed, and Aeron choked on what seemed to be a bout of laughter. That, he\u2019d apparently understood.</p><p>Actually, with the iron fence around the property and Torin having this place monitored 24/7, I\u2019m not worried about anything but relaxation.</p><p>Torin, keeper of Disease. The poor man couldn\u2019t touch anyone skin-to-skin without infecting them with some sort of sickness. Of course, that sickness wouldn\u2019t kill immortals, but it would infect them and they in turn would infect everyone they touched. Therefore, Torin spent most of his time alone in his room.</p><p>Well, not so alone anymore.</p><p>Amun had picked up on his thoughts, as well as Cameo\u2019s. Cameo was keeper of Misery, and the two had been engaged in a passionate affair of You-can\u2019t-touch-me-but-you-can-watch-me-while-I-pretend-you-are for weeks. Both knew it wouldn\u2019t last, but they were enjoying the hell out of each other right now. So much so that Amun often wanted to cut off his own skull and dig out his brain, just for a few moments of peace.</p><p>\u201cWe really didn\u2019t mean to intrude on your relaxation time,\u201d Aeron said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just be on our\u2014\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s mine is yours.</p><p>Aeron\u2019s shoulders slumped, and Amun fought another laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but my darling is right. You deserve to relax in peace. So why don\u2019t you take half the forest, and we\u2019ll take the other half? No, that won\u2019t work,\u201d she rushed on. \u201cWe\u2019ll just stress about the dividing line.\u201d</p><p>Silly woman.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. We can work out a schedule.\u201d Olivia grinned, proud of herself. \u201cSomething like, you get Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and we get Tuesdays and Thursdays.\u201d</p><p>Or I get every day, since I\u2019ve already staked a claim. And you can visit me upon occasion.</p><p>\u201cOr you thank us for allowing you even those three days,\u201d Aeron retorted when Olivia translated. \u201cOtherwise, we might spill your secret and then every last person living in the fortress will start coming here.\u201d</p><p>Amun flipped him off, a sign that needed no interpreting.</p><p>The booming laugh that next escaped his friend was like soothing balm to his ears. Before Olivia, and the events that led to Aeron\u2019s death, Aeron had never exhibited such merriment. He\u2019d been very much like Amun projected himself to be. And, truthfully, most often was. Somber. Sorrowful. Almost grief-stricken.</p><p>What\u2019s it like? Living without a demon? So many centuries had passed, Amun barely remembered how it had been, living in the heavens, carefree and without interference.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Aeron leaned back until his shoulders were resting against a tree trunk. He pulled Olivia with him, and helped her curl herself around him. \u201cAmazing. There\u2019s no voice in the back of my head, beseeching me to do terrible things. There\u2019s no urge to hurt or maim or kill. But it\u2019s also...odd. I hadn\u2019t realized how much I\u2019d come to rely on the bastard, uh, fiend\u2014sorry, sweetheart\u2014for information about people. I\u2019m having to relearn how to read people\u2019s intentions.\u201d</p><p>Amun knew that, because of Wrath, the warrior had sensed a person\u2019s sins the moment he\u2019d neared them. He\u2019d then become filled with a need to punish them, hurting them the way they\u2019d hurt others.</p><p>You\u2019ll adapt.</p><p>\u201cSoon, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe good news is that he\u2019s not as moody,\u201d Olivia added.</p><p>Lips twitching, Aeron kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cAll thanks to you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Amun\u2019s heart gave a little lurch. In happiness for what his friend had found. And yes, in jealousy. He wanted a female of his own. Desperately. He\u2019d found one he could have enjoyed, too. Kaia, a Harpy. She was a liar and a thief, but she was open about it, her sins there for everyone to see. She kept no secrets.</p><p>But she\u2019d also slept with Paris, keeper of Promiscuity and one of Amun\u2019s closest friends. Not that Paris wanted her again or could have her even if he did. Once Paris slept with a woman, he couldn\u2019t get hard for her again. That was part of his curse. But while Amun knew the little Harpy was intrigued by him, he also knew she would not be settling down anytime soon. And Amun wanted forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With other women, human women, well, it was too difficult. He knew what they were thinking every minute of every day. He knew when they found another man attractive. He knew when they said something nice to him but were thinking something cruel.</p><p>Aeron sighed, drawing his attention back to the present. I\u2019m here. I might as well ask him, the warrior thought.</p><p>Amun straightened. He\u2019d known Aeron would approach him sooner or later with the coming question, but hadn\u2019t known how to respond. He still didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t ask me, he signed. Not yet.</p> <p>A muscle ticked beneath his friend\u2019s eye. \u201cI hate when you read my mind.\u201d</p><p>Then conceal your thoughts. He didn\u2019t think there was a way to do so, though. No one had ever managed such a feat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Aeron confirmed. \u201cWhich means you already know that Olivia and I are leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Actually, no. That wasn\u2019t true. Aeron planned to leave Olivia behind, she just didn\u2019t know it yet. The warrior was desperate to keep her safe. Which, in his mind, meant leaving her here, even though she would be pissed.</p><p>Where are you going? he asked, though again, he already knew the answer.</p> <p>\u201cTo hell,\u201d Aeron replied. It wasn\u2019t a metaphor, either. The man meant exactly what he said. \u201cWe want you to come with us.\u201d</p><p>Legion, the little demon Aeron viewed as a daughter, was currently trapped in the fiery realm, and Aeron had ever intention of rescuing her. Had the warrior asked Amun to go anywhere else, he would have said yes without hesitation. But hell...he shuddered. His demon had lived there, once upon a time. That same demon had fought to escape, had succeeded, and had been punished for that success.</p><p>But the memories of that place had never faded. The heat, the screams, the rank odors of sulfur and rotting flesh that permeated the air. Disgusting. Add in the vile thoughts of the demons still living there and the tormented thoughts of the souls suffering there, and it was a new kind of hell for Amun.</p><p>What about Baden? he asked. Another of Aeron\u2019s pressing burdens.</p><p>Aeron arched a black brow. \u201cYou know about that, too. Great.\u201d</p><p>Baden. Once their best friend. But thousands of years ago, Hunters had beheaded him. Unlike Aeron, he hadn\u2019t been given a second chance at life. He hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve one, apparently. But Aeron, who had recently spent a little time in the afterlife, had seen him. Talked to him.</p> <p>Baden was out there. Baden could be freed, returned to them like Aeron. They just had to find a way to convince any deity who would listen to bring him back to life.</p><p>Aeron had kept this information to himself. But then, that was a habit they shared. Aeron liked to weigh all the facts, find any possible solutions, before mentioning a potential problem to the others. That had never been more evident than now. Aeron no longer suffered but all the others did, and he didn\u2019t want to add to their suffering until he could offer a resolution.</p><p>\u201cOnce Legion is safe,\u201d Aeron said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell the others about Baden. We can then concentrate on freeing him. But Legion has to come first. She\u2019s suffering. He is not.\u201d</p><p>And the Hunters? The artifacts? Pandora\u2019s box? Will you forget those? Now that you\u2019re without a demon, they must not concern you anymore.</p><p>A scowl darkened Aeron\u2019s face, shadows seeming to seep from his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. They concern me greatly. I don\u2019t want to watch my best friends die because I allowed my enemy to find the artifacts. I don\u2019t want to watch my best friends die because I wasn\u2019t there to protect them. But I love Legion, too. She\u2019s being tortured down there and I can\u2019t stand it. I have to free her, or I\u2019ll be no good to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Even after what she did to you?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aeron replied without hesitation.</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cYes. Me, too.\u201d</p> <p>Amun expected such forgiveness from Olivia. She was an angel and, as he\u2019d already realized, didn\u2019t know how to hate. She couldn\u2019t even hold on to a good anger. But Aeron? Forgiving a female for making a bargain with the devil, nearly ruining his life by almost killing his angel? Shocking. But maybe forgiveness came more easily to him now that he was without his demon\u2019s need for vengeance.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner we find her, the sooner we free Baden, and the sooner I can concentrate on the artifacts and the Hunters,\u201d Aeron added.</p><p>Many reasons to go, yes, but none overshadowed Amun\u2019s reasons for staying behind. Are you asking anyone else to go with you?</p><p>The back of Aeron\u2019s head banged against the tree, once, twice, and he peered up at the ocean of sky. \u201cNo. I hated even asking you. I don\u2019t want to leave the fortress unprotected or task the warriors with something else to do.\u201d</p><p>So, why me? Aeron had never thought the answer outright, and Amun had never pulled it from his friend\u2019s mind, so he honestly didn\u2019t know. The other warriors were just as strong as he was, just as skilled at warring and killing.</p><p>\u201cSecrets,\u201d Olivia said with a sad little sigh. \u201cYour demon will be able to learn where Legion is being held.\u201d</p><p>That made sense, and Amun nearly moaned. Because it meant they needed him specifically. Not for his brawn, but for his demon. No one else would do. How, then, could he tell them no? He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his suddenly tired face. Though everything and everyone inside him began screaming in protest, making him wince, he nodded. If I agree to do this, you\u2019ll have to ask one more. To take Olivia\u2019s place and better their odds of success. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>William.</p><p>William was an immortal of some sort, though none of them knew exactly what he was. The man liked to think of himself as a sex god, that much Amun knew. He\u2019d sleep with anyone\u2014and had. A man of few standards, no question. But he loved fighting almost as much as he loved sex, and he wasn\u2019t possessed by a demon. Therefore, the darkness of the underworld wouldn\u2019t frighten him. And if Amun fell as he suspected he would, there would be someone there to help Aeron leave.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Aeron said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p><p>Amun sighed, as sad as Olivia had been. Then count me in.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>THE BLOOD... the girl saw it in her mind, dripping, flowing, rushing. The screams...she heard them in her ears, agonized, evil. The darkness...it surrounded her, closing in tighter and tighter, nearly suffocating her.</p><p>How long this had been going on, she didn\u2019t know. Time had ceased to exist for her. There was only pain and chaos. And fire. Oh, God, the fire. She could smell the fumes, the scent of rotting bodies and brimstone.Tears leaked from the corners of her eyes, scalding her cheeks. She was lying in a bed, knees drawn up to her chest. Over and over she shivered from cold, and yet, she was still burning up inside. Someone had carried her here. She couldn\u2019t remember who. She only knew that the moment he had set her down, she had attacked him, unable to help herself. So badly she\u2019d wanted to bathe in his blood. She\u2019d wanted to hear his scream join all the others.</p><p>If he\u2019d survived, she didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care. Would have actually welcomed another victim, and she hated herself for it.</p><p>\u201cHow are you today, pet?\u201d</p><p>The words were barely audible through the screams, but she understood them all the same. And she didn\u2019t have to open her eyes to know who now stood beside her bed. Cronus. King of the gods...her master.</p><p>Can\u2019t hurt him. Can\u2019t allow myself to hurt him. He would punish her. Again.</p><p>Hurt him, another beguiling voice whispered through her head. It would feel so good.</p><p>Can\u2019t. Any more pain, and she would crumble. Forever lost.</p><p>Once she\u2019d been known as Sienna Blackstone. Once, she\u2019d been human. Once, she\u2019d been a Hunter. Then she\u2019d fallen for Paris, keeper of Promiscuity, and slept with him to strengthen him. Big mistake. The empowered warrior had decided to use her\u2014as a shield. He\u2019d abducted her just as she\u2019d once abducted him, allowing her own people to gun her down.</p><p>At the time, she hadn\u2019t thought it was possible to feel such agony. Liking a man, only to discover he couldn\u2019t care less about you. Bullets, slicing into flesh. Life, slipping away. She laughed bitterly now. How foolish she\u2019d been. That hadn\u2019t been agony. That had been a massage. This was agony.</p><p>Her back felt as if it had been dipped in acid and salt. Two hard things were growing between her shoulder blades, sprouting from the ruined flesh. Horns, perhaps. Or maybe wings. Every so often, she thought she felt them flutter.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Punish, that beguiling voice commanded. Take all that he claims as his, and then take his head.</p><p>Though her head was already filled with more evil than she could bear, new images began taking residence. She saw all the things Cronus had stolen over the centuries: artifacts, power, women. She saw all the lives he\u2019d taken\u2014and exactly how he\u2019d taken them. So many. Oh, there were so many lives cut short because of his greed. Not just his enemies, but his own people. Even humans. Anyone who had gotten in his way. Blood flowed, and the screams reached a new crescendo.</p><p>Oh, God. Moaning, she pressed the heels of her palms into her eyes. Had she known what awaited her in the afterlife, had she known what kind of person he truly was, she would not have allowed him to lead her to the heavens.</p><p>She would have stayed with Paris. A man she\u2019d thought she hated with every fiber of her being.</p><p>That hatred for him must have anchored her to his side, because her spirit had followed him for several days after her body died. He hadn\u2019t been able to see her, hadn\u2019t sensed her in any way. She\u2019d watched as he\u2019d given her a warrior\u2019s funeral; that had surprised her. She\u2019d watched as he\u2019d cried for her; that had confused her. She\u2019d watched as he\u2019d mourned for her; that had, unexpectedly, touched her.</p><p>Her anger with him had begun to drain. She\u2019d thought: even though he used me, he must have truly cared about me. And if he was capable of caring, he must not be the evil creature she\u2019d been led to believe.</p><p>But then his body had begun to weaken and Sienna had been forgotten. To regain his strength, he\u2019d slept with some random stranger. And then another. And another. He hadn\u2019t cared about a single one of them. He hadn\u2019t cared that they\u2019d wanted more from him than a mere bedding. He\u2019d walked away afterward and never looked back. Just as he would have done to her if she hadn\u2019t captured him for her boss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her anger had returned, hotter than before.</p><p>That\u2019s when Cronus had appeared before her. \u201cCome with me,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cand you will live again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to live again.\u201d The life she\u2019d led had not been the stuff of dreams.

There would be no evil in the world, no more abductions, if Pandora\u2019s demons were destroyed, she\u2019d been told.</p> <p>Cronus, though, had not given up.</p><p>\u201cYou can avenge your death, then,\u201d he\u2019d replied.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that, either.\u201d She\u2019d just wanted to pass quietly into the afterlife, the world and its inhabitants forgotten. Perhaps there she would have found her sister.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you want. But I can see your desires in your eyes, whether you admit them or not. You\u2019re desperate for a second chance. You want what you were denied. A family. Someone to protect you, to cherish you. Someone to love you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cAnd how will I get that with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m creating an army. A holy army of warriors the likes of which you have never seen. You can be a part of that.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s how he planned to find someone to protect, cherish and love her? \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot do this without you.\u201d</p><p>Why? She was too frail to win a physical altercation and had always been a little too timid to call anyone on their shit. That\u2019s why Dean Stefano, her boss, had always used her in the office, researching demon lore. She\u2019d been flabbergasted when he\u2019d asked her to seduce Paris and at first, she\u2019d said no.</p><p>Then she\u2019d seen his picture. No man was more exquisite, sensual in ways no mortal could ever hope to be. Her heart had raced and her palms had actually sweated, desperate to touch him. As plain as she was, no one like him had ever paid her any notice. As beautiful as he was, she hadn\u2019t understood how he could house such evil.</p><p>The desire to meet him, to see that evil for herself, had become an obsession. So she\u2019d finally said yes. She\u2019d arranged an \u201caccidental\u201d meeting in Athens. He\u2019d been interested in her, which had made her feel special. She almost hadn\u2019t drugged him, had almost sent him on his way. But then she\u2019d noticed the red tint bleeding into his eyes, glowing, broadcasting his malevolence for the entire world to see. There\u2019d been no denying his origins then. He was evil, even though he kissed like an angel. And maybe, just maybe, if she helped destroy him, the world really would become a better place to live. Maybe child abductions really would end. So she\u2019d done it. She\u2019d drugged him.</p> <p>And she had died for her efforts.</p><p>And, terribly enough, what did she regret most? Not enjoying him, fully, completely. Just the two of them, worries forgotten. What came in only a distant second? Not killing him.</p><p>\u201cJoin me,\u201d Cronus had added, \u201cand you\u2019ll meet Paris again. I swear it. He\u2019ll be yours to do with as you please.\u201d</p><p>His words were proof that he did indeed know what she wanted, whether she would admit it aloud or not. See Paris again? Have the warrior at her mercy? Yes! And yet, it hadn\u2019t been enough. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut more than that,\u201d he continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cI will ensure you see your sister again.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d nearly grabbed him and shook him, so great was her shock. \u201cYou know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s alive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. Thank God, thank God, thank God. \u201cThen yes,\u201d she\u2019d said without hesitation. \u201cYes, I will help you. Now. Hurry. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are saying that you will be mine, my soldier. Yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you take me to my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. One day.\u201d</p><p>Her sense of urgency intensified. \u201cWhy not now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mission comes first. Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>No. But she\u2019d said, \u201cYes.\u201d Anything to see her precious Skye again.</p><p>\u201cThen it is done.\u201d He\u2019d grinned slowly, satisfaction radiating from him, and whisked her to this palace in the heavens.</p><p>Had she gotten to see her sister yet? No. Had he trained her to fight? No. Had he sent her on that mission, whatever it was? Again, no. He\u2019d simply kept her here, alone unless he visited or summoned her, with nothing to do but think. And hate.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to leave, but she couldn\u2019t. She was bound to Cronus in a way she still didn\u2019t understand. A way she couldn\u2019t refute or disobey. Whatever he asked of her, she did, compelled by a force she could not defeat. Even though she\u2019d tried to do so, countless times.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question,\u201d Cronus said now, drawing her from her memories and straight back to the pain pulverizing her. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse.\u201d A whimper.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI had hoped otherwise, for I\u2019m eager to use you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did I forget to tell you?\u201d He laughed, the sound carefree. \u201cYou now carry the demon of Wrath inside you.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside her stilled. The screams. Her spirit\u2019s heartbeat. Even the darkness ceased swirling. The demon of Wrath was...inside her?</p><p>No. No, no, no! She was not one of them. Couldn\u2019t be one of them. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. You have to be lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. It\u2019s trying to make itself at home in your mind, and its wings are sprouting from your back.\u201d</p><p>Panic built, spread. Wings, he\u2019d said. Exactly as she\u2019d suspected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can hear its thoughts by now, urging you to do things you wouldn\u2019t normally want to do.\u201d</p><p>Oh. God. He had. He\u2019d truly done it. He\u2019d paired her with a demon. Noooo! This time, the word was a wail inside her. He\u2019d made her the very thing she\u2019d fought against. The very thing she\u2019d hoped to destroy.</p><p>A sob burst from her. \u201cYou bastard! You\u2019ve cursed me!\u201d</p><p>He huffed and puffed, insulted. \u201cHow dare you take that tone with me? I\u2019ve blessed you. How could you fight for me as a mere human, a lost soul? The answer is simple. You could not. And so I gave you a way to do so.\u201d</p><p>The tears streaming from her eyes burned as if they were carving grooves into her cheeks. \u201cYou ruined me in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day you will thank me,\u201d he said confidently.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. One day I\u2019ll kill you for this.\u201d A vow.</p><p>Heavy silence slithered between them, a hungry snake ready for its meal. \u201cYou threaten me even though I brought you a present.\u201d He tsked. \u201cSomeone you were dying to see.\u201d Skye?</p><p>Not daring to breathe, Sienna forced her eyelids open, and through the blur of her vision she saw that there really was a female standing next to the god king. The girl reached his shoulders, had a mane of dark hair like Sienna\u2019s own and olive skin. Her facial features were obscured by shadows, but that didn\u2019t stop Sienna\u2019s heart from thundering inside her chest.</p><p>Trembling, Sienna reached out. \u201cSister?\u201d</p><p>There was a rustle of clothing as the pair moved away from her. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve a present today, pet. Therefore, you will not get one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d</p><p>Silence. The two turned away and marched off. The girl never uttered a word of protest.</p><p>\u201cSkye!\u201d she shouted again. \u201cSkye! Come back. Talk to me.\u201d The last choked from her, tangling up in the hard knot forming in her throat.</p><p>Again, there was no response.</p><p>Sienna collapsed against her bed, new sobs racking her. How could Cronus have done this to her? How could he be so cruel?</p><p>He must pay. He must suffer.</p><p>The deep voice whisked through her head, and she jerked in shock and revulsion. Shut up, shut up, shut up. I know what you are. I hate you.</p><p>The insult had no effect. He must pay. He must suffer as you suffer.</p><p>Expecting the voice this time, she didn\u2019t jerk. She stilled. She even began to ponder. The demon of Wrath was inside her. And helpless and sick as she was, there was nothing she could do about that. Yet. So why not use it? Just once? Just to balance the scales and make things right?</p><p>\u201cH-how? How do I make him suffer as I now suffer?\u201d Oh, God. She was talking to a demon. Stop! It was weird and wrong...yet oddly freeing. There would be no stopping. Cronus had to pay for this.</p><p>You must steal that which he values most.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d Whatever the answer, she would do as the demon suggested and steal it. She would not hesitate. Cronus had thrown her into this terrible fire; he could burn with her. \u201cHis wife? His children?\u201d</p><p>His power.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Another vow. But just how was she supposed to steal power from a god?</p><p>He will pay. He will suffer.</p><p>Yes. Gradually, her tears dried and her heartbeat calmed. The lump in her throat dissolved. Cold seeped through her, filling her up, consuming her. \u201cHe will pay. He will suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVISIT HELL? No damn way.\u201d</p><p>Amun stood in front of the large plasma screen in the entertainment room, facing William. This had been the only way to get the man\u2019s attention. Whenever Amun had knocked on William\u2019s bedroom door, he\u2019d been told to go away. Whenever he\u2019d followed William into town, the warrior had ignored him as he plundered his way through the female population, one\u2014or two\u2014at a time. Sometimes the bastard had even done his business with Amun standing there.Now, William was a captive audience. Because Amun had brought in reinforcements. Anya, the goddess of Anarchy. As powerful and vindictive as she was, she could make anyone do anything she wanted at any time. Especially William.</p><p>The two were best friends and loved to torture each other. Which was why Anya had stolen some book that belonged to William. A very important book, apparently, and one the warrior needed to save himself from some curse. The two were always careful to keep those details buried behind inane thoughts while in Amun\u2019s presence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could have sifted through their minds to gain the answers, of course, but hadn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t need any more secrets, thank you very much.</p><p>He did know that whenever William acted like a \u201cgood boy,\u201d Anya returned a few pages to him. So when Anya challenged William to a game of \u201cGuitar Hero,\u201d along with Gilly, a teen who now lived at the fortress, William had accepted. The three were positioned around the TV, where Anya had stated they would remain until Amun had said his piece. Or signed, as the case was.</p><p>We need your help rescuing Legion, Amun began.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, but I have plans elsewhere,\u201d William said darkly. \u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow morning, and I\u2019ll be gone for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plans?\u201d Gilly demanded, fingering the butterfly necklace Lucien had given her earlier. A necklace exactly like the one Amun, Anya and William also wore. They had been told to wear them always, to block their actions from the prying eyes of the gods. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Whoa. What was that? Pure possessiveness had layered her words.</p><p>You\u2019re mine, he suddenly heard Gilly think. We belong together, not apart.</p><p>O-kay. Amun massaged the back of his neck. He hadn\u2019t needed to know that.</p> <p>Expression tight, William tossed his drumsticks in the air, caught them and twirled them. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter why I kept you in the dark. I\u2019m going and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>And wow. William usually joked about everything. He took nothing seriously. That he was in this temper...</p><p>I\u2019ve got to stop this, William thought. This can\u2019t go on.</p><p>Good. That was good.</p><p>\u201cThis trip is final, you said?\u201d Anya arched a brow at her friend, her lips curling in challenge. She was engaged to Lucien, keeper of Death, and was one of the most beautiful females Amun had ever seen. Not surprisingly, Lucien indulged her every whim. \u201cYou didn\u2019t yet clear this trip with me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go without me,\u201d Gilly said.</p> <p>\u201cI can and I will. And don\u2019t threaten me, Anya. This is one thing I will see through no matter what you do to my book.\u201d</p><p>Her expression a storm cloud of fury, Gilly tossed her bass guitar on the floor. The plastic cracked. Exactly as she imagined her heart was doing. \u201cYou promised to protect me always. How can you protect me if you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>She had straight brown hair and big, beautiful brown eyes. She was average height, but had more curves than any seventeen-year-old girl should have. And William was clearly doing his best not to look at her.</p><p>He was failing. Must...stop. Why can\u2019t I make it stop?</p><p>As though a book of his own opened up in Amun\u2019s mind, with everyone\u2019s secrets filling the pages, Amun suddenly knew exactly what was going on. Gilly thought she was in love with William. William was attracted to the girl and horrified because of it. She was too young for him.</p><p>But while William could do nothing about his desire for Gilly, he could do something about his thirst for justice. Gilly had been terribly abused as a child, and William had tracked down her family with every intention of killing them in the slowest, most painful of ways. That\u2019s where he was going. To Nebraska to have his revenge. Wouldn\u2019t be difficult, either. The mother was a housewife and the stepfather a doctor.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you. I will always protect you,\u201d William told her gently. He stood, reached for her, but realized what he was doing and dropped his arms to his sides. \u201cYou have to trust me on this.\u201d</p><p>Amun clapped his hands for their attention. Help me help Aeron and then I\u2019ll help you with the girl\u2019s family.</p> <p>William\u2019s attention had already wandered. He hadn\u2019t watched Amun\u2019s hands and had no idea what Amun had said. As Anya realized what Amun was implying, her blue eyes widened. Rather than voice the words for him in English or Hungarian, allowing Gilly to understand, she spoke to William in the language of the gods. The rough sounds were music to Amun\u2019s ears, reminding him of the carefree years he\u2019d spend in the heavens.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d William growled in the same language. Stiff, he tangled a hand through hair the color of the darkest night. \u201cActually, I want to do this alone. And besides that, Legion annoyed me. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s gone. I think it\u2019s safe to say I wouldn\u2019t rescue my own mother from hell. If I had one. I wouldn\u2019t even rescue Anya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d the goddess said with a roll of her eyes. \u201cBut listen. Aeron isn\u2019t glad she\u2019s gone.\u201d Her voice was gentler than Amun had ever heard it. \u201cWhich means Lucien isn\u2019t glad. Which means I\u2019m not glad.\u201d</p><p>William remained unmoving. \u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucifer is afraid of you, Willy. In hell, you\u2019ll be able to do things and go places Aeron and Amun can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, William\u2019s mind opened, gearing up to recall exactly why Lucifer feared him. But then he shut down the memory, which meant that Amun couldn\u2019t read it, not without digging, and that still wasn\u2019t something Amun wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d William said with a shrug. \u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Just as stubborn, Anya persisted. \u201cWilliam, think about what you\u2019re turning down. When you\u2019re with Gilly\u2019s family, you won\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking, what they fear, what other terrible things they\u2019ve done. But Amun will. He can tell you. And you can do more than hurt and kill them. You can terrorize them.\u201d</p><p>Gilly tossed her hands in the air. \u201cWill someone please speak in English and tell me what\u2019s going on? Someone? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anya and William said in unison.</p><p>\u201cGod! You guys are so lame. You want to act like I\u2019m not here? Fine. I\u2019ll do you one better. I\u2019ll leave. I don\u2019t know why I hang around you, anyway.\u201d With that, Gilly flounced out of the room.</p><p>Scowling, William jabbed one of his sticks through his drums. \u201cFine. Count me in, Amun. I\u2019ll go to hell with you and Aeron. Afterward, you\u2019ll help me deliver hell to my humans. Got it?\u201d</p><p>For better or worse, Amun nodded.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>WHEN SCARLET sat up and opened her eyes to a brand-new evening, she had no idea what to expect. After her \u201cwe had a son\u201d bombshell, Gideon had basically gone into shock. He\u2019d been silent, withdrawn, and she hadn\u2019t forced a confrontation because she\u2019d wanted him to have time to absorb the astonishing news.</p><p>Before he could do so, however, the sun had risen and she\u2019d fallen asleep, lost to her demon. She\u2019d been too distracted to participate in their usual terror games and didn\u2019t even know who they\u2019d targeted.\u201cWere you lying? Don\u2019t tell me!\u201d</p><p>The words whipped at her, and she quickly focused. Gideon hadn\u2019t moved her from the forest. Trees still surrounded her, birds and insects still sang. The spring still bubbled, and mist still wafted. There was no waning sunlight, no violet sky, only a thick blanket of dark, heavy clouds. A storm was brewing.</p><p>In more ways than one.</p><p>Gideon was bathed in shadows. Shadows her gaze had no trouble penetrating. His blue locks were wet and plastered to his brow, his cheeks, yet were still a gorgeous frame for the upsetting lines of tension that spread from his temples to his mouth. His eyes were like lasers, boring past the mental shields she surrounded herself with. His expression was tight, fierce, his lips pulled back from his teeth in a scowl.</p><p>He stood in front of her, a dagger in each hand.</p><p>Breath suddenly trapped in her throat, she swept her gaze over her body. There were no cuts on her arms or legs, and her dress was in one piece. There wasn\u2019t a single spot of blood to indicate he\u2019d injured her.</p><p>Okay. So. He hadn\u2019t attacked her in fury. Did that mean he could get away without saying, \u201cWho aren\u2019t you today?\u201d Did that mean he could get away with not kissing her awake?</p><p>Gods, his kiss. She reached up and traced her fingertips over her mouth. A mouth that still tingled. His tongue had plundered and taken and given. Taken so much passion. Given so much pleasure. His hands had been everywhere, touching her, learning her. And his body, so hard and hot against hers, had transported her back to the heavens. Locked up, helpless still, but uncaring because she had her man. A man who loved her.</p><p>It had been so long since she\u2019d given in to the demands of her body. So long since she\u2019d lost control. Gideon hadn\u2019t seemed to mind that loss. No, he\u2019d seemed to enjoy it. He\u2019d come on her belly and marked her as if they still belonged together.</p><p>Afterward, she\u2019d wanted to cuddle up to his side. She\u2019d wanted to kiss his neck and breathe in his musky scent. She\u2019d wanted to spill every secret, talk about everything they\u2019d once shared.</p><p>But she knew him, knew this man who had no clue about what she\u2019d once meant to him. And she\u2019d known beyond any doubt that that\u2019s what he had planned. He\u2019d taken her from prison into paradise, simply for answers. Answers he would attempt to unearth through fair means or foul.</p><p>He\u2019d always been that way. When determination set in, Gideon was more stubborn than she was. It was as annoying as it was wonderful. For once he\u2019d decided that she was to be his bride, he\u2019d moved heaven and earth to make it happen. Despite the odds against them.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be used in that way, however. She wouldn\u2019t let him think he could fuck her\u2014or almost fuck her\u2014and get his way.</p><p>\u201cScar. You\u2019re not pissing me the hell off. Don\u2019t pay attention to me.\u201d He tossed one of the daggers with a lethal flick of his wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet whipped around, following the movement of the blade. The tip was now embedded in the tree trunk, vibrating. And there were hundreds of grooves in the bark. He\u2019d been tossing that thing all day, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly, facing him again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d Steel was not something she would lie about. Ever. For any reason. He had been\u2014was still\u2014the most important person in her life.</p><p>A ragged breath left Gideon. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say was. His name was. That means he\u2019s...he\u2019s...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Absolute agony contorted Gideon\u2019s features. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have told him about the boy. Sometimes she wished she didn\u2019t know; it was just too painful. But part of her had thought, hoped, that Gideon would have retained knowledge about his own child. Knowledge that might have led to memories of his wife.</p><p>\u201cAll of it. I don\u2019t want to know all of it.\u201d As he spoke, he sank to his knees, the knuckles wrapped around the second blade leaching of color. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>Seeing such a strong warrior reduced to such bleakness tore at her, and she had to blink back a rush of stinging tears. If she told him now, it wouldn\u2019t be because of sex. It would be because he\u2019d begged. At least, that\u2019s how she rationalized this new need to share. Everything.</p><p>\u201cAll right, yes,\u201d she said, no less hoarse as her harsh, jagged breath scraped against her chest cavity. \u201cI\u2019ll tell. Tell you everything about his life and his death, but you can\u2019t speak. If you interrupt me with questions I may not be able to continue.\u201d Emotion would choke her. She would break down, sob, and no way would she allow Gideon to see her like that. This was going to be hard enough. \u201cGot me?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed, Gideon remaining still, silent. What danced through his head, what made him hesitate to agree, she didn\u2019t know. All she knew was that talking about Steel wasn\u2019t something she did. Ever. Again, it was just too painful. Even if Gideon remained quiet, she wasn\u2019t sure she would be able to get through this. Definitely not without crying.</p><p>Pretend it\u2019s a story you made up. Distance yourself. Yeah. Right.</p><p>Finally Gideon worked through whatever issue he had with her demand for silence and nodded. His lips were pressed in a thin, mulish line, cutting off any words he might have wanted to speak.</p> <p>Scarlet inhaled deeply, searching for fortification. She didn\u2019t find it. The words simply wouldn\u2019t form.</p><p>She pushed to shaky legs and strode to the tree with the dagger. Gideon didn\u2019t try to stop her as she removed the tip with a jerk. Then she began pacing, tapping the sharp metal against her thigh in a steady, hopefully calming rhythm. A cool, damp breeze fragrant with earth and sky wafted around her, while twigs and rocks cut at the soles of her feet.</p><p>Just say the words. Pretend, pretend, pretend. You\u2019ll be talking about someone else\u2019s life. Someone else\u2019s son. \u201cI told you I was pregnant and you were happy. You petitioned Zeus for my release into your custody. He said no. So you arranged for my escape. Only, I was caught. I was given twenty lashes before you realized I\u2019d failed. They had thought to break me, to force me to tell them who had aided me. I didn\u2019t.\u201d She would have died first.</p><p>\u201cThe pain was manageable, at least, but I was so afraid of losing the baby. My cellmates tried to hurt me, too, but I fought harder than I\u2019d ever fought anyone and was soon given a cell of my own permanently, not just for our...interludes. That\u2019s where I eventually gave birth to our\u2014\u201d her voice caught on the word \u201c\u2014to a beautiful little boy.\u201d</p><p>As the image of Steel flashed through her mind, that sweet boy sleeping on her chest, looking like an angel, she tripped over her own foot. She was shaking as she righted herself.</p><p>True to his word, Gideon remained silent, waiting.</p> <p>The first few drops of rain fell, almost as if nature was crying for her. For all she\u2019d lost.</p><p>Pretend. \u201cYou visited me every day. And every day you stayed a little longer and were a little more reluctant to leave. I feared you would have yourself committed to the prison just to remain at my side.\u201d And she was ashamed to admit she\u2019d liked the idea. \u201cThen one day you came to me, told me you had a new plan to gain my freedom, though you didn\u2019t give me the details at the time. That plan was, of course, to steal Pandora\u2019s box. So needless to say, you never returned.\u201d</p><p>At her sides, the trees began to blur. Her chin trembled, and her cheeks heated, the rain falling more steadily now. Do it. Keep going. She wanted to look down at Gideon but didn\u2019t. His expression, whatever it was, could be her undoing.</p><p>\u201cThen I was possessed by Nightmares, as you know, and I wasn\u2019t a fit mother. So the Greeks took him. Took Steel.\u201d And she\u2019d blamed Gideon more and more for the separation. If only he\u2019d come back for her, for them, how different things could have been. \u201cWhen my head cleared and I realized what had happened, I begged to see him but my cries went unheeded. I tried to escape every day. And every day they whipped me anew.\u201d</p><p>A choking sound left Gideon, but still Scarlet didn\u2019t allow herself to look at him.</p><p>\u201cFinally, I noticed how Tartarus, both the prison and its warden, were weakening. At last I managed to escape and made my way to Olympus. And I...I found our baby.\u201d This time, the choking sound left her. \u201cBut he was a baby no longer. Centuries had passed, but he was only a teenager, his immortality slowing his aging process, I guess. And he...he had no fucking idea who I was.\u201d</p><p>Rain, tears. Both drenched her.</p><p>Pretend, damn you. \u201cHe had grown horns and fangs, his eyes were red and patches of his skin were scaled. That\u2019s when I realized they\u2019d given him a demon, too. Which one, I still don\u2019t know. But he was beautiful, damn it.\u201d The last was screamed, identical to a banshee\u2019s wail, but she couldn\u2019t help herself.</p> <p>Silence. The cool wash of water.</p><p>Finish this. \u201cThey had made him their whipping boy. They laughed at him, kicked him, abused him vilely. There was no happiness in his eyes. Just resolution. He was enduring, proud, strong. A determined warrior. And that just made it worse, you know? I had failed that precious boy in every way, yet he was still everything I could have wanted in a son.\u201d</p><p>Tears continued to leak, tendrils of acid, scorching her cheeks. She wiped them away with the back of her wrist, shaking violently now. Pretend. \u201cI erupted at his treatment. I unleashed my demon in the most horrendous show of violence the heavens had ever seen. By the time I finished, the gods and goddesses around him were driven to insanity, which ultimately aided Cronus in his own escape.</p><p>\u201cBut I digress. When the darkness cleared, I realized Steel was afraid of me. He even fought me when I tried to abscond with him. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him, so I let him run from me. He went to Zeus, the only father figure he\u2019d ever known, and together they chased me down. Not that I tried to hide. I wanted Steel to find me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the serrated lump growing in her throat. \u201cTo Steel\u2019s surprise, Zeus chained us in front of each other. He told Steel that I was his mother, and Steel...he...\u201d Once again she had to fight past those blistering tears, not even the chilly rain cooling them.</p><p>A sliver of rock sliced the sole of her foot, and she welcomed the sting. \u201cHe was distraught. He cried. Begged me to forgive him. I tried to reassure him. He could have killed me, and I wouldn\u2019t have cared. But Zeus was determined to punish me for the trouble I had caused. He took...he took Steel\u2019s head in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Deep breath in, deep breath out. \u201cI fought so fervently against my chains, I lost a hand that day. But I didn\u2019t free myself in time. He was...gone. He was gone, and I was thrown back into my cell. And I stayed there until the Titans managed to overthrow the Greeks for good. But you know the worst part? He\u2019d planned it. Zeus had planned to kill him all along. He\u2019d had someone there, waiting, a new host for Steel\u2019s demon.\u201d</p><p>Again, silence. No, not true. Her choppy inhalations blended with Gideon\u2019s uneven exhalations and mixed with the patter of the storm.</p><p>There. He knew everything now. Every painful moment of Steel\u2019s life. Scarlet\u2019s failure. His own failure. What could have been, what hadn\u2019t been. Why she hated him so damn much. Why she could not possibly ever forgive him for leaving her behind.</p><p>\u201cScar,\u201d he whispered brokenly. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Still she couldn\u2019t face him. She felt too exposed, too raw, as if she\u2019d been scraped with a razor from the inside out. \u201cWhat!\u201d A scream.</p><p>\u201cI understand, I do.\u201d Meaning, he didn\u2019t. \u201cThat sounds like the...man I knew. A king who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about that bastard! You liked him, I know. You respected him, admired his strength. Before your possession, he was even good to you. As much as he was capable of.\u201d And that wasn\u2019t much. So the fact that Gideon defended him in any way... Suffer! \u201cHow did he treat you afterward, huh? He cursed you and he banished you! But you know what? He was never good to me and he was never good to your son.\u201d The words were coming in gasping rumbles now, slashing at him.</p><p>She had to stop. Her sobs were threatening to escape. But how dare he question the validity of her tale? He should be pleading for absolution. Shouting to the heavens. Cursing. That he wasn\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving you,\u201d she said. Though she\u2019d tried for a calm, this-is-how-it\u2019s-gonna-be tone this time, her own suffering was evident in every nuance of her voice. \u201cYou owe me a boon, and I\u2019m redeeming it by asking that you don\u2019t come after me. You\u2019ve done enough damage.\u201d</p><p>With that, she did it. She at last walked away and left her husband behind. She didn\u2019t look back. Closure sucked.</p><p>YOU\u2019VE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE.</p><p>The words echoed through Gideon\u2019s mind. Everything inside him screamed to jump up, to chase Scarlet down, to bind her to him in whatever way necessary, to do something, anything to soothe the wounds inside her, but he didn\u2019t. He remained crouched on the ground, shaking, hot tears streaming down his already soaked cheeks.She was right.</p><p>He had done enough damage. At first, he hadn\u2019t wanted to believe her. He\u2019d scrambled for any possible scrap to disprove her. But the pain in her eyes had been too real, the wounds in her voice seeping crimson. Which meant not only had he abandoned his wife, he\u2019d also abandoned his son. An abandonment that had eventually led to his son\u2019s murder.</p><p>A murder Scarlet had been forced to watch, help less.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t Gideon remember? Why? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rage beat through him, harder than fists of iron. Whatever he had to do, he would find out.</p><p>With a roar, he ripped off his necklace and tossed it aside. \u201cCronus,\u201d he shouted to the treetops. \u201cCronus! I command your presence.\u201d</p><p>It was the truth, but he couldn\u2019t stop the words. Didn\u2019t want to stop the words. Immediately, his demon screamed and pain slammed into his chest. Pain that doubled him over. Pain that spread through every inch of him, turning his blood to acid and his bones to bubbling liquid.</p> <p>Pain he deserved.</p><p>Soon he couldn\u2019t move, could barely speak. But over and over, he called, \u201cCronus. Cronus. Come to me. I need you.\u201d</p><p>An eternity seemed to pass, the rain finally dying, though the moon never broke through the clouds and the sun never appeared. Where was Scarlet? Had she made it someplace safe to await the coming morning? Probably. The girl was resourceful. Well able to take care of herself. Look at everything she had survived.</p><p>She was stronger than he was, that was for sure.</p><p>Gods, no wonder she was done with him. She had to hate him. Did hate him. The emotion had drenched her final goodbye. He didn\u2019t blame her, either. Just then, he hated himself. He\u2019d left his own child to die. His own child.</p> <p>He should be beheaded.</p><p>The tears stared flowing again, and he squeezed his eyelids shut. Darling Steel, saddled with horns and fangs, even scales. The ever-fastidious gods and goddesses had probably made him feel ashamed of those features. Features Gideon would have loved and fawned over. Cherished.</p><p>Scarlet had been right about something else, too. At one time, Gideon had liked and respected Zeus. The former god king might have been selfish and power-hungry, but in his way, he\u2019d been good to Gideon. Until the Pandora\u2019s box fiasco. After that, the Greeks had ignored Gideon and his friends, and as time passed, Gideon had found contentment with his new life.</p><p>Not his wife and child, though. They never had. Zeus had never been good to them, and for that, Zeus would suffer.</p><p>I will destroy the bastard. Once, Gideon had done everything in his power to protect his king. And how had he been repaid? His greatest treasures were taken from him. I will avenge my son. My wife.</p><p>Pandora\u2019s box be damned. Vengeance came first. Now. Always.</p> <p>\u201cTsk, tsk,\u201d a male voice suddenly said, the quiet sound exploding through Gideon\u2019s head.</p><p>He pried open his eyelids.</p><p>Cronus crouched in front of him, disappointment shadowing his ever-more-youthful features. \u201cYou are a fool, letting yourself decline like this. And for what? A single moment of truth?\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhy did you summon me? Again. I just spoke to Lucien and received my daily update. I do not require another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeus,\u201d Gideon gritted out. \u201cI want him.\u201d</p><p>Lies screamed.</p><p>Another bout of truth. Another bout of pain, fresh and searing.</p><p>Cronus blinked in surprise. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want him,\u201d Gideon repeated, panting. He would not discuss Steel with Cronus. If the god were to remember the boy, were to bad-mouth him in any way, Gideon would be out for his blood, as well, and right now he needed the king as an ally.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Unwavering, certain. \u201cYou cannot have him.\u201d</p><p>Gideon clenched his jaw as his gaze fogged over. Fight this. \u201cHe\u2019s your enemy. Let me slay him for you.\u201d He was so used to speaking deceitfully, he should have stumbled over the truth. At the very least, he should have had to think about what to say. Yet he didn\u2019t. The truth flowed from him, already a part of him. Zeus would die by his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to?\u201d Cronus asked, genuinely curious.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s breathing offends me.\u201d</p><p>Lies whimpered. More, please more. Stop, please stop.</p><p>The king\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cOnly after he has endured thousands of years of confinement will he be allowed the sweet taste of death. If even then. And I will be the one to deliver it. Now, is that all you wished to discuss with me?\u201d</p><p>If Cronus wouldn\u2019t help him willingly, the king would just have to help him unintentionally. All Gideon needed was passage into Olympus. Or whatever Cronus was calling the place. From there, he could hike into Tartarus. He\u2019d spent centuries doing so and still knew the way.</p><p>That was one thing he hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>\u201cI want to go to the heavens.\u201d Amid his demon\u2019s renewed screams, he gritted his teeth. Gods, the pain. Any more, and he would finally pass out. Just a little longer, and then you can sleep. \u201cLet me recuperate there, so that the Hunters won\u2019t find me in this condition and hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a lie. That didn\u2019t ease his suffering; it was too late for that, but Lies did sigh with a kernel of relief.</p><p>\u201cA boon, then? From me to you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon nodded as best he was able.</p><p>\u201cIf I do this, you know you will owe me.\u201d</p><p>Another nod. \u201cI\u2019ll do...anything you...want.\u201d For Steel. And for Scarlet. And maybe, while he was sneaking his way into the prison and removing Zeus\u2019s head, he could figure out what the fuck had happened to his memories.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Slowly Cronus grinned with satisfaction. \u201cYou may stay in the heavens until you have recovered. No longer, no shorter. And in return, I may call upon you at any time with my request for payment, and you must heed that request above all else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Another truth, more pain, more hissing.</p><p>The deal was struck.</p><p>As Gideon closed his eyes, the ground beneath him disappeared. After centuries of banishment, he would finally return to the heavens.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cTHAT STUPID, stupid man. That pig. That jerk. That raging asshat!\u201d</p><p>As Scarlet stomped through the forest, slapping tree trunks along the way, she called Gideon every vile name she could think of.\u201cThat shithead. That brainless caveman. That...father.\u201d</p><p>Goodbye, steam.</p><p>She stilled, panting, sweating, palms stinging. He hadn\u2019t known he was a father. She\u2019d thrown the information at him, then left him to deal with it on his own. And too well did she know how impossible it was to deal on one\u2019s own.</p><p>For months after Steel\u2019s death, she\u2019d done nothing but cry. She\u2019d stopped eating, had even stopped speaking. Maybe, if she\u2019d had someone there to care for her, to pick up the shattered pieces of her soul, she would have recuperated sooner.</p><p>Much as she hated\u2014no, hate was too strong a word just then. And she didn\u2019t know why. Still. Much as she disliked Gideon, she didn\u2019t want him wallowing. He was in the middle of a war. He couldn\u2019t afford to wallow.</p><p>One more night with him, Scarlet thought, hating herself. And it wasn\u2019t too strong a word when directed at herself. She turned around and stalked back to Gideon\u2019s camp. She\u2019d heard him shouting to Cronus, the god king who had despised her all her life because she was the evidence of his wife\u2019s betrayal. Evidence his peers could see.</p><p>Had Gideon thought to ask him for confirmation about Steel, like her word and pain weren\u2019t good enough? Or had he been seeking vengeance against Zeus, as she once had?</p><p>If that was the case, she would have to stop him. The former sovereign suffered more locked away, his power taken from him, the knowledge that his greatest rival was controlling his throne a constant in his mind, than he ever would have suffered if she\u2019d killed him.</p><p>Too quick. Too easy.</p><p>Still. She couldn\u2019t leave Gideon alone. So she would stay with him for what remained of the night, comfort him as best she was able. Not that he deserved it, but hell, she\u2019d always been a giver. But after this, she was done with him. For real this time.</p><p>Only, when she broke through the final wall of leaves, she saw that he\u2019d already left the camp. So soon? She hadn\u2019t heard him take a single step. Where the hell had he gone?</p><p>Scarlet spun, searching for any sign of him. All she found was a bag. Scowling, she stalked to it. Along the way, something hard, hot and thin hooked around her bare toe, and she stopped.</p><p>Her scowl became a frown of confusion and then irritation as she bent down and lifted...his butterfly necklace. Why had he left it? Because he was done with her and didn\u2019t want to match her anymore?</p><p>She popped her jaw, removed her own necklace\u2014how stupid she\u2019d been to wear it\u2014and clenched them both tightly in her fist. Metal crunched against metal.</p><p>\u201cRotten scum.\u201d She drew in a deep breath and caught a whiff of godly majesty. It was like a cloying perfume, pungent enough to sting the nostrils. She\u2019d endured that scent most of her life, and had been ecstatic to finally escape it when she\u2019d left Tartarus.</p><p>Cronus had been here, she realized. Son of a bitch! Where had the king taken Gideon? Had the god hurt him or helped him?</p><p>She had to know. And there was only one way to find out...</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d she shouted. Gods. She\u2019d sworn never to do this again. Leaving Gideon helpless to Cronus\u2019s cruel whims was not an option, however. And yeah, maybe the two got along and Gideon was happy right now. She\u2019d still do everything in her power to separate them.</p><p>Without a doubt, Cronus would try to poison Gideon against her. That shouldn\u2019t have mattered since she planned to take off tomorrow, but some part of her couldn\u2019t accept such an outcome.</p><p>Several minutes passed, but nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cGonna play difficult, are you?\u201d she muttered. \u201cFine. So can I.\u201d</p><p>First, though, she would prepare. Surely Gideon had a few weapons in that bag. She closed the rest of the distance and pulled the zipper. Inside she found T-shirts, jeans, sweatpants and yep, weapons. A semiautomatic, a few blades and an axe. Most surprising? An unopened packet of Skittles.</p><p>Scarlet quickly changed into a T-shirt and sweats. The sweats she had to roll at the waist and ankles, but at least they stayed on. Then she stashed the weapons all over her body. The necklaces she stuffed into one of the blade sheaths.</p><p>Now. Time to try again.</p><p>\u201cMother! Answer me or I swear I\u2019ll find a way back into the heavens. I\u2019ll move in with you. I\u2019ll be your constant companion. You won\u2019t be able to see anyone without my presence. You won\u2019t be able to do anything without me by your side. Do you hear me? This is your last chance, Mother, before\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough! You are not to call me by that hideous name. How many times have I told you that?\u201d</p><p>Thousands. And Scarlet cared as much now as she had every other time. Which meant she cared not at all.</p><p>The voice had come from behind her, so she turned. Slowly. As if Rhea wasn\u2019t strong enough to fear having at her back. To be honest, she simply didn\u2019t relish seeing the woman who had given birth to her. Even though she needed her.</p> <p>When their gazes finally met, Scarlet barely contained her gasp of surprise.</p><p>Last time she\u2019d seen Rhea, the woman had been greatly aged. Her silky dark hair had become a frizzy gray, and her unlined skin had turned into something akin to dry, wrinkled parchment. Now, her hair was a perfect mix of salt and pepper and her skin had smoothed out, only a few lines remaining.</p><p>From crone to cougar, Scarlet thought. Bitch.</p><p>Rhea wore a revealing golden robe, the top veeing to showcase her ample cleavage, the bottom so sheer Scarlet could tell she wore matching panties.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to stare at me all night, Scarlet darling?\u201d Each word was sneered. \u201cI know I\u2019m beautiful, but I still deserve respect. Tell me why you summoned me and let\u2019s be done with this.\u201d</p> <p>Collect yourself. \u201cSurprise! I wanted to present you with a Mother of the Year award,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>Black eyes so like her own narrowed. \u201cI have better things to do with my time than argue with an ungrateful upstart.\u201d</p><p>Ungrateful. Right. Scarlet simply refused to cater to the demanding woman\u2019s every whim. For good reason. No good would ever come of it.</p><p>Once, Rhea had loved her. Had treated her like a jewel. But as Scarlet matured, Rhea had begun to see her as a threat. As competition. For men, for the throne if they ever managed to escape, which they had always planned to do. Love had turned to jealousy, and jealousy to hatred.</p><p>That hatred...gods, Scarlet had wanted to die when she\u2019d realized her own mother would be happier if she were dead.</p><p>Had it not been for Alastor the Avenger, a Greek god who had been attracted to the young, blossoming Scarlet, Rhea and Cronus would have had Scarlet killed long ago. But Alastor had cursed both of the former sovereigns as only an avenger could. Every time they attempted to kill her, they would physically age.</p> <p>Needless to say, they\u2019d still tried many times. And they had indeed aged, just as Alastor had promised. Finally, their attempts had ceased and Scarlet had lived as normal a life as a girl in prison could. Meaning, no privacy, fighting for ever scrap of food and being prepared for anything.</p><p>Would have been nice to have Alastor by her side now. Rhea would do anything Scarlet desired. Without complaint. But sadly, Alastor had been killed when the Titans escaped, freeing the godly sovereigns from his curse.</p><p>Now is not the time to reminisce. Her chin jutted as she squared her shoulders, an attempt to disguise her loathing. \u201cYour husband was here. What did he do with Gideon?\u201d</p><p>Rhea frowned, though she couldn\u2019t hide the edge of satisfaction clinging to her expression. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have no idea who this Gideon is.\u201d</p><p>Like hell. Scarlet\u2019s mother might not have known that Scarlet and Gideon had married\u2014no one did\u2014but everyone had known of Scarlet\u2019s interest in the warrior. More than that, everyone had known of Zeus\u2019s army. Well, known of the warriors who had visited the prison, and Gideon had been a part of that. \u201cCome now, Mother. I know you\u2019re helping the Hunters. I also know your team is losing.\u201d</p><p>Red bloomed in Rhea\u2019s cheeks, erasing the satisfaction. \u201cYou know nothing, you foolish girl.\u201d</p><p>But Nightmares homed in on the queen\u2019s sudden spike of fear, stretching, purring, wanting to invade her mind and exploit every drop of it. \u201cOne last chance to tell me what I want to know, and then I start looking for Gideon on my own. And each night that I fail to find him, my demon will find you. You won\u2019t be able to close your eyes without seeing your defeat. Without seeing every way you can die.\u201d</p><p>Rhea\u2019s chin lifted, her fear falling away, speculation taking its place. \u201cWell, well. I could almost be proud of you at this moment. We should join forces and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere. Is. He?\u201d Never would Scarlet aid her mother. Not in any way. The things this woman had done to her...stabbing her, sending men to try and rape her, demeaning her at every turn. No. Never.</p><p>A moment passed in silence. Then Rhea\u2019s eyes narrowed, creating tiny slits of undiluted loathing. \u201cI could kill you for such impudence, you know. There\u2019s nothing to stop me from doing so now. No curse to age me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d Scarlet almost wished she would. Not that she would succeed. Scarlet was well able to take care of herself now. In fact, she\u2019d killed many of the Titans who had hurt her in prison. Rhea had to know that. Rhea had to know what she was capable of.</p><p>When the god queen remained in place, Scarlet almost smiled. Oh, yes. Rhea knew. There would be no challenge issued today.</p><p>\u201cGideon has promised Cronus a boon,\u201d her mother said stiffly. \u201cI will take you to him if you promise me you\u2019ll ensure that boon is never granted.\u201d</p><p>Trying to force her hand. She should have known. \u201cDone.\u201d But in this, Rhea wouldn\u2019t get her way. Scarlet abhorred Cronus as much as she abhorred her mother, so preventing him from getting something he wanted wouldn\u2019t be a hardship. And besides that, Gideon was a liar. If Gideon had promised the god king something, he\u2019d never really meant to see it through.</p><p>Therefore, there would be no boon to divert.</p><p>Win-win.</p><p>\u201cCome then. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Rhea waved a delicate hand through the air and the next thing Scarlet knew, she was standing inside an unfamiliar bedroom. Red velvet draped the walls, and crystal hung from the ceiling like twinkling stars. Every piece of furniture was polished mahogany, and made for seduction. A four-poster bed with rumpled covers, a lounge for two, bookshelves filled with naked photos rather than books. A dresser littered with bowls of fruit.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Scarlet asked, unable to mask her awe.</p><p>\u201cThe royal court.\u201d Rhea looked around with disgust. \u201cCronus used to keep this secret room for his mistresses.\u201d She uttered a tinkling laugh. \u201cWell, he did until I torched the entire chamber. But then Zeus had it restored for his mistresses. I came here after gaining my freedom from Tartarus, just to see what had been done. You remember, don\u2019t you? You tried to enter, but we denied you.\u201d She laughed again, but this time it was a cruel sound. \u201cPerhaps Cronus and your Gideon are having an affair.\u201d</p><p>As if. Gideon didn\u2019t swing that way. If she hadn\u2019t already known, his kiss would have assured her of that. He liked women. Liked them more than he should, but whatever.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCronus? I\u2019ll have you know I don\u2019t watch his every\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou try my patience, Mother. Where is Gideon?\u201d</p><p>The queen ran her tongue over her teeth, waves of resentment pouring from her, before pointing to the lump in the center of the bed. \u201cYou\u2019ll find him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lying...\u201d Scarlet allowed the threat to hang unfinished.</p><p>She approached the bed, trembling, and sure enough, Gideon was there, half-hidden by the covers. But her relief was short-lived. His pallid body shook, and sickly sweat poured from him. His teeth were digging into his bottom lip, and he was moaning.</p><p>That mop of blue hair was plastered to his forehead and temples, his skin was welted and his eyes squeezed closed. What was wrong with him? She wanted to tend to him, but didn\u2019t permit herself to move another inch. Not yet. Not with an audience.</p><p>Rhea appeared at her side. \u201cHe\u2019s not very attractive like that, is he?\u201d she asked conversationally, and Gideon\u2019s lids popped open. His eyes were bright red, glowing, and he couldn\u2019t quite focus on either woman. \u201cThat blue hair, those piercings. All that pain. A real warrior wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it, much less succumb to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a woman who\u2019s never known true pain.\u201d Her nails bit into her palms. No one speaks poorly of him but me.</p><p>\u201cWith you as a daughter, I\u2019ve known my fair share. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Scarlet might not like this woman, but those kinds of comments still cut.</p><p>Maybe because, for a long time, even after her mother had begun to belittle her, purposely distressing her, she\u2019d tried to be a good daughter. She had been Rhea\u2019s own personal little slave girl, catering to her every whim.</p><p>Her mother wanted extra food, so she\u2019d stolen it. Her mother thought a goddess was too pretty, so Scarlet had broken the female\u2019s nose. Her mother wanted time outside her cell, so Scarlet had bought it for her. Doing whatever a guard wanted her to do.</p><p>That had been the worst, giving herself to men she hadn\u2019t liked and who hadn\u2019t liked her. But she\u2019d cared so little about herself. She\u2019d felt worthless without her mother\u2019s love and had been determined to earn it back. Until the first murder attempt. Rhea had distracted her before going for her throat.</p><p>\u201cThey all watch you. They all crave you. You, a little nothing,\u201d Rhea had screamed as the blood dripped.</p><p>Cronus, who had also been in their cell, had come at her next. \u201cYou might be my wife\u2019s child, but you are not my heir and you will never have my crown.\u201d</p><p>Alastor had been walking by, had seen Scarlet fall. He\u2019d entered the cell, shoving Rhea aside and scooping Scarlet up. \u201cYou have no crown,\u201d he\u2019d told the former king. \u201cNor will you ever again.\u201d</p><p>After doctoring her, he\u2019d escorted Scarlet back to her prison. Where Cronus and Rhea waited. By then, Alastor had already cursed the pair. But that hadn\u2019t stopped them from trying. Again and again. Actually, months had passed before they\u2019d noticed how much they were aging. Only then had they stopped.</p><p>Sometimes, though, their words still haunted her.</p><p>She laughed bitterly. Those echoes of the past were her own personal little nightmare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when my end of our bargain is met,\u201d she said, keeping all emotion from her tone. Which would be, oh, never. \u201cYou can go now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, her mother remained where she was. \u201cI never knew what you saw in him, why you watched him so covetously. Paris, Lucien and Galen were the pretty ones, though one could hardly call Lucien pretty anymore.\u201d Rhea\u2019s face scrunched with disgust. \u201cSabin was the strong, determined one. Strider the fun one. Any of them would have been better than him, the wild one who enjoyed fighting.\u201d</p><p>Like that was a crime. Still, Scarlet clenched her jaw to keep her rebuke inside. One, she didn\u2019t want her mother to know how much Gideon still meant to her. Not that he meant a whole hell of a lot, she assured herself. Defending him would be like shouting her feelings (small as they were) from a rooftop. Two, she hated that anyone, especially Rhea, was seeing him like this, weakened and hurting, and prolonging the discussion would only encourage the goddess to stay.</p><p>\u201cNow they\u2019re all evil and in need of extermination,\u201d her mother continued.</p> <p>\u201cFunny that you say that, since you\u2019re just like them. Strife.\u201d Oh, yes. Rhea was possessed by the demon of Strife. She might deny it, but Scarlet knew the truth.</p><p>Rhea stiffened, a predator who\u2019d spotted prey after a too-long fast. \u201cUtter that word again, and I\u2019ll entice your lover into my bed. I could do it, you know, and there would be nothing you could do to stop me. I grow prettier every day.\u201d</p><p>Do not react. Not to the jealousy suddenly beating through her, or the consuming fury. Again, that would only encourage the goddess. \u201cDo whatever you want. Later. For now, just leave us,\u201d she said, knowing the order would grate on Rhea\u2019s nerves. \u201cI have a few things to discuss with him and then you can have him.\u201d There. That should throw her mother for a loop.</p><p>At first, Rhea didn\u2019t obey. She sauntered to the other side of the bed and ran the sharp tip of a nail up Gideon\u2019s leg, stomach and then throat. Gideon latched onto her wrist and growled. She laughed that tinkling, dead laugh.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he croaked, and then hunched over on another moan.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I think I\u2019ll have him anyway.\u201d With a smile that returned every bit of her satisfaction, the queen disappeared, leaving Scarlet alone with her husband.</p><p>Finally Scarlet was able to climb up the bed as she\u2019d wanted. Very carefully, she settled beside him, her pulse hammering at the base of her neck. \u201cAre you a prisoner?\u201d she asked, smoothing the hair from his damp brow.</p><p>He leaned into her touch. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A lie, she knew, because his answer wasn\u2019t followed by another moan. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to...find...Zeus.\u201d</p><p>Some of the ice around her heart melted; she couldn\u2019t stop it. So. He had meant to seek revenge. \u201cKilling him won\u2019t make you feel any better,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>Their gazes met, a heated tangle. \u201cNot willing to...find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCronus won\u2019t allow you to do that. So why did he bring you here?\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s smile was brief yet still pained. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need my help with the Hunters. I didn\u2019t ask him to bring me here so I can recover from the truth I spoke. I don\u2019t plan to make my way to Tartarus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke the truth? In the forest?\u201d Scarlet flattened her palm over his cheek, thumb tracing the bruise under his eye. \u201cStupid man. Believe me, if I thought it would ease my pain, I would have found a way to kill Zeus long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScar.\u201d He reached up with a shaky hand and cupped her nape. His grip was weak, but she knew what he was doing. Offering comfort. Comfort she had been denied for so long.</p><p>Tears suddenly burned her eyes.</p><p>Dangerous. Too dangerous. She couldn\u2019t allow this. Couldn\u2019t rely on him like this. Not for anything, even something as simple and wonderful as comfort. What would happen the next time she needed consoling and he wasn\u2019t nearby or didn\u2019t want to offer it? She would need it, wouldn\u2019t know how to cope without it.</p><p>She straightened, and he was too weak to follow her movement. His arm thudded back on the mattress.</p> <p>You are hard. Uncaring. \u201cIt\u2019s treacherous here in Titania,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cYou jailed many of these Titans, and they\u2019ll be all too happy to kick you while you\u2019re down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare. I do.\u201d</p><p>He might not, but she foolishly did. \u201cWe should return to Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d</p><p>Sweet, resisting man. \u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Zeus wasn\u2019t the one to take my memories of you and Steel? What if he didn\u2019t remove them to keep me from kissing him?\u201d</p><p>That...that made sense, she realized. Zeus had been so powerful, he very well could have removed Gideon\u2019s memories to prevent the warrior from killing him for Steel\u2019s death. Although the gods and goddesses of memory were usually the only ones capable of such a thing. Zeus could have paid one of them to do it, however.</p><p>With each new thought, rage sparked inside her. The same rage she\u2019d born in her cell, the same rage she\u2019d carried with her since her escape, but stronger. So much stronger. Zeus might have stolen more than her son. Zeus might have stolen her future.</p><p>Why she\u2019d ever been content to let him languish, she didn\u2019t know. It was so unlike her. Perhaps someone had screwed with her mind, as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you reach him,\u201d she said with such deadly calm even she was scared. Rivers of blood would flow. Screams would echo into a thousand midnights.</p><p>She wanted to go now, this second, to finally act, but morning was fast approaching and she would fall into that undisturbed sleep, unable to care for herself.</p><p>In this, she realized she did need Gideon and she would allow herself to use him. Tomorrow... Oh, yes, tomorrow. Vengeance.</p><p>\u201cHe will suffer,\u201d Gideon said on a ragged breath, mirroring her thoughts. Once again, he moaned in pain, but his next words rang out clearly. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>ZEUS\u2019S MENTAL doorway was closed and locked with a Do Not Disturb sign draped on the knob.</p><p>For hours, Scarlet waited in front of that doorway, clawing and kicking and pounding, something that usually bathed the target in fatigue. Even gods and goddesses. Yet the entry remained closed.He was awake and fighting the lethargy with a strength he shouldn\u2019t have possessed. Not with his slave collar. But he would have to sleep eventually. Everyone did, even deposed god kings. And when he did, she would be there.</p><p>However he\u2019d convinced her to allow him to suffer from afar...she might never know. The fucker had killed her son in front of her, and had likely taken Gideon\u2019s memories of her. He was the reason her heart had withered and died. He was the reason she had cried herself to sleep so many nights. And he could very well be the reason she\u2019d felt abandoned, alone, forsaken and used.</p><p>None of that mattered to her demon, however. Must feed, Nightmares said.</p><p>She understood, knowing well the consequences of denying her other half what he needed. He wouldn\u2019t want to, but he would be forced to feed on her.</p><p>So, though she would have preferred to stake out the Greek for all of eternity, she approached Galen. And, to be honest, hurting him would calm her down. Somewhat.</p><p>Thankfully, his doorway was open. His dream was as turbulent as before, only this time it was all his own. Over and over he relived what she\u2019d shown him. His helplessness. His weakness. His defeat at Gideon\u2019s hand.</p><p>Nightmares drank in his terror, luxuriating in the emotion even though the demon hadn\u2019t caused it, before scenting someone else\u2019s fear and moving on. And then another. When the demon was finally sated, Scarlet steered them toward Gideon\u2019s doorway. It, too, was open.</p><p>Her warrior slept. What thoughts drifted through his mind?</p><p>Walk away. A command from her sense of survival.</p><p>Can\u2019t. A cry from the most feminine part of her.</p><p>She was trembling as she stepped inside, and what she next saw left her gasping. There she was, wearing a beautiful red gown, yet chained in front of a strong, struggling boy who appeared half human, half demon. Zeus stood behind the boy, a curving knife in hand, glinting silver. Around them was a crowd of people cheering.</p><p>Not a memory, she realized, because Gideon had some of the details wrong. He was simply creating a scene from what she\u2019d told him.</p><p>For a long while, she debated: show him the truth or leave him to the illusion. An illusion that would be much easier to digest than reality.</p><p>He needs to know. Who spoke to her this time, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Did he, though? Sometimes she would prefer not to know herself.</p><p>He needs to know. For Steel. Steel deserved a father who knew how he\u2019d lived\u2014and died.</p><p>With that, Scarlet\u2019s reservations vanished. For Steel, she would do anything.</p><p>Trembling, she reached out and waved a hand over dream Scarlet\u2019s gown. That was the easiest correction to make and a good place to start. The material disappeared as if her palm was an eraser. Then, with another wave of her hand, she repainted her clothing. A dirty white robe, stained with blood. Ripped at one shoulder. She added cuts and bruises to her face and arms.</p><p>Gulping, she eyed the crowd. Using both hands, she wiped them away, leaving herself, Steel and Zeus, and a figure cloaked in darkness. A being whose feet didn\u2019t quite touch the ground, the hem of his black robe blowing in a wind no one else could see. The being who would accept and cage Steel\u2019s demon.</p><p>Without the cheers, a near-deafening silence took over.</p><p>Next, she changed the surrounding hippodrome where Zeus had often hosted his chariot games to an abandoned temple. White alabaster columns rose all around, dewy green ivy climbing their beveled lengths. There were steps that led to a cracked marble altar, each stained crimson from the many sacrifices that had taken place there.</p><p>That done, she turned her attention to Zeus. Her fingers curled in as her mind shouted avoid! She might snap. But she didn\u2019t stop. His gold and purple robe was the first to go. In its place, she painted armor. Silver. Etched with jagged yet beautiful butterflies that matched the tattoo on her back, as well as the tattoo on Gideon\u2019s right thigh. Between each of the butterflies was a glowing bolt of lightning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The knife the Greek sovereign held became a serrated machete crafted for maximum pain. With it, he didn\u2019t just slice. He ruined.</p><p>Do it. The rest. Gideon had gotten the god\u2019s facial features correct. Eyes that mirrored the thunderbolts adorning his armor, snapping, sizzling, glowing. A blade of a nose. Thin lips, but a strong jaw that more than made up for the shortcoming. Zeus had thick, pale hair that curled to his shoulders, the perfect accompaniment to skin the color of bullion. Sometimes, when you looked closely enough, you could see the streaks of lightning shooting through his veins.</p><p>Good. Survey done. Only, it wasn\u2019t relief she felt. One last detail to change...</p> <p>Finally, she moved her attention to Steel. Tears instantly burned her eyes, and her shaking increased, nearly toppling her into a sobbing heap. All the while, she could feel helplessness churning inside Gideon. He wasn\u2019t here, was merely watching with a mental eye, but his emotions were completely engaged. Everything he felt here, he would feel later, when he awoke.</p><p>Do it. Just do it. She shaved Steel\u2019s horns down, hating the action, hating herself; the Greeks hadn\u2019t wanted the boy to use them as the weapons they\u2019d been. She added patches of scales along the right side of his body. So beautiful. His teeth, she sharpened so that two fangs protruded over his bottom lip. My baby.</p><p>Humans would have found the boy grotesque...beastly. She found him lovely. Her heart lurched, so badly did she want to urge him to her chest and hold on forever. My angel. Taken too soon.</p><p>Finish it. Gulping again, chin trembling, she lengthened the boy\u2019s eyelashes and changed his eye color from black, like hers, to electric blue, like Gideon\u2019s. She added several years to his age. Gideon had pictured him as a young boy of eleven or twelve. He\u2019d appeared closer to sixteen, a teenager who had never had the chance to date or make love. A teenager who had never felt worthy or loved, and oh, she knew that feeling well.</p><p>In actuality, though, she didn\u2019t know if he had dated or loved anyone.</p> <p>Her tears began to fall freely as she covered him in dirt and bruises, broke his arm, his leg, and added thick scars to his back. Hundreds of them.</p><p>There. It was done. For good or ill, it was done. The scene was painted.</p><p>And now...now it was time for Gideon to see how things had truly unfolded.</p><p>Unsure whether she could live through this again\u2014for Steel, anything for Steel\u2014Scarlet nodded, arms falling heavily to her sides, and each image jerked to sudden life.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d dream Scarlet begged. \u201cPlease. I\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d The cut on her lip split, and blood seeped down her chin. \u201cJust leave him alone. Please.\u201d</p><p>Zeus\u2019s hard expression never wavered. \u201cCountless times you\u2019ve tried to escape, and yet you expect me to offer you a boon? Surely even you couldn\u2019t be that foolish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a boy. He did nothing wrong. Punish me. Kill me. Just let him go. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not just a boy. He\u2019s centuries old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Please, Your Highness. Please.\u201d</p><p>Through it all, Steel kept his head bowed and his eyes averted. He wasn\u2019t trembling, he wasn\u2019t crying. He was silent, still. Expectant. As if he deserved everything that was to be done to him.</p><p>\u201cAs long as he lives, you will continue to defy me,\u201d Zeus said. \u201cTherefore, he must die. Simple, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try to escape again. I swear it. I\u2019ll return to prison and quietly rot there. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had that option, daughter of Rhea. Once.\u201d Gaze never leaving her, the god king tossed his blade in the air, caught it by the handle. \u201cBut I must admit, I do like the thought of your head rolling. Perhaps I was too hasty in selecting who should die. What do you think, Steel? Shall I kill your mother or shall I leave that honor to you?\u201d</p><p>At that, Steel finally looked up. Shock curtained his features, overshadowing the acceptance and shame. \u201cM-mother?\u201d</p> <p>Such a sweet voice, with hints of smoke and cloud.</p><p>Scarlet offered him a watery smile. \u201cI love you.\u201d The very words she\u2019d yearned to say for so long. \u201cNo matter what happens, Steel, I love you. I\u2019ve always loved you and always will. I didn\u2019t give you up, my darling. You were taken from me.\u201d Choked now.</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s your mother. Yes, you were taken from her,\u201d Zeus confirmed as the teen turned to him in stunned confusion. \u201cYou may offer your thanks now.\u201d</p><p>Steel\u2019s shock gave way to horror, liquid red bleeding into his azure irises. He was the reason she was chained, after all. Thinking she was an enemy to the crown, he\u2019d led Zeus straight to her. \u201cMother,\u201d he said again, and this time, there was pain in that beloved voice. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself, sweet boy. You are everything I wanted you to be. Strong. Lovely. Intelligent. You did exactly as I would\u2019ve done had the situation been reversed. I love you so much.\u201d She couldn\u2019t speak quickly enough, knowing that at any moment\u2014</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Zeus barked, just as she\u2019d feared. \u201cI asked a question and desire an answer. So which is it to be, Steel? Will her death be delivered by my hand or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t want you to kill her.\u201d Steel\u2019s watery gaze drank her in greedily, as if he were memorizing every little thing about her. \u201cAnd I do not wish to kill her, either. Let her live. Please.\u201d His plea mirrored all the ones she\u2019d given before.</p><p>Scarlet fought with every ounce of strength she possessed. She had to reach him. Couldn\u2019t bear to see him pained. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, darling. Let him do it. It\u2019s fine, I swear to you.\u201d She would rather die herself than allow a single scratch to befall Steel.</p><p>\u201cI will not be merciful,\u201d Zeus said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Scarlet told them both. Better she suffer now than Steel suffer in the coming centuries because he\u2019d murdered her.</p><p>Silence. Terrible, terrible silence. But then, something far worse. \u201cKill me instead,\u201d Steel said. \u201cI am nothing. No one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Scarlet screamed.</p><p>But Zeus nodded, stroked his jaw and ignored her, focusing on her son. \u201cYou\u2019re right. She\u2019s much too valuable to dispose of. As the bastard daughter of Rhea, she is an embarrassment to Cronus and thus a priceless weapon to wield against him should the need arise.\u201d</p><p>She calmed. A chance. Hope. Zeus considered her a tool to be used against his enemies.</p><p>\u201cStill. She must be punished for her actions. Whatever shall I do, then?\u201d he asked, seeming genuinely pensive.</p><p>Hope dwindling... \u201cSend Steel away,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cThat will punish me. I\u2019ll wonder where he is and what\u2019s happening to him. Please. Please. Nothing would hurt me more than that. You know this is true.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Zeus grinned. He nodded. \u201cAn excellent plan. I\u2019ll send him elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Hope renewed, flooding her. \u201cThank you.\u201d Her shoulders sagged, her breath emerging shallowly. Her son would be safe. He would live. He would grow into the man he was meant to be. \u201cThank you so much, great king.\u201d Thanks continued to pour from her lips. She was babbling, she knew she was, but couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d spoken too soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send him to the afterlife,\u201d the god added, at last silencing her. \u201cAs I originally planned.\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d always planned, she realized. He\u2019d never considered letting the boy go, had only been toying with her.</p><p>Steel\u2019s eyes widened. In fear, in regret, then fixed on hers in resolve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Mother.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet screamed, the force shaking the temple, shattering her own eardrums. \u201cNo! No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d With no hesitation, Zeus raised the blade and struck.</p><p>GIDEON AWOKE with a roar and bolted upright. Tears were streaming down his cheeks in streams of acid. With a shaky hand, he reached up and wiped them away. Dear gods. He\u2019d just seen Zeus slit his son\u2019s throat. He\u2019d felt Scarlet\u2019s pain and helplessness. Her desperation.</p><p>That\u2019s how it had happened, he knew it was. Scarlet had shown him. He\u2019d sensed her in the dream. Her sweet scent, the intensity of her emotions. She truly would have done anything to save that boy. Anything. That\u2019s how much she\u2019d loved him. And she\u2019d had to recover from his loss alone.Gideon wouldn\u2019t have been able to do so. He was barely holding himself together now, and he still couldn\u2019t remember the boy. That beautiful boy. How strong Scarlet was. How resourceful. She was a survivor to the marrow of her bones.</p><p>His respect for her doubled. His desire for her tripled.</p><p>She deserved to be pampered. She deserved to be fought for as the prize she was. So pamper her he would. Fight for her he would. He couldn\u2019t make up for the past, but he could give her a better future.</p><p>Lock her away again? Never! He\u2019d been a fucking idiot to think otherwise. Dangerous or not, she was his. He would kill anyone, even his friends, if they threatened her.</p><p>He\u2019d have to find her, though. A difficult task, surely, considering she wouldn\u2019t want to see him. And\u2014</p><p>His gaze had been circling the bedroom, ensuring no enemies lurked nearby, a habit ingrained from centuries of war. Now he stopped abruptly.</p><p>Scarlet. Here. Sleeping. Surreal.</p><p>She was cuddled up beside him, her legs straight, one hand flattened over her heart, the other draped over her forehead. That mass of silky black hair was splayed around her shoulders, gleaming like polished ebony. She was a feminine feast, made to love and be loved.</p><p>He reached out, realized his shaking had increased\u2014damned truth-telling weakness\u2014and caressed a fingertip down her nose before his muscles gave out and his arm flopped uselessly at his side. Need to touch her. Always.</p><p>For the moment, he would have to be satisfied with the knowledge that she was here. How? Why? Did it matter? She was here! They could talk, and he could begin that pampering. Foot massages every day, her enemies\u2019 heads delivered to her doorstep like the morning paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Come on, baby. Wake up. Through the windowed doors that led to a balcony, he could see that the sun was muted and falling, darkening. That pampering could begin sooner rather than later. Any moment now and Scarlet would\u2014</p><p>Her eyelids popped open and she bolted upright just as he had done. Her head slammed into his chin, and he winced.</p><p>As she rubbed the point of contact, their gazes met. Her eyes...so dark, so mysterious. So filled with pain and hope and regret. A treasure as priceless as this woman should only ever look satisfied.</p> <p>She licked her lips and slowly eased back onto the mattress, twisting to her side to face him. Her mouth floundered open and closed for a moment, as if she were searching for the right words to say. He didn\u2019t want her to bring up the dream. Not yet. That was a heavy subject and right now they both needed to relax. Or rather, he needed to comfort her as he hadn\u2019t done before.</p><p>\u201cSo, who aren\u2019t you today?\u201d he asked, lying down so that they were eye to eye.</p><p>There was a flicker of relief on her face. \u201cScarlet...Long,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Long. As in Justin. A man with black hair and brown eyes. Gideon almost smiled. Sweet progress. Hopefully, she\u2019d never pick a blond again. And one day, maybe she\u2019d even call herself Scarlet Lord.</p><p>Did he want that? Yes, he did, he realized almost immediately. He liked the thought of this woman belonging to him. Truly belonging to him in a way that all the world would recognize.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWorse.\u201d</p><p>A lengthy breath escaped her. \u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>With the last of his strength, he settled his arm over the curve of her waist. She didn\u2019t rebuke him for so intimate a gesture, and he took heart. \u201cWhen I\u2019m even worse, I don\u2019t want to hit Cronus\u2019s bedroom.\u201d He needed to get his hands on a slave collar. That way, the doors to Tartarus would open right up for him. Those collars were like keys to the gate. To get in, that is. Getting out would be a different matter entirely. \u201cBut damn. I\u2019ve got my necklace, so I can roam freely.\u201d Without it, Cronus would know where he was and what he was doing. The god king could stop him and send him back to Buda before he set a single foot in the prison realm.</p><p>One of Scarlet\u2019s brows arched. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you don\u2019t have your butterfly necklace, so you can\u2019t move freely around this palace?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, trying to gauge her expression.</p> <p>She pulled both chains from a knife sheath at her waist, letting them dangle from her fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve got them. I found where you\u2019d tossed yours like garbage.\u201d She sounded almost bitter. \u201cSo they aren\u2019t just pretty decorations?\u201d Now she sounded...disappointed.</p><p>He\u2019d made her think the necklace was a present from him. And when she\u2019d found his, she had thought he\u2019d \u201ctossed it like garbage.\u201d As if she were garbage. He wouldn\u2019t allow her to think such a thing.</p><p>I will never lie to her again, he vowed. Then blinked. Wait. He would never purposely mislead her with his lies. Better. \u201cThey don\u2019t prevent the gods from watching us. From listening to us.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, her eyes widened. With that widening, she should have been even easier to read. Only, those orbs offered no hint of her emotions. \u201cThe necklaces are blocks, then.\u201d</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t erupted at his deception. \u201cExactly wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Smart.\u201d She moved to anchor one around her neck, but he shook his head, stopping her. \u201cBut why wait?\u201d Okay, now she looked ready to erupt. Her eyes were narrowed, almost...fiery, and her teeth bared in a fearsome scowl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too strong to leave right now\u2014\u201d too weak \u201c\u2014and we shouldn\u2019t wait until we\u2019re ready to sneak out of the palace to fall off Cronus\u2019s radar.\u201d They absolutely should wait. The moment Cronus lost his connection to Gideon, he would suspect the truth and do everything in his power to stop Gideon from succeeding.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to sneak out to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Again, he nodded.</p><p>Anticipation wafted from her. The two of them were going to Tartarus, and they were going to kill Zeus.</p><p>\u201cHow long till you\u2019re recovered?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot another day.\u201d One more day.</p><p>Blink. \u201cSo what are we supposed to do in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>Kiss. Touch. Relearn each other. Make love. \u201cNot talking.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes as if he\u2019d just made a funny. \u201cYou and me? Talk? I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019ve said all we need to say to each other. We\u2019ll work together in this, because we\u2019re stronger as a pair, but that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing. Working together. Killing together.\u201d</p><p>Great. She was falling back into stubborn mode. But he didn\u2019t mind. She could say anything she wanted, do anything to him. He planned to stick to her like pasties on a stripper.</p><p>\u201cAnd anyway,\u201d she continued, resolute, \u201clet\u2019s be real here. I don\u2019t have to wait around. I can sneak through the palace and kill any god or goddess I stumble upon. I\u2019m actually doing you a favor.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled low in his throat, rose, lashed out. The thought of Scarlet traipsing through the palace halls alone did not sit well. She wouldn\u2019t be up against humans, but immortals. Stronger, more violent immortals. Pure male instinct wanted her safe, happy and not in fucking constant danger.</p><p>Calm. He would just have to keep her busy. And if she wasn\u2019t interested in talking, that left only one other option. What he\u2019d wanted to do in the first place.</p><p>He\u2019d considered himself depleted, but the thought of having her rallied his cells, muscle and bone, allowing him to roll on top of her. She gasped at his weight, but he didn\u2019t shift away. No, he pressed himself down, giving her more.</p><p>\u201cTalking it is, then,\u201d he said, and as he\u2019d done the last time he\u2019d needed to soften her, he meshed his lips into hers.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>SCARLET STARTED to utter a protest. She\u2019d already kissed Gideon once, and now had his intoxicating taste seared into her mouth, her body, after centuries of fighting to remove it. Centuries of fighting to forget his weight, his heat, his strength. She didn\u2019t need to do so again, didn\u2019t need another reminder. Didn\u2019t need the cravings to return.</p><p>Not that they\u2019d ever stopped.She thought to push him away. He was weakened right now, and wouldn\u2019t be able to stop her when she scrambled off the bed and out of the bedroom. He wouldn\u2019t be able to draw her back into his arms, hold her close, overshadowing pain with pleasure.</p><p>But then his tongue rolled against hers, so damn sweet she could have wept. Then he whispered \u201cScar\u201d as if the nickname were a prayer, and rather than protest, rather than push him, she cupped the back of his neck with one hand and tangled her fingers into his hair with the other, canting his head.</p><p>The kiss deepened, from languid to shattering in a single second. A match lit, thrown. An inferno. Raging. Thoughts derailing. Nothing mattered but here, now. The man, the passion. The past fading.</p><p>Thoughts struggling to form.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Mouths claiming. Feasting. Breath mingling. Warm, then hot, then scorching. Tearing her down. Building her back up.</p><p>A glimmer of reason.</p><p>Don\u2019t just start to protest. Do it! Protest. Don\u2019t just think to push him away. Do it! Push.</p><p>Fire, cooling. Ice, crystallizing. Yes, yes. That\u2019s what she needed to do. Protest, push. She wouldn\u2019t lose herself again. She was smarter than that.</p><p>Prove it.</p><p>Scarlet wrenched her lips from his. Panting, she said, \u201cYou want to talk, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Her body shrieked a protest all its own. Still, she continued. \u201cI\u2019m the daughter of Rhea, and I was born inside Tartarus. For thousands of years, it was all I ever knew.\u201d The words rushed from her, laced with desperation. Surely this topic would douse her passion completely.</p><p>Gideon stilled. There was disappointment in his bright eyes, but also thrums of eagerness. Finally, he was getting what he\u2019d really wanted. Information. \u201cDon\u2019t go on.\u201d He didn\u2019t move off her, though, and she foolishly didn\u2019t insist that he do so. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know everything about you.\u201d</p><p>How easy she was. Another declaration like that, and she might kiss him. \u201cAt first, Rhea loved me, cared for me. But then, as I grew older, she began to see me as a threat. She wanted me dead. Real bad.\u201d</p><p>This topic should have dulled her passion, but it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Every muscle in Gideon\u2019s body tensed. And not in desire.</p><p>Great. The distraction ploy had worked. Only, it had worked on the wrong person.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were freed, the Greeks defeated, I tried to follow her to this palace. I hoped to make amends with her, make use of the libraries.\u201d To search for information about Gideon, but Scarlet kept that to herself. \u201cShe had me barred from entering.\u201d Bitterness trickled from her voice, but again, it didn\u2019t dull her passion in the slightest. He was on top of her, and all she had to do was open her legs. \u201cShe told me I wasn\u2019t worthy to walk the halls.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cHow\u2019d you get her to keep you out this time?\u201d</p><p>Knowing what he meant\u2014how had she gotten her mother to let her in\u2014Scarlet said, \u201cI bargained with her.\u201d Would he be pissed about that? \u201cI have to stop you from giving Cronus whatever it is you promised him. What did you promise, by the way?\u201d</p><p>No. No anger. Surprising. \u201cWe didn\u2019t agree to discuss it at a later date,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ah. The old you\u2019ll-owe-me-a-favor-of-my-choosing-at-the-time-of-my-choosing. \u201cYou lied to him, of course.\u201d It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>Gideon hiked his shoulders.</p><p>She\u2019d take that as a resounding yes, and wished she could trust herself to flatten her hands on those wide shoulders, feel the muscles bunching and straining underneath. \u201cSo there you have it. What you didn\u2019t know about my life in a dirty nutshell.\u201d</p><p>He peered down at her for a long while, silent, searching. So many emotions played over his features. Regret, sorrow and the anger she\u2019d looked for before. \u201cI\u2019m...not sorry for all you\u2019ve endured. I\u2019m...not sorry for my part in it. Damn it!\u201d The anger clearly won, and he pounded the mattress with his fists, bouncing them both. \u201cI really love that I can\u2019t tell you what I really mean without setting us back a few days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His apology weakened her as nothing else could have. His vehemence delighted her. Combined? They slayed her. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she offered, at last giving in to the desire to touch. Her fingers traced up his arms, learning every ridge of muscle and sinew. \u201cGideon Speak is kinda fun.\u201d</p><p>Like that, the anger drained from him, wonder overshadowing everything else. \u201cYou aren\u2019t too good for me. In every way. No, thank you, devil. For everything.\u201d</p><p>He thought she was too good for him? Slayed. Her. \u201cNo welcome,\u201d she replied softly.</p> <p>He licked his lips as his gaze fell to hers, and suddenly she knew his passion hadn\u2019t been extinguished, after all. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not dying to do so.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t admit it, don\u2019t you dare admit it. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>One more time, she thought dazedly. She would enjoy him one more time. Sex, though? No, she wouldn\u2019t go that far. But kiss him, continue touching him? Oh, yes. She needed to pass the time, anyway. At least, that\u2019s the only reason she would cop to just then. Besides, it wasn\u2019t like she truly would have left him here, helpless against any god or goddess who entered the room. For the moment, he was still her husband and she would protect him.</p> <p>\u201cIf we do this, the shadows and the screams will return,\u201d she warned. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to stop them. They\u2019re part of me, part of my demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dislike anything that\u2019s a part of you. I don\u2019t want to experience everything you have to offer.\u201d</p><p>Melting... \u201cThen kiss me,\u201d she commanded. Then his sweet words would cease, and she could begin to rebuild the ice. That needed ice.</p><p>Gideon needed no other encouragement. His lips were on hers a second later, kissing her as if he needed the air in her lungs to survive. He moaned as if he\u2019d never tasted anything more delicious. Kneaded her breasts as if nothing, even weakness, could prevent him from enjoying them.</p><p>Once again, her blood heated in her veins, a growing inferno that liquefied her bones. Her nipples hardened, ever-ready for his mouth, and her skin tingled, a plea for more.</p><p>\u201cWant you clothed,\u201d he rasped.</p> <p>Only time she ever had to translate his demon\u2019s lies was when they were in bed, her mind on other things, so it took her passion-fogged brain a moment to realize that Gideon actually wanted her naked.</p><p>Sex? she thought again. If she got naked, he would be inside her. She might even beg for it. Beg...yes... Hopefully, though, she had a little too much pride for that. \u201cNo,\u201d she managed.</p><p>He paused, lifted his head. Their gazes met, his eyes so bright a blue they rivaled a king\u2019s ransom in sapphires. He licked his already moist lips, breathing careful. \u201cHow about we don\u2019t negotiate?\u201d His voice was rough, as if each of the words had been rubbed with sandpaper.</p><p>Negotiate, huh? \u201cAll right.\u201d Never let it be said that she was unreasonable. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll rather than half.\u201d</p><p>Reality: he was willing to remove half her clothing rather than all. A concession, yes, when he could have insisted on full nudity. Eventually, she would have caved. \u201cAnd in return I get...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not an orgasm.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked at the corners. \u201cDo you want me to remove the top or the bottom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTop.\u201d Lightning fast, no hesitation.</p><p>He wanted her pants off, and gods, she wanted to take them off. \u201cDeal,\u201d she said with a nod. \u201cYou can take my top off.\u201d Better that way.</p><p>Too bad she hated \u201cbetter.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked as hers had done, because he knew she\u2019d purposely misunderstood. \u201cAs if you didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d he said, calling her on it. \u201cAs if I don\u2019t know you meant to say pants.\u201d</p><p>With a strength she wouldn\u2019t have thought him capable of in light of his demon\u2019s curse, Gideon shoved the sweats and panties from her waist to her ankles, then off completely. A gasp left her, cool air suddenly caressing her. He didn\u2019t give her time to complain or even encourage him. He crawled down her body. And there was the moment to stop him...gone. He pushed her legs apart. Another moment...gone again. He licked the most aching part of her.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Her back arched as she cried out, her hands already in his hair, holding him close.</p><p>She rode the waves of pleasure with abandon. No, no, not abandon. Had to keep the shadows and the screams inside. Gideon didn\u2019t mind them, he\u2019d said, but she wasn\u2019t yet ready to share him. She wanted this moment all to herself, that fiery tongue working her, loving her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want more?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Can\u2019t admit it. He\u2019ll say something sweet, and more of that ice will melt. \u201cMore. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more it is.\u201d He continued to lick, his teeth scraping perfectly, making her shiver. Soon his fingers joined the play, one sinking in and out, then two. Three. The shadows pulled, and the screams tugged.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She released him and grabbed the headboard, hips arching in a fluid, desperate rhythm. Felt so good, so damn good. Was propelling her so close to the edge...</p><p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d he muttered, eye closed to half-mast, lips curled in a half-smile. \u201cJust terrible. Had my fill. Will always have my fill.\u201d</p><p>He likes it, she reminded herself. Wants more. Wouldn\u2019t ever get enough.</p><p>Ice...melting. Heating...</p><p>Don\u2019t care, she realized suddenly. She wanted the blaze to grow, consume.</p><p>Scarlet draped her legs over his shoulders, the heels of her feet digging into his lower back, her thighs squeezing his temples.</p><p>\u201cBut something I do like...you\u2019re not holding out on me.\u201d A muscle ticked below his eye as his lashes lifted and he pinned her with a hard stare. \u201cWhere are the shadows and the screams you didn\u2019t promise me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I can\u2019t... Don\u2019t stop now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them go, and don\u2019t show me our wedding,\u201d he said, and then sucked her clitoris between his teeth.</p><p>She screamed, she shook, she almost came, the pleasure was so intense. But she wasn\u2019t quite there. Just a little more, and she\u2019d fly to the heavens. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScar...wedding...I don\u2019t want to see it.\u201d His voice was strained, as if he had to force the words out.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she panted. While he was...while she was...\u201cWe\u2019re a little busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do it while I\u2019m sleeping?\u201d He blew a puff of air against her warm, moist folds, and as sensitive as she currently was, she was thrust ever closer to satisfaction.</p><p>It was wonderful and terrible, gratifying and frustrating.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI can do it while you\u2019re awake.\u201d She could project images into his mind at any time. Nightmares was just as able to invade daydreams, after all. But just then Scarlet wanted Gideon concentrating only on her aching body. On the here and now.</p><p>\u201cThen, nope. I want you to do it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Why couldn\u2019t he wait till after? Because he feared she\u2019d leave him? Because he thought she\u2019d deny him? \u201cNever mind. But be warned. The ceremony was short, we couldn\u2019t risk something longer, and kind of somber.\u201d She\u2019d give him what he wanted, though. \u201cJust know that the moment you stop, I stop.\u201d There. Bargaining, just as he liked.</p><p>\u201cMy displeasure,\u201d he practically purred, tongue flicking out and darting back and forth over her clit.</p><p>Once again, her back bowed. Okay, maybe demanding he continue hadn\u2019t been the most brilliant of plans. Her thoughts were fragmenting again, her blood heating yet another degree, her organs blistering before erupting into more of those decadent flames, her bones melting, wanting only to pour over him.</p><p>In a burst, the shadows and the screams escaped her hold, swirling around Gideon and filling the room. Just as well. She could use them to create the daydream.</p><p>Concentrate. Scarlet dug through her favorite mental files\u2014files she\u2019d buried and thought to never consider again\u2014and found the one Gideon desired.</p><p>Instantly the scene opened up in both their minds.</p><p>Late at night, while the prisoners of Tartarus slept, Gideon roused Hymen, the imprisoned Titan god of Marriage, and brought him to the cell they used for making love.</p><p>For Scarlet, Gideon had arranged a lingering bath a few hours before, and had given her a clean white robe. Only, that robe was composed of lace and that lace conformed to her curves. She\u2019d never felt lovelier, before or since.</p><p>When the two men stepped into her cell, she threw back her hood in eagerness, and her long, dark hair cascaded over her shoulder, brushed and silky for once. Gideon reached out, pinched a lock between two fingers, and brought the strands to his nose. He breathed deeply his gaze perusing her.</p><p>\u201cHideous,\u201d the Gideon between her legs breathed just as the Gideon in the dream rasped, \u201cExquisite.\u201d</p><p>A blush stained her cheeks, then and now. But she wasn\u2019t the exquisite one, and she knew it. There was no more gorgeous sight than Gideon. His black hair rose in spikes, his blue eyes were bright, the midnight lashes framing them like feathered fans, and his lips still swollen from her earlier kisses.</p><p>He possessed a shadow beard, sharp cheekbones and a strong jaw. There wasn\u2019t a flaw to him. He wore the thin silver armor she\u2019d shown him in his dream of Steel, as directed by Zeus, and that armor was etched with jagged butterflies exactly like the tattoos they now bore.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d she asked nervously. Back then, her voice had lacked the...hardness of today, and even Scarlet had to acknowledge how sweet and innocent she sounded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>Her blush intensified, and ever shy, she cast her gaze to the ground, lips curling into a happy smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure about this,\u201d Hymen said. He cleared his throat, drew his hood around his face to keep his features hidden in shadow. \u201cIf anyone learns of my part in this, I\u2019ll be executed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon\u2019s arm wrapped around Scarlet\u2019s waist, a clear gesture of possession. \u201cI told you. No one will learn of it, and besides that, you\u2019ve already been handsomely rewarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscovery is the least of your worries,\u201d Gideon barked then. \u201cMarry us or feel the sting of my blade. Those are your only choices. And, Hymen. If you feel the sting of my blade, it won\u2019t be only once. No one will recognize you when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p> <p>Hymen shifted from one foot to the other, his fear palpable. \u201cOf course, of course. We\u2019ll start now.\u201d The words rushed from him. \u201cGideon of the Greeks, tell Scarlet of the Titans why you wish to wed her.\u201d</p><p>Those piercing blue eyes met her dark black ones, and he took her hands in his. \u201cFrom the first, you enchanted me. You are more than beautiful. You are smart and strong and determined. When I\u2019m with you, I want to be a better man. I want to be worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, this long-ago Gideon, more ice melted around Scarlet\u2019s heart. But he wasn\u2019t finished.</p><p>\u201cI want to provide for you. I want to give you the life you deserve. One day, I will. Because I know, deep in my soul, that to part is to die.\u201d</p><p>Tears flooded Scarlet\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cScarlet of the Titans,\u201d Hymen said, a little choked up himself, \u201cplease tell Gideon of the Greeks why you wish to wed him.\u201d</p><p>While her knees knocked together, Scarlet struggled to find adequate words. Words that would tell this man exactly how she felt. \u201cFrom the first moment I saw you, I was attracted to you and hated myself for it. But how could I have known that underneath your beautiful exterior was an irresistible mix of courage, passion and tenderness? You quickly proved your worth, and taught me mine. I was a slave, but you made me a woman.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were filled with tears as well, she noticed.</p><p>\u201cYou are my everything,\u201d she whispered, chin trembling. \u201cMy past, present and future. My heart. My life. To part is to die.\u201d</p><p>Hymen swallowed audibly. \u201cKiss now and forever-more seal this union.\u201d</p><p>Gideon didn\u2019t hesitate. He wrapped his arms around her, drew her close and pressed their lips together. Their tongues met, twined, his breath filling her lungs and her breath filling his.</p> <p>They were one.</p><p>In the present, Scarlet allowed the image to fade. She realized she\u2019d never released the headboard, and the metal was bent. Realized Gideon had stopped pleasuring her, but she hadn\u2019t noticed, so lost had she been in the memory. So lost, in fact, that real tears were now streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>They were streaming down Gideon\u2019s, too.</p><p>Their gazes met as they had inside that cell, and she saw the emotion swimming in those baby blues.</p><p>He was the same, yet so completely different. And the differences weren\u2019t physical, though his hair was now as bright a blue as his eyes. He was harder, harsher, more distanced. Before, he\u2019d had an easy smile and had delighted in soothing her with his biting observations of both the Greeks and Titans.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why this prison is so big?\u201d he\u2019d once asked her. \u201cTartarus is overcompensating for the size of his dick.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d nearly swallowed her tongue, she\u2019d gasped so hard at his irreverence. She\u2019d always wanted to insult her captors, but had been too scared. Gideon had given her the freedom to do so, to finally vent, even in so small a way.</p><p>Now, he opened his mouth, but no words emerged. Perhaps he didn\u2019t want to lie just then, and she was grateful. She was too raw, too vulnerable, as if her heart had been cut out of her chest and presented to him in a ribboned box.</p> <p>Slowly he climbed up her body. Still not speaking, he kissed her. Again, she didn\u2019t protest. She simply opened to him, accepting everything he wanted to give. She tasted herself, sweet and warm, but also him. Wild and minty. Before, his hands had been all over her. They\u2019d kneaded at her, both taking and giving pleasure. Now, he cupped her cheeks, infinitely gentle. Giving all, taking nothing.</p><p>And like that, the icy shell she\u2019d spent centuries erecting stopped melting. It simply tumbled down, brick by frosted brick.</p><p>\u201cNot going to...won\u2019t...don\u2019t trust me, devil.\u201d Gideon unzipped his pants. \u201cNot going to...\u201d Again, he didn\u2019t finish. He simply pressed his erection between her legs, hard and unbelievably thick, unyielding male to weeping female, and hissed. He didn\u2019t sink inside but rubbed...creating the first bloom of a fever. A slow burn, but all the hotter for it.</p><p>Trust him not to take what she hadn\u2019t offered. But really, she wouldn\u2019t have stopped him if he\u2019d poised himself for penetration. Still. He never did. He contented himself with the rubbing and the kissing, tongues rolling, savoring, simply basking in all that she was, as she did with him.</p><p>For a moment, she pretended they were back inside that cell. That this man really was her husband. A husband who loved her, who placed her needs above all things, even himself. She pretended that he would return to her tomorrow as well, love shining in his eyes. She pretended their only obstacle was her imprisonment.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>Perhaps he\u2019d been doing the same, pretending, because the sound of her voice snapped him from that steady pace. His movements toughened, sped up. Became more frantic. He\u2019d always been so gentle with her, treated her like a porcelain doll, but now...he was dirty and wanton, consuming, the friction sparking.</p><p>She drank him in greedily, luxuriated. And it was easy, so easy to do. To give herself. To lose herself. Even though he was different now. Maybe because he was different.</p><p>\u201cNot...my Scar. Not my Scar. Don\u2019t touch me,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>Touch. Yes. Must. She pried her fingers from the headboard, her hands falling on him, nerves tingling back to life as her nails grazed his skin, leaving welts. He roared, a song of absolute contentment tinged with utter despair. The past and present, discordant yet soothing.</p><p>\u201cYou...you...\u201d he said, then stopped himself. \u201cScar.\u201d A prelude, a waiting storm. \u201cDon\u2019t come, don\u2019t come for me, don\u2019t you come for me.\u201d With every word, his cock pressed against her clit.</p><p>Every muscle in her body stiffened, pain in its most exquisite form. The shadows danced faster...faster...the screams grew louder...louder...until hers joined the symphony, the edge of completion rushing to meet her halfway.</p><p>She hurtled over, shaking, shouting, clutching at the man responsible. \u201cGideon!\u201d My Gideon.</p><p>Soon he was shaking as well, roaring again, louder this time, and warm seed was jetting onto her stomach. That only increased her pleasure, spiraling her into a deeper awareness of her body. He was on top of her, weighing her down, all over her, his semen on her skin, branding her.</p><p>A marriage of the flesh, base, instinctual. What she\u2019d craved, had never thought to have again. What she\u2019d needed, despite the repercussions.</p><p>What would surely be the death of her.</p><p>An eternity later, they collapsed together, Scarlet into the mattress, Gideon still on top of her. As the shadows and screams dispersed, neither of them moved. They lay there for a long while, trying to catch their breath, still completely lost in the moment. This was, perhaps, the only relaxed, contented moment they would ever have, because she couldn\u2019t allow this again, she realized.</p><p>She had to replace the ice.</p><p>There was no other way to protect her fragile heart. A heart she couldn\u2019t afford to give away. Not again. She barely had any pieces of it left. But there were pieces. And that was just as shocking.</p><p>Save yourself. Hurry! She shoved him off her and sat up, not trusting herself to look at him. \u201cGet some rest,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure no one enters the room.\u201d</p><p>Last time they\u2019d fooled around, he hadn\u2019t complained about the abrupt change in her. He\u2019d simply done as she\u2019d ordered. Mostly. This time, he latched onto her arm and jerked her backward, twisting her so that she landed on her stomach.</p><p>Before she had time to protest\u2014so you\u2019d give one now?\u2014he raised her shirt and planted a soft kiss on her lower back, where her tattoo rested. TO PART IS TO DIE. The action was so unexpected, so astonishing and secretly welcome, she pressed her lips together to cut off her sob. Damn him. Damn him to hell!</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay next to me. Don\u2019t let me hold you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Resist. You have to resist. But she found herself nodding and whispering back, \u201cAll right.\u201d Idiot.</p><p>With a sigh, she curled closer to him. I\u2019ll patch myself up tomorrow.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>IMPATIENCE RODE Strider like a damn carnival pony. Several days had passed since he\u2019d last received a text from Gideon. Last Strider had heard, Gideon was leaving his hotel due to a Hunter infestation. Understandable. But Lies had one more day to check in or return, and then Strider was supposed to search for him. Hell, Gideon might be in trouble and counting on that.</p><p>Except, Strider had to remain in the fortress. Some bad shit was about to go down.What a cluster. Amun, Aeron and William had left a short while ago to perform a search and rescue in the fiery pits of hell. Yeah, a real party in a box. Strider would\u2019ve liked to go with them, though. At the very least, to trail behind them and offer what protection he could. But he wouldn\u2019t be doing that, either.</p><p>Instead, he found himself standing inside Torin\u2019s bedroom. The keeper of Disease was seated before a wall of monitors, each revealing a different location in the fortress, the mountain outside it and the surrounding city as the warrior typed away on a keyboard.</p><p>Normally Torin was nonchalant, irreverent and unruffled. Today he\u2019d tangled his hand through his white hair too many times to count, causing the strands to stick out around his head. His neck-to-toe clothes were wrinkled, and the gloves he wore every minute of every day were frayed in a few places. His expression was dark and somber, and lines of tension bracketed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the Hunters posted again?\u201d Strider asked.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, there and there.\u201d Torin motioned to different monitors with a tilt of his head. \u201cThey\u2019re in large groups, and they\u2019re surrounding the fortress full-circle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow were they able to amass and approach without our knowledge?\u201d Torin\u2019s eagle eye usually missed nothing. Helped that he could hack into any system, even the city\u2019s, the government\u2019s, and study areas from their cameras.</p><p>\u201cThey fucking appeared out of nowhere,\u201d the warrior mumbled. \u201cWhich means someone flashed them. Lucien can only flash those he touches, so whoever did this is sickeningly powerful. I\u2019ve summoned Cronus, but he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs here,\u201d a hard voice finished.</p> <p>Both Strider and Torin turned to find Cronus towering in the far corner. The god king strode forward, the hem of his alabaster robe dancing around his ankles. Interesting.</p><p>There\u2019d been no flash of light, as the sovereign usually preferred. Like the Hunters, he\u2019d simply appeared.</p><p>Was everyone off their game today?</p><p>Like Torin, he was in a state of disarray. His dark hair, now minus any gray, was a mop around his head. His tanned skin, no longer marred by wrinkles, was tight with his frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Strider asked. He didn\u2019t mind fighting Hunters. In fact, he loved it. Lived for it. His demon did, too. Every victory was like injecting heroin straight into his veins, a high, an addiction. But this...</p> <p>Some of his friends were gone. The fortress was filled to bursting with women. Some of them delicate, and in need of serious protection. Hell, Maddox\u2019s female was pregnant. How was Strider supposed to win this battle and keep everyone safe?</p><p>Cronus stopped behind Torin, closer than anyone had dared get to the warrior in years. \u201cGalen is out of commission for the time being, so my...wife\u2014\u201d he sneered the word \u201c\u2014is dealing directly with the humans. And she\u2019s commanded them to storm this fortress, destroy it and everyone inside then steal your artifacts from the rubble.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Damn, damn, damn. He couldn\u2019t even rejoice that Galen was out of commission, for whatever reason. This was bad news, all the way around.</p><p>A growl rose from Cronus. \u201cHer daring...offends me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill her, then,\u201d Torin suggested, deadly serious.</p><p>Strider seconded that motion.</p> <p>Never had the god king appeared more wistful. \u201cNo. I cannot.\u201d</p><p>The absolute conviction in his tone surprised Strider. \u201cHow about I do it?\u201d Killing females wasn\u2019t his favorite thing, but he\u2019d had to do it before. Hunters were fond of using women to distract the Lords, to learn about them and ultimately betray them. He did what was necessary to protect his friends. Always had, always would.</p><p>Cronus shook his head, though he hadn\u2019t lost his pensive glow. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was holding him back? \u201cDo you love your wife or something? Even after all she\u2019s done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove that whore? No!\u201d A denial spat as if the greedy bastard had just been asked to abdicate his throne.</p><p>Kings, man. Worse than females. \u201cThen let me end her.\u201d</p><p>Cronus rounded on him, fury flickering black and gold in his eyes, and gripped a fistful of Strider\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou will not touch her. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>All systems go.</p> <p>This was a challenge. One Strider couldn\u2019t ignore. His demon roared to life, happy, eager to attack. There would be no saving the god queen now. Not without Strider suffering. And that\u2019s exactly what happened when he lost. He suffered. And he would do anything to prevent such an outcome. He wanted the heroin.</p><p>The king must have realized his mistake. He released Strider, palms out. \u201cMy...apologies, Defeat. Do whatever you wish.\u201d Though he didn\u2019t sound apologetic, the words had the desired effect.</p><p>Defeat\u2019s eagerness deflated. Challenge over, systems shut down. Disappointed, Strider nodded and smoothed his shirt. \u201cSo, you wanna explain? You don\u2019t love her, but you want her alive. She\u2019s causing you nothing but problems, yet you don\u2019t want to end her. I\u2019m drawing a blank on this one.\u201d</p><p>He could imagine his head separating from his body in the ensuing silence.</p><p>Then, \u201cIf Rhea dies, I\u2014\u201d Cronus scrubbed a hand down his suddenly tired face. \u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you does not leave this room. If it does, I will know and I will retaliate.\u201d</p><p>Strider and Torin shared a look, then both of them nodded.</p><p>Cronus closed his eyes. Several more minutes ticked by in that lethal silence. Then his shoulders slumped, and he sighed, facing them. \u201cIf Rhea dies...I die. We are...connected.\u201d</p><p>Strider\u2019s first thought after absorbing the news? Oh, shit, no. Not good. Not good at all. The Lords needed Cronus. For the moment, anyway. Bastard he might be, but that bastard was helping them in ways they hadn\u2019t known they\u2019d needed. He\u2019d provided them with ancient scrolls that listed all the immortals possessed by one of Pandora\u2019s demons, giving the Lords a chance to capture them before the Hunters did. He was able to whisk them wherever they wished to go\u2014like the fiery pits of hell. He had given them necklaces that prevented other gods from being able to spy on them.</p><p>Strider fingered the necklace in question. A butterfly with blade-tipped wings, exactly like the one tattooed on the left side of his hip, dangled from the center of an unbreakable chain. What would they do without Cronus\u2019s aid?</p><p>Return to a life of being ignored by the gods? Sounded good in theory, but what if someone else, someone who didn\u2019t want them to succeed, took an interest in their cause?</p><p>Torin stopped typing and swiveled in his chair, peering up at the king. \u201cBut Rhea\u2019s helping Galen. And Danika\u2014\u201d the All-Seeing Eye \u201c\u2014predicted Galen would kill you. If Danika was right, Galen will also be responsible for Rhea\u2019s death. So why would your wife aid him?\u201d</p><p>Good point. They\u2019d known for months that Galen would make a play for Cronus\u2019s head, but they hadn\u2019t known why. Until a few weeks ago, when Strider and a few of the others had finally gotten the surly deities known as the Unspoken Ones to cough up some answers. Whoever presented the Unspoken Ones with the god king\u2019s head would be given the Paring Rod, the last of the artifacts needed to find Pandora\u2019s box.</p><p>Only problem? Each of the Unspoken Ones was part man, part animal and all venom, and he didn\u2019t trust them.</p><p>They were slaves to Cronus\u2014slaves that would be freed upon his death\u2014and would say anything to gain release. Hell, they may not even know where the Rod was.</p><p>Besides, there was no telling what kind of havoc they\u2019d wreak if they were loosed. They liked to eat humans, after all. As in, chomp them out and spit out their bones.</p><p>The Rod wasn\u2019t worth risking the end of the world. Yet.</p><p>\u201cSince Rhea flashed the Hunters here,\u201d Strider said to Cronus, \u201ccan you flash them elsewhere?\u201d He could have patted himself on the back for that one. Someone should probably dub him Master Strategist.</p><p>A shake of the king\u2019s head dashed his hopes for such a prestigious (and brilliantly invented, if he did say so himself) award. \u201cShe\u2019ll simply flash them back. Perhaps inside the fortress next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Strider replied, thinking aloud. \u201cCurrently we\u2019re missing a chunk of our forces. Which means we won\u2019t have an edge if we fight these Hunters. Which means we could lose. Which means it\u2019ll be best if we split up. I can take one of the artifacts. Reyes can take Danika, and Lucien and Anya can take the remaining artifact. We\u2019ll all go in different directions. The Hunters won\u2019t be able to track us all. And with our new necklaces\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer manlaces,\u201d Torin said, sounding more like his old, irreverent self.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Damn. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of that? \u201cWith our new manlaces, even Rhea won\u2019t know where we are.\u201d</p><p>Cronus stroked his chin, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d Torin asked, clearly recognizing a phenomenal idea when he heard one.</p><p>Strider started designing a Master Strategist plaque for his room. \u201cMaddox can take Ashlyn somewhere. As protective of her and that bun in her oven as he is, he\u2019s probably already built a bomb shelter in the city. Now that Gwen\u2019s back from her trip to the clouds, she and Sabin can take care of themselves. They aren\u2019t in any danger. Aeron\u2019s off on his mission to hell and Olivia\u2019s taken Gwen\u2019s place in the sky, from what I can tell. The others, well, Kane, Cameo and Paris, can stay here with you and defend our home. Gideon can help when he returns.\u201d If he returns.</p><p>He will. Strider wouldn\u2019t believe otherwise.</p><p>A moment passed in heavy silence, but at least there was no cutting edge to this one.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the fourth artifact?\u201d Cronus asked, returning to the conversation. \u201cWho\u2019s going to look for it?\u201d</p><p>Bottom line was, they couldn\u2019t allow the Hunters to get it. Even at the expense of Cronus\u2019s head. \u201cI can,\u201d Strider said. \u201cI\u2019ll take the Cloak of Invisibility with me. That way, I won\u2019t have to fight anyone if I find it. I can just grab it and go.\u201d</p><p>Torin arched a black brow at him, green eyes glowing. \u201cDo you have any idea where to start looking?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. He did. The Temple of the Unspoken Ones.</p><p>Cronus must have realized the direction of his thoughts, because he gave another growl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to betray you,\u201d Strider assured him, palms raised in a mimic of Cronus\u2019s earlier gesture. Like Gideon, he could easily lie. Whether he was lying or not, though, he didn\u2019t yet know. \u201cI\u2019ll remain invisible and listen. If the Hunters arrive, if the Unspoken Ones mention anything about the Rod, I\u2019ll be there. I\u2019ll find it first.\u201d</p><p>Cronus relaxed somewhat. \u201cVery well. You may go with my blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, uh, we had best get everyone on the same page and on their way,\u201d Torin said, his voice hard once again. \u201cThe Hunters are on the move.\u201d</p><p>Strider\u2019s gaze returned to the monitors, and sure enough, the groups of Hunters were closing in on the fortress. \u201cYou tell everyone what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said to Torin in a rush. \u201cI\u2019ll grab the Cloak and kill as many of those bastards as I can on my way out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Defeat sat up again, once more happy and eager.</p><p>Happy and eager himself, Strider palmed a blade and a semiautomatic, his favorite weapon combination.

The heat was unbearable, the smells of sulfur and rot thick in Amun\u2019s nostrils. Thousands of screams assaulted his ears, each more tortured than the last.</p><p>Why had he agreed to come here?Oh, yeah. To save Legion. For Aeron.</p><p>Like Amun, Aeron and William were seated in the small but sturdy boat Cronus had summoned for them after flashing them here.

One drop of that liquid upon their skin, and their life force would begin to drain.</p><p>\u201cSo, why is Lucifer afraid of you?\u201d Aeron asked William, cutting through the silence as he gently rowed.</p> <p>The warrior, who was reclining at the stern of the boat, plucking at the tip of his blade, merely shrugged. \u201cJust is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a reason,\u201d Aeron insisted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll always talk about that reason.\u201d</p><p>William made sure to keep his mind blank, Amun noticed, preventing Amun from reading his thoughts.</p><p>Such a delightful journey already. And this was only the beginning.</p><p>They had to follow the river to where it merged with the four other rivers flowing inside this vast lair. Phlegethon\u2014the river of fire. Acheron\u2014the river of woe. Cocytus\u2014the river of wailing. Lethe\u2014the river of forgetfulness. And they had to do it without disturbing Charon, the boatman of the underworld responsible for carting the dead to whichever section of hell their lost soul had been condemned to. The fires, the endless pits, the persecution caverns.</p> <p>Until recently, they wouldn\u2019t have had to worry about Charon at all. But upon Cronus\u2019s release from Tartarus, the god king had returned this realm to its original state, including the rehiring, so to speak, of its guardians.</p><p>Charon, if Amun\u2019s sources were accurate, was nothing more than a walking skeleton. He viewed living beings as abominations and strove to wipe them out. To the dead, however, he was courteous.</p><p>I would help you with the coming trials, Cronus had told them, just before disappearing, but I must return to your fortress \u2019ere my wife does more harm. Then he\u2019d added, I bid you good luck, for you will greatly need it. You bested Lucifer, Aeron, and now he wants revenge.</p><p>That \u201cbesting\u201d was the reason Legion was trapped here. She had broken a heavenly law and bound herself to Aeron. Lucifer had planned to use that bond to possess her body and escape the underworld. Only, to save everyone he loved, Aeron had allowed Lysander to take his head and break the bond, returning Legion here and ruining Lucifer\u2019s plans.</p><p>Olivia upset that you left her behind? Amun signed, and William translated, his gaze then roving over the dark, misty water in search of another boat.</p><p>A muscle ticked below Aeron\u2019s violet eyes. Eyes he, too, was moving over the water. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage it?\u201d William asked, sounding genuinely curious rather than cheekily blithe for once. \u201cI know women, and that one is more determined than most. And, well, you\u2019ve got no backbone where she\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><p>Aeron ignored the jab. \u201cLysander helped.\u201d</p> <p>Lysander. An angel. An elite angel, at that. He was Olivia\u2019s mentor, the one who\u2019d killed Aeron, and the only man powerful enough to keep a resourceful female like Olivia from following her man.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll hate me when this is over,\u201d Aeron added morosely.</p><p>Amun caught the bulk of his thoughts. Aeron had nearly called this trip off to prevent such a thing from happening, and that had filled him with guilt. Olivia was his life, his future. He loved her more than he loved himself, more than he loved his friends. She was his everything. But he wouldn\u2019t be the warrior she\u2019d fallen in love with if he\u2019d left Legion here to die. Yet he hadn\u2019t been able to tolerate the thought of bringing innocent Olivia into this dark, evil place.</p><p>She\u2019d been here before, and several demons had attacked her and ripped off her wings. The memories still troubled her at times, and Aeron never wanted her to have to relive those helpless moments. So he\u2019d tricked her into staying with Lysander, who now held her captive in the sky.</p><p>In spite of everything, part of him wanted to go back for her and bring her here if that\u2019s what she wished. Anything to stop her from hating him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d William replied after some thought involving knives, scissors and a tub of honey. He showed no mercy. But then, he never did. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t known for their forgiveness. Especially women who\u2019ve been spending quality time with the minor goddess of Anarchy and a bunch of bloodthirsty Harpies.\u201d</p><p>Aeron scowled at him, and the warrior just laughed. That laughter caused Aeron\u2019s aggression to spike and his paddling to increase in velocity. Gently, Amun removed the oars from his hands and took over.</p><p>Because of the thickness of the mist, he could see very little in front of him. However, he began to see what looked to be pinpricks of orange-gold light. A crackling fire, perhaps? Were they close to the River Phlegethon?</p><p>He turned just as slow and easy as he paddled to silently ask the others to verify. But as he moved, he spotted several ripples in the water. Ripples that weren\u2019t coming from their boat. His blood heated, and it had nothing to do with the two-hundred-degree temperature.</p><p>Amun smoothly locked the oars in their holders and grabbed his guns. Aeron and William caught the significance of his gesture and followed suit.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d William whispered as his gaze scanned the area.</p><p>Aeron crouched on his belly, peering intently into the night. A moment passed, silent, taut. \u201cThere\u2019s another boat,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cSeveral yards ahead.\u201d</p><p>Amun opened his mind, allowing his demon to search for any incoming streams of conscious thought. All he heard was Must die, must die, must die.</p><p>Charon, he realized, just as the other boat came into view. A figure wearing a long, black cloak stood in the center. He had flames instead of hair, and a face that was composed only of bone. Worse, with only the barest (yet still earth-shattering) glance, Amun realized Charon\u2019s eyes were deep black holes where thousands of souls seemed to dance...or writhe in pain.</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of this,\u201d William said.</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Aeron replied.</p><p>William stood, and the vessel rocked. \u201cYou know me, old friend. It is I, William the Beloved,\u201d he called. \u201cWe mean you no harm. We just want to pass through.\u201d</p><p>Old friend? William the Beloved?</p><p>Charon lifted both hands and pointed a bony finger at Aeron and William.</p><p>Oh, shit. William\u2019s thoughts invaded Amun\u2019s mind. Guess I shouldn\u2019t have bagged his wife last time I was here.</p><p>Wonderful.</p><p>\u201cWhat does being pointed at mean?\u201d Aeron demanded softly.</p><p>\u201cIt means we\u2019re on his hit list,\u201d William responded, sounding grimmer than Amun had ever heard him. \u201cBe afraid. Be very afraid.\u201d</p><p>Amun, the guardian had ignored. Which made no\u2014The answer hit him, drifting to him from the creature\u2019s thoughts. Charon sensed the demon inside Amun and didn\u2019t care if he entered hell or not.</p><p>Just as, this very morning, he hadn\u2019t minded if Galen entered. The memory washed through Amun\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cYou demand payment, this I know,\u201d Galen had said just before tossing a severed human head into Charon\u2019s boat.</p><p>Charon had nodded in acceptance, and swept his arm behind him so that Galen could pass. Only, Galen remained in place, jaw hardening. He looked over his shoulder, forward, over his shoulder again.</p><p>Again, Charon swept his arm back to usher Galen along.</p><p>Galen scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not yet. There\u2019s something I have to do on the surface first.\u201d His hands fisted. \u201cSomeone I have to kill before the bastard kills me. But I\u2019ll be back. And when I am, you\u2019ll remember that I\u2019ve already paid for my entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Amun, man,\u201d Aeron said, dragging Amun from his troubling vision. \u201cYou listening? Any ideas about what we should do? William says we can\u2019t look into the bastard\u2019s eyes without losing our own souls, and we can\u2019t touch him, either. If we do, he\u2019ll be able to compel our gazes to his.\u201d</p><p>Charon\u2019s boat was inching forward, Amun saw, and sparks were now igniting over his fingertips. Kill, kill, kill, the boatman was thinking. The obsessive concentration he displayed didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>Options? Payment wouldn\u2019t work, not for them. Aeron was no longer possessed by a demon, and William was merely an immortal. Charon wouldn\u2019t let them pay to pass unless they were dead. Or missing their souls. And the boatman planned to do whatever was necessary to ensure either outcome.</p><p>The first thing he planned? Splashing them.</p><p>Thank the gods Olivia had supplied them with a vial of water from the River of Life. Found only in the heavens, a single drop could counteract the effects of this water. Only problem was, once they ran out, they were out. There\u2019d be no more. Ever.</p><p>Better for one man to use one drop than three men to use three drops. More than that, Amun\u2019s soul was tied to his demon, so Charon wouldn\u2019t want it. Which meant Amun was the only one who could look at and touch the guardian without consequence.</p><p>Which meant Amun had to be the one to act.</p><p>Have an idea, Amun signed. On my signal, propel our vessel to the shore.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Someone else will be the hero for a change. But what\u2019s the signal?\u201d William asked.</p><p>This. Amun leaped at Charon, throwing them both into the river. Sizzling water enveloped him, practically burning away his clothing and peeling away his skin. But he held tight to Charon, caging the bony creature within his arms. Perhaps the water negated a little of the creature\u2019s ability, because Amun felt no compulsion to gaze at him. Most of his power remained, however. Skeletal hands pushed at him and those hands were a thousand times hotter than the water, like jolts of electricity straight to his heart, causing the organ to stutter to a halt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still Amun held on.</p><p>Soon, lack of oxygen began to fuzz his brain. He opened his mouth, accidentally swallowed a mouthful of that terrible, rotting liquid and gagged. Death crawled through him, destroying him cell by cell, filling him with decay. Weakening him.</p><p>Charon wiggled loose.</p> <p>The boatman kicked his way to the surface. Though Amun\u2019s vision was dotting over with black, he fought his way up, too. Before he could discover whether Aeron and William were safe, Charon batted him back under with a hard elbow to the top of his head. Stars flashed behind his eyes. More of that disgusting water slid down his throat and into his stomach. A stomach now churning and burning with nausea.</p><p>Again, Amun fought his way up. The moment he broke the surface, he sucked in as much air as he could. Good thing, too. His boat was out of sight, and Charon was pissed and now determined to end Amun. Demon or not.</p><p>As Amun treaded water, their eyes met. The souls were swirling, faster and faster, white blurs that hypnotized. And yet, Amun didn\u2019t lose his soul. Somehow, his demon kept him grounded.</p><p>Punish, punish, punish, the creature was thinking. He grabbed Amun by the hair and shoved him under. This time, Amun wasn\u2019t strong enough to free himself. He could only flail, sucking in gulp after gulp, dying a little more with every second that passed.</p><p>Dear gods. Was this it for him? His muscles seized, preventing all movement. Yes, this was it. The end. His body was shutting down. He\u2019d lived so long, he should be happy about that. But he\u2019d never fallen in love, cherished anyone the way his friends cherished their women, and found that he mourned the lost opportunity.</p> <p>Inside his head, Secrets roared. Roared so loud and long his muscles twitched back to life. Can\u2019t give up. Can\u2019t. Give. Up.</p><p>His demon had never spoken to him before.</p><p>Though it required every last bit of his strength, Amun kicked Charon in the chest, shooting them apart, and swam up and away. He glanced left, right, and spotted the shore because William was holding some type of glowing stick and waving him over.</p><p>Determined, he breast-stroked toward the light. Until Charon grabbed hold of his ankle and stopped him. Secrets roared for a second time. Must...fight...</p><p>Secrets even reached a mental claw toward the boatman and unleashed a stream of images inside his head. Good images. The few happy secrets Amun possessed. Secrets that had saved human lives. The giving of money. The giving of organs. Love from afar.</p><p>Charon released him and clutched at his own bony temples. Panting, still dying inside, Amun worked his way to the shore.</p> <p>William reached for him, but Aeron stopped him. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch him. You\u2019ll weaken, too.\u201d</p><p>Amun fell upon the ground, sharp rocks digging into his bare, blistered back.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d Aeron commanded. He was thinking: Never seen a man in this condition. Will the water be enough to save him? Oh, gods. How could I have brought him here? If he dies, it\u2019ll be my fault.</p><p>Amun didn\u2019t have the strength to obey. The cool water Aeron tried to pour into his mouth dribbled over the side of his face. And damn it! That had been more than a drop.</p><p>\u201cOpen, or I\u2019ll do it for you,\u201d William growled. He meant what he said.</p><p>Amun finally managed to unhinge his jaw, prying his lips apart, and a second later a cool stream was dripping into his mouth, slowly chasing away the weakness and the burn.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d William said. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly any left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. Look, the charred areas of his skin are weaving back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but how long\u2014\u201d Abruptly, Aeron stopped talking.</p><p>A few yards away, voices cackled. Amun didn\u2019t have to see to know multiple pairs of red eyes peeked around a bloodstained boulder. He could already hear their thoughts: Fresh meat.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>BACK ON MY FEET and in fighting form, Gideon thought the next night. Well, perhaps \u201cfighting form\u201d was too strong a phrase. Barely-hanging-on-but-forcing-himself-into-action was a much better description. He led Scarlet through secret passageway after secret passageway in Cronus\u2019s palace, stumbling over his own feet every couple of steps.</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re good?\u201d Scarlet asked, squeezing his hand.\u201cOf course,\u201d he lied smoothly. No way he\u2019d turn around and go back to that bedroom. One, he\u2019d make love to her. There wasn\u2019t time for that, and worse, she\u2019d have to do all the work and he\u2019d look like a jerk. More of a jerk than he already was. And two, vengeance waited.</p><p>\u201cGreat. You\u2019re doing horribly. We should turn around and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh! You\u2019re so frustrating. Well, are you sure you know where you\u2019re going?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a woman to suffer in silence.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Thousands of years had passed since he\u2019d last been inside this heavenly citadel, but he remembered these hidden hallways. Gods knew he\u2019d once used them enough, having been one of Zeus\u2019s trusted elite. He\u2019d had to sneak the king to his mistresses and the mistresses to the king, all the while listening for plots against his majesty and watching for spies. Then and now, it helped that many of the walls were made of two-way glass.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Scarlet suddenly gasped out, tugging at him, trying to get him to stop.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll gawk at everything later.\u201d No, actually, they wouldn\u2019t. They\u2019d be too busy torturing their son\u2019s murderer. Don\u2019t think about that until you find the bastard. The rage would consume him, and he\u2019d use up what remained of his energy.</p><p>She knew what he\u2019d meant, knew they wouldn\u2019t be coming back. \u201cBut I...I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, he thought with a pang of regret. Even though she was the daughter of a queen, she\u2019d been treated like a slave her entire life, denied her birthright not only when all the Titans were imprisoned, but after they were freed, as well. Fuckers! He slowed his steps, allowing her to take in the stardust chandeliers, the glistening marble waterfalls, the orchids blooming straight out of the walls.</p><p>How could her mother have kept this from her? How could the woman who\u2019d given birth to her have treated her so poorly?</p><p>Like you treated your own son?</p><p>Gideon popped his jaw. Someone stole my memory of him, damn it.</p><p>That didn\u2019t ease his guilt. He should have remembered that precious boy. Some part of him should have, at the very least. Yet, of all the times Gideon had seen flashes of Scarlet in his mind, he\u2019d never seen flashes of Steel. He didn\u2019t have a single tattoo to represent and honor his dead son.</p><p>I\u2019m the worst fucking father in the world.</p><p>Lies had nothing to say on the matter; it was as if the demon didn\u2019t care about the boy, living or dead, truth or lie, on any level.</p><p>But Steel couldn\u2019t be a lie. No one would fake the pain Scarlet had projected upon his murder. Not even the actors Scarlet liked to eat with her eyes.</p><p>With his free hand, Gideon scrubbed at his scalp. Even now, he couldn\u2019t remember his life with Scarlet. Couldn\u2019t fucking remember, even though their wedding was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever witnessed. She\u2019d glowed. Oh, had she glowed. With love, promise...hope. Just thinking of it, he was humbled.</p><p>And yeah, he wanted her to look at him like that again. He didn\u2019t deserve it, but he couldn\u2019t stop the desire.</p><p>He fingered the butterfly necklace once again clasped around his neck. Thank the gods Scarlet had found it and brought it to him. Even though she had every reason to hate him, she\u2019d thought of him, looked out for him.</p><p>She truly was far too good for him.</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine living here?\u201d she asked with wonder. Wonder tinged with regret and sadness. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been forced to live in caves and crypts and this was my legacy. Wow. Just wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I don\u2019t prefer to live below.\u201d Here, he was one of a thousand others who were just as strong as he was. If not stronger. There, he was a man of power.</p><p>He wanted to be all-powerful in Scarlet\u2019s eyes. He wanted to be well able to provide for her.</p><p>Hell, he might just buy her a palace of her own. Actually, no. He\u2019d build the bitch with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d She tugged free of his hand, stopped and pressed her palms to the glass. Her own necklace clinked. \u201cPeople actually read in those chairs?\u201d</p><p>He paused beside her and sighed. \u201cTake your time. We don\u2019t need to reach Cronus\u2019s room, like, ASAP. He won\u2019t be returning for me soon, and we don\u2019t need to be long gone by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but why venture into his bedroom?\u201d Her gaze was glued to the heavy velvet drapes and the gold-inlaid tables that filled the empty sitting room. No, not empty, he realized. Someone\u2014a tall, blond male\u2014was striding to the bookcase. \u201cCan he hear us?\u201d Scarlet whispered.</p><p>Did she want him to? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good. So we can drool in peace.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize the god, but that didn\u2019t stop Gideon from hating the male at first sight.</p><p>\u201cAnyway. As I was saying,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just head to the prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a slave collar to open the gates of Tartarus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no! I\u2019m not wearing a slave collar. Not ever again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to wear it, smartie, not just hold it. Now. Do you not know who that is?\u201d So I know the name of the next man I kill.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. That\u2019s Hyperion, Titan god of Light. Gorgeous, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Damn her and her attraction to blonds. \u201cI might have known the face, but I don\u2019t know the name. I also don\u2019t know that Hyperion is a sociopath. He doesn\u2019t enjoy setting immortals on fire just to watch them burn and hear them scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t meet him in prison?\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cMet, yes. We didn\u2019t share the same cell, though. Unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>If Scarlet thought to kiss another man the way she\u2019d kissed Gideon, if she thought to allow another man to touch her the way Gideon had touched her, burning to death would be the least of her worries. Right now, she belonged to Gideon. She was his wife. He didn\u2019t share. At least, not anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scowling, Gideon grabbed her hand and tugged her forward. \u201cNot enough of that.\u201d His steps were clipped, his boots thumping into the onyx floor. They snaked a corner and another room came into view. A ballroom. Glittery sprites were darting throughout it, dusting and polishing the entire area.</p><p>Around another corner, the hall tilted at a steep incline, and though his still-tired thighs hated the burn, he didn\u2019t slow. His growing anger gave him strength. Anger, not jealousy. He didn\u2019t do jealousy.</p><p>\u201cSo who aren\u2019t you today?\u201d He hadn\u2019t asked yet, he realized. But as always, once he wondered, he could think of nothing else. Say Lord. You had better say Lord.</p> <p>\u201cScarlet...Hyperion. Yes, that has a nice ring to it.\u201d</p><p>Enough! At the top of the incline, Gideon stopped and spun. When Scarlet slammed into him, he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her. She kept her gaze averted and...was that...was she... Sure enough. Her lips were curling into a smile. She was fighting laughter, the witch.</p><p>Gideon released her, his anger draining. Anger, not jealousy. \u201cYou\u2019re not begging for a spanking, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Her words cut off as she gasped. Once more she pressed herself against the glass, her amusement forgotten. \u201cThat\u2019s Mnemosyne. My aunt.\u201d</p><p>Knee-mah-zee-knee. Odd name. He followed the direction of Scarlet\u2019s gaze. Inside an opulent bedroom of cherrywood and gold-threaded marble, a slender blonde sat upon a ruffled pink bed. Her hair curled innocently to the middle of her back. In contrast, she wore a slinky black dress that was slit up both thighs.</p> <p>\u201cNo hurry, remember?\u201d He wrapped his arm around Scarlet\u2019s waist. He hadn\u2019t dared before. She would have rebuked him, and he\u2019d known it. But she had teased him a moment ago, and she was distracted now; he wasn\u2019t above using either to his advantage. He wanted to touch her. All the damn time.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to her, Gideon. Please.\u201d Dark eyes flicked briefly up to him, imploring. \u201cShe\u2019s the goddess of Memory and she might know who messed with your mind. Or how they did it, at the very least. Gods, I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think about asking her before.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Scarlet had asked him for anything, and he found, even as urgency raced through him, that he could deny her nothing. \u201cSure you can\u2019t trust her?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Scarlet\u2019s head canted to the side. Her gaze swept past her aunt, past the room, to someplace he couldn\u2019t reach. \u201cShe was always kind to me. Wait. At least, I think she was. She used to hug me when I was sad. Again, I think. My memories of her are fuzzy.\u201d</p><p>Fuzzy. That wasn\u2019t like Scarlet. She remembered every-freaking-thing.</p><p>Her gaze met Gideon\u2019s, lingering this time, and her frown deepened. \u201cWait. What was I saying?\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t remember that, either? \u201cWe weren\u2019t discussing your aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy who?\u201d</p><p>He blinked down at her. She couldn\u2019t recall a conversation from two seconds ago? Weird. And wrong.</p><p>His attention returned to her aunt. The goddess of Memory, huh? Gideon had never dealt with the woman; she\u2019d been locked up before his creation and he\u2019d never heard any gossip about her. Good or bad.</p><p>Scarlet followed his gaze. \u201cOh, look, Gideon! That\u2019s my aunt Mnemosyne.\u201d Eagerness practically buzzed from her as she jumped up and down. \u201cShe\u2019s the goddess of Memory. Maybe she\u2019ll be able to tell us how your memories were taken.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. \u201cScar. Don\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly her head turned, and her eyes clashed with his. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s not in that room?\u201d</p> <p>She blinked in confusion, just as he had done a moment ago. \u201cWhat room?\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin and turned her head back to the glass, so that she was once again looking inside the chamber. She gasped. \u201cGideon! Do you know who that is? She\u2019s the goddess of Memory, and she might be able to tell us how someone screwed with your mind.\u201d</p><p>His stomach clenched. Clearly, someone\u2014Mnemosyne herself?\u2014had screwed with Scarlet\u2019s mind. Because if she wasn\u2019t looking at her aunt, she couldn\u2019t remember the woman.</p><p>Could Mnemosyne have taken Gideon\u2019s memories, as well?</p><p>There was only one way to find out....</p><p>Fury. So much fury. \u201cJust...don\u2019t give me a minute to reason out the best way to approach her. Okay? And stop watching your aunt, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Okay.\u201d She tried to turn her head toward him, but he placed a hard hand on top of her head and held her immobile. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be still. But why do you want me to keep looking at her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do it.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her to forget again.</p><p>His arms fell to his sides as he considered their options. There was a doorway from the secret passage that led into the bedroom. Actually, there was a doorway to every room in the palace. But he didn\u2019t want to exit that way and reveal the passage to Mnemosyne, just in case she didn\u2019t know about it. As long as it was secret, he could use it as a way of escape. Which left only one option, really. Waiting.</p><p>Obstacle one. He and Scarlet would have to wait until the goddess left the room, sneak in and then wait for her to return. That could cause all kinds of problems since they needed to reach Cronus\u2019s room before the king realized they were missing.</p><p>Cronus could have stored the slave collars somewhere else, but Gideon highly doubted it. The king would want them close at hand, easily reachable if he decided to enslave someone new.</p><p>Obstacle two. Scarlet would need to sleep soon, and that would force them to remain for another twelve hours. At least. That was a little more waiting than he wanted to do.</p><p>On the plus side, Cronus wouldn\u2019t be able to find them. They could hide anywhere. But that didn\u2019t meant they could escape.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this again?\u201d a female voice suddenly asked from the bedroom. Only, Mnemosyne hadn\u2019t moved her lips. Peering closer, Gideon saw that a second woman had just exited the closet. A servant?</p><p>\u201cWith Atlas gone,\u201d the goddess replied in a bored tone, \u201cI needed a lover.\u201d</p><p>Atlas, Titan god of Strength. Once, the god had attempted to escape Tartarus and Gideon had helped hunt him down and re-cage him. And it hadn\u2019t been easy, either. No one had ever fought so forcefully.</p><p>Where had the god of Strength gone?</p><p>\u201cBut Cronus?\u201d A pair of black stilettos dangled from the servant\u2019s fingers as she approached the bed. She was tall and thin, with short brown hair that curled around her head. Plain blue cloth covered her, and not a single piece of jewelry did she wear. \u201cYou\u2019ve only been his mistress for six days, and already he kicked you out of your quarters in favor of a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a reminder,\u201d the goddess snapped.</p><p>\u201cHave you learned who the man is yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Cronus...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperimenting with a male lover? Who knows? I\u2019ll learn that, too, and eliminate the bastard if so.\u201d</p><p>The female sighed. \u201cYour sister will never forgive you for taking her place at the king\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>Mnemosyne laughed, the sound carefree. \u201cOh, Leto, you ignorant fool. My sister won\u2019t bother me. No matter what I do.\u201d</p><p>Ah. He knew the name. Leto was the minor Greek goddess of Modesty. She\u2019d been one of Hera\u2019s personal attendants yet had given birth to two of Zeus\u2019s children, and when the former queen learned of Zeus\u2019s infidelity, she had hated Leto for it. Hera had also tried to kill her, which was why Leto had been incarcerated with the Titans and had later, most likely, helped Cronus regain his throne.</p><p>Leto bent in front of Mnemosyne and strapped the shoes to her feet. \u201cBut how can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>A frowning Mnemosyne stood. \u201cYou\u2019re bothering me now. Leave.\u201d</p><p>Color bloomed in Leto\u2019s cheeks, but she straightened and strolled from the room.</p><p>Mnemosyne strode to the full-length mirror just in front of Scarlet and Gideon, heels clinking, and twirled, watching herself as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she breathed, her satisfaction clear.</p><p>Scarlet reached out and traced the glass, just along the woman\u2019s jaw. \u201cHer tone with Leto...that isn\u2019t like her. She\u2019s gentle. She\u2019s unerringly kind. I...think. I mean, even though everything inside me tells me she used to hug me and whisper sweet words into my ear, in the back of my mind, I can see her pushing me down. Yes. She did. She pushed me down. I can see it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your memories fuzzing more?\u201d Clearing up, he meant.</p><p>She understood. \u201cYes. The more I watch her, the more solid they become. She didn\u2019t just push me, she...yes, she actually kicked me while I was down.\u201d</p><p>First, the bitch was going to pay for that. Second, Scarlet was regaining her memory with surprising speed. Gods, he wished it were that easy for him. Just think about something and boom, it was all there. Every last detail. So badly he wanted to relive his every moment with Scarlet and Steel. \u201cWorry, Scar.\u201d Don\u2019t worry. \u201cYou won\u2019t get to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Such intense longing radiated from her, his chest started hurting. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I want to ask her about. The pushing and the kicking. You. What if...what if she\u2019s the one who hurt you?\u201d</p><p>What if. Yeah, he had questions of his own. And damn it. While he could wait for answers, he didn\u2019t want Scarlet to have to. There had to be another way inside that room.</p><p>He looked down the passage, where they had yet to go. Several more doorways loomed. \u201cStay here,\u201d he said, an idea hitting him. Come on. He pulled her with him. The next room was occupied by several servants, but the chamber after that was empty. Perfect. They could exit the secret passage with no one the wiser, backtrack to her aunt\u2019s room and enter through the front door. That way, if a quick escape became necessary, running back into the passage would still be an option. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon twisted the knob, relieved when the door opened soundlessly.</p><p>Inside the new quarters, he closed the door and watched as the paneling blended into the mirrored wall. Then he faced Scarlet and placed a finger at his lips. Quiet. This room might be empty, but he hadn\u2019t forgotten that the one next to it was not.</p><p>She nodded in understanding.</p> <p>Avoiding the immaculate feathered bed was tough\u2014he could just imagine Scarlet on top of him, grinding on his always-hard cock\u2014but he managed to place one foot in front of other. Eye on the prize and all that shit. As planned, they backtracked. In the hall, several sprites bustled past with their cleaning supplies. Gideon acted as if he belonged there and they ignored him. With all the immortals that passed through this palace, they were probably used to strangers.</p><p>Mnemosyne\u2019s door was closed. And damn, he was growing tired of trying to pronounce that name, even in his mind. He\u2019d never be able to say it out loud, anyway, thanks to his truth-curse. NeeMah would have to do instead. Besides, Scarlet thought she remembered this woman pushing her down, so that made the bitch an enemy, as far as Gideon was concerned.</p><p>\u201cLet me do all the talking,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank gods. I wasn\u2019t going to say anything to you, but since you mentioned it...she wouldn\u2019t understand you, so you\u2019d be doing everyone a favor, letting me take over.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a hard kiss on her lips, a silent thank-you. Then, with his free hand, he palmed a dagger and burst inside.</p> <p>The goddess gasped as she spun to face him, a hand fluttering over her heart. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Auntie,\u201d Scarlet said at his side. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d He was proud of her. There was iron-hard determination in her tone.</p><p>Blue eyes widened. \u201cS-Scarlet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one and only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get up here?\u201d She couldn\u2019t mask her outrage. Or her fear. \u201cYour mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Scarlet said. \u201cWe have questions, and you have answers. Answers you will give us.\u201d</p> <p>Good girl.</p><p>NeeMah gulped. Laughed shakily. \u201cYes, of course. And of course I missed you. I love you so much. You know that. I would do anything for you, just as I did when you were a child. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. Scarlet\u2019s head tilted to the side, and she rubbed her lips together as if she were pondering something important. Her warrior-stance relaxed. \u201cI\u2014 Yes. Yes, I do. You were so kind to me.\u201d</p><p>Gideon squeezed her hand. Don\u2019t lose focus now, sweetness. She was looking at the goddess; her mind shouldn\u2019t be fuzzing. Should be clearing. Right? That\u2019s how it had worked in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you remember.\u201d NeeMah\u2019s arms opened, the very picture of love. \u201cNow come over here and give your favorite aunt a hug.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet tugged from his hold and rushed forward. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry we scared you. We\u2019re not going to hurt you, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Gideon tried to grab her, but she danced out of reach, threw herself at her aunt, and he was forced to watch as smug satisfaction filled the goddess\u2019s eyes. Definitely a bitch, he thought. Besides that, his demon was suddenly going batshit crazy. In a good way. The demon liked her.</p><p>Pathological liars always had that effect.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just so happy to see you,\u201d Scarlet continued, oblivious. Looking at NeeMah must not matter when you were in the same room with her. Or when she purposely wove a deception.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m so...happy you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>Lie. Both he and his demon recognized it.</p><p>The bitch would pay for playing with his woman. He\u2019d thought it before, but now, now it was a need.</p><p>\u201cNow. Tell me about the man you brought me.\u201d The goddess\u2019s gaze landed on Gideon, intent, studying this time. Recognition\u2014followed by shock\u2014claimed her features. \u201cYou. Wh-what are you doing here? With Scarlet? What questions do you have for me?\u201d</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth. Such a telling reaction. She knew him, and she had expected him to stay away from Scarlet. \u201cScar, devil,\u201d he said, waving her back to his side. \u201cDon\u2019t ask her if she screwed with my memory.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly panic overrode every other emotion on the goddess\u2019s face. She straightened, stiffened. \u201cScarlet, my sweet. Your friend is being very rude. And sadly, he\u2019s acted this way before, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d She caressed Scarlet\u2019s temples, rubbing her thumbs in circles. \u201cEven though you try so very hard to instruct him with his manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d Scarlet admonished, releasing her aunt and turning to him. Her eyes were glazed but narrowed. \u201cHow dare you treat my favorite aunt that way? You know better. I\u2019ve told you and I\u2019ve told you to treat my family with respect.\u201d Uh. Excuse me?</p><p>NeeMah remained behind her, taller than Scarlet and towering over her shoulder, but using her as a shield nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask her!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Scarlet blinked, the glaze fading from her eyes. \u201cAsk her...\u201d</p><p>A now-trembling NeeMah laid a hand on Scarlet\u2019s shoulder. \u201cScarlet. You know I love you. You know I would never hurt you. And now you know, much to my regret, that Gideon used you to get to me. He and I were lovers, and he\u2019s always wanted me back. Isn\u2019t that right? We\u2019ve talked about this.\u201d Liar!</p><p>And yet, power hummed from each of her words, and Gideon almost believed he\u2019d used Scarlet to reach this point. That he\u2019d wanted to kill Scarlet and her aunt all along. Because if he couldn\u2019t have NeeMah, no one could.</p><p>Lies laughed, a giddy sound, and an image popped into Gideon\u2019s head. Small, fuzzy, but there. An image of Gideon pacing back and forth, planning. And the more he studied the image, the more the details filled in. He\u2019d been in his bedroom in Budapest, and he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Again, Lies laughed. Hate it, hate it, hate it.</p><p>This time, he was jarred from his thoughts. If Lies \u201chated\u201d the images so much, that meant they were fabricated. And if they were fabricated, that meant NeeMah had planted them. And if NeeMah had planted them...</p><p>\u201cYou used me,\u201d Scarlet gasped out. Absolute betrayal filled her eyes as she stared at him.</p><p>Had the same false images floated through her mind? Of course they had, he thought. NeeMah was more powerful than he ever could have realized. \u201cDevil, you don\u2019t have to believe me. I wouldn\u2019t kill your aunt if you were in front of her.\u201d Come on, darling. Move away from her and I\u2019ll end her.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do that to me?\u201d Scarlet croaked. \u201cHow could you use me to win back my aunt after everything you already did to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never\u2014\u201d Shit. He couldn\u2019t say it. Couldn\u2019t speak the truth. \u201cYour aunt is beautiful to me.\u201d Understand what I\u2019m saying, please understand. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one I want.\u201d</p><p>Grinning now, fear gone, NeeMah backed away from Scarlet. \u201cI\u2019ll go get help, my sweet.\u201d Despite her expression, her tone was still sad. \u201cYou keep him here. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Scarlet widened her legs, balled her fists. An attack position. And this time, her warrior-stance was directed at him.</p><p>What the hell? \u201cScar, this isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d he began, but before he could utter another word, Scarlet had launched herself at him, her intent to kill more than obvious as she slashed at his throat.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>BETRAYED AGAIN, Scarlet thought darkly. By the same man. And she couldn\u2019t fully blame him. She kept letting it happen because she was attracted to him. Well, no more. She wouldn\u2019t kill him, she decided just before contact, though part of her knew that was the only way to truly end the madness inside her. But she would beat him senseless and hold him here until her beloved aunt returned.</p><p>Whatever happened to him after that, she wouldn\u2019t care.She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>As they hit the ground, Gideon arched back to avoid her nails in his jugular. He also took the brunt of the fall. The back of his skull slammed into the floor, and he winced. Must have cracked him good, because blood splattered. To her surprise, he didn\u2019t try to fight her off as she straddled his chest and glared down at him.</p><p>\u201cI should never have trusted you,\u201d she snarled. \u201cTrusting you always destroys another piece of my life.\u201d</p><p>His hands\u2014hot and hard and callused\u2014flattened on her thighs, as though he was holding her to him rather than pushing her away. \u201cThat woman was telling the truth. I did this to you. She didn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t lying. She wasn\u2019t manipulating your memories and weaving fake stories inside your head.\u201d The words escaped him in a rush.</p><p>Mnemosyne lie to her? Ha! \u201cYou\u2019re the only liar here.\u201d She drove her fist into his nose, and more of his blood spurted. \u201cThat\u2019s for forgetting me,\u201d she spat. She\u2019d wanted to do this for a long time. Nothing would stop her now. She punched his face again. More blood. \u201cThat\u2019s for abandoning your son.\u201d</p><p>Stop, Nightmares cried inside her head. Don\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>Decided to wake up, did you? Well, you can just shut the hell up!</p><p>Don\u2019t hurt him. Please. He\u2019s telling you the truth.</p><p>Defending the bastard? You\u2019re my demon. Not his. Now do what you were created to do and frighten him. Cover him with spiders. No.</p><p>Fine. She would destroy him on her own. Except, when she raised her fist for a third punch, Gideon didn\u2019t turn away. He waited, his expression resigned, even expectant, and she paused. He was letting her hurt him, damn him. Scarlet tried to catch her breath. There was no satisfaction in his acceptance. Only shame.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about this, devil.\u201d</p><p>Devil. His version of angel or sweetheart. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d used the endearment, and just as before, her heart squeezed in her chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to call me that. You don\u2019t have the right.\u201d Not anymore. \u201cBesides that, there\u2019s nothing to think about. You were using me to punish my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGodsdamn it, you aren\u2019t the most exasperating creature I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Scarlet popped to a stand and kicked him in the stomach. No mercy. She couldn\u2019t show him any mercy. \u201cThat\u2019s for sleeping with her. Actually, that\u2019s for sleeping with all your bimbos while you were married to me.\u201d</p><p>Stop. Nightmares again. Despondent. You must stop.</p><p>No mercy. Not until he\u2019s dead. But her own mind rebelled at that. I thought you\u2019d decided not to kill him.</p> <p>Demon red flickered in the depths of Gideon\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare listen to me, to what I\u2019m really saying. I slept with her. I did. Okay? All right?\u201d</p><p>There was something about his claim, something she should be considering, but at the moment, she couldn\u2019t make rational thought matter. All she could see was Gideon\u2019s naked body wrapped around her aunt\u2019s, the two lost to their passion. All she could hear were Gideon\u2019s moans of pleasure.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted Mnemosyne all along.</p><p>Scarlet\u2019s hands balled, her nails cutting skin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret ever meeting me. That\u2019s a truth you can take to the bank. Or better yet, the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so not stubborn,\u201d he gritted out, remaining exactly as he was. Splayed, hers to abuse. \u201cI will always betray you. Don\u2019t you understand? Always. Betray. You.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know!\u201d Another kick.</p><p>Breath exploded from his mouth. He closed his eyes for a moment, lines of frustration branching in every direction. \u201cDon\u2019t think about this,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019d met your aunt a thousand times before. There are many reasons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! There\u2019s nothing for me to think about.\u201d Scowling, she paced around his prone body. Another kick. But again, satisfaction proved elusive.</p><p>Growls suddenly filled her head. Nightmares had stopped pleading and was now worked into writhing fury. Stop, or I\u2019ll make you relive Steel\u2019s death. Over and over again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me better than anyone,\u201d Gideon burst out on a wheeze. \u201cWhy would I need you to win her back, when I\u2019d met her so many times? How could I touch her if I wanted you?\u201d</p><p>Those questions made absolutely no sense. Why was he\u2014 Wait. He was Lies, she reminded herself. He couldn\u2019t speak truth. Translation: why had he needed Scarlet to win a woman he\u2019d never met, and how could he have touched Scarlet if he\u2019d wanted Mnemosyne? That\u2019s what he was really asking.</p> <p>She raised her fist.</p><p>Last warning.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2014\u201d She stopped, frowned. Good questions. She considered her options, her demon panting, waiting for her to strike, to finally unleash a tidal wave of grief over her. A tidal wave that would not stop her. \u201cBecause you...needed me to make her jealous.\u201d Yes, that was it. The knowledge solidified as she pulled the memories of her recent time with Gideon to the forefront of her mind.</p><p>Every time he\u2019d kissed and touched her, he\u2019d been distanced. He hadn\u2019t made love to her, hadn\u2019t tried to penetrate her. Because that would have been taking things too far when he loved another. Yes, yes. The more she considered this, the more everything made sense. The more right her aunt seemed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s totally my style,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Style or not, it just made sense. \u201cYou...bastard! I wasn\u2019t good enough to fuck, is that it? You were saving your precious cock for her.\u201d Scarlet swung her fist down, intending to knock him in one ear and cause his brain to fly out the other.</p><p>An image of Steel, cut and bleeding, dying, took residence inside her head, and she whimpered.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Gideon was sitting up and gripping her wrist. His eyes narrowed, his lips pulled tight. \u201cYou don\u2019t want penetration? I won\u2019t give you penetration.\u201d With a sharp tug, he had her on the ground. Before she could protest, he rolled on top of her, pinning her down with his muscled weight.</p> <p>Nightmares removed the gory, hated image and moaned. Yes!</p><p>No way Gideon would\u2014oh, yes. He would. He worked at the waist of her pants, trying to jerk them open and down.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said on a trembling breath. What was happening? \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>More, her demon demanded.</p><p>The warrior stilled, but he was panting as he glared down at her, reminding her of herself a few moments ago. When she\u2019d been furious and jealous and...irrational? Surely not. She was thinking clearly for the first time in centuries. Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t accuse me of being a lot of things, Scar, and wanting you more than air to breathe isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Another translation was needed: she could accuse him of a lot of things, and wanting her more than air was one of them. So...he did want her. Proof: he wasn\u2019t writhing in pain.</p><p>Scarlet gulped back the sudden lump in her throat. He. Wanted. Her. So why had her aunt\u2014 Wait. That was the something she\u2019d been trying to remember a short while ago. He had to speak in lies or he would hurt. Savagely. And he\u2019d said, I slept with her. I did. Her, meaning Mnemosyne. Yet he hadn\u2019t screamed, passed out or grown weak. So he had been lying. He hadn\u2019t ever slept with her aunt.</p><p>This was...this made no sense.</p><p>\u201cI need to think,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Gideon eased off her, but didn\u2019t move away. She lay there, struggling to put the rest of the pieces together.</p><p>First, Mnemosyne had accused him of trying to make her jealous. But what had he done to make her aunt jealous? Nothing, that\u2019s what. He\u2019d come up here to find Zeus and avenge Steel. Scarlet had followed him, and he\u2019d been genuinely surprised to see her. Which meant he hadn\u2019t planned for her to follow him.</p><p>She\u2019d told him about her aunt, and he hadn\u2019t acted as if he knew the woman. Granted, that could have been a lie. But then, why would he have arranged for Scarlet to see her if he\u2019d wanted to keep their association secret? The jealous thing, sure, but he hadn\u2019t put his arm around Scarlet while Mnemosyne watched. He hadn\u2019t tried to kiss Scarlet or seduce her in front of her aunt, either. He\u2019d just yelled at her, commanding her to find out if her aunt had messed with his memory.</p><p>That\u2019s when Mnemosyne had placed a warm hand on Scarlet\u2019s shoulder and told her about Gideon\u2019s plan. Told her. Yes. The moment Mnemosyne had spoken, the first image of Gideon and her aunt rolling around in bed, naked, had appeared in Scarlet\u2019s mind. That image had been fuzzy at first, but the more Scarlet had believed it possible, the clearer the image had become.</p><p>\u201cT-tell me you desire my aunt,\u201d Scarlet said, focusing on the man above her.</p><p>There was a hard glint in his eyes. \u201cI desire your aunt.\u201d</p><p>Not a flicker of pain.</p><p>Not daring to hope, she said, \u201cTell me you used me to win her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used you to win her.\u201d</p><p>Again, no pain.</p><p>Her aunt had lied to her.</p><p>Scarlet closed her eyes. Anything to hide the burning relief most likely banked there. Gideon hadn\u2019t betrayed her. Gideon hadn\u2019t betrayed her! The knowledge was part soothing balm for her battered heart and part kindling for her sudden, raging guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for kicking you,\u201d she said on a groan. \u201cAnd punching you. And screaming at you.\u201d</p><p>At last, Nightmares calmed.</p><p>Slowly Gideon eased the rest of the way off her. \u201cYou\u2019re not forgiven.\u201d The words offered absolution, but there was no emotion in his tone.</p><p>Scarlet cracked open her eyelids, only to see that Gideon had already turned, presenting her his back. Still angry? Hiding his expression? \u201cShe\u2019s powerful. To have made me believe in your cruelty, and so strongly, so quickly...\u201d Scarlet shuddered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the sweet woman I remember did that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s a real sweetheart.\u201d Gideon flicked her a glance over his shoulder as he stood. Nope, he hadn\u2019t been hiding his expression; it was as empty as his tone. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure all of your memories of her are correct.\u201d</p><p>Correct equaled wrong. Every muscle in Scarlet\u2019s body tensed. He was right. The image she had of her aunt didn\u2019t fit with the woman she\u2019d just encountered. Of course Mnemosyne had manipulated her perception at some point.</p><p>Mnemosyne had certainly had plenty of opportunities. For centuries, they had shared a cell. A simple touch, a spoken word, and boom. Scarlet\u2019s life was completely altered.</p><p>Dear gods. How many times had Mnemosyne screwed with her head? How many of her memories were fake?</p><p>Which memories were fake?</p><p>Air burned her nose, her lungs. Suddenly Scarlet didn\u2019t trust anything she believed. Even...her wild gaze landed on Gideon.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to get out of here,\u201d he said, extending a hand.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about this now. You can\u2019t afford the panic. Gulping, she twined their fingers and allowed him to tug her upright. As before, when he\u2019d gripped her thigh, his skin was hot, hard and callused. Shiver-inducing. \u201cEnough time has passed that I doubt Mnemosyne went for help. She ran. Is probably hiding. Otherwise, guards would be in here, weapons pointed at us.\u201d</p><p>Strong shoulders lifted in a shrug. \u201cBetter sorry than safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave, though. We have to find her. I need to...talk with her, find out what other lies she\u2019s convinced me of.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shook his head, resolute. \u201cWhat Zeus did is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lie, maybe.\u201d The realization hit her and she gasped, her free hand flying to cover her mouth. Maybe Zeus hadn\u2019t truly murdered Steel. Maybe someone else had. Or maybe Steel had never been killed. Maybe Steel was alive. Maybe he was out there, waiting for her to find him.</p><p>Hope bloomed inside her chest, filling her with a joy she hadn\u2019t known since the last time she\u2019d held Steel in her arms. \u201cWe have to summon Cronus.\u201d She fisted Gideon\u2019s shirt. \u201cWe have to find out if he knows anything about Steel.\u201d</p><p>His expression gentled, and he cupped her cheeks. \u201cScar, devil...\u201d</p><p>Devil. There was that endearment again. She rose on her tiptoes and pressed a quick kiss to his lips. Lips still swollen from meeting her fist. Lips that were bleeding and missing a ring. Had she tugged it loose? \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, Gideon. I think...I hope... What if he\u2019s still alive? What if our baby is out there?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth. To protest? Then he shook his head violently, scales flashing underneath his skin. \u201cOh, sweet sunshine and roses, I can absolutely believe I\u2019m doing this,\u201d he muttered, releasing her to jerk his necklace from around his neck and stuff the chain into his pocket.</p><p>Wow. That was the vilest curse she\u2019d ever heard him utter.</p> <p>\u201cCron!\u201d he shouted, fist raised and pumping in the air. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence. Scarlet could barely contain herself; she felt ready to jump out of her skin. Knew she wouldn\u2019t last much longer. Soon she would start shouting threats. Dismemberment, the removal of the king\u2019s cock. \u201cCron!\u201d</p><p>\u201cManners, Lies. Manners. You\u2019re in my home. You do not bellow for me. You ask nicely.\u201d</p><p>The voice came from behind them, and they swung around in unison. Cronus was perched at the edge of the bed, his lips pinched in displeasure.</p><p>Who cared about his displeasure? He was here! Scarlet\u2019s shoulders sagged with relief. Answers were within her grasp, hope a living entity inside her.</p> <p>\u201cNo thanks for coming,\u201d Gideon said, bowing his head in deference. He\u2019d never done such a thing before, and she knew he did so now for her benefit. Because she was desperate, and he was taking no chances.</p><p>Ice...melting. Again.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Cronus said, gaze roving over her warrior. \u201cWe\u2019ve regained our strength, I see. I didn\u2019t expect you to recover so quickly. But what are you doing in Leto\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Pleasantries? Now? \u201cI\u2019ll do the talking,\u201d Scarlet told Gideon before facing off with the king. Knowing him as she did, she knew she couldn\u2019t just jump into her demands. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned something disturbing about Mnemosyne. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy. Are you. In Leto\u2019s. Bedroom?\u201d Cronus asked again. His attention never veered from Gideon.</p><p>Argh. \u201cYour mistress was here. We wanted to talk with her.\u201d</p> <p>One dark brow arched, but that was it. His only reaction to her words. Damn him! After the aging curse was cast, after failing to kill her over and over again, he\u2019d decided to ignore her, to pretend she didn\u2019t exist. She was an embarrassment to him, after all. Proof his wife had cheated on him.</p><p>Like he could cast stones, though. His mistress was his wife\u2019s sister.</p><p>Gideon sighed, and there was an angry twinge to it. On her behalf? Her guilt returned. She never should have punched him. So many times. \u201cYour mistress wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d the king asked smoothly.</p><p>Just how many did he have?</p><p>\u201cNot Mnemosyne,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>A curtain fell over Cronus\u2019s features, obscuring his emotions. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she didn\u2019t try to fuck with Scarlet\u2019s memory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d the king asked again.</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to talk to her,\u201d Gideon snapped.</p><p>Cronus\u2019s head tilted to the side as he studied the warrior. \u201cShe came to me. Told me you were in here. Tried to convince me you were here to kill me, but what she hasn\u2019t yet realized is that her tricks do not work on me. She\u2019s currently locked in my chambers while I figure out her game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you with that,\u201d Scarlet said, determined. She had a few ideas about how to extract information from her aunt. Needles were involved. So were hammers.</p><p>Again, Cronus ignored her. \u201cI want Secrets to interrogate her, but he\u2019s otherwise occupied at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t expect me to fetch him for you?\u201d Gideon asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI expect you to return to your fortress and summon me the moment he returns. That is the boon I require of you as payment for the time you\u2019ve spent in my palace.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in Gideon\u2019s jaw. Hers, too. Rhea\u2019s \u201crequirement\u201d for Scarlet was to stop Gideon from summoning Cronus when Amun returned, and she nearly roared in frustration. If finding Amun was the only way to gain information about Steel, she wouldn\u2019t stop Gideon. No matter what she\u2019d promised her mother.</p><p>No matter what that might cost her.</p><p>She\u2019d heard stories about what happened to those who broke their promises to the gods, and those stories had never ended favorably. The liar was always weakened, curses were always heaped and death was always the end result.</p><p>Dying before holding her son again...hell, no!</p><p>Perhaps she could summon Cronus, she thought next, and grinned. Hello, loophole. Her grin quickly faded, however. What if the king ignored her? And what if her promise to her mother was still considered broken?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unwell?\u201d Gideon whispered in her ear, drawing her attention.</p><p>You\u2019re good, he meant. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied. Her inattention must have worried him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Mnemosyne is aiding Rhea,\u201d Cronus continued, \u201cshe must be destroyed. If not...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet grown tired of her and the way she vexes my wife. So either way, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll allow you to speak with her.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet had to fight the urge to launch forward and slam her fists into Cronus\u2019s face. To break his nose, his teeth, and introduce his penis to her knee. Multiple times.</p><p>Gideon must have sensed the direction of her thoughts because he twined their fingers and squeezed. To comfort her?</p><p>\u201cDoubt me not,\u201d she said harshly. \u201cI will confront my aunt. And if she lied to me about my son\u2019s death, I\u2019ll kill her whether she betrayed you or not. Whether you want her alive or not.\u201d</p><p>Cronus blinked at her, looking at her for the first time since entering the room. \u201cYour son?\u201d His astonished gaze returned to Gideon. \u201cWhat\u2019s she talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteel, damn you,\u201d Scarlet shouted. \u201cThe child I gave birth to when we were still in captivity. Is there a chance he\u2019s still alive?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Thick, unwanted silence that slithered through her like a snake, ready to bite, to poison.</p><p>Then, \u201cScarlet,\u201d the king said, and his tone was suddenly, shockingly gentle. \u201cWe were locked in the same cell from the time of your birth until we managed to escape. You never gave birth. You were never pregnant.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>THIS WAS THE FIRST time Gideon had ever seen Cronus exhibit any type of compassion. And that he did so toward a female he hated...well, Gideon could now forgive him for his earlier treatment of Scarlet, ignoring her as he had. And yet, Gideon wished there was no need for such compassion.</p><p>You were never pregnant. The words, though meant for Scarlet, hit Gideon, and he knew. Knew. Truth. Cronus spoke only truth. That meant only one thing. It hadn\u2019t been Gideon\u2019s memory that had been tampered with; it had been Scarlet\u2019s.No wonder Lies liked her so much, yet hadn\u2019t been able to tell if she spoke true. She was a living falsehood, but didn\u2019t know it. They\u2019d never had a son. They\u2019d probably never been married.</p><p>Which sucked. He\u2019d grown used to thinking of Scarlet as his wife. Perhaps they had married, though. In secret, as she\u2019d said. After all, the first time he\u2019d seen her, when she\u2019d told him they had once wed, he\u2019d had flashes of her in his mind, flashes of the two of them, naked and straining toward release. He\u2019d thought those flashes were memories. And yeah, they could have been.</p><p>Because the fact was, he\u2019d seen her in his dreams, too. Before he\u2019d ever met her. That had to mean something. Right?</p><p>Steel, though...he\u2019d had no flashes of his son. Not a single one. That, too, had to mean something. And yet, he didn\u2019t have to wonder about his feelings for the boy. Now that the fury over Steel\u2019s supposed treatment was gone, he realized he possessed a spark of love for what might have been. He truly mourned his child\u2019s loss.</p><p>And if he mourned, when he\u2019d had only that one glimpse of Steel, the glimpse Scarlet had given him, how much worse must she feel?</p><p>Scarlet\u2019s gaze darted between the king and Gideon, Gideon and the king. She was shaking her head continuously, trembling, gasping for breath. His heart actually wrenched inside his chest, scraping against his ribs. He hated to see her like this. So torn up and vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You have to be wrong. I held my little boy. I loved him.\u201d The last was said angrily, as if daring the king to contradict her.</p><p>Frowning, Cronus rose from the bed. \u201cThere are too many eyes and ears here.\u201d He waved his hand and their surroundings simply disappeared, leaving only a wide expanse of thick, white mist. The air was cool, fragrant with the sweet scent of ambrosia.</p><p>Gideon breathed deeply, savoring this moment of calm before the coming storm. The mist thinned, cleared, and he saw that they were in the heart of an ambrosia field, the tall flowering vines rising from the ground, pink flowers reaching toward the glowing sun.</p><p>Sun. Shining. His attention whipped to Scarlet. He expected her knees to collapse and her eyes to close as sleep claimed her, but she remained standing. Awake. Not even yawning. How?</p><p>\u201cThis is a realm where night and day are one,\u201d Cronus explained, as if reading Gideon\u2019s mind. Hell, he probably was. Some immortals could do so. Gideon knew that Amun could. \u201cBesides that, Scarlet\u2019s demon operates on a time scale, not the rise and fall of the sun.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t bother him when Amun read his mind. Cronus, though, bothered him greatly. What he was feeling for Scarlet and Steel was private. His. He didn\u2019t want to share. Not because he was embarrassed about the softer emotions running rampant through him, but because he wanted every part of them all for himself. Real or not.</p><p>Not important right now. Your woman is all that matters. He wrapped his arm around Scarlet\u2019s waist, intent on soothing her the only way he could, but she jerked away from him, still shaking her head, her trembling becoming violent.</p><p>\u201cMy son was real. My son is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your mind, no doubt he is.\u201d Cronus pivoted on his heel and eased forward, forcing Gideon and Scarlet to follow. His fingers brushed the tips of the vines as he said, \u201cHere\u2019s how Mnemosyne works. She places her hand on you, for contact increases the power of her suggestions. She then tells you something. If it\u2019s something you want to hear, your mind accepts it more readily. If not, she\u2019ll tell you something else, then something else, until she\u2019s woven a tapestry inside your mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scarlet tripped over a vine, and Gideon grabbed her by the T-shirt, hefting her up and keeping her on her feet. She didn\u2019t seem to notice, kept striding forward, remaining close to Cronus and glued to his every word.</p><p>Gods, she was lovely in the sunlight. Even lost to sorrow and confusion, she seemed to soak up the rays and glow from within.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d Cronus asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Her methods don\u2019t explain anything,\u201d Scarlet lashed out. \u201cI know every detail of Steel\u2019s life. Every detail. My aunt could not have created so complex a tapestry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can and obviously did. Once Mnemosyne makes a suggestion, the seed of a memory is planted. The more you consider that seed, the more it\u2019s watered, and the more it will grow. As it grows, your mind begins to fill in the blanks, so to speak, making the memory plausible. Making it as real to you as if it truly happened.\u201d</p><p>Gideon kept his gaze glued on the endless sea of green and pink in front of him. He didn\u2019t dare glance over at Scarlet again. She was the strongest female\u2014or rather, person\u2014he\u2019d ever met, but he doubted even she could withstand this type of devastating news without breaking down. A breakdown she wouldn\u2019t want anyone to witness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Her voice quivered. Was drenched with an agony so overwhelming he had never encountered its like. To her, this must be like watching Steel die, helpless to save him, all over again.</p><p>Just then, Gideon would have willingly died to give the boy life.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about Steel right now,\u201d she said in a tragic tone that rivaled that of Cameo, keeper of the demon of Misery. \u201cJust tell me if Gideon and I were...were...\u201d</p><p>Slowly, so slowly, Cronus shook his head. \u201cYou were not.\u201d</p><p>Truth.</p><p>Lies roared, furious, disbelieving. And Gideon wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because the demon hated truth, or because the demon wanted those words to be a lie.</p><p>Gideon hissed in disappointment. He desired Scarlet more than he\u2019d ever desired another, and he liked having her with him. Most of all, he loved knowing she belonged to him and no other man.</p><p>Perhaps...perhaps he\u2019d wed her now. For real this time. It was worth considering, at the very least. Because damn, he hated the thought of being without her.</p> <p>No, Lies said. No. Yes, yes.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Mnemosyne not do something like that?\u201d Gideon asked. He was surprised by how rough his voice was, as if his throat had been scrubbed raw with sandpaper.</p><p>Cronus sighed. \u201cI can guess. Scarlet\u2019s mother. Shortly after Rhea and I were cursed with an aging spell, Scarlet grew unexpectedly happy. Not because we were aging, she hardly seemed to notice that, but because she clearly had a secret. Looking back, I realize Mnemosyne must have begun weaving those memories of you at Rhea\u2019s behest, to punish her daughter for the spell. You see, any time Rhea tried to kill her, the queen aged a bit more.\u201d</p><p>And if the queen had looked anything like Cronus when they\u2019d come out of Tartarus, she had tried many, many times to off his sweet Scarlet. Again, Gideon wasn\u2019t opposed to killing females, and he added Rhea\u2019s name to his Must Die Painfully list.</p><p>\u201cThe sisters had noticed how Scarlet watched you,\u201d the king continued. \u201cEveryone had. There was absolute longing in her gaze. That\u2019s why, I\u2019m sure, it was so easy for Mnemosyne to plant the suggestion of a marriage when in fact, the two of you had never even spoken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gods,\u201d Scarlet gasped, tenting her hands over her mouth. Her horrified gaze landed on Gideon. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She had desired him, even then, and the knowledge filled him with pride. But she didn\u2019t like that he knew, that much was clear, and he found that he wanted to ease her, even in this.</p><p>Gideon stopped, grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her. \u201cDon\u2019t recall that even before I met you, I didn\u2019t see you in my mind. Don\u2019t recall that I didn\u2019t even tattoo myself with your eyes, with the same tattoo you bear. We may have married, and we may have met, but I did not notice you, too.\u201d Understand me, sweet. I craved you, even then.</p> <p>As he spoke, however, several questions claimed his attention. How had he known about the tattoo? How had he seen it before he\u2019d actually met the woman? Had they been connected somehow?</p><p>She\u2019d begun to relax, to nod, but then she stiffened and jerked from his hold. Cold infused her eyes. \u201cAfter our...fake marriage, after my possession, after I gained control, I entered your dreams until your doorway disappeared. Another reason I thought you were dead. I never used my demon against you, I simply watched over you. That must be how you saw me.\u201d</p><p>Well, another question answered. And once again, he was filled with pride. So much desire... But not her. There was no pride, no joy. Her horror had only grown.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me in prison,\u201d she said, tears forming, spilling over. \u201cYou didn\u2019t notice me then.\u201d</p><p>Those tears nearly dropped him to his knees. \u201cDevil.\u201d He reached out, meaning to force her to accept his embrace. He would comfort her, damn it. He may not have noticed her back then, but he noticed her now.</p><p>She darted out of reach, and several tears splashed onto his hand. \u201cI hated you,\u201d she spat. \u201cFor so long, I hated you for abandoning me. I even blamed you for Steel\u2019s death, and I wanted to punish you. I dreamed of punishing you. Then I entered your life, and I did hurt you. In your dreams, I presented you with your greatest fear. And I was glad. I liked doing it. Liked hurting you. Then, today, I punished you again. Yet you had done nothing wrong. You had never done anything wrong.\u201d She choked on the last word, a sob bubbling from her parted, trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cDevil, you did everything wrong. Blame yourself. I wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing.\u201d Please understand. It had never been more important for a person to understand what he was truly saying.</p><p>Shaking her head, she swiped at the still-falling tears with the back of her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ll never know how sorry I am for everything I did to you. I\u2014I\u2014I have to go. Send me home. Please.\u201d Her gaze swung to Cronus. Or rather, to where Cronus had once stood.</p><p>The god king was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cCronus. Cronus!\u201d Scarlet shouted.</p><p>In the next instant, the fields disappeared and walls of gray stone rose at Gideon\u2019s sides. Gideon whipped around, taking in his new surroundings. His bedroom, he realized. His bedroom in Buda.</p><p>Moonlight seeped from the window, illuminating his furnishings. A platform bed with a brown-and-white comforter. Two nightstands, both marred by the knives he constantly tossed at them. One balanced a red lamp that had a chink on its left side. One held a bowl of candy bars.</p><p>There was his dresser, his scuffed leather chair. His closet stuffed with more weapons than clothing. The doorway to his bathroom.</p><p>Home. He was home. But it didn\u2019t feel like home without Scarlet. Where was she? Had Cronus left her there, in that field? Alone with her grief? He roared as Lies had done earlier, enraged, helpless, desperate. He would\u2014</p><p>Calm.</p><p>Scarlet appeared in the center of his room, and Gideon breathed a sigh of relief. Except...</p><p>Her tears were gone. Her horror and hurt, vanished. Her face was a blank canvas, completely devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cScar,\u201d he began, rushing toward her.</p><p>Her gaze met his, and she held up one hand to ward him off. \u201cI wish you a safe and happy life, Gideon. Nothing more needs to be said.\u201d She tried to pass him, but he latched onto her arm, stopping her.</p><p>\u201cWhere aren\u2019t you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway.\u201d</p><p>No way in hell. He knew her, knew she planned to hunt and torture her mother and aunt for what they\u2019d done to her. \u201cWe\u2019ll kiss them together.\u201d Kill them together. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Something in her eyes hardened. Like liquid cooling and solidifying into steel. Steel was the perfect name for any child of hers. She was stubborn to her very core. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of my mother and aunt.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened, and he jerked her into the inflexible line of his body. She slammed into him with a huff, but refused to look up at him. Her gaze remained on the wild pulse at the base of his neck.</p><p>He was panting, he realized. In fear that he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach her. In arousal. She smelled of the ambrosia fields and radiated warmth. \u201cYou must have heard me correctly. We\u2019ll kiss them together.\u201d</p><p>Finally, her gaze lifted. Pinpricks of red flashed every few seconds, as if her demon was ready to break free. \u201cAfter I kill my aunt, I\u2019m going to find a way to remove my memories. All of them. I want a fresh start, a clean slate. Because right now I have no idea what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake. I don\u2019t know, and it\u2019s killing me. Do you understand? It\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>His own anger draining, he kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. So not sorry, devil. You can\u2019t let me help you kiss her, okay?\u201d The other thing, well, he\u2019d die before he allowed Scarlet\u2019s memories of him to be taken.</p><p>A tremor rocked her; she gulped. \u201cHow can you want to help me after everything I\u2019ve done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...like you. I don\u2019t miss him, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to elaborate. She knew who \u201chim\u201d was. Once again, tears pooled in her eyes. He\u2019d never thought to be glad to see a woman cry, but her sadness was much easier to take than her emotional barrenness.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t real,\u201d she whispered, hands clutching Gideon\u2019s shirt and twisting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. He wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014 Wait. What?\u201d She blinked in surprise. He could only speak in lies, so what he\u2019d said should have felled him. But he was still standing, still strong.</p><p>\u201cSteel wasn\u2019t real. To the two of us, in our hearts, he wasn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>The tears spilled down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t make them pay for this, devil. I just need you to...not trust me.\u201d Trust me, please.</p><p>\u201cThey manipulated me,\u201d she said, the melted metal he\u2019d seen in her face bleeding into her voice. \u201cLaughed at me all these years. Why? What did I ever do to them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t monsters.\u201d They were. Far greater than any demon he had encountered. \u201cIt had everything to do with you.\u201d Nothing to do with his darling Scarlet. With his free hand, he threaded his fingers through her hair, once again offering what comfort he could. He didn\u2019t dare release her at any point or she\u2019d bolt. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get one thing right, though. As far as I\u2019m concerned, we aren\u2019t really married.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed, but the rest of her sagged. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you consider us married?\u201d</p><p>Rather than try and explain in Gideon Speak, he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d she said vehemently. She pounded a fist into his chest. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Not the reaction he\u2019d expected. Or wanted. The words had flowed of their own accord. Natural, meant to be. He\u2019d considered it before, but now he knew. He would have her, in every way. Whatever it took.</p><p>\u201cThe two of us?\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019re done. We\u2019re over. Not that we ever got started.\u201d</p><p>Hardly. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, wet lashes nearly fusing together. \u201cNow you listen to me. We\u2019re lucky we escaped an eternal pairing. We\u2019re terrible for each other. All wrong.\u201d She laughed and the sound reminded him of a harbinger\u2019s bell. A sound some immortals heard just before they died. \u201cNo wonder you didn\u2019t notice me the night I first sought you out.\u201d</p> <p>He arched a brow. What night?</p><p>\u201cYou were at a club,\u201d she answered, though he hadn\u2019t spoken the question aloud. \u201cAnd you nailed a human female in a shadowed corner, where anyone could have seen you. Where I saw you.\u201d</p><p>Once, public sex had been a usual occurrence in his life. So, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to isolate a single night in his memory and know, know Scarlet had been there. But suddenly he could.</p><p>An evening like any other, ambrosia-laced alcohol and sex his focus. Yet there\u2019d been a thick cloud of darkness next to his table, one his eyes hadn\u2019t been able to pierce. He\u2019d thought his excess had addled his mind. Especially when the scent of orchids had wafted to his nose. When Lies had tried to jump out of his skull. When his cock had throbbed unbearably.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sense you,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t take someone else, thinking she was responsible for the lust I was feeling when in truth, she was\u2014\u201d not \u201c\u2014and you weren\u2019t.\u201d Were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014 Still.\u201d Color bloomed in her cheeks, twin pink circles of embarrassment. \u201cWe\u2019re still wrong for each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight again.\u201d And suddenly, all he could think about was her earlier words about how he couldn\u2019t possibly want her because he\u2019d never tried to penetrate her.</p><p>That\u2019s what he got for being considerate. For giving her time.</p><p>Well, bye-bye consideration. He was taking what he wanted. All of what he wanted. He was going to have this woman, and she was going to accept him. She was going to admit that they belonged together. That they were perfect for each other. Everything else could be figured out later.</p><p>Was there anything to figure out, though? She amused him, delighted him, set his blood on fire. She never backed down, didn\u2019t fear any part of him. Even his demon. She met him challenge for challenge. Was probably stronger than he was.</p><p>More than that, they both needed comforting right now, and there was only one way to achieve it. In bed.</p><p>Without a word, Gideon anchored both of his hands on Scarlet\u2019s waist and tossed her atop the bed in question. She bounced on the mattress, but when she finally stilled, she didn\u2019t scramble off; she just peered over at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked in a husky voice.</p><p>\u201cFinishing this,\u201d he said, advancing on her. Finally, he was beginning it.</p> <p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>WIN, WIN, WIN. Have to win.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sweat poured down Strider\u2019s face and chest as he rounded a corner, slowed his sprint to a frantic walk and pressed into the shadows cast by a looming column. Thankfully, he\u2019d realized he had tails\u2014four of them, to be exact\u2014before reaching the Temple of the Unspoken Ones. So he\u2019d changed directions and now found himself in the historic district of Rome, miles from the island, a gawking crowd around him, eyeing the towering white remains of the Temple of Vesta and taking pictures so they\u2019d always remember the moment. Blending in was kind of a problem. He was taller than everyone around him and thicker with muscle.But he would have liked to gawk, as well. He had helped build that temple, after all. After he\u2019d helped destroy the one that had been erected before it. Not that he\u2019d ever be given credit. Not that he wanted credit.</p><p>Good deeds could ruin a man\u2019s rep. \u2019Cause really, a sensitive warrior would not elicit fear inside the hearts of Hunters.</p><p>Fear was sometimes the only thing that kept those Hunters at bay.</p><p>Strider had been warring with them for thousands of years. In the old days, they\u2019d followed him from one city to another, blood and screams and death in their wake. Buildings had been razed, history tainted. He and his friends had retaliated so savagely, so brutally, he\u2019d thought his enemy exterminated.</p><p>Several years of peace had followed. Years his demon had basked in, high from victory. But of course, the hiding survivors one day forgot their fear and rose again. Attacked again. The war resumed as if it had never ceased.</p><p>Win, win, win, the demon of Defeat chanted inside his head. Must win. \u201cI fucking know.\u201d But the Cloak of Invisibility was currently in his possession. He couldn\u2019t chance being injured and immobilized in a fight. Which meant he had to run.</p><p>Gods, he hated running.</p><p>If he could just find a moment alone, he could drape himself with the stupid Cloak and disappear, then forget this had ever happened. That he\u2019d ever been spotted, shot at, and now, cornered.</p><p>Only thing that stopped him from withdrawing the thing that very second was the possibility that the Hunters following him didn\u2019t know he had it. No reason to show it to them and add fuel to their determination.</p><p>He tried to be gentle with humans as he pushed his way through them. Some muttered about his rudeness, others turned to yell at him only to zip their mouths when they got a glimpse of him. Dark as his expression was, he probably looked capable of murder.</p><p>Fitting. He was.</p><p>Had the Hunters found Lucien and Anya, wherever the couple had gone? Had they found Reyes and Danika? Soon as he was safe, he was going to call them, warn them that the enemy could be near.</p><p>The soles of his boots thumped against the paved streets of the Forum. Birds squawked and flew away. Sunlight speared the ground and bounced up, and he had to blink rapidly to wet his stinging corneas. If he could make it another few blocks, he would reach the Aedes Divi Iuli. He could lose himself in the ruins, something the Hunters chasing him couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>At least, he didn\u2019t think so. He knew this land because he had once lived on it. They hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Pop. Whiz.</p><p>Silencers. \u201cShit!\u201d The curse flew from his mouth as a sharp sting lanced the back of his shoulder. Accompanying the sting was a warm rush of liquid. Finally, they\u2019d nailed him. As many times as he\u2019d been peppered with bullets in the past, he knew the feeling. Shit. Shit!</p><p>Win. Win!</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Perhaps he should have gone to the States. Bigger crowds, larger land mass. Easier to lose oneself. But he\u2019d wanted to chat with the Unspoken Ones. See if he could convince them to change the terms of their bargain. Like, rather than bring them Cronus\u2019s head, freeing them and most likely endangering the entire world, maybe they would be happy ruling over their own realm or something. If he could get them to agree, he could go to Cronus and present the option.</p><p>Thankfully, he\u2019d noticed his tail before he\u2019d reached the temple and headed for the Roman Forum. The damage he could have caused had he unintentionally allowed his enemy to hear his plan was too vast to consider just then.</p><p>WIN!</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d What to do, what to do. He was wearing that fucking butterfly necklace, so Cronus wouldn\u2019t know where he was or what was going down. Which meant Cronus wouldn\u2019t be popping in and saving the day. And Strider couldn\u2019t take the necklace off because Rhea could then pop in and ruin the day.</p><p>Pop. Whiz.</p><p>Another sharp sting, this one in his calf. He stumbled, but kept moving.</p><p>Win.</p><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m on it.\u201d Looked like he\u2019d have to use the Cloak of Invisibility, moment alone or not.</p><p>Strider reached into his pants pocket\u2014damn it, his hand was shaking\u2014and withdrew the small square of gray cloth. Surprised him every time he saw the thing. How could so powerful an artifact come in so small a package?</p><p>Someone stepped into his path, and Strider simply barreled through him. Another pop and whiz rang out. Humans might not recognize the muffled sounds, but they recognized danger and raced for cover.</p><p>Strider spun to the right just as a bullet soared past him. Plumes of dust and debris rained around him as the bullet lodged in rock.</p><p>Defeat laughed like a kid who\u2019d just opened his Christmas present early and found out he\u2019d gotten exactly what he\u2019d asked Santa for. Winning!</p><p>Quickening his steps, he tossed a glance over his shoulder. There were four Hunters, three males and one female, racing after him, spreading out to engulf him from all sides, darting through the crowd as if they had done so a million times before.</p><p>A plan began to form in Strider\u2019s mind, and he grinned. He wouldn\u2019t need the Aedes Divi Iuli, after all. He took the next corner as if his feet were on rails and shook open the Cloak. The more he shook, the more the Cloak unraveled. The more it unraveled, the bigger it got. Soon, it was large enough to cover his entire body.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that? He\u2019s got the Cloak!\u201d one of the males shouted. \u201cKill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo mercy!\u201d</p><p>Win, win, win.</p><p>More pops. More whizzes. So many he couldn\u2019t keep track. A few weeks ago, Hunters would\u2019ve done everything in their power to keep him alive. Capture him, yes, but also ensure he lived. They\u2019d feared freeing his demon and unleashing its evil upon an unsuspecting world. Except, Galen had found a way to pair the freed demons with new hosts. His plan? To pair them with people of his choosing. Humans who would follow his every command. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pop. Whiz.</p><p>A bullet lodged in Strider\u2019s lower back, another in his thigh. He stumbled, slowed. Shit. At this rate, he\u2019d bleed out before he got the cape around his shoulders.</p><p>Win, win, win. A whimper now, pained and unsure. A pain that radiated through Strider.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up yet,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve got this. I promise you.\u201d Both arms shaking now, he managed to drape the Cloak over himself and jerk the hood in place. In the next instant, his body disappeared from view and even he couldn\u2019t see it. An odd sensation.</p><p>He leaped from the path he\u2019d been taking, stopped abruptly and turned. The Hunters slowed, each frantically searching the thinning crowd for any sign of him. They\u2019d put distance between themselves, but now edged closer to each other.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d one rasped.</p><p>\u201cHe used the Cloak. Damn it! We\u2019ll never find him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019s still running or do you think he\u2019s waiting nearby, planning to follow us?\u201d</p> <p>Winning! Defeat said again, happy once more though not completely satisfied. No one had died.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a demon coward. He\u2019s running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t know that for sure. Which means we can\u2019t return to base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we shouldn\u2019t talk, either. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>None of the Hunters had looked to their feet yet. Had they, they would\u2019ve seen the blood that left the protection of the cape and materialized on the stones. Strider eased to the dirt, careful to avoid bumping into anyone and giving away his location.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want us to do?\u201d the female asked, speaking up for the first time. Husky voice, a hint of smoke.</p> <p>\u201cSplit up,\u201d the tallest of the group said. He was clearly the leader. He had dark hair, dark eyes and dark skin. And he looked so much like Amun, Strider was momentarily struck senseless. Surely he was merely seeing things. \u201cJust roam the city until I call you and tell you otherwise. But move as fast as you can. He\u2019s injured, and won\u2019t last long out there.\u201d</p><p>Each of them nodded, broke apart and kicked into gear. Well, except for the leader and the girl. They shared a loaded glance. Silent. A muscle was ticking in the guy\u2019s jaw.</p><p>He leaned down, pressed a quick kiss to the girl\u2019s mouth, muttered, \u201cStay safe,\u201d and moved away from her.</p><p>Interesting. And profitable. Clearly, the two were lovers. The leader would probably do a lot to get his female back.</p><p>Rather than find shelter and patch himself up, Strider followed her. New challenge, he told his demon.</p><p>Win.</p><p>I will. She was petite with shoulder-length blond hair. Mixed into the blond were streaks of bright pink. She wore a white Hello Kitty tank top and ripped jeans. Weapons were probably hidden all over her curvy little body. There was a silver stud in her eyebrow that matched the gray of her eyes, and one of her arms was sleeved with tattoos.</p><p>There was something familiar about her. Something that caused a wave of...hatred to hit him. Yes, hatred, he realized with shock. There was no mistaking the dark emotion for something else. How odd. He didn\u2019t remember meeting her. Not in any of the battles he\u2019d had with Hunters. That didn\u2019t mean he hadn\u2019t met her, though. Only that she\u2019d been insignificant at the time.</p> <p>Why the hatred, then?</p><p>Win. Win!</p><p>Worry about who she is later, asshole, he told himself. Short as she was, she was able to move faster than he would have expected. He wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up, as weak as he was becoming.</p><p>Win.</p><p>I told you. I will. She\u2019s as good as mine.</p><p>When the girl wound around a corner and headed toward a crowded building, Strider grabbed her by the hair and jerked. A low blow, but necessary. As she fell, she yelped in surprise. A second later, though, she was on her feet, two daggers palmed.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she snarled. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come after me, the perceived weak link. Well, that was your first mistake.\u201d</p><p>Several humans turned to stare at her, obviously wondering who she was talking to.</p><p>Strider didn\u2019t reply. Just darted behind her and smashed his hands against her carotid, cutting off the blood supply to her brain. And shit! She was cold. Like a block of ice. He almost pulled away. Almost.</p><p>\u201cSo what was my second?\u201d he asked smugly.</p><p>At first, she struggled, tried to spin. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d But then her knees buckled, and her eyes rolled back into her head.</p><p>Just like that, she was out.</p><p>We won. We won!</p><p>Too easy. Still. As the pleasure began to wash through him, Strider grinned. The grin only widened as he picked up the girl, shivered\u2014because damn\u2014then hid her within the confines of the Cloak and carried her away.</p><p>SIENNA DRAGGED herself from her bed, the chains around her neck, wrists and ankles rattling, cutting. When she stood to shaky legs, those chains pulled taut, cut deeper, preventing her from moving away.</p><p>There was a red film over her eyes, coloring her vision, painting everything she studied in crimson. Fitting, since she wanted everything in the room to be bathed with blood. Hers, Cronus\u2019s. She craved it. Dreamed of it. The velvet curtains, the flowers blooming from the walls, the polished wood and the alabaster statues of too-tall men with too many muscles......all dripping...</p><p>Enough! Must reach Paris, she thought. Or maybe the thought belonged to the demon. Wrath. The enemy inside her. The enemy she should despise but couldn\u2019t; just then, Wrath was her only link to vengeance. And salvation.</p><p>Paris will help. This time, she knew exactly who the words belonged to: the demon. Paris can guard you until you\u2019re strong enough to attack Cronus.</p><p>Maybe Paris would guard her. Maybe not. Moments before she\u2019d died, she\u2019d told him how much she hated him. And she had. Hated him. She was pretty sure she still did. Or didn\u2019t. God, she was so confused. The more the demon spoke about Paris, the more her dislike faded.</p><p>Paris will help.</p><p>\u201cI heard you the first time,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Part of her\u2014the human part\u2014thought she might try to kill the warrior when she reached him. Part of her\u2014the female part\u2014thought she might kiss his beautiful face. Only thing she knew for sure was that she was going to find him, and she was going to use him, as Wrath had suggested. He, too, was possessed by a demon, and while he guarded her\u2014if he would\u2014he could teach her how to control this new, darker side of herself.</p><p>And once that happened...bye-bye Cronus.</p><p>Determined, urgent, she stepped forward again. Or tried to. Those damn chains yanked but held steady. Her body burned with rage, with hate, and the wings still growing between her shoulder blades flapped wildly.</p><p>Each emotion gave her strength. She jerked again. And again. Skin sliced open and vessels burst. The pain, the pain, the pain... Paris, her mind shouted, giving her strength...and finally, one of the chains cracked...</p><p>AMUN STUMBLED through the smoky cavern, William and Aeron holding him up and keeping him from kissing the bone-laden ground. They\u2019d fought countless demon minions to get here, to this forgotten valley of death. They were as injured as he was. He shouldn\u2019t add to their burden, but he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>Crunch, crunch. Sweat poured from him, draining him. His skin was sliced like a Christmas ham, but that wasn\u2019t the worst of his torment. Too many secrets...they were bombarding him, consuming him. Evil secrets, vile secrets. Thefts, rapes and murders. Oh, the murders.The souls decaying in this underground prison had killed their brethren in the most heinous of ways, enjoying every bit of torture they inflicted. And now, the demons who lived here were enjoying every bit of the torture they inflicted. Retaliation, they found it so sweet.</p><p>The demons, at least, didn\u2019t keep secrets. They were happy to share the disgusting details of their lives. But Amun could also read their minds and knew their basest thoughts. He could feel their desire to steal, to rape and murder. Could see through their eyes as they did so.</p><p>Never had he felt so dirty, and he doubted he would ever be able to cleanse himself of this. Secrets loved it, though. Loved every moment of it. Was humming, soaking up each new revelation like chocolate through a straw.</p><p>\u201cNothing on Legion?\u201d Aeron asked for the thousandth time.</p><p>He shook his head and winced at the ensuing ache.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep roaming this place blind,\u201d William said. \u201cWe\u2019re each cut up and bleeding from our last go-round with those minions. They\u2019re small, but damn, they\u2019re wily. I thought I was going to lose my balls.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer might be afraid of the warrior, but his servants were not. They\u2019d attacked William as staunchly as they\u2019d attacked Amun and Aeron.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to steal a demon\u2019s memories,\u201d Aeron told Amun grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way. William\u2019s right for once. The longer we\u2019re here, the more we\u2019re forced to fight and the weaker we become.\u201d</p><p>No, Amun thought, even as he nodded. He\u2019d known it would come to this. He\u2019d hoped otherwise, and had resisted for as long as he could. If things were bad now, they were going to be impossible after he stole a full set of demon memories. There would be no purging himself later.</p><p>They would be a part of him forever.</p><p>Why are you doing this again? he wondered. Because he loved Aeron. Wanted his friend happy and knew his friend couldn\u2019t be happy any other way.</p><p>And what of your happiness?</p><p>He ignored that question. He might talk himself out of what he was about to do, and couldn\u2019t allow himself to do such a thing. Find a demon, he signed. Bring it to me alive. The higher up the caste system it is, the better.</p><p>\u201cYou want a High Lord?\u201d William asked, incredulous. A High Lord was what possessed each of the Lords. They were the most powerful of the demons and the most knowledgeable of what was happening down here, but there were only a few left within these depths. A few that hadn\u2019t tried to escape with the others. Like Secrets.</p><p>Amun nodded. If possible. They would also be the hardest to capture.</p><p>His friends led him to the shadowed mouth of the nearest cave and eased him down. Every muscle in his tired body sighed in relief, basically liquefying. He closed his eyes. Rest, he\u2019d rest for a moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone patted his shoulder. Someone placed a gun in his hand. Then footsteps sounded. How long he sat there, weapon gradually slipping from his too-loose hold, he didn\u2019t know. All he knew was that the next time he opened his eyes, his friends were back.</p><p>Aeron and William stood before him, panting, barely managing to maintain their grip on a wildly bucking demon. The creature was as tall as they were, with green scales over portions of its body and a face composed only of bone. Several horns protruded from its spine and even its feet.</p><p>\u201cNot a High Lord, but close enough,\u201d Aeron gritted out. There was a new gash on his forehead and blood was seeping into his left eye.</p> <p>\u201cDo your thing,\u201d William commanded. \u201cBefore it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Though it required every ounce of his strength, Amun managed to reach out and place his hands on the creature\u2019s skull. The bucking intensified. Frantic screams escaped. Twice, Amun\u2019s sweaty palms slid out of place, but he eventually made the mental connection and his hands were no longer needed.</p><p>Memory after memory flooded him. A lifetime of rage and pain and torture. All inflicted upon others. The creature was second in command to the High Lord Pain, Reyes\u2019s demon. Upon Pain\u2019s escape, this creature had taken over. And oh, had it enjoyed hurting others. In every way imaginable and even some Amun had never considered.</p><p>This one had even hurt Legion. And now her shrieks were trapped inside Amun, her terrified expression the only thing he could see. Gods, he wanted to vomit. And did vomit, the moment the connection was severed.</p><p>William and Aeron released their burden, and it collapsed to the ground, useless now, brain wiped clean.</p> <p>A hand settled atop Amun\u2019s head and caressed down, stopping at the base of his neck and massaging. A comforting touch meant to soothe. Nothing could soothe him, however. Not ever again.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d Aeron asked gently.</p><p>Amun nodded, tears burning his eyes. Those shrieks...the blood...too much...</p><p>The hand on his neck stilled. \u201cWhere? Tell me, Amun. Please.\u201d</p><p>Amun raised his gaze, ready to vomit again. She\u2019s given to a new demon every other day. She\u2019s beaten, tortured...and worse. In between those days, she returns to Lucifer, who entertains his minions with her screams. Today, she\u2019s with him. And he...he...he knows you\u2019re here. He plans to kill you in front of her.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p> <p>SCARLET DIDN\u2019T move or speak as Gideon crawled up her body. He took his time, too, removing her boots, socks and pants along the way. She could have protested. She didn\u2019t. She needed this, she realized. Just once. A moment of beauty and pleasure to overshadow a lifetime of hate and regret. Of sadness and pain. Of deceit.</p><p>Funny, Gideon was keeper of Lies, yet he\u2019d been the only person ever to be honest with her.So this moment? Yes, she would take it. Cling to it. Anything else with him...no. As long as her mother lived, as long as her aunt could manipulate her mind, she was a danger to him.</p><p>A danger he didn\u2019t deserve. He was blameless of every crime she\u2019d ever tossed at his door.</p><p>Gods, she was a fool. Deserved only punishment. She should leave, not luxuriate in her own selfishness by stealing this moment. She owed him that, at the very least. But she couldn\u2019t force herself to pull away from him. Just once, she reminded herself. She\u2019d have him. He seemed to want her, too, so really, leaving would make her selfish.</p><p>\u201cSo ugly,\u201d he whispered, reverently tracing his fingertips along the inside of her thighs.</p><p>Goose bumps broke out over her flesh, but when he realized what he\u2019d said, he froze and looked up at her with budding panic.</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant,\u201d she told him softly. He\u2019d left her in a T-shirt and panties, so he couldn\u2019t see the hard tips of her nipples. Couldn\u2019t see how much she already desired him.</p><p>Slowly, he relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m not amazed by you, devil.\u201d His thumbs dabbled at the indentation behind her knee, caressing her, tantalizing her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you know that.\u201d</p> <p>How could he be so gentle with her? How could he stand to touch her? After everything they\u2019d just learned? If you\u2019re going to enjoy this, you have to stop traveling down that thought path.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t stop. The thoughts lanced at her, sharp and undeniable. She had built fantasies around this man. She had. All on her own. Her aunt had merely made the suggestion that they\u2019d been married, and Scarlet had created a full-blown history. She was humiliated. She was remorseful. Vulnerable. Raw. Humiliated. Had she mentioned that?</p><p>Mostly, she was mourning. Her beautiful wedding had never happened. She\u2019d never lain in this man\u2019s arms, hopeful and sated. She hadn\u2019t given him a son. Her chin trembled as white-hot tears flooded her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d She might not want him to end it, might want this one moment with him, but she had to offer him a way out. If he was doing this out of pity, well, she couldn\u2019t handle any more embarrassment and that would embarrass her more than anything else. \u201cYou aren\u2019t really my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking,\u201d he muttered, lifting her shirt, bending down and laving at her navel. \u201cI\u2019m loving what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>A tremor moved through her, sultry and hungry. \u201cKeep talking\u201d equaled \u201cshut up\u201d in Gideon Speak. Who would have thought she\u2019d enjoy hearing those words? \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to say is that you don\u2019t owe me anything.\u201d Was that breathless voice hers? \u201cIf anything, I owe you.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, raised his head again, his eyes narrowing, lashes tangling together and blocking that gorgeous ocean-blue. \u201cYou owe me lots.\u201d There was unrestrained fury in his tone. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what this is about.\u201d O-kay.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you desperately,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cDo you not understand? My body doesn\u2019t ache for yours. I haven\u2019t dreamed of being with you since the first moment I saw you. The past matters. It does.\u201d</p><p>Several tears splashed over and trickled down her cheeks. Embarrassing tears. But still she couldn\u2019t move away. The past didn\u2019t matter to him? \u201cReally?\u201d How could she dare to hope?</p><p>He nodded, his unrelenting gaze never leaving hers. \u201cYou aren\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>She was his. And just like that, something snapped inside her. The resistance she\u2019d fought so hard to build against him, perhaps. All that remained inside her was desire. So much desire. She would have him. Just this once, she reminded herself a second time. She would hold nothing back. Would give him everything.</p><p>What would happen to her heart afterward, she didn\u2019t know. Liar! What\u2019s left of it will shatter. She wouldn\u2019t worry about that until absolutely necessary. Right now, Gideon was with her. He wanted her. That would be enough.</p><p>Though she\u2019d wanted to jump him every time he\u2019d neared her, she\u2019d never allowed herself to be the aggressor with him. Her resentment and pride had hindered and muted every sensation. But not this time.</p><p>Slowly Scarlet sat up, forcing Gideon to do the same, until he straddled her thighs. Her hair tumbled to her shoulders. The strands weren\u2019t long enough to shield her cleavage, and that irritated her for a moment. Such a thing would have been sexy, and she wanted to be sexy for this man. In every possible way.</p><p>She wanted him to want her with the same intensity she\u2019d wanted him all these years. All these centuries.</p><p>He sucked in a breath. \u201cNo more.\u201d</p><p>More. \u201cNot yet. I want to see you.\u201d She gripped the hem of his shirt and jerked the material over his head.</p><p>Now she was the one to suck in a breath. Gods, he was magnificent. Perfect in every way. His skin was golden, his stomach roped with unparalleled strength. The black eyes and red lips he had tattooed on his chest and neck caught her gaze and she traced them with a fingertip. She even traced an imaginary butterfly on his right shoulder, nail scraping lightly, leaving an imprint of red. They might not be married, but the symbol connected them.</p><p>\u201cCools so bad,\u201d he panted.</p><p>Burns so good, he meant, and that thrilled her. She moved her touch to the indigo loop piercing his nipple, then the sapphire stud in his navel. Blue again.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you like blue so much?\u201d she asked just before flicking her tongue against the nipple ring. Cold metal and hot skin, a delicious combination.</p><p>A moan escaped him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about this now?\u201d He curled a hand over the erection straining over the waist of his pants and rubbed up and down. \u201cThere\u2019s not something better for us to do.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d thought him magnificent before. Silly her. Here he was, at his most primal. A warrior who saw what he wanted and took it, damn the consequences. But... \u201cYeah. I do want to talk.\u201d Knowing him was just as important as being with him. Only this once.</p><p>That time, she despised the reminder.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hand fell away, and he sighed, placing her desires above his own. He didn\u2019t edge away from her, but cupped her ass and urged her forward, until the core of her covered him. Hard, hot. She bit the inside of her cheek to stop a reckless groan from forming.</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t this kid in Tartarus, and he wasn\u2019t the ugliest little thing I\u2019d ever seen. One day I didn\u2019t deliver a new prisoner into his cell and the kid didn\u2019t ask for a game. Only thing I couldn\u2019t find was paper and a crayon. Wasn\u2019t blue. When I didn\u2019t hand them over, the kid didn\u2019t smile the sweetest smile I\u2019d ever seen and tell me that blue was the bestest color in the world, like the sky he\u2019d heard about but had never seen. That day, blue didn\u2019t start to represent...freedom to me.\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d spoken, Scarlet had ceased breathing, the tremor sliding the length of her spine too intense. \u201cThis boy,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cDid he have a shaved head and black eyes?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Gideon tilted his head to the side. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d He went rigid. His gaze widened, and his attention zeroed in on her face, studying intently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you,\u201d he gasped out. \u201cBut you\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHad a shaved head like a boy, yes.\u201d Perhaps that was how he\u2019d known her eyes, but that didn\u2019t explain how he\u2019d known her lips. Had he seen them when she invaded his dreams, as she suspected? Had he truly been that aware of her? \u201cIt was one of the few kindnesses I remember from my mother. Most of the prisoners knew I was a girl, but it was best not to remind them. It was best to look as...unattractive as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone...\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cTartarus was filled with gods and goddesses used to getting their way. Used to exerting their power anytime they wished. They were angry, frustrated and desolate. What do you think?\u201d She could have lied. Made herself seem pure, untouched. Yet, she wanted only honesty between them.</p> <p>Oh, the irony, she thought.</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to Zeus and ask for the boy\u2019s release, you know. I wasn\u2019t denied.\u201d Each word was harsher than the last.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and she grinned. \u201cThat was sweet of you.\u201d So they had spoken inside that prison. That was real. A real memory. And they\u2019d shared it. Together. No wonder she had adored this man from the first. \u201cI\u2019m done talking now. I hope you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>But he was still clearly considering the past. Still angry about her treatment. She wanted him focused on her now, and only her. \u201cGideon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have you now.\u201d</p><p>He huffed, but remained still as she unfastened his pants. Black briefs, tenting with his arousal. Her mouth watered. Before the night was over, she was going to have that hard, thick shaft inside her mouth and body. She wasn\u2019t letting Gideon leave this bed until they\u2019d both climaxed a dozen times. At least. She would make the most of their night together.</p><p>Quickly she worked both the pants and the underwear off his legs and tossed them to the floor. He\u2019d already kicked off his boots and socks. If he\u2019d even been wearing them. She couldn\u2019t recall. And now, finally, he was bare. Now, finally, he was all hers.</p><p>She sat at his ankles, admiring the rest of him. His legs were long, lean yet perfectly muscled. There was a smattering of dark hair on his calves that thinned on his thighs and thickened again around his shaft. His testicles were heavy and drawn up tight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he croaked out. \u201cYour stare isn\u2019t killing me.\u201d</p> <p>So he thought he was dying, did he? \u201cThen I feel sorry for you. I haven\u2019t even begun to torture you yet.\u201d</p><p>A groan. Of anticipation? She hoped so.</p><p>Scarlet traced his real butterfly tattoo with her tongue, then worked her way up to his sac. He uttered another groan, this one far more hoarse. Just to torment him further, she blew on the moisture she\u2019d left behind, warm breath that would cool against his skin. Yet another groan, even a bowing of his back as he sought closer contact.</p><p>\u201cGrip the headboard and don\u2019t let go,\u201d she commanded, lest he decided to pump into her mouth and end things too quickly. He\u2019d made her work for her first orgasm with him. She could do no less for him. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d He stiffened.</p><p>At first, she thought she\u2019d pushed this dedicated warrior used to control too far. He stared up at her, uncertainty in his eyes. But then, his arms flew above his head and his fingers wrapped around the top of the wood. Holding so tightly his knuckles blanched.</p><p>His uncertainty hadn\u2019t stemmed from a reluctance to follow her orders, she realized, but from trepidation. He was afraid to believe she\u2019d actually take over.</p><p>And that meant...he wanted control taken from him. Wanted to lose himself to the passion without worrying about anything but the sensations. Of course. The humans he\u2019d been with wouldn\u2019t have known because he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell them. Never mind that Scarlet wanted to kill those humans for having touched and tasted him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want from me.\u201d She needed to hear him say it. Needed him to know that she and no other understood his true meaning. \u201cAdmit it. In your way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d He licked his lips again. There was no shame in his brilliant eyes, only more of that woeful trepidation. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re wanting me to admit.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he did. \u201cSay it, Gideon, or I walk away. This ends.\u201d Could she follow through with that threat? She didn\u2019t know. Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t make her find out. Already she was damp and aching, hungry for him.</p><p>And she wondered, would he be the lover she\u2019d created in her mind? Or something more?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be in charge,\u201d he whispered, as if he feared she would take him at his word.</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good. Because in this bed, I decide your every action. In this bed, I own you.\u201d</p><p>The relief that curtained his features would thrill her for the rest of her days.</p><p>So she took the game to the next level. \u201cIf you hesitate to obey me even once, I\u2019ll leave you unsatisfied. You\u2019ll have to watch me pleasure myself, knowing you won\u2019t be allowed to climax. Understand?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, unable to hide his eagerness. Even his cock twitched.</p><p>She\u2019d never been this hard-core an aggressor\u2014sexually, that is\u2014but she would be lying if she claimed not to enjoy it. She wanted to be what Gideon had never had before. She wanted to be everything he needed, everything he yearned for.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, not even a little,\u201d she told him as she lowered her mouth to his erection. She didn\u2019t touch him, though, only let her exhalations continue to caress him. For a moment, she thought perhaps he\u2019d even stopped breathing.</p><p>\u201cDevil,\u201d he finally gritted out. But he didn\u2019t move. Oh, no, he didn\u2019t move. \u201cI can wait forever. Please, please don\u2019t...do anything. Please...\u201d</p><p>Still she waited. Until her blood was molten in her veins. Until he was trembling. Until she felt ready to jump out of her skin, the darkness and screams swirling inside her, desperate for release. Then Scarlet licked him from base to tip.</p><p>He shouted her name, a prayer and a curse rolled into one hoarse entreaty. She twirled her tongue around his slit, tasting the saltiness of his seed, then bore down, taking him all the way inside. Until, long as he was, he hit the back of her throat. My man.</p><p>Up and down her mouth rode him, and still he didn\u2019t move. He wanted to, she knew it, for she could feel the tension in his muscles. He might not be her husband, but just then he did belong to her. She did own him as she\u2019d claimed, owned his passion, and the knowledge was heady, fogging her mind, heating her blood yet another degree.</p><p>She gripped the base as tight as she could, and he cried out. Not in pain but in intensified pleasure. With her other hand, she cupped his balls and tugged. \u201cMove now. You can move.\u201d</p><p>Whatever tether he\u2019d had on his body broke, and he shuddered over and over, again and again, pumping his hips into her hands, trying to slide his cock in and out of her steady grip. But she never loosened her hold, never let him create a necessary friction, and no seed emerged. His cock remained hard as a lead pipe.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d she praised huskily. \u201cYou deserve a reward.\u201d</p><p>His only reply was a ragged pant. Sweat glistened over his trembling body as she kissed her way up his stomach. She stopped and dabbled at his navel, then played at his nipples, sucking one, then the other. Soon, his trembling was so intense, the entire bed was rocking and the springs were squeaking.</p><p>Inside her head, Nightmares hummed.</p><p>When Gideon tried to arch his back, placing his cock into the apex of her slick center, still covered by her panties, she bit down on his nipple ring and tugged. He moaned, and the wood he held cracked, but he forced his hips to settle back on the mattress. His breath grew more ragged.</p><p>Scarlet sat up and straddled his waist. Slowly she removed her shirt and dropped the material beside his head. His white-hot gaze ate her up, devouring her breasts. As he watched, she palmed them, tweaked her nipples.</p><p>He lifted his head, trying to get to them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes. It was a scream from her demon and a plea from her body, but she shook her head. \u201cDown.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he obeyed.</p><p>Denying him wasn\u2019t a power play for her. Far from it. He\u2019d given the control to her, had been eager to relinquish it, in fact. That meant he\u2019d wanted someone to tell him no. To direct him. Any other woman would have allowed the action, but he didn\u2019t want what he\u2019d always had. He wanted something different. And she would give it to him, no matter the opposition. No matter how much she wanted that mouth sucking on her.</p><p>\u201cDevil,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>Darling. \u201cPut your hand between my legs.\u201d</p><p>The headboard finally broke as he rushed to obey. Though she\u2019d told him to use only one, he placed one hand between her legs, groaned as if in pain, then placed the other on her thigh and groaned as if in agony.</p><p>She didn\u2019t scold him. Yet. The action had probably been instinctual on his part, and was definitely welcome on hers. \u201cMake me climax like this. Me, only me.\u201d</p><p>He was jerking the barrier of her panties aside in the next instant, his fingers sliding over her wet clitoris. Now she was the one to groan. Nightmares, too. So damned good. The shadows and the screams finally broke free, seeping from her, enveloping the bed, wrapping around them.</p><p>Like before, Gideon didn\u2019t seem to mind. And for a long while, he simply rubbed her. Rubbed her until she was moving with his touch, trying to force his fingers to sink inside her rather than torment her sensitive center. Gods, he was working her to a fever pitch, so when he finally, blessedly penetrated her with one finger, she instantly climaxed, squeezing him, holding tight.</p><p>Her head fell back as she rode the waves of satisfaction to the sky, stars twinkling behind her eyes. How long she floated, she didn\u2019t know. She only knew that when she came back to herself, Gideon was still, awe in his eyes, awaiting his next command, his body so tense she could have snapped him in two.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t good enough, though. She wanted him out of his mind with lust. She wanted him begging for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now she scolded him. \u201cAgain,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cYou\u2019ll make me come again before you receive your own pleasure.

All the while Gideon\u2019s thumb played with that little bundle of nerves. Double stimulation, so good, so good, so damned good. More shadows, more screams.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come, devil, don\u2019t come.\u201d His hips moved in sync with his words, rubbing against her, electrifying her enjoyment.</p><p>Just like that, Scarlet was propelled back to the sky, twirling, free, so overcome she might never be the same. Might? Ha.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me have you, please, don\u2019t let me have you. Please.\u201d</p> <p>A plea he\u2019d probably never uttered to another. And that he didn\u2019t take her yet, that he waited for permission, spoke more of his intense need to relinquish control than his hesitant confession had.</p><p>That was why she didn\u2019t give him what he craved. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cRip my panties the rest of the way off, but don\u2019t enter me.\u201d</p><p>The blue scrap of cloth was torn from her and resting beside her bra in less than a second. Gideon gripped her hips, fingers wrapping around to her ass. He pressed so determinedly, she knew she would have bruises. Bruises she welcomed.</p><p>\u201cNot now?\u201d Lines of tension branched from his eyes, and he was worrying his bottom lip so forcefully with his teeth, there was a trickle of blood running down his chin. He was on edge, desperate, but still he waited.</p><p>That roused her yet another degree, as if she hadn\u2019t already climaxed twice.</p> <p>\u201cWhat have you fantasized about doing to other girls?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cOther girls? I remember all the other girls.\u201d A broken admission. Strained. \u201cI can think of everyone but you.\u201d</p><p>He thought only of her. My darling. She couldn\u2019t make him wait anymore.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d she said, and he was lifting her, thrusting deep, roaring loud and long before the last syllable left her mouth.</p><p>Scarlet climaxed instantly, shuddering, her roar blending with his. Gods, he stretched her, hit her just right, and the orgasm was far more intense than any she\u2019d ever experienced before. Even the screams and shadows shuddered. Even Nightmares bellowed.</p><p>Gideon, too, climaxed instantly, shouting her name, jetting hot seed inside her. Branding her, claiming her. Owning her. She could have basked in the sensations forever, could have remained one being, a part of Gideon, for eternity.</p><p>Or at least until his bedroom door crashed open and two angry Lords clomped inside the bedroom, weapons drawn.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p> <p>GIDEON HEARD the split of wood against metal, and knew his door had just been kicked down. Next he heard angry footsteps, a muttered, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d from his friend Kane, and a growled, \u201cShit,\u201d from Lucien.</p><p>They had to be confused. Scarlet\u2019s shadows filled the room from one corner to the other, thick and dark and writhing. Worse, the screams that accompanied those shadows were louder than a bullhorn and more menacing than a war cry.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Kane demanded.</p><p>Clearly, neither warrior could see through the gloom. Shit, neither could Gideon. But he didn\u2019t want either one of them shooting now and asking questions later.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d he shouted above the noise, rolling Scarlet beneath him and jerking the covers over her naked body. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t resist, and his urge to blind anyone who might see her so resplendent receded.</p><p>If he had his way, no one would see her bare but himself. And godsdamn, he was going to do everything in his power to have his way.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Lucien demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Gid. I\u2019m not fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon?\u201d Kane\u2019s shock was clear. \u201cStrider told us you\u2019d left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on in here?\u201d Lucien again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me a minute, and I won\u2019t take care of things. Oh, and don\u2019t stay put.\u201d Gideon raised an expectant eyebrow at Scarlet. Much as he wanted to keep her hidden, he couldn\u2019t. His friends needed to see her (covered), see how he looked at her, and know beyond any doubt that she belonged with him. That to harm her was to die. That simple.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dragging the sheet with her, she squirmed out from under him and propped herself against the cracked headboard. Her expression was blank, though her color was high. Dark hair tangled around her beautiful face and she smoothed several strands away with a steady hand. Steady.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. Not when he felt like an earthquake was even now raging through him. \u201cAs if you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You want an audience for our afterglow, you\u2019ll get an audience.\u201d She closed her eyes, features hardening with her determination. A moment later, the shadows thinned and the screams quieted, both seeming to vapor-lock around her before being sucked completely inside her.</p><p>While she\u2019d straddled him, while he\u2019d thrust his shaft deep inside her, he\u2019d forgotten that they were there. Hell, he\u2019d forgotten everything. Except pleasure, that is.</p><p>And gods, had she given him pleasure. Nothing like that had ever happened to him before. But he\u2019d dreamed of it. Dreamed of being at a woman\u2019s mercy while she took what she wanted from him. That probably wasn\u2019t something most warriors dreamed about, but over the years he\u2019d disappointed too many women to count and that had been hell on his ego.</p><p>He\u2019d say something like, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you want, I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d so the women wouldn\u2019t tell him and he\u2019d have to guess and of course, he\u2019d sometimes\u2014most times\u2014get it wrong. Tonight, he hadn\u2019t wanted to think about his next move. He hadn\u2019t wanted to wonder if he was doing it right.</p><p>Scarlet had taken care of everything. Exquisitely.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d shot like a fucking virgin the moment he\u2019d entered her and was embarrassed as hell about that, but that only proved how much she\u2019d aroused him. He\u2019d known she was enjoying herself, that she was taking exactly what she needed, and that had increased his own enjoyment. Actually, everything about her had increased his enjoyment.</p><p>Her body fit his like a puzzle piece. Her scent was like nose candy and better than any ambrosia he\u2019d ever snorted. Yeah, he\u2019d been there, done that. Her skin was smooth, the perfect contrast to his callused hands, and her hair was perfect for fisting. Inside, she\u2019d been wet and warm and tight enough to squeeze him.</p><p>But next time, he was going to be in control. He was going to demand, in his way, that she tell him exactly what she craved. She would know what he meant, and she would tell him the truth. Tell him what she really wanted him to do to her. And he would do it. Every damn thing. Nothing would be taboo. The dirtier the better.</p><p>Kane cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably from one booted foot to the other, and Gideon realized he\u2019d been quietly staring at Scarlet, who was still watching him with that blank expression. He tried not to blush like a pussy but failed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d Hazel eyes brightening with amusement, Kane sheathed the two Sigs in his hands. He must not have seen Scarlet in the dungeon.</p><p>Gideon studied the warrior. His mix of brown, gold and black hair was shorter than when Gideon had last seen it. No doubt his friend had caught the strands on fire. Again. The man\u2019s demon, Disaster, fed off catastrophes, purposely drawing them. In fact, one of the wooden shards that had flown from the busted door was lodged in Kane\u2019s side, blood seeping from the wound and soaking his shirt.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my wife,\u201d Gideon said, and even though the words were a lie, he liked saying them. Could hear the pride in his tone.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m no one,\u201d Scarlet stated baldly. \u201cI\u2019m nothing.\u201d</p><p>Like hell, he thought, tossing her a glare. She was...everything.</p><p>Everything? His brow puckered. Surely that was an overstatement. He liked being with her, enjoyed her, had contemplated marrying her for real, felt married to her, and would even kill to protect her. But was she everything to him?</p><p>He could think of nothing he valued as much as he valued her. Not his war, not his weapons. Not even his friends. So, yeah. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Nightmares,\u201d Lucien said, his blades steadily pointed in Scarlet\u2019s direction. \u201cAka one of the few prisoners who\u2019s ever left our dungeons alive.\u201d Unlike Kane, his eyes weren\u2019t gleaming with amusement. His eyes\u2014one blue that saw in the spiritual world, one brown that saw into the earthly realm\u2014were calm and determined. He was possessed by Death, and could shred a soul in a single heartbeat of time. The blades were kind of overkill.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suggest you lower your weapons. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love for me to threaten Annie that way, just as I love how you\u2019re threatening Scar.\u201d</p><p>Annie, real name Anya. Lucien\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. The warrior\u2019s face was terribly scarred, and as he ran his tongue over his teeth, those scars seemed all the more puckered. He was iron-willed, loved rules and took no risks when it came to the safety of his loved ones. Especially Anya.</p><p>\u201cYou could be making the suggestion under duress,\u201d Lucien said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll keep my weapons where they are, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m under duress.\u201d Now put those godsdamn weapons away, before I\u2019m forced to do something we\u2019ll both regret, he wanted to shout. Lucien was his friend, and Gideon didn\u2019t want to hurt him. But he would attack, no hesitation, to protect Scarlet. She\u2019d been hurt enough.</p><p>Finally, the blades were sheathed. Reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you here? Feel free not to tell me and then stay as long as you want.\u201d Which meant: Tell me and get your ass out! They\u2019d seen Scarlet, knew she was important to him. Mission accomplished. He was ready to be alone with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucien massaged the back of his neck. \u201cKane texted me that something was going down in your room, and I flashed back to help since Torin and Cameo are the only other people left at the fortress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere aren\u2019t the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that in a minute. I didn\u2019t expect you to be here. Strider told me you\u2019d left with Nightmares. And great going by the way, putting everyone at risk by letting the girl run wild.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a name.\u201d Why the irritated, offended voice? \u201cAnd it\u2019s not Scarlet.\u201d He just...he wanted his friends to treat her right. To treat her with respect. Not like she was a nuisance or an enemy and he should watch his back whenever she was around.</p><p>\u201cAnd ta-da.\u201d Scarlet splayed her arms in a how-am-I-still-sane gesture. \u201cAfter all that running wild, we\u2019re back. Or he is. I\u2019m about to take off.\u201d She kicked her legs over the side of the bed, dislodging the sheet. In the next instant, both exquisite breasts were bared. Both nipples hard like frosted cherries. \u201cNice seeing you again, though.\u201d</p><p>Two pairs of eyes widened before both men spun to give her their backs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, leaving\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d Where the hell did she think she was going?</p><p>Scowling, Gideon grabbed her by the nape and jerked her back down. Roughly, yeah, but she could take it, and he liked that about her. With his other hand, he drew up the sheet. Then he settled in beside her, his arms locking around her and holding her in place wrestler-style.</p> <p>She was a warrior herself and could have fought him, but she didn\u2019t. And it wasn\u2019t because she cared about who saw her naked, he thought darkly. Obviously she wasn\u2019t ashamed of her body. Not that she should be, but still. He was ready to sandpaper his friends\u2019 corneas even though their weapons were put away. Now they knew what a perfect shade of red her nipples were.</p><p>\u201cI have stuff to do,\u201d she said stiffly, \u201cand you have stuff to do. It\u2019s time to say our goodbyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. \u2019Cause we did not agree to take care of that stuff together.\u201d</p><p>Like Lucien, she ran her tongue over her teeth. \u201cI never agreed.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she had, maybe she hadn\u2019t. He still couldn\u2019t tell with her. Which was odd, now that he thought about it. They hadn\u2019t been married. Their pasts weren\u2019t intertwined. Well, not as much as they\u2019d assumed, anyway. And they now knew her memories were false. So why could his demon still not tell when she spoke true?</p><p>\u201cCan we turn around now?\u201d Kane asked, his amusement making another appearance.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gideon said as Scarlet said, \u201cWhy would you want to? We\u2019re decent.\u201d</p><p>Both warriors pivoted on their heels. Lucien pulled at his collar and Kane clearly fought a grin.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Lucien said, then glanced pointedly at Scarlet. \u201cA lot has gone down while you were away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more.\u201d Immediately she tried to dislodge Gideon and stand, though she never outright tried to injure him. Which meant she didn\u2019t want her freedom enough, he thought smugly. \u201cI can take a hint,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ll give you guys some privacy.\u201d</p><p>He held tight, keeping her in place. \u201cWhatever you need to say to me can\u2019t be said in front of her.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, and that was both good and bad. Her skin had been rubbing against his, and well, the material draping his lap was getting taller by the second.</p><p>Cheeks flaming for the second time in the past five minutes, Gideon lifted her up and settled her in front of him so that her body covered his growing erection. Mistake. The thick length pressed into the crevice of her ass, and he had to stifle a groan.</p><p>She gasped as if he\u2019d burned her, and tried to jump off him. \u201cGideon!\u201d</p> <p>His arms wrapped around her in a vise-grip, and he used his legs to frame hers. \u201cDon\u2019t get comfortable. You\u2019re going somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Gritted this time.</p><p>\u201cScar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you stubborn jackass.\u201d With a sigh that sounded both frustrated and relieved, she relaxed against him. Even rested her head on the curve of his shoulder.</p><p>Unable to resist, he kissed her temple. That\u2019s my good girl.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She gave an imperious wave of her hand in his friends\u2019 direction. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Start talking. The sooner you start, the sooner this ends.\u201d</p><p>Both Lucien and Kane were too busy gaping to speak.</p><p>What had Lucien meant? Kane, Cameo and Torin were the only ones left at the fortress? Why? And why had Lucien had to flash back here? Where had he been?</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want to dress first?\u201d Kane finally asked Scarlet, sounding as hopeful as he did regretful.</p><p>\u201cNot sure,\u201d Gideon answered for her. One, his curiosity was now too high to take the time needed to throw on a shirt and jeans. Two, he didn\u2019t want either man getting another peek at Scarlet. And three, he didn\u2019t want to release Scarlet.</p><p>Maybe he was being selfish, placing temptation right under Kane\u2019s nose like this. The man hadn\u2019t had a lover in years, too afraid his demon would somehow physically hurt his females. Which wasn\u2019t an irrational fear. It had happened. Several times. Gideon remembered the screams. But just then, Gideon was really only concerned with Scarlet. If he let her go, she might run before they settled things between them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take her advice and explain,\u201d he finished. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust her, I swear.\u201d After everything, Scarlet wouldn\u2019t betray him. He knew that, at least.</p><p>Though he\u2019d never shed his reluctance, Lucien nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with the basics. You might not know this, but Aeron, Amun and William journeyed into hell to retrieve Legion. No one\u2019s heard from them since.\u201d</p><p>Cronus had mentioned the boys were somewhere else, but not that the somewhere was actually hell. Freaking great. Gideon couldn\u2019t leave until he\u2019d spoken with Amun, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he could convince Scarlet to wait before slaughtering her despicable family.</p><p>Of course, she was supposed to stop him from contacting Amun, and he planned to let her do so, freeing her from her promise to Rhea, but she couldn\u2019t stop him if he couldn\u2019t find Amun. So again, he had to wait.</p><p>Unfortunately, he\u2019d never been a patient man. He wanted this over and done. He wanted NeeMah at his mercy, aka the end of his sword. He wanted time to romance Scarlet. Time to prove to her that things could work between them. All of which had to be placed on hold.</p><p>\u201cReady for the rest?\u201d Lucien asked, fighting a grin himself now. \u201cYou look distracted.\u201d</p><p>He would not blush. Again. \u201cDon\u2019t go on,\u201d he said with a wave just as commanding as Scarlet\u2019s had been.</p><p>Lucien gave up and let the grin form full-force. \u201cHunters surrounded the fortress, apparently planning to steal our artifacts. We decided to split up. Anya and I took the Cage, Reyes took Danika and Strider took the Cloak. Paris decided to take a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we no longer surrounded?\u201d he asked, glancing at his closet. He had a case of weapons in there. He could do some damage, blow off some steam.</p><p>\u201cStrider killed most of them on his way out,\u201d Kane said with pride.</p><p>Lucky. \u201cOthers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaddox didn\u2019t want Ashlyn near a potential battleground, so he took her away,\u201d Lucien said. \u201cSabin and Gwen took Gilly somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Yep, that left only Kane, Torin and Cameo. Could they hold the fort if other Hunters showed up and attacked? Yeah, there were all kinds of traps leading up the mountain and any intruders would be forced to first battle explosions, trip wires, rigged gunshots and metal clamps around their ankles. But that wouldn\u2019t stop hundreds. Survivors could make their way inside.</p><p>\u201cCan I count on you to stay?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>Adding one more warrior to the mix wasn\u2019t a miracle cure, but it would help.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s head fell back and hit the tattered headboard. He closed his eyes. Damn it. If the fortress was attacked and he was injured before Amun returned, if that delayed his confrontation with NeeMah...he would just have to deal, he thought.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t count on me.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet didn\u2019t react.</p><p>\u201cKnew it,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. Stay here,\u201d he told the warriors. Get lost. \u201cI don\u2019t need some alone time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Lucien replied, still shooting off that sheepish grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd try to control the...whatever we stumbled upon,\u201d Kane added. \u201cThat was just flat-out weird.\u201d</p><p>With that, both men turned and strode out of the room. One of them remained in the hall to try and refit the door in its hinges. When that failed, whoever it was propped the wood in the entrance so that most of the bedroom was blocked, only a long, thin crack of light visible.</p><p>Alone at last.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay here with me,\u201d Gideon said to Scarlet, and once again he hated his demon. More than anything, he wanted Scarlet to stay with him and he was willing to beg to make that happen. Beg properly. Truthfully. But he couldn\u2019t allow his body to weaken just then. His friends needed him at his strongest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with you. We can\u2019t do this, I know we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to be with me?\u201d she asked, finally ripping from his hold, standing and whirling on him with shining black eyes. Gods, she was glorious in her nakedness. Skin still flushed and pink, nipples beaded from the cool air, lean legs braced, stomach flat and navel dipped. \u201cWhy would you want to try?\u201d</p><p>Let her leave. A plea from Lies to keep her here.</p><p>Working on it. But why do you care? Not mine.</p><p>That\u2019s right, he shot back, doing to his demon what Scarlet sometimes did to him. Even though he knew the demon lied, he responded as if the fiend had told the truth. She\u2019s mine. And that wasn\u2019t up for debate. \u201cYou didn\u2019t promise your mother to stop me from helping Cronus,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her bitter laugh shut him up. \u201cGuess what? I lied to Mother Dearest. Besides that, you and I don\u2019t have a past,\u201d she continued before he could respond. \u201cWe\u2019re attracted to each other, yes, but that will fade. Right now I\u2019m just the shiny new toy who gets you and your sidekick, and that\u2019s got to be a relief for you. But we have different goals, and that\u2019s what matters. I\u2019m going to kill my mother and my aunt, even if it takes an eternity. You\u2019re going to protect your friends.\u201d</p><p>Shiny new toy. Fuck that! He popped to his knees, dislodging the sheet completely. Yeah, his erection stretched toward her, and yeah, she noticed, even backed up a step, but he didn\u2019t cover it. Let her see what the shiny new toy did to him.</p><p>Don\u2019t grab her, Lies commanded.</p><p>Grab her? He\u2019d lose an arm. We have to finesse this. \u201cClearly you\u2019re thinking this through rationally, Scar. You don\u2019t follow through with your promise, and you\u2019ll live happily ever after.\u201d One thing he knew. For immortals, a broken vow was fatal. He\u2019d imprisoned many Greeks for just such a crime. Therefore, Scarlet would be following through. \u201cSecond, you face your aunt and she won\u2019t give you new memories. She won\u2019t beat you.\u201d Gideon, too, laughed bitterly. They both knew her ass would be handed to her. \u201cShe won\u2019t chain you to a leash of her choosing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know what she can do now. I know what to guard against.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really? \u201cHaving trouble recalling what happened today?\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders and raised her chin. \u201cI told you. I\u2019m prepared now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll make a difference.\u201d No fucking difference at all! Why couldn\u2019t she see that?</p><p>\u201cWell, failure is a chance I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d</p> <p>Well, he damn well wasn\u2019t. \u201cDon\u2019t stay here with me, and I won\u2019t help you defeat her.\u201d Then, whatever. \u201cWe\u2019re weaker together, you know we are.\u201d They were stronger. \u201cI mean, I did nothing to help you come to your senses last time, right?\u201d He\u2019d done everything.</p><p>Fury sparked in her eyes as she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cAnd just how long would you expect me to stay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d need to guard the fortress and everyone inside. Didn\u2019t know how much time would pass before Amun returned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d she said and turned away. The elegant curve of her back had him sweating, and those tattoos...he\u2019d never licked them, never given them the attention they deserved. One day. One day he\u2019d devote an entire night to her back. If she let him. \u201cYou\u2019d keep me here indefinitely, and that I won\u2019t allow. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, let her go. Stop her.</p><p>\u201cScar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d she repeated, but still she didn\u2019t storm off. \u201cYes. I\u2019m going.\u201d One step, two. Hesitant. As if she warred with herself. Or perhaps her demon.</p><p>His own demon whimpered.</p><p>She took another step, still hesitant. And then silence, waiting. Maybe he\u2019d gotten to her. Maybe\u2014</p><p>She fisted her hands and strode into the closet. Clothing whooshed. A growl. Stop her, Lies gritted out, and it was the first time in all their centuries together that the demon had told the truth. Please.</p><p>Gideon blinked in shock, even as the demon screamed in pain. Pain that radiated through his entire body. A grunt escaped him, his muscles seeming to rip from his bones, his bones seeming to pop out of his skin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he barked. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon?\u201d</p><p>Stop...her...</p> <p>Another grunt. Black winked over his vision. Shut up! We have to stay strong. Stop...</p><p>The sweat poured from him, little rivers all over his body. \u201cDon\u2019t give me...a couple days...to learn more about...what\u2019s going on and do...what I can to help...so I can\u2019t leave with...a clear conscience.\u201d He could barely get the words out.</p><p>She leaned out of the closet, brow furrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed as she waited for him to elaborate. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Again she waited. Again he offered nothing more. He didn\u2019t want her pity. Didn\u2019t want her having to take care of him. He wanted her to view him as the warrior he was.</p><p>She frowned, looked away. \u201cListen. We both know the truth. You can\u2019t leave this place with a clear conscience. No matter how long I give you. And no, I\u2019m not doing this to be cruel. Please believe that,\u201d she whispered, then ducked back inside, disappearing from view.</p><p>Stop...stop...</p><p>Shut up! Panting, almost wheezing, he said, \u201cI have slept...with very few women.\u201d Many. \u201cAll of them made me feel...utterly satisfied.\u201d He\u2019d been pleasured, yes, but always hollow and lonely. \u201cBut with you, it\u2019s all physical.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t admire your strength...and your courage and fuck, I don\u2019t want...to see your smile.\u201d He did. More than anything.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she called, but there was a tremble in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t...want to.\u201d Fuck. He wouldn\u2019t be able to stay awake much longer. Took every ounce of strength he possessed to get to his feet.</p><p>\u201cShut up! Just shut up. I have to leave.\u201d A pause. A sniff. \u201cI have to.\u201d Another whisper.</p><p>No! A scream.</p><p>Gideon roared as more of that awful pain raged through him. \u201cMorning won\u2019t...arrive soon. Don\u2019t wait another day at least.\u201d Stay forever.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gideon. What\u2019s wrong with you? Tell me this time.\u201d Soft black material hanging from her fingers, she once again leaned out. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stay,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>A frustrated sigh met his words. \u201cThe moon is high. I\u2019ve got several hours to find someplace safe. I\u2019ll be fine, so there\u2019s no need to worry about me if that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he could stall her. Keep her talking until the sun rose and she drifted to sleep. \u201cHow did your demon...know I love spiders...so much?\u201d It was the first question that popped into his head.</p><p>\u201cMy demon just knows. My demon always knows. Why are you afraid of them? I\u2019ve wondered.\u201d</p><p>He liked that she\u2019d wondered about him. Even about that. \u201cBefore my possession \u2014\u201d after \u201c\u2014and never...at random times\u2014\u201d always \u201c\u2014I wouldn\u2019t feel them...crawling all over me. I wouldn\u2019t bat them away...and many more wouldn\u2019t take their place.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared back inside the closet. Something clanked. There was a muttered curse.</p><p>What else could he ask her? His brain was fogged, clouded by the pain, but surely there was something. \u201cSo why...\u201d Damn it. What? \u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just stop. You\u2019ve never been this talkative before, so I know what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d A gun clicked, metal slid against leather, and then she finally emerged fully.</p><p>Her hair was anchored in a ponytail at the base of her neck. She wore another of his T-shirts and a fresh pair of his sweatpants. Both were rolled to fit her shorter, smaller frame. In several places, there was a telltale bulge. Looked like she was stealing...four of his weapons. Not that he cared.</p><p>Gideon wanted to close the distance, grab her up and remind her of just how good it was between them. Weakened and hurting as he was, though, his knees finally gave out and he collapsed to the ground.</p><p>With a cry of concern, she stepped toward him. Just before contact, however, she stopped herself. Backed away. \u201cPlease understand, Gideon.\u201d Cold, so cold, and that was far worse than her lack of emotion. \u201cIt has to be this way. Being with you...hurts. There\u2019s just too much in the way. I\u2019m too much of a liability to you. And I know that isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s mine, but that doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>Every instinct he possessed yearned to tell her she wasn\u2019t a liability. But he couldn\u2019t. Truth or lie, she would know his meaning. NeeMah influenced her too easily. That didn\u2019t mean Scarlet wasn\u2019t worth the risk.</p><p>She was worth every risk.</p><p>But he wanted her to be happy, even if that meant upsetting himself, and she didn\u2019t think she could be happy with him. It hurt her.</p><p>The thought of her hurting utterly destroyed him. She\u2019d endured far too much already.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d she continued in that cold, detached way. Frowning, she rubbed her temple, as if her head were aching. Or perhaps, as he\u2019d suspected, her demon was as loud and upset as his own. \u201cLike I told you, I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure my memory is wiped clean. If I have to break into Tartarus and abduct the Greek god of Memory, I will. And when it\u2019s done, I won\u2019t remember you, so there\u2019s no reason to start something that has no future.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no. From the demon and Gideon. And yet...</p><p>Cringing at the effort required to move, he waved his arm toward the door. \u201cStay, then.\u201d If she needed to leave to find happiness, so be it. But when he healed, when the fortress was fortified, he would go after her. Somehow, some way, he\u2019d prove he could make her happy, too. Wiping her memory, though, wasn\u2019t going to happen. Ever.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Gideon,\u201d she said, then hesitated only a moment before walking away from him and out of his room.</p><p>No! No! Mine. Come back! Lies shouted, and that was the last thing Gideon knew.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>THE OLD MATTRESS squeaked as the punked-out female thrashed atop it, lost in what was probably a bloody, violent nightmare. I\u2019ll have to thank Gideon\u2019s woman later, Strider thought, just in case she was responsible. And he didn\u2019t feel bad for the lack of compassion.</p><p>He had studied his bounty while she\u2019d slept. Every inch of her, even peeling back her clothes for a look at all the hidden places. Weapons could be stored anywhere. Some would say he had no scruples, and he would agree. He didn\u2019t. Not with this woman. Never with this woman.He now knew who she was, and she didn\u2019t deserve leniency from him. She deserved the sting of his blade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There, lying on the small motel bed, locked with him in this tiny room, was Hadiee, the woman who had led Baden, keeper of Distrust, to his slaughter. She helped destroy my best friend!</p><p>The beheading had taken places thousands of years ago, and she\u2019d been human. Or so he\u2019d thought. Yet here she was, as young as she\u2019d been back then. Which meant she was now immortal. Right? How it had happened, he didn\u2019t know. But he would find out. He would be finding out a lot of things from the bitch.</p><p>It had taken him a few hours to place her, \u2019cause yeah, the tattoos, piercings and pink streaks in her hair had thrown him. She hadn\u2019t looked like this back then. Her hair had been several shades lighter, a tumble of snowfall, and her skin glowing from the sun\u2019s kiss. She\u2019d dressed in the rough, conservative garb of a servant, but that hadn\u2019t detracted from her prettiness.</p> <p>He never would have placed her if not for the scoreboard tattooed on her back.</p><p>Lords: IIII Haidee: I</p><p>She\u2019d split her back in two, one side for the Lords, one side for herself. He\u2019d known exactly what the marks meant, too, because Baden had marked himself that way, as well. Bitch.</p><p>The four he and his friends had supposedly killed, he couldn\u2019t name. And yeah, he\u2019d probably slain them. In all his many centuries, he\u2019d slain thousands. The knowledge of that should have dulled his anger toward this woman. It didn\u2019t. Baden had been the best man Strider had ever known. The kindest to his friends, the most supportive and caring.</p><p>Being possessed by the demon of Distrust had changed him, of course, just as being possessed by such a dark force had changed all of them. But he\u2019d been the first to come back to his senses. The one who had led everyone else to the light. He\u2019d felt the guiltiest for the destruction the Lords had caused. He\u2019d been the first to reach out, to try and make amends with humans.</p> <p>He had also hated what he\u2019d become more than any of the others. He\u2019d hated that he distrusted himself, everyone around him, even his friends. Especially his friends. But that had only made Strider love him more. Baden had been Strider\u2019s salvation. Strider had wanted to be Baden\u2019s salvation.</p><p>Hadiee had destroyed that chance.</p><p>As the girl continued to thrash, eyes squeezed shut, sweat beading over her skin, arms and legs jerking at their ties, her cell phone rang. Strider grinned. He\u2019d been hoping this would happen and didn\u2019t have to guess who was calling. The boyfriend. The leader of the Hunters who had been chasing him.</p><p>Strider reached out, swooped the cell from its perch on the table beside him and flipped it open. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said into the mouthpiece, \u201cbut your girlfriend\u2019s a little tied up right now and can\u2019t come to the phone.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. A ragged breath and crackling static. \u201cShe\u2019s mine, you sick bastard! If you hurt her...\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. The boyfriend. \u201cIf?\u201d Strider laughed with genuine amusement. \u201cThat\u2019s cute. Really it is.\u201d</p> <p>Now there was a roar. \u201cWhich piece of evil shit are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that this evil shit has your woman. And he isn\u2019t giving her back. Not unless it\u2019s in pieces.\u201d</p><p>More of that static crackled over the line, followed quickly by a loud boom, a curse. Loverboy must have punched the wall. \u201cWhat do you want with her? What will you trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thousand Hunter hearts. Oh, wait. Hunters don\u2019t have hearts. So I guess there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m willing to trade for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dirty, filthy\u2014\u201d The human stopped himself, as if only then realizing Strider could punish his woman for everything he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a good person. She has a family. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anger blasted through him. \u201cI\u2019m a good person. I have a family.\u201d He could just imagine how the Hunter was gritting his teeth at that. \u201cAnd yet she would have taken my head without hesitation. It\u2019s only fair that I reciprocate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t good, and you know it. You\u2019re selfish and dark and ruined. You belong in hell.\u201d</p><p>Selfish? Dark? Yeah, no question. But ruined? Hardly. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing but try to protect myself for thousands of years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd in that protecting\u2014\u201d the Hunter sneered \u201c\u2014you\u2019ve killed my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as your woman killed mine.\u201d Now it was Strider\u2019s turn to punch something. He slammed a fist into the side table, splitting the wood. Boom!</p><p>A feminine gasp had his gaze moving back to his charge. He stilled. She\u2019d stopped thrashing, was staring over at him through blazing gray eyes. \u201cAnd believe me,\u201d he added calmly, \u201cshe will pay for that.\u201d</p><p>No reaction from Hadiee.</p><p>Her boyfriend, however, exploded. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t killed anyone! But I have. Trade her for me.\u201d</p><p>Did he not know her history? It seemed unlikely that the one person who\u2019d succeeded in killing a Lord of the Underworld wouldn\u2019t have become the stuff of legend among her cohorts. \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Strider said. \u201cI like the hostage I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>The Hunter\u2019s fury overtook him, obliterating his common sense. \u201cI will find you and I will kill you, you motherfucking son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Slowly he grinned. \u201cNow that sounds like a challenge. Good news is, I accept.\u201d Inside his head, his demon jumped up and down with excitement. \u201cFind me and we\u2019ll have a little party.\u201d</p><p>Without removing his gaze from the girl, Strider closed the phone, reveling in the fact that he\u2019d had the last word. He stood. Hadiee\u2019s murderous expression didn\u2019t change as he walked to the bathroom. He knew phones could be traced and tracked and wasn\u2019t going to allow that to happen here. Whistling, he crushed the plastic and wires into as many pieces as he could and flushed them down the toilet.</p><p>When he rejoined her, reclaiming his chair at the foot of the bed, he stretched out his legs and anchored his hands behind his head, a pose of smug relaxation. \u201cFeeling better after your rest, darling Hadiee?\u201d</p><p>Surprise darkened those gunmetal eyes. \u201cYou know who I am.\u201d A statement, not a question.</p><p>He answered anyway. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no one calls me that anymore. I\u2019m Haidee now. A minor change in spelling, but a big stride in modernization, don\u2019t you think? Defeat.\u201d</p><p>So. She knew who he was, as well. How did she, but not the boyfriend?</p><p>\u201cOr you could just call me Executioner,\u201d she added, a taunt.</p><p>Rather than strike her as he wanted, he arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019ll just call you Ex, then. Since you and I are going to be intimate, an endearment seems appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Surprise was replaced with anger. Once more, she began thrashing atop the bed, jerking at her ties. Her lips pulled back from her straight, white teeth, and she hissed over at him.</p><p>\u201cTouch me and I\u2019ll peel the skin from your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d touch you that way.\u201d He shuddered. He was not attracted to this female. Not in any way.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d be stupid enough to believe a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re only stupid enough to murder one.\u201d</p><p>No shame. No regret. Only a smile, dark and wicked, that didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. \u201cYou say stupid. I say brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut as I was saying,\u201d he continued past his sudden surge of rage, determined to scare her again, \u201cI plan to intimately acquaint you with my weapons.\u201d</p><p>Funnily enough, that seemed to calm her. \u201cYou can try\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do more than that.\u201d Before she could reply, probably to him again, he switched the direction of their conversation. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze raked over him, and she grimaced in distaste. \u201cYou haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. Thank you.\u201d He flattened a palm over his heart. \u201cThat means so much to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a compliment,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Good. He was getting to her. \u201cOf course it was. I\u2019m gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also a coward,\u201d she snarled. \u201cA real man would have fought someone his own size.\u201d</p><p>He almost grinned. He\u2019d been called worse. Maybe that was why insults like that never affected him. \u201cActually, I\u2019m a very smart warrior. I took the weak link, yes, but now the rest of the chain will wither. Think about it. With your death, the men will go crazy. They\u2019ll be ruled by their emotions. They\u2019ll make mistakes. Fatal mistakes. All I\u2019ll have to do is wait, swoop in and kill them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t flinch at his words. Either she didn\u2019t believe he would actually kill a woman, which was stupid, since he\u2019d done so before and as a Hunter, she had to know that, or she thought herself infallible. Which was...possible, he realized with a sudden blast of dread.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re more than human.\u201d His head tilted to the side as he ran his gaze along her compact little body. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is what you are and how you got that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll never know,\u201d she replied, staunch once again.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, I guess. Even immortals can be cut down.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved the corners of her lips. Smug and satisfied and taunting. And this time, the amusement reached her eyes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Two simple words, but they built a fire inside him that crackled and smoldered, spread and raged. So badly he wanted to stand, stalk to her and choke the life from her. He wanted to hurt her, make her suffer endlessly.</p><p>And he would.</p><p>He\u2019d always been a possessive man. What he considered his was his. Women, cars, weapons, didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t share. Ever. And right now he considered this woman his property and her misery his mission.</p><p>She was his to do with whatever he willed.</p><p>Whatever we will, his demon interjected.</p><p>So. Defeat wanted a piece of her, as well. Maybe Strider could share, just this once.</p><p>He schooled his expression to reveal nothing but calm. He thought perhaps there were red flickers in his eyes, showing just how close to the surface his demon now was, because Hadiee, no, Haidee, no, Ex, paled, blue lines becoming visible beneath her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Inside his head, Defeat laughed, almost giddy, loving that the woman had been intimidated.</p><p>\u201cCapturing you was the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a challenge at all. You\u2019re not much of a warrior, are you? Which makes me wonder why the men keep you around. Because they like to pass you around? Because you managed to kill a Lord, something none of your kind has been able to do again?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cMaybe I let you capture me. Maybe I\u2019m still Bait, and now that we\u2019re together, I\u2019ll lead you into slaughter. But let the men use me? No. I\u2019m with one, and he will punish you for this. You have my word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe word of a Hunter? Sorry, but that means nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019ll beg you to let me go, you think wrong. If you think I\u2019ll cower at your feet, you think wrong. I will prevail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try,\u201d he said, parroting her earlier words to him.</p><p>Her teeth flashed in a scowl. \u201cI\u2019ll do more than that. I\u2019ll give my man your head as a birthday present.\u201d</p><p>Most would have been crying by now. She was brave, as she\u2019d claimed, he would give her that. \u201cClearly you don\u2019t know me well enough. To think you\u2019ll be alive for your lover\u2019s next birthday...well, you are a Hunter. I shouldn\u2019t have expected you to be intelligent.\u201d</p> <p>Tendrils of mist drifted from her nostrils. At first, he thought he was mistaken. But no. That really was mist, crystallizing in front of her face. \u201cOh, I know you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re Strider, keeper of Defeat. I\u2019ve seen your picture, heard tales of your exploits. You burned cities to the ground, tormented innocents then destroyed their families.\u201d</p><p>The reminder caused a muscle to tick below his eye. \u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t done. \u201cYou thrive on challenge. You can\u2019t lose without pain. Well, guess what? I don\u2019t think you can keep me in this room without having to tie me. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re strong enough.\u201d</p><p>What. A. Bitch. She wanted to challenge him, did she? She\u2019d soon learn the error of her ways. He stood, stalked to the bed and withdrew a knife. Surprisingly, she didn\u2019t flinch as he lowered it toward her. She looked...eager. Ready to die.</p><p>What an odd reaction.</p><p>With quick precision, he cut each of the ties. Immediately she tried to bolt toward the door, but he caught her by the waist and flung her back onto the bed.</p> <p>As she gasped, he jumped on top of her, weight smashing her down. She struggled, oh, did she struggle, teeth snapping at him, hands pounding at him, knees whipping a direct pathway to his shaft. Fuck!</p><p>He held on through the pain and dizziness and nausea and soon she tired, panting, sweating, more of that mist wafting from her.</p><p>That chilly mist smelled of...ambrosia, thick, flowery. Addicting.</p><p>\u201cYou really should think before you speak. You haven\u2019t been fed or watered.\u201d Like the animal she was. \u201cYou\u2019re too weak to take me.\u201d</p><p>When she stilled completely, he grabbed her wrists and pinned them above her head. He locked her legs down with his own, and his middle fell more deeply into hers, her body offering him a cradle.</p><p>She was soft, chilled, almost like champagne on ice. And the scent of that ambrosia... He felt his cock thickening, elongating, and growled, suddenly pissed off beyond measure. \u201cSee? Easy,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She looked at him through the thick shield of her lashes, those gray eyes steady, emotionless. \u201cRound one is yours. That hardly matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the loser.\u201d</p> <p>His demon purred with joy. That joy sparked pleasure, and that pleasure washed through him. Ah. That was why he was aroused, he realized; it had nothing to do with the woman. Thank the gods. He wouldn\u2019t be able to live with himself if he lusted for a godsdamn Hunter.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked in that calm, dead voice.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe send a piece of you to your boyfriend, then send the rest of you to my friends.\u201d</p><p>BY THE TIME they reached Lucifer\u2019s palace, Amun was useless and he feared he\u2019d weakened his companions. There\u2019d been other battles with demons, yet Aeron and William had had to fight on their own while protecting him. Now they were bloody and bruised and forced to drag him along.</p><p>His friends would\u2019ve been better off leaving him behind.The new voice in his head...gods, it was worse than any other he\u2019d ever welcomed. So many urges...kill, maim, destroy. Reminded him of his first years with Secrets. So many dark deeds done...so many memories infused with his own.</p><p>One of these new memories filled his mind even then. Three human souls were bared and chained before him, each trembling, crying, begging for mercy. He didn\u2019t have mercy, however. He was too eager for this. His claws sharpened to deadly points and he slowly raked each tip over the two males, sinking deep, cutting skin and hitting bone, letting the female see what would soon be done to her, increasing her fear. Both men screamed, for his claws were tipped with acid.</p><p>That acid burned through the human souls, rotting everything it touched.</p><p>Soon their skin turned to char, and that char spread. That\u2019s when he flipped them over, one at a time, that sweet scent of rot in his nose, and raped them. Their screaming increased, their thrashing increased, and he laughed. Laughed with true glee. Fun, this was always so much fun.</p><p>The woman watched every thrust, helpless, afraid, knowing she was next.</p><p>Soon, he promised her. Finally, he emptied into the second male and turned to the female, already hard again. He was always hard. Always ready. The more unwilling the victim, the better.</p><p>She tried to crawl away from him, but the chain around her neck stopped her. He laughed. Can\u2019t run from me, little maggot.</p><p>No, Amun screamed in his mind. That\u2019s not me. That\u2019s not me!</p><p>He leaned over and vomited, entire body spasming as bile blistered a path through his throat.</p><p>Strong hands patted his back, offering comfort. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Let it out,\u201d Aeron said.</p><p>Once he\u2019d voided his stomach completely, he straightened. Or tried to. His knees finally gave out and not even his friends could hold him up. He was too heavy. A dead weight, boneless.</p><p>They managed to drag him to a gnarled tree and prop him against the jagged trunk. Trees in hell, he thought dazedly. Go figure.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Aeron asked, crouching in front of him.</p><p>Nothing. Groaning, Amun forced his eyelids to remain open. The new voice continued to scream, to make itself known, and the pain in his head increased. But he\u2019d rather feel that pain than see those terrible images.</p><p>He scanned his surroundings, searching for a distraction. The forest was composed of ash and withered foliage. There was no green, no colorful flowers. Only an endless sea of black. Souls had been tormented here.</p><p>He had tormented souls here.</p><p>Oh, gods.</p><p>\u201cTake a moment to rebuild your strength,\u201d William said, motioning to the looming hill where Lucifer\u2019s palace rested. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>Amun followed the direction of his friend\u2019s gaze. Black brick rose from that monochrome sea, two crumbling towers connected in the center to form a giant skull. There was a staircase enclosed by pikes\u2014pikes that held severed human heads\u2014leading to the yawning mouth of that skull, where sharp, yellow teeth hung like a chandelier. He would never make it.</p><p>Just leave me here, he tried to sign.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d succeeded, but William understood him nonetheless. \u201cYou have to go with us. If it becomes necessary, and I pray that it won\u2019t, only you can discover where Lucifer has hidden the girl.\u201d</p><p>And how much worse would Lucifer\u2019s memories be than this demon\u2019s? How much more could Amun take?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here before,\u201d Aeron said to the warrior. \u201cAnya said Lucifer is even afraid of you. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya misspoke.\u201d William had once again carefully blanked his mind, preventing Amun from reading the truth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Knowledge is power, and we need all the power we can get. Look at us.\u201d Aeron waved a hand down his bleeding body.</p><p>He was at the razor-edge of his patience, ready to erupt at the slightest offense.</p><p>\u201cThe reason doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d William snapped. He, too, was gearing for a battle. \u201cHe\u2019ll fight me, just the same as he\u2019ll fight you.\u201d</p><p>Arguing wasn\u2019t helping their cause. Amun held out a shaky hand to be helped up. His knees nearly collapsed again, but two strong arms banded around him, his anchors in the storm.</p><p>Once more, the three of them trudged forward. By the time they reached the top of the hill, they were panting, cursing. There were no demon guards posted at the entrance to the staircase, but then, Lucifer didn\u2019t want to keep them out. The prince of darkness was inside, and he was waiting.</p><p>Up the stairs they climbed, dust pluming at their feet. The door was open. After only the briefest of pauses, they stepped into a wide foyer, where piles of bones rested in each corner. The floor was stained red with blood and sticky with things he didn\u2019t want to contemplate.</p><p>Amun pulled from his friends\u2019 clasps, determined to stand on his own. He wouldn\u2019t hinder them any more than he already had. He was a warrior, damn it. He could do this.</p><p>\u201cBe ready,\u201d Aeron whispered, blades already in hand.</p><p>\u201cBeen ready,\u201d William replied, gripping his own blades more tightly.</p><p>They\u2019d already run out of bullets and had had to dispose of their guns.</p><p>Together, they stalked forward, straight ahead, Amun continually tripping over his own feet. But he did walk, and at the moment, that was all that mattered. Finally they reached a room, scalding orange-gold flames licking each of the walls and fanning heat in every direction.</p><p>His demon sighed. And, if he wasn\u2019t mistaken, uttered the word home. Sickness reclaimed his stomach. Not home, he thought. Never home.</p><p>Focus. There, in the center of the room, was a dais built from brimstone and atop that brimstone was a throne of twisted, jagged metal and horns.</p><p>The prince of darkness reclined in it, calm, unfazed by his expected visitors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt last,\u201d Lucifer said, sipping from a bejeweled goblet. He was well built, with black hair and orange-gold eyes. He would have had a handsome face, one females probably would have melted over, if not for the deadness of those eyes. They gave him away, revealed his evil for all to see. \u201cYou certainly took your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Legion?\u201d Aeron demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No pleasantries? No \u2018how are you doing, dearest master\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d William said evenly. \u201cI\u2019m doing well, thank you, reviled slave.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer popped his jaw before nodding in greeting. \u201cWilliam. I was surprised to hear you had returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell the man what he wants to know, and we\u2019ll leave. Your blood won\u2019t have to be spilled. I know, I know. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Amun concentrated all of his energy on the prince, linking with his mind, staying tuned to his thoughts. At first, there was nothing. Only silence. But Amun continued to push, to dig deeper, and must have finally penetrated some sort of barrier. All at once, an intense wave of hatred hit him. Hatred and fear, as Anya had predicted.</p><p>Mine, mine, mine. You will not take what\u2019s mine.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry my minions treated you so shabbily,\u201d Lucifer said. His tone was just as easy as it had been from the first, as if he wasn\u2019t chanting in his head. \u201cI will, of course, punish them. Though perhaps I\u2019ll be more merciful than you used to be.\u201d</p><p>A vein popped from William\u2019s temple.</p><p>He was still closed off, and Amun didn\u2019t have the strength to mentally reach him. Besides, that might have severed the link to the prince.</p><p>Lucifer\u2019s head canted to the side, and he grinned, his attention shifting to Aeron. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about you, Wrath.\u201d Thoughtful, he tapped his chin. \u201cNo, no. I can\u2019t call you that, can I? You are Wrath no longer. You are demon-free. Would you like to change that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither tell us where the girl is or fight us. You\u2019re boring me, and I have things to do,\u201d William said.</p><p>Lucifer\u2019s attention returned to him, eyes narrowing. \u201cOh, yes. I know exactly what those things include. Seducing the lovely Gilly. Your desire for her grows daily, doesn\u2019t it? Brother. And really, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t stop and visit your Horsemen. They miss you so.\u201d</p> <p>Brother? Horsemen? The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?</p><p>Aeron stiffened, shooting William a shocked and angered glance.</p><p>Lucifer laughed inside his head, utterly pleased with himself.</p><p>He\u2019s trying to divide you, Amun signed, unsure Lucifer had meant what he\u2019d said. Not about Gilly, and not about the Horsemen, Amun knew both were true, but about the familial connection. Unfortunately, neither warrior noticed him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying, of course,\u201d William said smoothly. Or tried to. His voice trembled just a bit. \u201cI\u2019ve never touched Gilly, and I never will. I\u2019m not into jailbait. And the horsey comment doesn\u2019t deserve a response.\u201d</p><p>One dark brow arched in smug amusement. \u201cWhatever you say. Now, let\u2019s begin with the night\u2019s entertainment and rid you of your boredom. Shall we?\u201d He clapped his hands, the sound echoing through the surrounding blaze.</p><p>To the left, two demon High Lords entered the room. If their grins were any indication, they\u2019d been waiting eagerly for their summons. Between them was Legion, shoulders hunched, pale hair in bloody tangles around her head. She\u2019d been stripped and chained, and there were welts along her thighs where she\u2019d been whipped.</p><p>Knowing he couldn\u2019t afford the distraction, Amun blocked her thoughts. But not before he caught a glimpse of them. Oh, the terrible things that had been done to her...so much worse than what the minion of Pain had shown him, for that creature had only witnessed portions of her torture.</p> <p>She might never recover.</p><p>She was as cut and bruised as he was, and there was a desolation in her eyes that had never been there before. But when she caught sight of Aeron, she began to struggle, to scream, worried for him, hopeful for herself. \u201cAeron! Aeron!\u201d</p><p>The demons held tightly, and Aeron tried to stalk forward, but William gripped his arm and held him in place.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer was watching Aeron, eating up his reaction, loving the paleness of his skin, the grinding of his teeth. \u201cNothing to say, warrior?\u201d</p><p>Aeron nodded. \u201cYou will die for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Another stiff nod, as if he didn\u2019t trust himself to speak again.</p><p>Amun felt the surge of disappointment that filled the prince. He\u2019d wanted Aeron to rant and rave. But, no matter, Lucifer thought, and Amun almost pulled from the being\u2019s mind. He retained the connection, sick to his stomach, churning with dread. Lucifer wasn\u2019t going to be deterred. What he had planned was sure to drive Aeron to the brink of madness. Aeron, stupid Aeron, who had ruined his plans to possess Legion and destroy the Lords.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get started with the festivities,\u201d Lucifer said smoothly. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>SCARLET WAS experiencing the five stages of grief. All at the same time. Denial\u2014Gideon hadn\u2019t been writhing in pain when she left him. Anger\u2014her bitch of a mother had ignored her summons, over and over again, so she hadn\u2019t made it back to the heavens to begin tracking Mnemosyne. Bargaining\u2014Let Gideon finally win his war, she\u2019d prayed to no one in particular, and I\u2019ll forget about my revenge against my aunt. He\u2019d be safe and Scarlet wouldn\u2019t be a liability. Depression\u2014she would never see the beautiful warrior again, she just knew it. Acceptance\u2014she\u2019d done the right thing, leaving him. He would be better off.</p><p>Tears burned her eyes, but she hastily wiped them away. Only a day had passed, but she missed him terribly. And like an addict in need of a fix, she was still in Budapest, close to him. Close enough to climb the iron fence that surrounded his fortress and saunter up to the front door, knock, grab him when he opened said door and kiss him.Only reason she\u2019d resisted was because she\u2019d barely gathered the strength to walk away the first time. No way could she do so a second time.</p><p>Idiot. Frustration and desperation joined her other emotions. She would have tried to summon someone besides her mother for a ticket into Titania, but none of the gods, Greeks or Titans, liked her. Or if they did, she didn\u2019t remember. Fucking Mnemosyne.</p><p>Return to Gideon, Nightmares pleaded. I\u2019ll be good, I swear.</p><p>Her demon had experienced the five stages of grief as well, but kept returning to bargaining. You\u2019ve always fancied him. Why? I don\u2019t understand. You fancy no one.</p><p>He...belongs to me.</p><p>She wished. I\u2019m no good for him. But she wanted to be. Gods, did she want to be.</p><p>He might not be her husband, she might not have any history with him, but she had come to...like him this past week. And he had come to like her. She knew he had. He\u2019d tried to talk her into staying. He\u2019d told her that he wanted more from her than a single bedding. And oh, gods, hearing those words had nearly crushed her resolve to leave.</p><p>But in the end, she\u2019d known leaving was her best and only option. She\u2019d also known she\u2019d had to close the door on them completely. Otherwise he might have come after her. Until her mother and aunt were dead, they had to remain apart. As long as Rhea lived, Gideon was vulnerable. As long as Mnemosyne lived, Scarlet was vulnerable. Or rather, her mind was.</p><p>And if her mind was vulnerable, that meant Gideon was in danger. She could be convinced to hurt him, kill him, or even be persuaded that he was determined to hurt or kill her. She would attack him, and he didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>He was a good man. A strong and gorgeous good man, and she\u2019d caused enough turmoil in his life. But if, after her mother and aunt were dead, he still wanted to try to make a relationship work, she would be willing, she decided. However, she doubted he would want to try. There\u2019d been frustration, desperation, anger and sadness in his eyes as she\u2019d abandoned him. And pain. So much pain.</p><p>She\u2019d cried as she\u2019d exited the fortress. Cried harder as she\u2019d slunk into this underground crypt. The moment she\u2019d reached the bottom, she\u2019d closed her eyes and entered dreamland. Still crying.</p><p>She\u2019d been tempted to find Gideon. In fact, all of her strength had been needed to resist. Only thing that had saved her from doing so was, ironically enough, her aunt. Scarlet had forced herself to visit the woman and wait outside the doorway to her consciousness.</p><p>Though she\u2019d waited and waited, the bitch had never fallen asleep, and by the end, Nightmares had been a writhing cauldron of hunger. Scarlet had then given the demon free rein, and a tormenting spree had quickly ensued, shaping the dark dreams of thousands. Including Rhea\u2019s.</p><p>That, Scarlet had enjoyed, taking special care to present her mother with her greatest fear: losing to her husband.</p><p>Now, sleep was upon Scarlet again, and she was again waiting outside her aunt\u2019s doorway. If she couldn\u2019t reach Mnemosyne this time, she was going to draw Mnemosyne to her. And have a little fun in the process. That\u2019s why she had removed the butterfly necklace Gideon had given her. So that she could be found. Soon...</p><p>She had to wait several hours, but this time Mnemosyne\u2019s door creaked open...only to snap shut so quickly she couldn\u2019t sneak inside. Well, well. Her aunt was fighting slumber. Soon, though, the goddess of Memory would lose. They always did.</p><p>All the while Nightmares\u2019s hunger grew more intense, just like before.</p><p>Just a little longer, she told her companion.</p><p>The fiend whimpered inside her mind, and the shadows and screams that had been a part of her for thousands of years, so much so she hardly noticed them until Gideon aroused her to madness, intensified, too. Seeking release. Seeking a target.</p><p>I promise, she added. If she had to allow another tormenting spree, she would.</p><p>Finally, though, the wait paid off.</p><p>Mnemosyne drifted, her doorway opening halfway and allowing Scarlet to dart inside before it could close again. Which it was in the process of doing. She latched onto the sweet, shining dream even then trying to form and tugged, dragging her aunt deeper and deeper into that state of bliss. Luring her... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dream continued, her aunt now unable to wake.</p><p>Mnemosyne saw herself on the heavenly throne, queen to gods and mortals alike. She issued orders that were instantly obeyed, and poems were composed about her beauty. Though she was mistress to Cronus in reality, Cronus wasn\u2019t the man she truly desired. That honor belonged to the Titan god of Strength, Atlas. He was a handsome man with dark hair and eyes a darker shade of blue than Gideon\u2019s, and he sat at her right-hand side, worshipping her.</p><p>So tranquil the scene was, so hopeful.</p> <p>Scarlet wanted to scream. Her aunt didn\u2019t deserve such accolades, even in her dreams. Not after everything she\u2019d done. Not after the pain she had caused.</p><p>Scowling, Scarlet held out her hands and began wiping away the background. Atlas was the first to go, then the golden throne, then the palace. Thorns and fire sprouted in their place. She placed Mnemosyne in the center of those scorching flames, watching as they licked her aunt\u2019s body, burning away her skin, her beauty.</p><p>Mnemosyne shrieked in terror, in utter agony. So real was the dream, her skin would be melting in reality. It wouldn\u2019t kill her, Scarlet wouldn\u2019t allow the flames to last that long, but it would horrify the bitch to see herself in the morning. To see her pretty looks gone and a revolting hag in her place. Yes, that skin would regenerate. But until it did... Scarlet laughed.</p><p>Nightmares danced inside her head, loving every moment of this. More!</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d With only a thought, Scarlet dismissed the blaze.</p> <p>Moaning, her aunt fell to the ground, her knees too weak to hold her up. Scarlet walked to her, unhurried, rearranging the scene with every step. The plain gray walls of Tartarus formed, followed by the many cots that had filled their shared cell. Next, Cronus and Rhea appeared, arguing in a corner.</p><p>Lastly, Scarlet added herself. Bedraggled, dirty, a slave collar around her neck, and hair in tangles to her waist. When she\u2019d reached adulthood, her mother had stopped arranging for her head to be shaved. Allowing Scarlet to be pestered by other prisoners had been more important to Rhea than being the fairest in the realm. The guards hadn\u2019t wanted to help Scarlet, either, and getting her hands on a blade had been impossible. Cutting it had become a luxury and one of the first things she\u2019d done upon her release.</p><p>In the vision, she pressed her back against the bars and peered down at her aunt.</p><p>\u201cRemember this?\u201d she asked. \u201cOur centuries of slavery?\u201d</p><p>Mnemosyne barely had the strength to look up, but look up she did, hate glinting in her eyes. She was laboring for every breath, and tears were streaming down her ruined cheeks. Those salty droplets had to sting.</p><p>\u201cEither you find me,\u201d Scarlet told her, crouching down to her level and cupping her chin despite her aunt\u2019s flinch to avoid contact, \u201cor I come to you every time you fall asleep. If you thought the flames were bad, wait until you see what I have planned next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Mnemosyne choked out. Strands of hair were charred to her skull, her cheeks sunken, some of her bones visible. \u201cCronus will kill you when he sees what you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she smiled. \u201cGood. I look forward to his attempts. Meanwhile, enjoy your first taste of tomorrow\u2019s entertainment.\u201d</p><p>With that, Scarlet threw her aunt to the wolves. Literally.</p><p>GIDEON LASTED three days. Three damn days. Once he\u2019d regained his strength, he\u2019d helped fortify the fortress, had snuck into town on several occasions to hunt for Hunters, had found a few stragglers, interrogated them, hadn\u2019t learned anything, and had killed them.</p><p>Now, he was going after Scarlet.Her memories of him were her own creation, and yeah, she now knew they were false memories. Fake or not, though, she had constructed some really good times between them. And she had to want him still. Even though she\u2019d thought he had left her in prison, even though she\u2019d thought he had betrayed her with countless women, she had come to Budapest for him.</p><p>He could do no less for her.</p><p>The simple fact was, he loved her. Loved her with every breath in his body, every cell in his blood, every bone and organ he possessed. He loved her to the depths of his very soul. Had only taken five minutes after she\u2019d walked away to realize it.</p><p>She was strong and courageous, she understood him in a way no one else ever had. She teased him and never seemed annoyed that he couldn\u2019t tell the truth. No, she was amused.</p> <p>She was beautiful and fit him perfectly. He couldn\u2019t think straight when she was gone because he could only think of her. Could only wonder where she was and what she was doing. Wonder if she missed him, needed him, thought of the pleasure they\u2019d brought each other and could bring each other again.</p><p>All he had to do was find her.</p><p>No, Lies said on a sigh of contented agreement. No, thank you.</p><p>No thanks needed, buddy.</p><p>Where was she? Determined, Gideon massaged the back of his neck. He could reason this out. Scarlet wanted to destroy the goddess of Memory; the last person to see the goddess had been Cronus. In the heavens. Only immortals who could flash or had wings could enter on their own, and neither applied to Scarlet. So she would have needed help.</p><p>She would have known Cronus wouldn\u2019t aid her. She would have then turned to her mother, as she\u2019d done when looking for Gideon. Except, would the god queen help her again? Scarlet was now bent on her destruction, as well.</p><p>So, probably not.</p><p>Who did that leave?</p><p>Damn it. He could think of no one. Which put him right back at square one. She\u2019d never mentioned a friend or ally.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, though. He was still going after her. If he had to tear the world apart, he would. And there was someone who could give him a starting place.</p><p>Gideon strode to Torin\u2019s room. Before he could raise his hand to knock, his friend called, \u201cEnter.\u201d Cameras, he realized, and wanted to smack himself on the head. Should have thought of this before.</p><p>Excitement suddenly overwhelmed Gideon. Maybe tearing through the planet wouldn\u2019t be necessary. Shaking now, he twisted the knob and stepped inside, then shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cExpected you before this,\u201d Torin said, swiveling in his chair. Twined hands rested on his middle, and that should have made him the picture of relaxed male. Only, his cheeks were flushed, his eyes were glassy and he couldn\u2019t quite catch his breath.</p><p>Behind him, one of the computer screens played a YouTube video titled House of Witches\u2014A Peaceful Night at Home.</p><p>Gideon saw women. Lots and lots of sexy women. Some were drinking champagne\u2014from the bottle\u2014some were dancing provocatively, but all were laughing uproariously.</p><p>\u201cShow \u2019em what you got, Carrow!\u201d someone called.</p><p>A black-haired stunner with green eyes came into sizzling focus and simply lifted her top, flashing a buxom pair of breasts as she shouted, \u201cWhoohoo!\u201d Then she paused with her chest still bared and said, \u201cPost this without sharing the profits, and I\u2019ll cut off your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Torin swung around, pressed a few buttons, and the computer screen went blank. \u201cI thought I\u2019d turned that off,\u201d he muttered as he once again faced Gideon.</p><p>I\u2019m not even gonna ask. \u201cSo, uh, how isn\u2019t everyone today?\u201d All the Lords checked in with Torin at least once a day, so Gideon decided to get business out of the way before he made his \u201cI\u2019m outta here\u201d announcement.</p><p>\u201cAlive. That\u2019s all I know. Though Strider texted me to say he would soon be coming home with a \u2018prezie\u2019 for everyone.\u201d</p><p>A present? His curiosity was piqued, but Gideon only nodded. \u201cListen, there\u2019s not something I need to tell you about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there.\u201d Torin held up a hand. \u201cNo need to bungle through something in a language I\u2019m still having trouble deciphering. Like I said, I expected you before this. I heard about your \u2018wife\u2019 and I\u2019m honestly surprised you lasted this long. Kane, Cameo and I have got things under control here. Since Strider took a page from Gwen\u2019s book and played Goodbye Trachea with everyone surrounding the fortress, no one\u2019s tried to attack us, and I\u2019ve seen nothing to indicate that anyone will in the near future. So go get your woman. If you can convince her to join us, everyone will stop running to me and begging me to talk some sense into you and lock her up. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s tried to hurt us, anyway, you know?\u201d</p><p>Relief speared him so intensely he almost dove into his friend for a bear hug. \u201cI hate you, man. You don\u2019t know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Torin grinned, all pearly whites. \u201cNow that I have no trouble deciphering. I hate you, too. But get all thoughts of hugging me out of your head. Yeah, I can tell you want to. I\u2019m not the hugging type. I really will kill you with kindness.\u201d</p><p>Might be worth it. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, you know,\u201d he said in all seriousness. \u201cHug you, I mean. Wouldn\u2019t plant a big wet one right on your lips, either.\u201d Which meant he totally would. Because really, he would still be able to kiss Scarlet. Yeah, he\u2019d be infected and that would infect her, but neither of them would die from it, and then neither of them would ever be able to touch anyone else.</p><p>He liked the thought of having Scarlet all to himself.</p><p>The keeper of Disease puckered up. \u201cIn that case, don\u2019t let me stop you. It\u2019s been a while, so I\u2019m desperate. Even you look good at this point.\u201d</p><p>Gideon wasn\u2019t sure Torin had ever been kissed, but found himself grinning, as well. \u201cYou are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies!\u201d a hard voice shouted from outside, echoing from Torin\u2019s speakers. \u201cLies! I know you\u2019re in there. Come out right now. Come out and face me, you mangy coward!\u201d</p><p>Amusement fading, Torin swung around and eyed the computer monitors. Gideon edged in beside him for a closer look and what he saw astonished him. Galen, keeper of Hope, leader of the Hunters, was hovering outside the fortress, white wings flapping frantically.</p><p>Usually the warrior wore a pristine white robe. To better match the angels and gods, Gideon suspected. Today, that robe was covered in soot and blood and frayed at the hem.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t kill me,\u201d the keeper of Hope shouted, arms splayed, blades gleaming in both hands. His pale hair stood on end, and his sky-blue eyes were wild. There was a fanatical glint in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was this a dream? Nothing like this had ever happened before. Galen operated in the shadows, always sending humans to do his dirty work. But the warrior had never, never openly challenged the Lords.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s completely sane, right?\u201d Gideon asked. The guy was batshit crazy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s singled you out.\u201d Torin typed furiously at his keyboard. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any Hunters on the ground that I can see. Still, I wouldn\u2019t trust him not to have backup hiding somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLies! Either you come out here and fight me or I burn your home to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has to be a trick,\u201d Torin insisted. \u201cOr he would have already tried to burn us to the ground, rather than simply threatening to do so.\u201d</p><p>Trick or not, Gideon couldn\u2019t miss this opportunity. Capturing Galen could end the war with the Hunters. Successfully. And ultimately, that would eliminate one of the threats against Scarlet.</p><p>\u201cI can try to shoot him down,\u201d Torin said, \u201cand you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d If Torin missed, the bastard might run away. Again. \u201cDon\u2019t let me do it. My aim\u2019s not better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLies!\u201d</p><p>Torin nodded. \u201cJust to be safe, I\u2019m texting Kane and Cameo. I\u2019m telling them to head into the forest and ensure you aren\u2019t ambushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Now don\u2019t tell our friend I\u2019ll be out in five.\u201d</p><p>Torin nodded again and rushed to comply.</p><p>Gideon raced to his bedroom. He was already swathed in weapons since a warrior could never be too careful, but he grabbed his RPG and a grenade and grinned. He hadn\u2019t gotten to use this baby in a long, long time, Sabin having deemed it too dangerous to fire off with innocents around.</p><p>Today, there were no innocents around.</p> <p>He sprinted to the side of the fortress that Galen occupied and hunkered down at the highest window, placing him above the Hunter. Galen was watching the ground, expecting him to emerge from the front door. Fool. As quietly as possible, Gideon raised the window-pane and edged the end of the barrel between the slit in the curtains.</p><p>\u201cLies!\u201d the frantic immortal shouted. \u201cCoward! Face me, damn you!\u201d</p><p>Coward? No. He was smart. Gideon loaded the grenade in front, rested the heavy launcher on his shoulder, aimed, held steady, held, grinned again as Galen appeared in the crosshairs, and squeezed the trigger.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Strong as Gideon was, he was propelled backward with the force of the grenade, but he straightened quickly and surveyed his handiwork through the smoke left behind.</p><p>He\u2019d hit his target, tossing Galen several yards, spinning him through the air, and causing an explosion of fire and soot in the sky. That would have killed a mortal. Galen, however, was cut and bruised and now missing a hand\u2014payback was a bitch\u2014but he wasn\u2019t out for the count.</p><p>He just looked pissed.</p><p>With a roar, the now-flaming warrior propelled himself through the window in the next room over. Glass shattered, and there was a grunt, then pounding footsteps rained. Gideon palmed two daggers and darted into the hall, the portraits and freshly polished tables blurring at his sides.</p> <p>He met his enemy in the middle of the walkway, flying to the ground in a punching, kicking, stabbing heap. Galen\u2019s wings were broken, and his mangled wrist was gushing blood that soaked into Gideon\u2019s clothes, warm and wet. There was a smoking hole in his shoulder where the rocket must have hit first, yet his strength was undisturbed. Determination would do that.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t take my head,\u201d the keeper of Hope roared, swinging with his good hand. He\u2019d managed to maintain a hold on his blade and now sliced the side of Gideon\u2019s face. His cheek split open, and his own blood began to gush.</p><p>With a roar of his own, Gideon slashed his knives forward. One cut at Galen\u2019s neck, slicing to spine, and the other at his uninjured shoulder. This man had been his friend for many years, yet he\u2019d been Gideon\u2019s enemy for thousands more. No love remained. No fond memories.</p><p>They would end this. Here, now.</p><p>Galen flailed for breath, clutching at his now-open neck. Gideon disengaged and stood, panting, sweating, bleeding, staring down at the man responsible for so much of his suffering.</p><p>Had Galen not existed, he never would have thought to steal and open Pandora\u2019s box. He would have remained in the heavens, a soldier to Zeus. Perhaps he would have finally noticed Scarlet and freed her as she\u2019d dreamed. Perhaps they would have lived happily ever after.</p><p>Or perhaps he would have been locked away when the Titans escaped Tartarus. Then again, perhaps the Titans wouldn\u2019t have escaped if he and the other warriors had been there. But that didn\u2019t matter. What was done, was done. Now, he had a chance to make things right.</p><p>In the background, Gideon could hear the thump of two pairs of boots and knew Kane and Cameo were running to help him. He laughed. So simple, so easy this seemed. This man had eluded him, caused trouble from afar, but had been taken down in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Life just didn\u2019t get any better than that.</p><p>He raised his blade. One more strike, and Galen would be out for a long, long time. Time the Lords could use to decide whether or to not kill him and free his demon. Time for Gwen, his daughter, to say goodbye.</p><p>Of course, that was when Rhea, the god queen, suddenly appeared in a flash of bright azure light. She was pale and shaky, her face tight with a scowl. Had she been watching the entire time?</p><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d she cried. \u201cHe is my warrior. Mine. You were not to hurt him. But now...now you will pay.\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, Gideon found himself swept from the fortress and imprisoned inside a four-by-four cage, bars on every side, above and below, and looking into a palatial bedroom of velvet and marble. Ambrosia scented the air, and paintings of Titan gods decorated the walls. There was a four-poster bed with a lacy pink canopy, and a crystal chandelier that hung from the ceiling by a single vine of ivy. That ceiling, however, was clear and domed, and peered into a lovely blue sky.</p><p>Shit! Victory, gone. Defeat, his. All in a blink. He almost couldn\u2019t believe it. Hoped this was only a dream. A nightmare of Scarlet\u2019s creating. But deep down he knew she wouldn\u2019t do that to him. This was real. He had lost.</p><p>Be careful what you wish for, he thought bitterly. He\u2019d wanted someone to take him back to the heavens so that he might search for Scarlet, and now he was there. Only, he was at the god queen\u2019s mercy.</p><p>Not that she had any.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>GIDEON WAS left alone in the cage for several hours. Alone in the bedroom, too. He didn\u2019t have to wonder where Rhea was, though; he could guess. She was with Galen, seeing to his health. He\u2019s my warrior, she\u2019d cried. Mine. You were not to hurt him.</p><p>What he did wonder about was whether or not he was trapped in something akin to the Cage of Compulsion that Lucien was in the process of hiding, where the prisoner was compelled to do whatever the owner of said cage wanted. He\u2019d rather cut out his heart than become Rhea\u2019s slave.He wanted her head on a platter. A platter he would then gift to Scarlet as a token of his affection. Scarlet...</p><p>Where was she? What was she doing? He would speculate every day until he saw her. It wasn\u2019t that he was worried about her, either. The girl could take care of herself better than anyone he\u2019d ever met. He simply missed her. She was a part of his life now. The best part.</p><p>He wanted to create new memories with her. Real memories, better than the ones she\u2019d woven herself. He wanted to be there for her and make up for all the years he\u2019d ignored her while she rotted in Tartarus.</p><p>First, though, he had to escape this fucking hell hole.</p><p>\u201cRay!\u201d he shouted, shaking the bars. Gods, he reminded himself of Galen. Frantic, desperate. \u201cRay!\u201d</p><p>Once again, a bright azure light filled his line of vision. Gideon remained on his knees, though he hated to do so. But there was no room in the cage, and standing wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>Rhea appeared in the center of the bedroom, her pretty features tired and tight, her dark hair in tangles. No more gray, he realized. She wore a white robe that was stained with blood and soot. So yep, she\u2019d been with Galen.</p><p>\u201cYou rang?\u201d Hate and smugness mixed in her tone, creating a timbre that scraped at his ears. \u201cSo eager for your punishment?\u201d</p><p>He knew no one would be swooping in to rescue him. He\u2019d tried to remove his butterfly necklace, which blocked his whereabouts from all immortals, but somehow, some way, the metal had been fused together and now refused to part. He couldn\u2019t even lift the links over his head.</p><p>Rhea\u2019s doing, he was sure.</p><p>His guess? She didn\u2019t want Cronus finding him or even knowing what she did to him.</p><p>She waved her hand through the air and, shockingly, the bars around him disappeared. Since the bars behind him had been holding him up, he fell to his ass. Gideon was quick to recover, though, and jumped to his feet. He didn\u2019t have a weapon, as those had been magically removed.</p><p>\u201cSmart of you,\u201d he remarked. She was as much a fool as Galen.</p><p>\u201cLunge at me, I dare you,\u201d she replied, remaining in place. Her teeth were bared, as if she couldn\u2019t wait to rip into him and work off a little steam.</p><p>He would have loved to accommodate her. He wanted her head on that platter, after all. But he wasn\u2019t Strider, and he didn\u2019t have to respond to every challenge. He didn\u2019t have to give the bitch what she wanted. Besides, he didn\u2019t know what powers she possessed, didn\u2019t know what she was capable of, but he did know what her husband could do and if she were anything like him...Gideon shuddered. He would lose before the fight even began.</p><p>\u201cWell, coward? Just going to stand there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He turned his back on her, heard her insulted gasp of breath and strode to the other side of the room as if he hadn\u2019t a care. He stopped in front of a vanity, lifted a perfume bottle to his nose and sniffed. Grimaced. Did she actually wear this shit? It was potent, like bat wings mixed with eye of newt.</p><p>\u201cI have removed all the exits, so wipe all thoughts of escape from your puny mind. You\u2019re as trapped in this room as you were in the cage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Truth. Lies hissed inside his head. \u201cSounds wonderful.\u201d He replaced the perfume and lifted a brush. Several strands of hair were intertwined in the bristles.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, wonderful? It\u2019s terrible, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was possessed by the demon of Lies, she just hadn\u2019t connected the dots yet. Oh, the fun he could have with her, he thought, cutting off his grin before it could form.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not curious about why you brought me here and what you plan to do with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHa! I know better. You\u2019re seething with curiosity.\u201d</p><p>He merely shrugged as he tossed the brush back onto the vanity surface, watching as it skidded and crashed into a jar of green paste. Clearly Rhea cared about her appearance. \u201cActually, I\u2019m seething with worry for Galen. Please tell me he\u2019s recovered, oh, beautiful queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar! You don\u2019t care about Galen.\u201d He never heard the woman move, but in the next instant, she was behind him, claws digging into his neck and whipping him around. \u201cYou hate him, want him dead. Well, guess what? You didn\u2019t get your wish. He\u2019s alive, and he will heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p> <p>She popped her jaw, eyes glittering. \u201cHe begged me to kill you. I told him no, that I had other plans for you.\u201d</p><p>Again, truth. Lies hissed at her. \u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she released him. But not for long. All too soon, she returned her hands to him, but this time, the action wasn\u2019t born of anger but of determination.</p><p>\u201cThink yourself unflappable, do you? Well, let\u2019s see what we can do about that. Let\u2019s make you more comfortable.\u201d Her voice had become husky with sensual promise.</p><p>Hell. No. Scarlet was the only woman he wanted to bed. But he couldn\u2019t move away from Rhea. Somehow, she had pinned his feet in place. Relax your expression, boy. Don\u2019t let her know she\u2019s getting to you.</p><p>One of her fingers traced the center of his T-shirt and the material burned away, the cotton smoldering completely and leaving his chest bare. His skin remained cool to the touch.</p> <p>Oh, yes, she was powerful.</p><p>\u201cWow. Thanks.\u201d Calm, smooth. No way would he let her know just how much he hated this. \u201cThis does feel better.\u201d</p><p>Bewildered, she stepped back, widening the distance between them. \u201cI thought you liked my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed with suspicion. \u201cWhat game do you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo game.\u201d A grin lifted the corners of his lips.</p><p>For a long while, she simply stared at him, gauging. Then she squared her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. You love her. I can tell. But let\u2019s see how long that lasts, shall we?\u201d Gaze never leaving him, she reached for the scooped bodice of her robe and tugged. The material split down the center, drooped from her arms and fell to the floor, leaving her utterly naked.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s molars ground together. He could just imagine his confession to Scarlet, because no way would he try and keep something like this a secret. He wanted no secrets between them. Ever. And besides, better she hear this from him than her bitch of a mother who would skew the facts. Hey, devil, your mom\u2014you know, the woman you love so much\u2014didn\u2019t disrobe in front of me and I didn\u2019t see her wax preference.</p> <p>He\u2019d deserve another fork to the chest.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Rhea smoothed her palms over the jagged butterfly tattoo gracing her breasts and shoulders, then down her sides, over her perfectly curved hips and then inched around to the apex of her thighs, where her fingers dabbled at the fine tuft of dark hair.</p><p>Every bit the coward she\u2019d accused him of being, he peered up at the domed ceiling, watching as fluffy white clouds drifted by. Dread bloomed in his veins and spread through his entire body. He could guess where this was heading.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk. Your tone suggests you\u2019re lying again, but we both know you desire me. And soon Scarlet will know it, too.\u201d</p><p>Motherfucker! His guess had been right, then. She planned to rape him. And it would be rape, because there was no way he\u2019d consent. Then she would tattle to her daughter. Mother of the Year Award, meet Rhea. Or not.</p><p>Once again, Rhea reached out and touched him. Her fingers danced over the waist of his pants and those, too, burned away, smoldering as they fell, yet leaving his skin cool, unaffected.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that so much bett...er.\u201d A growl of frustration escaped her.</p><p>No doubt she\u2019d just seen his flaccid cock. Little Gid would not be responding to her in any way. He almost laughed. Almost. \u201cI hope you feel really good about this,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout what you\u2019re planning. After all, you haven\u2019t hurt Scarlet nearly enough over the years. And I\u2019m sure she\u2019s deserved everything you\u2019ve done to her. \u2019Cause she never loved you, did she? Yeah, you should be real proud of yourself, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>With every word he uttered, the queen stiffened a little more. \u201cFinished?\u201d She scraped a nail down his chest, drawing blood this time. Red sparks lit her eyes, revealing the demon she tried so hard to hide.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Only a few weeks ago, Gideon had learned that Rhea was keeper of the demon of Strife, that she fed off conflict. She couldn\u2019t blame her demon, though. She\u2019d been this much of a bitch before her possession. Look how she\u2019d treated his beautiful Scarlet in prison. What\u2019s more, she could have controlled her darker impulses, but had simply chosen not to. He and his friends were proof of that.</p><p>Reyes\u2019s demon, Pain, had once wanted to hurt everyone it encountered. Reyes had learned to turn that desire inward, cutting himself to save others.</p><p>Maddox\u2019s demon, Violence, had once wanted to erupt at every cross word, every accidental touch. But Maddox had learned to hold the rage inside himself.</p><p>Lucien\u2019s demon, Death, had once wanted to steal the soul of every human it encountered. Lucien had learned to wait until those humans died before acting on the impulse.</p><p>Gideon could go on and on. Every demon-keeper had trials and struggles, but they\u2019d done whatever was necessary to tame their beasts, to corral those darker urges. Rhea could\u2019ve done the same, but she hadn\u2019t. She preferred to create discord, even among those she was supposed to love and protect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve figured it out,\u201d Rhea suddenly said with a half smile. \u201cYou say the opposite of what you mean. You think Scarlet is innocent. You think I should coddle her. What you don\u2019t know is that she has plotted and planned to destroy me and take my crown. From the very beginning! She even slept with my husband. Your leader.\u201d</p><p>Lies. All lies. His demon purred with pleasure, even as Gideon fought a rage like he\u2019d never known before. Not with Scarlet, never Scarlet, but with Rhea. How dare she utter such things about his woman. And yeah, Gideon totally got the irony.</p><p>He was tempted, so tempted, to yell at this woman, to tell her his true feelings about her and about his precious Scarlet. He wanted her to know and was more frustrated than ever that he couldn\u2019t say his thoughts outright. Had he not needed to keep his strength around her... But he did. For Scarlet.</p><p>Rhea\u2019s head slanted pensively as she reached up and dragged one of her nails along the curve of his jaw. He jerked away from her touch, but not before it burned him, searing his skin and leaving a raw, open wound.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. Look who\u2019s willing to believe the best of such a disappointing brat. Stupid of you, but admirable. Perhaps one day you\u2019ll realize your mistake and give me that loyalty.\u201d</p><p>Never. \u201cTotally possible.\u201d</p><p>She laced her arms around him and pressed her nakedness into his. His cock, of course, remained flaccid. That didn\u2019t deter her, though. She nipped at his bottom lip and rubbed against him, knee sliding up and down his thigh. \u201cMy daughter thinks to ruin me in my dreams, you know. I can feel her outside my mind, waiting. But she\u2019ll learn better than to challenge me. Do you want to know how, my darling boy?\u201d</p><p>Gods help him.</p><p>\u201cEvery time she invades my dreams, you will make love to me.\u201d A slow, eager smile lifted her lips. \u201cAnd believe me, you will.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, though not the way she clearly wanted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rather die.\u201d You raging psycho.</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I\u2019m not allowed to kill you, just as my husband isn\u2019t allowed to kill my Hunters. But there are other ways to ensure your cooperation.\u201d</p><p>He. Would. Fucking. Strangle. Her. With his feet still planted on the ground, he leaned into her, allowing his weight to hit her full force. Because she hadn\u2019t thought to pin his hands, he reached for her, intending to close his fingers around her fragile neck. His hands met some type of invisible block.</p><p>A tinkling laugh escaped her. \u201cSilly demon. No harm can befall me inside this room. Why else would I stay here? Now, let me show you why you\u2019ll be making love to me whenever I wish....\u201d One step, two, she backed away from him, forcing him to straighten.</p><p>Grinning, she spun in a quick circle. He would have laughed at her cluelessness\u2014grinning? really?\u2014but when she faced him again, she was no longer Rhea. She was Scarlet, and the shock was like a punch in the gut. Suddenly he was looking at Scarlet\u2019s lovely face. Scarlet\u2019s black eyes. Scarlet\u2019s bloodred lips. Scarlet\u2019s flawless skin. Scarlet\u2019s taller and stronger frame. And his body responded!</p><p>His horrified study intensified as he desperately searched for an imperfection. Shit, shit, shit. They were the same. Fuck, they were\u2014 No. Wait. Rhea lacked Scarlet\u2019s tattoos. Those amazing, lick-right-here tattoos. So, okay. All right. Fine. He could deal with this. They weren\u2019t the same. Down, boy.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like?\u201d She even spoke in Scarlet\u2019s raspy voice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He liked. Fuck, he liked. He\u2019d been so hungry for Scarlet, so damn hungry. And now, here she was, his for the taking. No tattoos, no Scarlet. Don\u2019t forget.</p><p>\u201cNot even when I do this?\u201d Watching him as she moved, Rhea slid her fingers up the flat plane of her belly, cupped her breasts and pinched her nipples, hardening them to little pearls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No tattoos, no Scarlet. No fucking tattoos, no fucking Scarlet. Still. His body continued to react, unable to help itself. To his cock, this was his woman, soon to be his wife. He hoped. And his cock hungered for her desperately, had been without her for too long.</p><p>Not Scarlet, not Scarlet, not Scarlet, he told the traitor frantically, willing the blood to leave his growing erection.</p><p>Lies loved it, though. Loved knowing Rhea was living a lie. The demon had never been so excited, in fact.</p> <p>You begged me to force Scarlet to stay. Now you\u2019re willing to betray her?</p><p>Scarlet. Love Scarlet.</p><p>A lie. But...but... You said she was yours.</p><p>She is. Isn\u2019t.</p><p>What the hell? Damn you. We\u2019re on Team Scarlet. Do you understand?</p> <p>Sure, sure, was the reply.</p><p>Which meant, Lies was not on Team Scarlet.</p><p>What the hell? he wondered again. Was everyone conspiring against him?</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d Rhea treated him to another grin, but there was an evil twinkle in those dark eyes, something Scarlet had never directed at him. \u201cLet\u2019s stop playing games, and start on the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She regally waved her hand through the air, a prelude he was coming to dread, and Gideon suddenly found himself lying on the bed, stretched out, again pinned in place and unable to move. He was like a rag doll, being tossed wherever the queen desired him, and he was sick of it.</p><p>\u201cListen, sweetheart, you\u2014umph.\u201d</p> <p>Rhea had whisked herself on top of him, her knees straddling his waist. Once again, she looked like herself and his body, as well as his demon, deflated. Thank the gods.</p><p>So you\u2019re on Team Scarlet again? he asked Lies.</p><p>Yes. No.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand you.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon. This is going to be fun.\u201d Rhea\u2019s smile didn\u2019t fade. In fact, she grinned all the wider. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, and motioned to the right.</p><p>Dread thrummed through him as he turned his head. He saw...nothing and frowned. Why had she\u2014 No, wait. Tiny white lights were flashing just in front of the mattress, growing, linking together, and then Scarlet was there. The real Scarlet.</p><p>She was dressed completely in black. Black T-shirt, black leather pants, black boots. Even black leather bracelets. Her hair was anchored in a low ponytail, revealing the graceful length of her neck. A neck that didn\u2019t sport a butterfly necklace.</p><p>She spotted Gideon with a grinning Rhea on top of him and gasped in shock, in horror.</p> <p>\u201cDevil,\u201d he shouted, but she disappeared in the next instant, gone as if she\u2019d never been there. \u201cBitch,\u201d he then shouted at Rhea, and Lies roared inside his head. Pain exploded through him, followed quickly by that hated weakness. He grimaced, shook, hated, hated...hurt.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t help himself. He was filled with so much hate, so much regret, so much rage, he couldn\u2019t stop the words from flowing from him. \u201cI will kill you. I planned to anyway, but now you\u2019ll suffer at my hand. You\u2019ll regret all the ways you\u2019ve harmed your daughter.\u201d More pain, more weakness.</p><p>Finally, Rhea\u2019s smile fell away. Her skin even leached of color. She inched down his body until she hit the end of the mattress and had to stand. Her knees must have been shaking because she swayed.</p><p>\u201cY-you are lying again. I know you are.\u201d</p><p>Before Gideon could reply, another voice rang out. \u201cWe have much to discuss, woman.\u201d</p><p>As the still-naked Rhea whipped around in dismay, Gideon\u2019s gaze\u2014which was narrowing and darkening with every second that passed\u2014moved to the center of the room. Cronus had appeared, and he had brought a...female? Yes, definitely a female. Her skin was charred to black and her hair had been burned away, but the delicacy of her bones was evident. A little too evident.</p><p>Perhaps Gideon moaned. Perhaps the god king merely sensed him. Either way, Cronus\u2019s focus swung to him, and the king sucked in an astonished breath. His eyes narrowed to tiny slits of fury.</p><p>\u201cSo. We have more to discuss than I realized. You think to use one of my warriors.\u201d Hard, yet devoid of any emotion. \u201cAfter we agreed not to travel that road.\u201d</p><p>Rhea raised her chin, a white cloak appearing out of nowhere and wrapping around her. \u201cHe loved every minute of it, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he looks ready to vomit.\u201d Cronus, too, raised his chin.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to admonish me for my actions when my sister, your mistress, stands beside you.\u201d Her gaze brushed over the trembling female. \u201cWhy did you burn her?\u201d She sounded surprisingly upset at the sight, despite the fact that her sister was sleeping with her husband. \u201cDid she fall out of favor?\u201d</p><p>Her sister. That soot-covered skeleton was the goddess of Memory, Scarlet\u2019s aunt, then. The shit-infested day was suddenly looking up.</p><p>Gideon threw himself from the bed. He didn\u2019t have the strength to stand, could only scoot his way toward the woman, planning to grab her and hold on until he could find a way home.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t burn her,\u201d Cronus snapped. \u201cYour daughter did. But this should be a private conversation. Gideon, I trust you\u2019ll guard Mnemosyne until such time as I can retrieve her. After all,\u201d he added with a pointed glance at Rhea, \u201cI doubt she\u2019s in any condition to follow in her sister\u2019s footsteps and seduce you.\u201d</p><p>Rhea screeched an unholy sound, and as Gideon reached up to cover his already hurting ears, he found himself lying on his bed in his bedroom. NeeMah was on his floor, his to do with as he pleased, apparently, since a slave collar now circled her neck.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he shouted, praying Cronus would hear and that the king would stab his queen through her rotted, black heart.</p><p>With this latest truth, his demon roared and his pain tripled, burning through him like fire. Darkness winked over his vision, but he threw himself to the ground and crawled to NeeMah.</p><p>She whimpered and tried to scramble away.</p><p>\u201cNo reason to want to escape, darling. You\u2019re in for a treat.\u201d Maintaining a grip under her arms, he stood to shaky legs and began dragging her to the dungeon.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>THAT BITCH! was the first thought to hit Scarlet as she awoke. Fuming, she bolted upright. Rhea had finally whisked her out of Budapest and into the heavens. Where she\u2019d seen her naked mother straddling her naked boyfriend. Then Rhea had tossed her somewhere sunny. Where, Scarlet didn\u2019t know. All she\u2019d known was that the abrupt switch from dark to light had utterly confused her demon. Unlike the ambrosia field, time did exist between the two locations.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten the barest glimpse of speeding cars and towering buildings before her eyes had shut of their own accord and her mind had sunk into a deep, undisturbed sleep.Now she was in a freaking hospital, she realized as her gaze circled her surroundings. She must have passed out on a busy sidewalk, no one had been able to revive her, and so they\u2019d taken her in for medical care. Shit!</p><p>A heart monitor beeped beside her. Electrodes were attached to her chest, and an IV protruded from her arm. The medical staff had replaced her clothes with a paper-thin gown and removed her weapons. Local police would most likely come around to talk to her about that, too, and damn it, she didn\u2019t need that right now.</p><p>Damn it, she thought again. Motions clipped, she jerked out the needle, blood seeping from inside her elbow, and ripped away the cords. The monitor went crazy, shouting loud and long as she threw her legs over the side of the gurney.</p><p>Footsteps pounded, and then a short, plump female was rounding the corner and flying into Scarlet\u2019s room. When she spotted Scarlet sitting up, about to stand, the tension left her features, but she extended her arms to push Scarlet back down.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, ma\u2019am, you need to be careful.\u201d She spoke in English, no hint of an accent. I\u2019m in the States, Scarlet realized. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know what was wrong with you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, and I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Determined, she brushed the woman aside and stood. Her knees were weak and almost buckled, but she pressed her weight into her heels and steadied herself, even as a wave of dizziness hit her.</p><p>What the hell had they been pumping into her vein?</p><p>Strong hands settled on her shoulders and applied pressure. Having none of that, Scarlet again knocked the woman\u2019s arms aside. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d Her butterfly necklace was in the pocket of her pants, and she wanted it back.</p><p>The human clearly wasn\u2019t used to being challenged; she paled as she backed away, palms raised and out. \u201cYour clothes are with your arsenal.\u201d</p><p>Yep. Those weapons had gotten her into trouble. \u201cAnd where\u2019s my arsenal?\u201d</p><p>Eyes of light brown narrowed. \u201cWith the police.\u201d Hard, firm tone. \u201cThere\u2019s an officer here who\u2019s been waiting to talk with you, so I suggest you lie back down. You shouldn\u2019t be up and around. We\u2019re still running tests, trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>Shit, she thought again. If her clothes were locked away in some police station, getting them back would take a lot of time and effort. Time and effort she didn\u2019t have. \u201cLook, nothing\u2019s wrong with me except my clothes and belongings have been stolen. Now where the hell am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorthwestern Memorial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What city?\u201d</p><p>The nurse blinked at her. \u201cChicago.\u201d</p><p>Why the hell had her mother sent her here?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to get your doctor and let her know you\u2019re ready to be discharged,\u201d the nurse said. Of course, Scarlet knew she was lying. Thanks to Gideon, she considered herself a living lie detector now. The nurse was going to summon the officer.</p><p>Scarlet allowed the woman to leave the room without protest. The moment she was alone, she kicked the shadows out of her head. They wrapped around her, cuddling her close, enveloping her with impenetrable darkness. Well, impenetrable for everyone else. No one would be able to see her, but she could absolutely see everyone and everything.</p><p>Rather than leave, however, she pressed against the wall, right by the doorway. Just in time, too. The officer, who was in his early twenties, physically fit and determined, came barreling down the hall, coffee in hand. He haphazardly slapped that coffee on the counter of the nurses\u2019 station without slowing his step, his other hand remaining on his gun handle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scarlet gasped in horrified realization. He was a Hunter. The tattoo on his wrist, a symbol of infinity, wasn\u2019t just for decoration. It was his mark, his vow to kill those who were demon-possessed.</p><p>That\u2019s why her mother had flashed her here. There was probably a contingent of Hunters based here.</p><p>Her stomach twisted. At least Rhea hadn\u2019t flashed her into the middle of that contingent. Which had to mean, on some level, that Rhea held her in some affection.</p> <p>Wishful thinking, and you know it. Most likely, Rhea had just misjudged the distance.</p><p>When the man reached Scarlet\u2019s room, he flew past the door, just as Nurse Tattletale had, his expression resolved. He stopped and growled when he realized he was alone.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>None of the nurses were willing to approach and respond.</p><p>Had Rhea had time to tell him who Scarlet was? What Scarlet was? Probably not. Otherwise, there would have been more than one Hunter waiting for her to awaken, and this one wouldn\u2019t have left her. Even for a second. So why was he here?</p> <p>There had probably been a report about her appearing out of nowhere, she realized, and he probably wanted to know how she\u2019d done it.</p><p>Renewed anger sparked in her chest, easing the sting in her stomach. She\u2019d fallen asleep in front of humans who could have done anything they wanted to her, and she wouldn\u2019t have been able to defend herself. Yet another sin to punish her heartless mother for.</p><p>As the officer radioed for assistance, then shouted orders to the hospital staff to lock all the building\u2019s doors, Scarlet slipped into the hallway, doing her best to remain in the shadows so that her shadows blended in.</p><p>Making her way outside proved uneventful. There was simply no way to lock the E.R. exits, since wreck victims were being wheeled in. Sunlight waned, creating a purple sky, the evening fragrant with summer blooms. Crickets chirped, and cars zoomed on the nearby road. An ambulance was blaring its sirens as it pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>Scarlet headed toward that lot with every intention of stealing a car. But where should she go? Her aunt was too weak to find her now. She couldn\u2019t get to the heavens to slap her mother around, couldn\u2019t block her location from the gods, so she could be found by any of them at any time and tossed into another Hunters\u2019 den.</p><p>Gideon wasn\u2019t home, so he couldn\u2019t\u2014</p> <p>Gideon. Her hands fisted. Did his friends know where he was? And who he\u2019d been doing? Her nail sharpened, cutting into her palms. Slow down. Are you sure he was having sex with your mother? He didn\u2019t look like a man lost in pleasure.</p><p>Scarlet thought back and frowned. Sure, both Gideon and her mother had been naked. And sure, her mother had been straddling his waist. And okay, yeah, there\u2019d been no promises between her and Gideon. She\u2019d told him things were over, finished. In his mind, he\u2019d been free to do whatever or whoever he wanted. But there\u2019d been panic in his eyes. Panic and pain and fury.</p><p>What if he hadn\u2019t been there of his own free will?</p><p>She gulped, afraid to hope. And she hated herself for even wanting to. He could be in serious trouble.</p><p>But his reaction would explain why her mother had flashed Scarlet there to witness the deed and then shooed her away before Gideon could say anything. What better way to hurt her than to \u201csteal\u201d her man?</p><p>The very hope she feared suddenly grew wings and fluttered through her. If she was wrong about what had happened and he truly did want Rhea, she would...what? Kill them both? Try and remind him how good it had been between them?</p><p>No. That still wasn\u2019t an option. Was still too dangerous. Besides, after everything that had happened, Gideon deserved a long and happy life.</p><p>Finally, Scarlet knew what she had to do to save him, to give him that long and happy life. And she would have rather chewed off her leg. Because now an eternity of suffering awaited her.</p> <p>GIDEON SAT in front of the dungeon\u2019s cell, peering inside at NeeMah, who was still mostly charred. However, pale hair had sprouted from her scalp, and new skin was forming on her face and limbs. She should have regenerated completely by now, but the slave collar, which prevented her from using her godly powers, had slowed her healing process considerably.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wearing a collar, but his healing process seemed slowed, as well. After two days, he was still weak himself, and had barely made it through the fortress and down the steps to get here\u2014where he had remained\u2014but his determination had spurred him onward. He would get answers for Scarlet.\u201cYou will\u2014not\u2014\u201d he dropped the volume of his voice for the word not, hopefully making NeeMah hear only what he wanted her to hear \u201c\u2014answer everything I ask. If you do\u2014not\u2014I will torch your healing skin.\u201d And that wasn\u2019t a boast. He would do it. With a smile.</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d NeeMah said. She lay on a cot, her hands resting under her cheek. Her lids opened, revealing the whites of her eyes, a startling contrast to the black smudges circling them. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He was used to torturing Hunters for every scrap of information, so her easy compliance threw him a little. He\u2019d thought he would have to burn her at least once to prompt her into her first reply. That he hadn\u2019t...His suspicious nature peeked past his determination\u2014and disappointment. Charbroiling her might have been fun.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you\u2014not\u2014tormented Scarlet all these years?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Her voice was ragged, raspy from smoke. \u201cYou aren\u2019t her husband.\u201d</p><p>I want to be. One day, I will be. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d uttered quietly \u201c\u2014answer the question\u2014\u201d yelled viciously. He held up a lighter.</p><p>She flinched, even whimpered. \u201cBoredom,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cFavors for my sister the queen. Why else?\u201d</p><p>Truth. He hated himself just then, because, in a way, he was just as much at fault for Scarlet\u2019s treatment as her aunt. How many times had he entered Tartarus? Countless. Why hadn\u2019t he noticed Scarlet? The woman, not the child. If he had, there were a thousand things he could have done to protect her.</p><p>Namely, he could have moved her to a private cell. He could have killed both Rhea and NeeMah, or, at the very least, warned them what would happen if they didn\u2019t stop tormenting her. Yet he hadn\u2019t noticed the lovely woman she\u2019d become and so he\u2019d done nothing.</p><p>How could he not have noticed her? Just how stupid and blind had he been? She was the most important person in his life.</p><p>He truly didn\u2019t deserve her, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop him from trying to win her.</p><p>\u201cIs there a way to undo the damage you\u2014\u201d he lowered his voice to whisper softly \u201c\u2014didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d then let his voice return to normal \u201c\u2014cause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can remove all her memories.\u201d</p><p>Which was what Scarlet wanted. Not Gideon, though. He wanted Scarlet as she was. But he also placed her wants above his own and would do whatever was necessary to make her happy. Even that, he realized now.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t stop him from trying to romance her all over again.</p><p>\u201cWill I erase her memories, though?\u201d NeeMah continued, somehow stronger now. \u201cNo. Believe me, it\u2019s better to have Scarlet as an enemy than Rhea.\u201d</p><p>And yet she had become Cronus\u2019s mistress. Perhaps, though, that had been at her sister\u2019s request, a way to keep tabs on the man. Interesting. Amun would be able to discern the truth, which was why Cronus had wanted the warrior\u2019s aid in the first place.</p><p>\u201cAnd to be honest,\u201d NeeMah added, almost as an afterthought, though she couldn\u2019t conceal the clenching of her teeth, \u201cafter what Scarlet just did to me, I would rather die than aid her.\u201d</p><p>As that was NeeMah\u2019s only other option, she might just get her wish. She would change her mind, though, the moment he approached her with the lighter and a can of gasoline. He was sure of it. But he didn\u2019t threaten her again. There was no need. Scarlet wasn\u2019t here, so why force the issue just yet?</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014doesn\u2019t\u2014her mother hate her?\u201d he asked, raising and lowering his voice as needed.</p><p>NeeMah rolled to her back, hissed in a pained breath. \u201cMy sister can\u2019t help herself. She thought she loved Scarlet\u2019s father, and yet he was only using her. He had a wife of his own and cast Rhea aside as soon as he learned of her pregnancy. Then the Greeks captured the Titans and threw us in prison, preventing her from gaining revenge against the foolish mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2014didn\u2019t\u2014blame Scarlet?\u201d Bitch. He flicked the lighter on, off, as he waited for her reply, daring her to refuse him.</p><p>\u201cNot at first. At first, she loved the infant. Or rather, loved the infant as much as she was able. But as Scarlet grew, looking so much like her father, Rhea\u2019s love died. And it didn\u2019t help that Scarlet was growing into such a lovely woman. Rhea had already had so much taken from her. Her throne, her power, her freedom. To no longer be considered the fairest in the realm was a blow her ego could not tolerate.\u201d</p><p>Because of vanity, she\u2019d practically gift wrapped her daughter for the monsters trapped inside their cell. Calling the woman a bitch, he realized, had been an insult to bitches.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Gideon longed to return to Rhea, a knife in hand. He would slit her throat without any hesitation\u2014then spit on her lifeless body. On. Off. Flames sparked, died. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, when Strife was paired with her,\u201d NeeMah continued shakily, \u201call of her feelings intensified. Her hate, her jealousy, her need to prove herself. She was compelled to cause trouble. As you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were given a demon.\u201d A statement, not a question. Not once had her eyes flickered with red. Not once had he seen a flash of undiluted evil behind her face. Oh, there was evil, all right, just not the demonic kind.</p><p>She replied anyway. \u201cNo. I was spared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Not,\u201d he finished in a whisper. On. Off.</p><p>\u201cZeus chose who was paired with what demon, and each pairing was determined out of spite. A punishment of sorts. I had done nothing to harm him. Nothing he recalled, that is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Truth mixed with smug superiority.</p><p>Lies hissed.</p><p>Zeus had told some of the Lords why they\u2019d been given their demon. Lucien received Death because he\u2019d opened Pandora\u2019s box, nearly leading to the demise of the world. Maddox received Violence because he\u2019d killed the most soldiers in his quest to reach the box. Paris had seduced Pandora to distract her, therefore he\u2019d received Promiscuity.</p> <p>Why, though, had Gideon been given Lies? He\u2019d been a good warrior for the king. He\u2019d helped steal Pandora\u2019s box, yes, but his part had been minimal because he\u2019d felt so damn guilty for betraying his creator.</p><p>With that line of thinking, another question arose. Why had Scarlet been given Nightmares?</p><p>Lies began to purr.</p><p>Gideon frowned. Why purr? That spoke of affection. I thought you were over Scarlet, you fickle bastard. Not mine, Lies said. Which really meant, All mine.</p><p>You can\u2019t do that, you little shit. You can\u2019t keep changing your mind like that, wanting her one minute, discarding her the next. Not mine.</p> <p>I should ask her demon to\u2014</p><p>NOT MINE.</p><p>Wait. What? Her...demon?</p><p>NOT MINE.</p><p>His eyes widened as everything finally slid into place. Had the two demons been...lovers while inside that box? Or maybe inside hell?</p><p>The purring increased in volume, and he could only shake his head in wonder. All this time with his demon, and he hadn\u2019t realized such creatures could form connections like that. But Lies and Nightmares must have done so.</p> <p>That explained so much. Why Lies had wanted to stay with Scarlet, but hadn\u2019t cared about Scarlet herself. Why Lies had been willing to do something abhorrent to him, like tell the truth, just to keep Scarlet nearby. Why Lies had responded to Rhea when she\u2019d looked like Scarlet. The demon had only seen the packaging and had assumed Nightmares was inside.</p><p>Perhaps Zeus had known of the connection. Perhaps Zeus had also known of Scarlet\u2019s desire for Gideon. Perhaps he\u2019d given Gideon the demon of Lies as a...gift.</p><p>And you were trying to find a way to kill him. He might just owe the deposed king a big fat thank-you. He would rather kiss Scarlet, though. Damn it, where was she? What was she doing?</p><p>Would she go for his throat the next time she saw him? She thought he was screwing her bitch of a mother, after all. Or would she try to avoid him for the rest of eternity?</p><p>Even if she wanted to, she wouldn\u2019t be able to do so. She was tracking NeeMah and would eventually discover that the woman\u2019s trail led here. So they would meet again. He would just have to make sure he was prepared. Fingers crossed she didn\u2019t kill him while he slept or remove his head before he\u2019d had a chance to explain.</p><p>Fingers crossed she even wanted to hear his explanation.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of memory loss...I think it\u2019s funny that you and Scarlet met again.\u201d</p><p>NeeMah\u2019s voice drew him from his thoughts, and he arched a brow at her. \u201cNot\u2014\u201d whispered \u201c\u2014again?\u201d Loudly.</p> <p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember\u2014\u201d she smiled at that, fleeting, but there all the same \u201c\u2014but you came looking for her once. Well, a little boy you discovered was actually a girl. She was grown by then and you clearly liked what you saw.\u201d</p><p>Fire ignited in his chest, then spread to his limbs. At first, Gideon didn\u2019t know why. Then he realized Lies was storming through him, so agitated the turmoil seeped into Gideon. Why? \u201cDo you remember?\u201d the goddess asked him.</p><p>He remembered that little boy, and now knew that had been Scarlet. Yet he didn\u2019t remember ever encountering an adult version Scarlet. Had his memory been screwed with?</p><p>\u201cAnyway, for some reason, you never returned. You left her there.\u201d She offered him another false grin. \u201cSuch a pity.\u201d</p><p>He hopped up, panting with the force of his sudden rage. On. Off. On. Off. She had screwed with him.</p><p>\u201cOh, do you wish to remember? Give me your hand, and it\u2019s done. Even with my collar, I can get inside your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d he snarled, gripping the bars, shaking, the lighter clinking against the metal.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, clearly thinking there was nothing he could do. She sat up, gaze never leaving him. \u201cOne day? What will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014I will\u2014\u201d Nothing sounded violent enough.</p><p>\u201cWill you kill me? Will you torture me? What can you truly do to harm me? Tell me I\u2019m ugly? Tell me I\u2019m powerless? Do it, then. And see how I punish Scarlet in turn. We both know she\u2019ll return for me. I\u2019ll convince her to hate you. I\u2019ll convince her to kill you. I\u2019ll convince her to sleep with man after man. I\u2019ll convince her to kill herself. And there\u2019s nothing\u2014\u201d</p><p>A roar, loud and long, echoed between them. Through out the entire tirade, Lies had prowled and paced, a caged predator filled with rage. At the mention of Scarlet\u2019s death, the demon had erupted.</p><p>Before Gideon knew what was happening, the demon exploded from his body, a dark vision of scales and horns and bones. Of evil.</p><p>NeeMah yelped with horrified panic as the fiend chomped at her\u2014before disappearing inside her. She jerked, hunched over. Whimpered. Soon, tears began streaming down her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so ugly,\u201d she cried. \u201cSo powerless. I\u2019m unworthy of life. Oh, gods, I\u2019m so unworthy.\u201d</p><p>All the things she\u2019d taunted Gideon with, things she hadn\u2019t ever believed of herself. But now, with the demon convincing her that the lies were the truth, she believed, and it was tearing her up inside.</p><p>He could only watch, his own rage easing in the shadow of his combined shock and fascination. Lies had actually left him. Left him. And was now obviously prowling through NeeMah\u2019s head, making her believe the lies about her beauty, her strength. How the demon had done it, he didn\u2019t know. Why the demon hadn\u2019t ever left him before, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>How the demon remained sane and Gideon alive, he didn\u2019t know, either.</p><p>Minutes later, when NeeMah was a sobbing puddle on her cot, her entire body shuddering, the demon returned to him and settled inside his head, purring with more of that satisfaction.</p><p>How did you do that? he asked, dazed.</p><p>I know.</p><p>The demon had no idea, then. Why did you come back?</p><p>Aren\u2019t tethered to you.</p><p>Holy hell. Can you do it again?</p><p>I know.</p><p>Let\u2019s find out. \u201cYou might want to buckle up,\u201d he told the goddess as he grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re about to have a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>DRY, BRITTLE foliage reached out from the plethora of trees, slapping at Strider\u2019s cheeks, scratching his skin and darkening his already black mood. He had Hadiee, aka Haidee, aka Ex, roped to him and leading the way, taking the brunt of the branch-slaps as she grumbled and complained and called him all manner of names. \u201cBastard\u201d was the kindest.</p><p>Back at the hotel, he\u2019d lain on top of her, vowing to hurt her worse than she\u2019d ever been hurt, but in the end, he hadn\u2019t cut her into small pieces, hadn\u2019t even scratched her, and he was pissed as hell about it.He\u2019d raised his blade to do so. To take a finger at the very least. She deserved it for killing Baden. But she\u2019d gazed up at him with such courage, such challenge, wanting him to end her it seemed. So he\u2019d stayed his hand. No way would he give her what she wanted.</p><p>As if she sensed the direction of his thoughts\u2014and hell, maybe she did. She was immortal now, but he didn\u2019t know how she was or what she was\u2014she shouted over her shoulder, \u201cYou should have killed me, you stupid moron!\u201d Her gray eyes gleamed. Her skin was flushed and dewy with sweat\u2014that actually resembled tiny beads of ice\u2014and her pink hair was plastered to her temples.</p><p>Even worn-out, she was a lovely sight. Thank the gods \u201cbeautiful bitch\u201d wasn\u2019t his type. \u201cAnd end your suffering? Ha! Keep moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to suffer. If you think I\u2019ll keep my fury to myself, you\u2019re stupider than you look. And you look endlessly stupid! I plan to tell you about every damn thing that bothers me. Starting with the insects. They\u2019re eating me alive!\u201d</p><p>For half an hour, she complained about the damn bugs. Only took five minutes, though, for his ears to start bleeding from the shrillness of her voice.</p><p>\u201cTime-out,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe\u2019ve been walking for hours, and I need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime in. We\u2019re close to where I want to be. No resting yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime-out. Or are you too scared to rest for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>Scared? It was a challenge to prove himself, and one his demon accepted.</p><p>Scowling, Strider stopped abruptly. Ex didn\u2019t realize this and kept moving until the rope around her ankle\u2014a rope that was tied to his wrist\u2014ran out of slack and jerked. She tumbled to her face, quickly rolled over and glared up at him.</p><p>His scowl became a grin as he dropped his backpack at the base of a tree and flopped beside it. \u201cFine. Time-out.\u201d</p><p>Ex remained on the ground, though she sat up and pulled her knees to her chest. \u201cBastard,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cTouch your ankle and I\u2019ll cut off your hands.\u201d An empty boast\u2014maybe\u2014but she didn\u2019t know that. \u201cAnd here\u2019s another bitch-slap of truth, little girl. From now on, every time you challenge me, I will view it as an invitation to have sex with you.\u201d Nothing would disgust her more, he was sure.</p><p>The rosy flush abandoned her cheeks. \u201cWarning received.\u201d</p><p>Good. Now. Since they were resting \u201cfor a few minutes,\u201d he might as well make the best of it. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He unzipped his pack and withdrew a box of Red Hots.</p><p>Ex spotted them, and her eyes nearly bugged out of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what you brought for field rations? You idiot! Stupid is too generous a word for you. Candy won\u2019t sustain us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d He tossed a mouthful past his lips, chewed and closed his eyes at the delicious taste. Maybe even moaned.</p><p>When he next looked at her, she was frowning and holding out her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sure you want some? These are only for idiots too stupid to bring proper field rations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me.\u201d</p><p>He dumped a few of the precious candies into her shockingly chilled palm before he could change his mind about feeding her, then shook as many as he could fit into his mouth. Again, his eyes closed in ecstasy. Cinnamon. There was no better taste. Even females couldn\u2019t compare. Unless they tasted like cinnamon, but he\u2019d never met one who did. Not naturally, at least.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we going, anyway?\u201d Ex grumbled.</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cNone of your damn business.\u201d He said it pleasantly, yet left no room for argument.</p><p>Truth was, he was taking her to Budapest. Only, he was taking her the long way. Through forest and desert and anything else that struck his fancy. Anything that would break her down, weaken her and force her to rely on him. Not to mention, get her boyfriend off his trail.</p><p>Right now they were on the newly risen island of the Unspoken Ones, making their way to the temple, but staying away from civilization.</p><p>After all, he\u2019d been on his way to visit the Unspoken Ones when Ex and her friends had interrupted him, and he saw no reason to change his plans on her account. Besides, this way he had the added benefit of showing Ex what a true monster was.</p> <p>They\u2019d frighten her, she\u2019d realize Strider wasn\u2019t as bad as she\u2019d thought and be grateful he\u2019d kept her safe. Soon she would trust him to always see to her protection. She would open up and tell him everything he wanted to know about her and her Hunter pals. Since he obviously didn\u2019t have the stomach to kill her\u2014now, at least, and that still dropped him right into a shame spiral\u2014he might as well use her. And then betray her. Just as she\u2019d betrayed Baden.</p><p>When Strider finished with her, when she trusted him completely, he might just send her back to her people. After they knew how disloyal she had been to them, that is. Then they could kill her.</p><p>To gain her trust, though, he couldn\u2019t be too nice to her. Not in the beginning at least. She would become suspicious. Besides, he wasn\u2019t that good an actor. He hated this woman, and the thought of being nice to her grated his every nerve.</p><p>\u201cGot any water?\u201d she asked in that whining, complaining voice.</p><p>Gra-ted. \u201cYeah.\u201d He grabbed one of the bottles of water he\u2019d brought, twisted off the cap and drained most of the contents while she watched. A whimper escaped her, and he squeezed the bottle a little too hard, crackling the plastic.</p><p>\u201cWell? Are you going to share or not?\u201d</p> <p>With a forced shrug, he tossed her what was left. \u201cThat has my cooties,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>\u201cGood news is, I\u2019m up-to-date on all my shots.\u201d She drained the contents in seconds, then peered over at him, clearly irritated with what little he\u2019d given her.</p><p>\u201cBe grateful I gave you any at all,\u201d he said with feeling.</p><p>\u201cEvil bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurderous bitch.\u201d Stop. This isn\u2019t the way to win her over. Who cares if she becomes suspicious thanks to sweet behavior?</p><p>Win her over, Defeat commanded. Win. Win. Win.</p><p>Great. His demon saw winning her as a challenge. It was a challenge he hadn\u2019t needed, but there was no way around it now. He had to convince her to\u2014he almost growled\u2014like him.</p><p>Motions clipped, Strider dug through the backpack until he found the dehydrated meat he\u2019d brought. He pulled out a bag of it, as well as another bottle of water, and tossed both to the girl.</p> <p>She caught them easily, realized what they were and grumbled, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...welcome.\u201d Ugh. That hadn\u2019t been fun to say. Actually tasted like ash on his tongue.</p><p>Silent, he watched her as she ate. Dirt smudged her face, and there were tiny scratches along her jaw. Bugs had bitten her neck, leaving swollen, pink circles. Her clothes were wet with perspiration and just as dirty as her face.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t any of that detract from her loveliness?</p><p>She probably made a deal with the devil. Like Legion. Unlike Aeron, he wasn\u2019t willing to die to save her. \u201cHow long have you been dating your man?\u201d</p><p>Dark lashes lifted, and then gunmetal eyes were peering into his soul. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll tell you. But answer a question for me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d answer honestly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Truth. No reason to lie about that.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so,\u201d she said with a smugness that irritated him.</p><p>Strider popped his jaw. What? She didn\u2019t think he was good-looking enough to catch a female? She didn\u2019t think anyone could tolerate him for long periods of time? Well, she was mistaken. He didn\u2019t have a girlfriend because he didn\u2019t want one. His demon fed off the challenge of winning their hearts, but once that was accomplished, the demon\u2019s attraction was gone.</p><p>And then, of course, the females would try and challenge him in other ways. Ways he hated. Bet you can\u2019t spend the entire day with me and enjoy yourself. Bet you won\u2019t call me every night for the next week. It was just better for everyone involved if he kept things temporary.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long have you been dating your man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven months.\u201d</p><p>Seven months? In human years\u2014something akin to dog years\u2014that was a very long time. \u201cSo why haven\u2019t you guys gotten married?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as she stuffed the last piece of jerky into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You wanted to, but he didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she said stiffly, \u201che wanted to, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Interesting, and unexpected. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you? Just using him for sex?\u201d</p><p>The flush returned to her cheeks, softening her features, making her more than beautiful. Making her appear vulnerable...sweet. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>There was a tightening in his chest. One he didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t want to contemplate. You aren\u2019t attracted to this woman.</p><p>\u201cNot to change the subject\u2014and by that I mean I\u2019m ready to change the subject. Do you remember killing me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d All those centuries ago, he\u2019d slammed his blade into her stomach, raging over what she\u2019d done to Baden. Then, when she\u2019d doubled over, he\u2019d taken her head. \u201cMind telling me how you\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. \u201cNo guilt for your actions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Do you feel guilty for what you did to my best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought so. And that...bothered him. It shouldn\u2019t have bothered him. He knew who and what she was\u2014for the most part. Snuffing out evil was her ultimate goal, and she\u2019d considered Baden evil. Would it have killed her to pretend remorse, though?</p><p>Frowning, he zipped up his bag and stood. \u201cTime in. Again,\u201d he barked. Then cringed. He hadn\u2019t meant to sound so harsh.</p><p>Ex didn\u2019t rush to obey. In fact, she stared up at him for a long while, hands rubbing up and down her calves.</p><p>\u201cUp,\u201d he said more gently, tugging at the rope. But there was too much give in that rope. Somehow she had managed to cut it, even though he\u2019d never seen her fingers near it. And she certainly hadn\u2019t been gripping a knife. Not one that he\u2019d been able to see, at least.</p><p>\u201cTime out.\u201d Grinning, she kicked out her leg with more force than someone her size should have been capable of, swiping his ankles together and knocking him to the ground. Like a bolt of lightning, she streaked off.</p><p>Catch, catch. Win, win, Defeat shouted as Strider leaped to his feet and darted after her. You\u2019re losing. You must win.</p><p>As he sprinted, he reached for the Cloak he\u2019d strapped to his chest, hiding it there because he\u2019d known the last thing Ex would want to do was feel him up. Only, it wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>That...bitch! Somehow, she\u2019d stolen it. Just like with the rope, he had no idea how she\u2019d done it. He only knew he had to catch her. Before she reached her boyfriend.</p><p>SO LOUD...so terrible. Amun was somehow on his feet, gripping a blade. William and Aeron were on each of his sides, pinning him in to protect him. A new horde of demons surrounded them\u2014they\u2019d already fought the first and second lines of defense\u2014some small, some big, but all of them determined. Their thoughts...totally focused on blood and pain and death.</p><p>Taste, they thought. Hurt. Kill. They swiped at the warriors with their claws, biting at them with poisoned fangs, kicking and hitting, laughing and taunting.The battle itself had been raging for hours. Maybe days. Perhaps years. Each man was exhausted, cut, bleeding, shaking, at the edge, probably in agonizing pain, and every time they killed a demon, three more took its place. But they refused to give up.</p><p>Amun tried to help them, but every time he moved, every time he reached out to slash one of the creatures, a new voice entered his mind and grew in volume, new images flashing inside his head\u2014rapes, more tortures, more killings\u2014nearly driving him to his knees.</p><p>Through it all, Lucifer sat upon his throne, watching, grinning, Legion at his feet. Every so often, he would pet her head as if she were a favored dog. And when she would try and rise, desperate to help Aeron, the prince of darkness would dig his claws into her scalp and hold her down until she whimpered her surrender, blood trekking down her temples.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much more I can take,\u201d Aeron gritted out.</p><p>\u201cArm...hanging...by...thread,\u201d William replied. He wasn\u2019t exaggerating, either.</p><p>Must help them, Amun thought. The air was hot, draining what little remained of his strength. And the smoke...gods, all he wanted to do was cough. Cough until he finally hacked up enough intestine to die.</p><p>Although, that might not be necessary. The scent of death clung to every inhalation, stinging his nostrils, promising a reckoning. Very, very soon.</p><p>Push through. Ignore the voice, the images. Only reason the two warriors were still standing, despite the poison probably working through them from those demon bites, was that they\u2019d drunk the rest of the Water of Life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If this didn\u2019t end soon, the water would lose its potency and nothing would save them.</p><p>Can\u2019t let them die. Him, yeah. He welcomed an end. But not his friends. Never his friends. With a roar, Amun raised his arm, blade at the ready. And yes, the voices and images grew in intensity, but he didn\u2019t let either stop him this time. He plowed forward, out of the protective embrace of his friends, and slashed. Slashed and slashed and slashed. Demon after demon fell, grunting, groaning, bleeding at his feet.</p><p>By the time he reached the center of them, he was dripping with their fluids, his eyes burning, his mouth filled with the taste of rot, but still he didn\u2019t stop. And soon, he didn\u2019t want to stop. The images...yes, he wanted to kill. He wanted to maim.</p> <p>He cut off a demon\u2019s arm and grinned. He snapped a demon\u2019s leg in two and laughed. He removed eyeballs, tongues, even private parts, and laughed all the harder. This. Was. Fun.</p><p>Fear sparked in their crimson eyes, and they were soon backing away from him. But he was having none of that. Needed more. Was excited. Was imagining all the things he could do to them. They\u2019d scream, they\u2019d beg, they\u2019d bleed. Yes. Fun.</p><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d Lucifer shouted, no longer relaxed. \u201cTake his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we take your head instead?\u201d a new voice proclaimed. \u201cIt will look very nice in my trophy case.\u201d</p><p>Amun recognized that voice, knew it belonged to someone he admired, but didn\u2019t take time to look at the speaker. So many targets, just waiting for his blade. He sliced a throat, stabbed a heart, felt a warm splatter on his face and licked it away. Delicious.</p> <p>\u201cLysander,\u201d Lucifer hissed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Aeron,\u201d a female shouted. \u201cMy poor darling. You\u2019re falling apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia! Get out of here. Go! You shouldn\u2019t see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you. And if you had any idea what I had to do to convince the Heavenly High Council to send an army down here, you would be begging my forgiveness for leaving me behind and then thanking me profusely for coming to your aid.\u201d</p><p>The angels had arrived, Amun thought distantly. He probably should have been happy about that, but the demons around him flew from the chamber, screaming, leaving him with no one else to kill. Or take. That was not fun.</p><p>Scowling, he whipped around. Saw the army of white-robed angels forming a half circle around Lucifer. Saw the prince of darkness hissing at them as he, too, tried to flee. One of those angels held a sobbing Legion, one a nearly unconscious William, and Olivia had her arms wrapped around a trembling Aeron.</p> <p>If Amun couldn\u2019t kill demons, he supposed he could kill angels. Yes. Yes, he thought, he could. He smiled. They might even be better targets. They would scream louder, fall harder, hurt easier.</p><p>Grinning now, he launched forward, blade raised...swiping down...about to nail one of the winged bastards in the back. Fun, fun, fun. But a hard hand locked around his wrist, stopping him.</p><p>Amun roared out his fury. He hadn\u2019t spoken in a while, and his vocal cords were raw, the sound they created raspy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Secrets?\u201d Lysander demanded, shaking him. \u201cThese are my people, come to help you. You do not attack them. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Again, Amun roared. From the corner of his eye, he watched as the weakened Aeron tried to pull from Olivia\u2019s grip. \u201cLet him go, Lysander. He isn\u2019t himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeron, stop,\u201d Olivia said, wings wrapped around him to bind him closer to her. \u201cLook at Amun\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s fully demon now. Stay away from him or he might infect you, too.\u201d</p><p>Infect? Amun had never felt better. Had never enjoyed himself more. His friends would be lucky to experience this.</p><p>\u201cJust let me talk to him,\u201d Aeron pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s like this because of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalk alone won\u2019t suffice,\u201d Lysander said, dark eyes swirling, practically peering into Amun\u2019s dark soul. His voice was calm, hypnotic. \u201cWill it, demon?\u201d</p><p>Amun wrenched himself free and swiped at the angel, startled to find a demon\u2019s arm cradled within his grasp. When had he ripped it off? Lysander expected the blow, however, and blocked it with one hand; with the other he created a fiery sword out of thin air.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Aeron and William shouted in unison.</p><p>But it was too late. The momentum of the angel\u2019s block had spun Amun around, and the ensuing dizziness had sent him to his knees. It was the perfect position for a beheading.</p><p>Only, Lysander didn\u2019t take his head.</p><p>The sword of fire descended, struck him in the chest, burned through clothing and flesh and left a gaping hole.</p><p>At first, Amun was too stunned to do more than gaze down at that smoking wound. Then the pain set in, sweeping through him, eating him alive, shooting the voices and images inside his head into a tailspin of their own. He fell forward, onto his face, every muscle in his body spasming with agony.</p><p>Lysander knelt beside him. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky,\u201d the angel said, \u201cyou\u2019ll die from this. If not, you\u2019ll survive but wish you hadn\u2019t. Either way, you\u2019ll spend your remaining days imprisoned.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>SCARLET LOCKED herself in a crypt. That lasted six hours.</p><p>She stole a boat, intending to spend her days drifting at sea. She made it two miles.She flew to Siberia. For three minutes.</p><p>Every time, she\u2019d been flashed back to Budapest. Inside the fortress\u2014down the hall from Gideon\u2019s room. Every time, she\u2019d had to sneak out without being noticed. She was tired of sneaking out, though, because she knew she would only be brought back. By whom? She didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care anymore.</p><p>Obviously, someone thought she had unfinished business here. So she would finish that business and return to her self-imposed, eternal exile. No revenge. No battles. No love. No Gideon.</p><p>It was safest that way. For him. For herself.</p><p>This way, she couldn\u2019t be used against him. If she were to hurt him because her aunt screwed with her head again...if she were to see him with her mother again, naked, and liking it...</p><p>Her hands fisted. She pressed against the hallway wall that led to Gideon\u2019s bedroom, her demon\u2019s shadows thickly cloaking her. No one would be able to see her, but they would certainly be able to hear her. Nightmares\u2019s screams were as thick as the shadows. Hopefully, though, they would think the wind was merely whistling against the windows.</p><p>Knowing the Lords as she did, she doubted that would be the case. They were cautious, suspicious, and prone to act first and ask questions later. Some of the many reasons she admired them. But she was taking no chances. She would find Gideon, talk to him and leave. Hopefully for good this time.</p><p>His door was around the corner and to the right. Just a little farther...</p><p>Everything inside her urged her to rush to him, to throw herself into his arms\u2014this was Gideon, her sweet Gideon, who had given her more pleasure than anyone else ever had\u2014but she had to maintain the slow pace or anyone who stumbled upon her would realize something was off. Wrong. They\u2019d never have a chance to talk. She\u2019d be tossed back into the dungeon.</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, hey,\u201d a male voice suddenly said, though there was no one around her. \u201cI know you\u2019re there, Scarlet. Don\u2019t blame yourself for failing to hide from me, I happen to be made of awesome. Anyway, I just texted Gideon to let him know, so you should be seeing him any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScar!\u201d she heard Gideon shout next. Her heart tried to crack through her ribs as he raced around the corner, quickly saying, \u201cTorin didn\u2019t spot you inside the fortress, so I don\u2019t know you\u2019re\u2014\u201d He stopped a few feet away from her, and expelled a shallow pant of breath. \u201cHere.\u201d His shoulders sagged. \u201cNo thanks to the gods.\u201d</p><p>Nightmares sighed, content for the first time in days.</p><p>And shit, Gideon was so beautiful. His blue hair was in spikes around his head, his blue eyes bright, his skin tanned and perfect. Her hands itched to touch him. Her tongue longed to trace his tattoos. The one and only time they\u2019d made love, she hadn\u2019t explored him nearly enough; she\u2019d been too eager to get him inside her. Next time, she thought.</p><p>Next time? There couldn\u2019t be a next time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me explain what you saw,\u201d he said, still rushing to get the words out. \u201cYour mother didn\u2019t flash me into the heavens, and she didn\u2019t burn away my clothes, somehow pin me down and climb on top of me. I didn\u2019t want her, I swear to you.\u201d The moment the last confession left him, his features contorted in pain and his knees collapsed.</p><p>Damn it. Truth. He\u2019d told the truth. I didn\u2019t want her. Melting inside, Scarlet willed the shadows and the screams to subside. She bent down, arms winding around his waist to heft him back to his feet.</p><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d she said without heat. \u201cI\u2019d already figured that out.\u201d For the most part. Kind of. \u201cYou should have lied to me. You shouldn\u2019t have weakened yourself in my presence. Idiot!\u201d she said again. Now she could take advantage of him.... \u201cBut...I...love...you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Scarlet dropped him, shock pounding through her. He thumped on the floor with a grunt. \u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered, bending down and hefting him back up. Dear gods. He couldn\u2019t have just said... It wasn\u2019t possible....</p><p>Gideon couldn\u2019t love her; she wasn\u2019t lovable. She was too hard, too stubborn, too violent. He deserved sweet and soothing, tender and uplifting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d she said, then gulped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to say it back.\u201d He was panting now, the words falling from his lips faster, as if he knew he would soon pass out. \u201cJust know I have your aunt. Cronus gave her to me.\u201d</p><p>She nearly dropped him again, but managed to continue marching him onward. Finally they snaked the corner and entered his bedroom. Her aunt was here. Her fucking aunt was fucking here. Her aunt could do what Scarlet now feared most.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cDungeon.\u201d He moaned.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gideon. Start lying to me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He grunted.</p><p>More truth. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Just shut up before you hurt yourself permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo...important...\u201d He hissed.</p> <p>\u201cShut. Up!\u201d Scarlet helped him into bed, her motions stiff. As muscular as he was, he proved to be extremely heavy. But eventually, he was stretched out on the mattress, his eyelids closing, his head thrashing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...leave,\u201d he said, the pain once again so intense it halted his speech. Blindly he reached for her, grasping for her. \u201cJust...Scarlet?\u201d</p><p>She knew what he was asking. Had she paired herself with another actor in her mind? \u201cYes, I\u2019m just Scarlet,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow be quiet like I told you. Please.\u201d Eyes suddenly burning, she twined their fingers and sat beside him, unable to resist him even though she was desperate to stomp downstairs and end her aunt, once and for all. If she had the courage to even approach the woman.</p><p>Gideon calmed instantly, and her eyes burned a little more.</p><p>Moonlight seeped in from the room\u2019s window, caressing him, making his sweat-glistened skin look as if it had been sprinkled with glitter. How she\u2019d missed him. Craved him.</p> <p>Damn him. He\u2019d ruined everything. I love you, he\u2019d said, and he\u2019d meant it. She couldn\u2019t give him up now, not even to save him from herself. Would you ever have been able to do so? Scarlet traced shaky fingers over his brow. He released another of those relieved sighs, much like Nightmares had, body turning toward hers, seeking. He. Loved. Her.</p><p>Seriously. How could he love her?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t, she decided. He was confused, that was all. Perhaps feeling grateful because she\u2019d finally given him the sex he\u2019d been craving. Well, when the newness of that wore off, he\u2019d realize she was wrong for him. He\u2019d realize someone else would be better for him. He\u2019d cast Scarlet aside.</p><p>She would be forced to give him up.</p><p>Her fingernails were lengthening, sharpening into claws as she imagined this magnificent warrior kissing and touching another woman. But Gideon must have sensed her upset, because he started thrashing again. As soon as she gentled her touch, he calmed anew.</p><p>A long while passed, Scarlet caressing his face, and eventually he slipped into a deep slumber. Her relief was as palpable as his had been earlier. She didn\u2019t like to see him suffer. If anyone deserved peace, it was this man.</p> <p>\u201cGalen came after him, you know,\u201d that voice from the hallway suddenly said.</p><p>Her gaze lifted, moved around the room. Again, no one loomed nearby. Which meant speakers were everywhere. And clearly the guy was watching her, which meant cameras were also everywhere, showcasing her every move.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve got Galen locked away, too, huh?\u201d She\u2019d deal with him and her aunt when she went down to the dungeon. If she dared, she added again. Would she be able to pull a victory out of her hat-o-tricks this time?</p><p>\u201cNo. Galen was about to fall, finally, and was babbling about not allowing Gideon to kill him, when the god queen appeared. She flashed both men away.\u201d</p><p>Galen, babbling about not allowing Gideon to kill him. Every bit of warmth abandoned Scarlet\u2019s body, leaving her a hollow shell of herself. Galen had come after Gideon specifically. Gideon. Because of her, she realized with horror. Because she\u2019d screwed with Galen\u2019s dreams.</p><p>She\u2019d meant to torment him, to make him back away. Instead, she\u2019d drawn him deeper into the war, made him more determined to win. This was yet another thing she\u2019d done to destroy Gideon\u2019s life. Yet another reason someone else would be better for him. She had hurt him, time and time again. Sickness churned in her stomach.</p><p>Scarlet pushed to her feet, careful not to disturb Gideon, and tiptoed from the room. Her last visit here, she\u2019d memorized the layout of the place and knew exactly where to go.</p><p>Yes. She dared.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you kill her,\u201d the voice said. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded as she strode down the steps. Some of the windows were stained glass, and as golden beams of moonlight hit them, rainbow shards spilled across the walls.</p><p>\u201cTorin, keeper of Disease and protector of the universe.\u201d No matter where she stepped, his voice remained the same volume. \u201cWell, of the fortress, at least,\u201d he amended.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even when you were locked inside Tartarus? My exploits were legendary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>A sigh of disappointment. \u201cAnyway, Gideon isn\u2019t done questioning the female, so I\u2019m going to make sure she stays alive so that he can.\u201d</p><p>A loyal friend. She could find no fault with that and was actually happy Gideon had such a strong support system. It was something she\u2019d always wanted but had never found. \u201cGuess what? He was saving her for me.\u201d She thought she knew Gideon well enough to utter the words with confidence. He was a giver. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t care when I rip out her throat. He\u2019ll even thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to tell me that himself.\u201d Torin\u2019s firm tone left no room for argument.</p><p>She snaked a corner, strode down another hallway and hit another staircase. This one was wider, cruder, dirtier. Even the air she breathed was becoming thicker, dust coating her lungs.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d she said, \u201cGideon\u2019s a little incapacitated right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means, what? I\u2019ll have to make sure she stays alive until he\u2019s no longer incapacitated. Trust me, I\u2019ll knock you out if I even think you\u2019re going for a kill shot. And I have a feeling you spend enough time unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you plan to knock me out, huh?\u201d</p><p>He laughed with genuine humor, and it was a nice sound. \u201cLike I\u2019d really spill my secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll just talk to her,\u201d she said on a sigh. Truth or lie, she wasn\u2019t sure. She\u2019d find out when she reached her aunt, she supposed.</p><p>Finally, she hit the bottom of the steps and entered the dungeon. She knew it well, having occupied a cell herself for several weeks. And she almost giggled like a schoolgirl when she saw her aunt trapped in the very same one Scarlet had occupied. What a nice bit of justice. Gold star for Gideon.</p><p>Wearing a soiled white robe, Mnemosyne slept atop a cot, large patches of her skin pink and healthy, while other areas were still black and charred. Some of her hair had grown back, though it was thin and short. Her chest rose and fell too quickly, shallowly.</p><p>Grinning, Scarlet gripped the bars. \u201cWell, well, well. How far the mighty have fallen. From mistress to the god king, to immortal soup, to prisoner of the Underlords. Poor baby.\u201d</p><p>Mnemosyne\u2019s eyelids cracked open, and she focused on Scarlet. Then her aunt was whipping to a stand, backing up and pressing herself against the far wall. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>That fear delighted her even more than it delighted her demon. \u201cI\u2019ve come to say hello to my favorite aunt, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>The pink tip of her tongue swiped over her blackened lips. \u201cAnd beg me to erase your memories, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg?\u201d Scarlet chuckled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt raised her chin, anger obviously giving her courage. \u201cIt would do no good, anyway. You owe me thanks, little bastard child, not condemnation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d She arched a brow in taunting salute as she razed her knuckles over the bars. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have had the audacity to seek out your Gideon had you not thought he\u2019d already wed you. You had watched him from afar for years, too afraid to draw his attention, too afraid he would spurn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor thousands of years, I also labored under the belief that I\u2019d witnessed my son\u2019s murder. So, thank you?\u201d She gripped and rattled the bars with so much force the entire structure shook, dust falling from the ceiling. \u201cNo again. That won\u2019t be what you receive from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill me, then.\u201d Her aunt\u2019s chin lifted another inch. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet allowed every dastardly deed she\u2019d ever committed to shine in her expression. \u201cI already told you. That\u2019s not how I\u2019m going to handle you.\u201d So she wouldn\u2019t be killing her aunt today, she realized, even though the desire was there and she was tempted. Not for Gideon, but because the woman didn\u2019t deserve to drift off into nothingness, no pain, no suffering.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Fine, she thought, scowling. She wasn\u2019t going to act now because Gideon hadn\u2019t yet given the order for the woman\u2019s death. Scarlet wanted to be as loyal to him as his friend was. Perhaps then she would be worthy enough to be his woman.</p><p>Did she want to have to prove herself worthy of him, though?</p><p>Yes. Yes, she did. More than anything else in the world, even vengeance against her aunt. She loved him. She loved him so much she ached. He wasn\u2019t her husband, but still she loved him as if he were. Maybe it was because of the memories she\u2019d created, maybe not. Either way, he owned her heart. Had always owned her heart. If there was a chance they could be together, even a small chance...</p><p>\u201cYour man came to me, you know,\u201d Mnemosyne said with relish, drawing Scarlet from her sanguine thoughts. \u201cHe wanted to know why I hate you so much, but I refused to tell him.\u201d Smugness joined the relish.</p><p>Scarlet shrugged. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t care why you did what you did to me, only that you did it at all.\u201d</p><p>Mnemosyne blinked, composure slipping before she shook her head and schooled her features. \u201cYou care. I know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, I might have. But you know what? You aren\u2019t important. Besides, what you did drew me to Gideon, as you said.\u201d With that, Scarlet turned, ready to go back up and be with her man. To comfort him. To give him everything he needed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? Get back here, Scarlet.\u201d</p><p>One step, two, she climbed.</p><p>\u201cScarlet! You can\u2019t leave. Your mother couldn\u2019t kill you while we were prisoners, you know that. To even try meant she would begin to age. But to succeed meant she would become aged for all eternity, no hope for the return of her once-great beauty. Therefore, she tasked me with your torment, and I accepted because...because...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scarlet paused. Her aunt\u2019s cell was blocked from view by the wall, but her voice, oh, her voice...shrill, but truthful. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to know, you\u2019ll come back here and face me.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. Another. Could be a waste of time, but... Curiosity got the better of her, and she backtracked until she once again stood in front of the cell.</p> <p>Mnemosyne nodded, troubled expression smoothing out. \u201cOne day a seer was thrown into the cell with us. That seer took one look at you and laughed, claiming you would kill your mother and assume the heavenly throne. I removed the memory from everyone except Rhea and Cronus. They deserved to know the truth about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? What does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are linked in a way you cannot possibly understand, though I will tell you that when one dies, the other will automatically follow. The fact that you would kill Rhea meant that you would also kill Cronus.\u201d</p><p>All the moisture left her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe seer,\u201d her aunt continued, \u201cwe killed. You, we kept busy with romance and tragedy, hoping you would end your life yourself. You never even tried, though, did you?\u201d</p> <p>But how many times had she been tempted to do so? Countless.</p><p>\u201cSo now do you comprehend the real reason Cronus gave me to Gideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Mnemosyne was the one to grin now. \u201cIt was so that I could prove my loyalty to the crown...and eliminate you once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Before Scarlet had time to move, Mnemosyne had withdrawn and thrown three small silver stars. Sharp, they cut through Scarlet\u2019s throat, each of them slicing veins and arteries, even her voice box. Of their own accord, the shadows and the screams shot from her head, enveloping her, crying for her.</p><p>And then, like Gideon, she knew nothing more.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>\u201cGIDEON. GIDEON!\u201d</p><p>Torin\u2019s frantic voice tugged Gideon from his slumber and straight into a river of pain. Burning, clawing, bones breaking apart and shooting jagged shards through his bloodstream, cutting everything they encountered, pain.\u201cGideon, man. Can you hear me? You have to wake up.\u201d</p><p>Why was he\u2014oh, yeah. He\u2019d told Scarlet the truth. Worth it, he thought next, almost grinning. Scarlet was here, his beautiful Scarlet, and she now knew he loved her. Finally.</p><p>She knew he hadn\u2019t slept with her mother. She\u2019d called herself Scarlet. Not Scarlet Pattinson. Not Scarlet Reynolds. Just Scarlet. His Scarlet.</p><p>She had to want him, too.</p><p>When his strength returned, he was going to romance the hell out of her, as planned. He was going to prove they were meant to be together.</p><p>Even Lies purred with the rightness of that plan.</p> <p>Don\u2019t want to find her.</p><p>\u201cGideon!\u201d</p><p>Though his mind and body yearned to sink back into unconsciousness, Gideon forced his eyelids to open. Moonlight was waning, sunlight fighting for its place in the sky. His woman would be falling asleep soon. He could hold her. He could simply breathe her in.</p><p>\u201cScarlet was injured. Kane\u2019s carrying her to your room now. Should be there in less than a minute. He\u2019s tripped a few times and twisted his ankle. That bitch goddess did something to his mind and he let her out of her cell. She\u2019s working her way out of the fortress, and there\u2019s no one here to stop her.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s thoughts locked on the first sentence, every protective instinct he possessed falling into a tailspin. Scarlet was injured. Fuck no. He bolted upright, panting, sweating, gaze savagely scanning. How bad were the wounds? Where was she?</p><p>His door flew open and Kane hobbled inside, a motionless Scarlet cradled in his arms. Blood soaked her neck, shoulders and T-shirt and matted her hair. Gideon moaned. No. No!</p><p>He scrambled from the bed, knees collapsing on impact. As he hit the ground, Kane gently laid Scarlet atop the mattress. Not a sound did she make. Gideon fought his way into a crouch, vision swimming as he peered down at his woman to survey the damage.</p><p>There were three deep grooves in her neck. One rode the length of her carotid, one her trachea and one the curve of her shoulder. Two were kill shots, even for immortals, and one was simply meant to prolong her agony. Inside, he wailed. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Kane said, silencing him. \u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe goddess screwed with his memory,\u201d Torin said, silencing Kane. \u201cWhile he was busy gathering Scarlet in his arms, Mnemosyne reached between the bars and latched onto his ankle. She told him Scarlet was inside the cell and he needed to open it to get to her. So he did. She also told him there was no one else in the cell, so he paid no attention to the goddess as she darted out of the dungeon. I recorded everything. Oh, and good going, everyone.\u201d He clapped, and somehow the action itself exuded sarcasm. \u201cYou did a great job of searching the bitch for weapons.\u201d</p><p>Gideon should have killed her while he\u2019d had the chance. He hadn\u2019t, and now Scarlet...his Scarlet... Tears ruined what remained of his vision. He flattened a shaking palm over her heart. The beat was shallow, erratic and dangerously slow.</p><p>The cuts were still seeping, and if they weren\u2019t closed soon, she would bleed out. Torin was a no-go as far as doctoring went. No way would Gideon allow his woman to be infected with the warrior\u2019s disease, even though he\u2019d once thought keeping her to himself would be nice. Yes, Torin could wear gloves to prevent skin-to-skin contact, but that was risky. And Gideon was unwilling to take the slightest chance. Weak as Scarlet was, the disease might actually kill her. If the slices didn\u2019t.</p><p>Kane was a no-go, as well. The man could barely keep himself alive. Plaster loved to fall on him, and floors loved to collapse while he stood upon them. No way would Gideon allow the man to operate on Scarlet.</p><p>That left Gideon, weak and shaky as he was. There just wasn\u2019t time to get her to a hospital.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a field kit,\u201d he said. He\u2019d stitched himself and his friends up a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Kane began.</p><p>\u201cNot now!\u201d he growled, every ounce of his impatience and worry ringing out.</p><p>Kane nodded and limped into action.</p><p>Gideon could hear Lies whimpering inside his head, chanting, Sweet dreams, sweet dreams, sweet dreams.</p><p>Gideon translated: Nightmares, Nightmares, Nightmares. He had to bite back a roar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, Scarlet,\u201d he said. There wasn\u2019t a renewed shock of pain, nor an increase in his lethargy. His mind and his demon viewed his words as a lie. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d he repeated, tears falling freely now.</p><p>His hands trembled as he smoothed the hair and blood from her face. The action caused the muscles in his shoulders to knot, but he didn\u2019t care. Pain was nothing in the face of this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in any shape to do this,\u201d Torin said, grave.</p><p>Like there was another choice. To do nothing was to watch her die. And he would not watch her die. She was going to pull through, no matter what any of them believed.</p><p>Kane raced back inside the room, white streaked over his cheeks. Plaster must have fallen on him along the way, as Gideon had known it would.</p><p>\u201cAll yours.\u201d Kane dropped the black leather pouch on the bed. \u201cI just hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Shaking more intently, Gideon unrolled the material. He lifted the thread and the needle and the tiny scissors, then got to work. Took him forever to stitch a single slice, his eyes constantly fogging over, his grip weak, but he did it. Then he moved to the next one, and then the next one, until Scarlet was no longer bleeding.</p><p>But the fact was, she\u2019d lost a lot of blood already and he didn\u2019t have the equipment to do a transfusion. Which she needed. Desperately. And would have. So he\u2019d just have to do it the old-fashioned way, he supposed.</p><p>Immortals had the same blood type, and didn\u2019t have to worry about a negative reaction the way humans did. Scarlet was half-human, however, and he\u2019d never transfused a half-human before. Only himself and the other Lords. Still, that wasn\u2019t going to stop him. He grabbed the syringe from the pouch, jabbed himself in the crease of his elbow and withdrew as much life-giving fluid as the vial would hold. Then he stuck the needle into Scarlet\u2019s arm, slowly pushing that fluid inside her.</p><p>If she later complained about sharing a needle, he\u2019d spank her. After he hugged her. And made love to her. And hugged her again. They were immortal, as well as lovers. It\u2019d be okay.</p><p>He repeated the process so many times he lost count. Repeated it until Kane grabbed hold of his wrist and said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You\u2019re draining yourself.\u201d</p><p>True. He was weak. Weaker than he\u2019d ever been. But if Scarlet needed more, he would give her more. Would give her every drop.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else you can do, man,\u201d Kane said, as grave as Torin. \u201cExcept wait. And pray.\u201d</p><p>Sweet dreams, sweet dreams, sweet dreams.</p><p>Like hell there was nothing else he could do, Gideon thought darkly. There was something. He could summon Cronus.</p><p>SHADOWS and screams enveloped Scarlet, dragging her into a sea of darkness and screeching noise, and holding her captive. They were stronger than she was and trapped inside her, so they had no other outlet, no other way to feed. And they needed fear to feed. Lots and lots of fear.</p><p>Fear they would get from her.Horrific image after horrific image played through her mind and nearly all of them involved Gideon. Gideon with another woman and loving every moment of it. Gideon being beheaded by Galen. Gideon going after Mnemosyne to avenge Scarlet\u2019s death and dying himself.</p><p>Scarlet attempted to insert herself into every scene and change the outcome, but that only made things worse. Gideon would laugh at her or go for her throat. And gods, did her throat hurt. She was having trouble breathing, and her limbs were heavy and cold. And she knew what she was imagining was wrong, things Gideon would never do, which added guilt into her riotous mix of emotions. She\u2014</p><p>Blinked in surprise. A warm fire had ignited in her blood, and was traveling through her, leaving tiny pockets of energy. That energy grew and interlocked, until she was consumed by it. The darkness and the screams at last settled, and she slipped into a peaceful sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How much time passed until she next became aware, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cDevil! Can\u2019t you hear me?\u201d A rumbling male voice called to her from a long, dark tunnel. \u201cCan\u2019t you see me?\u201d</p><p>Gideon. Gideon was near. She blinked open her stinging eyes, excitement pounding through her as his face came into blurry focus. Blurry, because screaming shadows were seeping from her and dancing around him.</p> <p>A surge of disappointment and rage destroyed her excitement. This was another trick, she thought. Gideon was nothing more than a mirage, a way to torment her.</p><p>\u201cDevil. Don\u2019t talk to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t be real. \u201cGo away,\u201d she rasped, and gods, her throat still hurt. She tried to roll away. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Strong fingers cupped her jaw, a blanket of warmth in the middle of a winter storm, and angled her head, forcing her to maintain eye contact. Slowly, he grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be okay. I wasn\u2019t so afraid... Didn\u2019t pray to Cronus, didn\u2019t beg him to help you. Didn\u2019t inform him he owed me for ignoring me about Aeron. He didn\u2019t tell me he\u2019d brought you here. Didn\u2019t give you a vial of his blood.\u201d</p><p>He was babbling, and even knowing this was another nightmare, she drank him in, her gaze cutting through the darkness. Shaggy blue hair, electric eyes. Pierced eyebrow, muscled body. Her heartbeat sped up, was suddenly stronger, steadier.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry you were injured. I\u2019m not sorry I didn\u2019t take care of your aunt while I had the chance.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Why would this dream Gideon apologize to her? That was a pleasure, not a frightening terror. Not that he had any reason to apologize; he\u2019d done nothing wrong. But still, this wasn\u2019t something her demon would do. Joy wasn\u2019t his favorite thing.</p><p>That could only mean...Gideon really was here. He was close to her, talking to her. Touching her.</p><p>She could only stare up at him in wonder. \u201cI\u2019m awake. I\u2019m alive. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t give you my blood, Cronus\u2019s blood.\u201d Those callused hands slid up and he traced his fingers along her temples. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to survive, right? Right?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d given her his blood? That must have been the shot of strength she\u2019d experienced, of peace. And that he\u2019d approached Cronus on her behalf, the very being who\u2019d asked her aunt to strike at her... Why Cronus had agreed, she didn\u2019t know. She only knew there was no better man than Gideon.</p> <p>This warrior really did love her, she thought, awed. He\u2019d been hurting from telling the truth, yet he\u2019d somehow found the strength to give her what she needed.</p><p>You\u2019re melting again. He\u2019ll get hurt if you stay with him.</p><p>I was already melting. In fact, there was no ice left around her swelling heart.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I\u2019ll survive,\u201d she told him. And would kill Mnemosyne at last. \u201cBecause of you, I feel stronger already.\u201d Especially now that he was here with her.</p><p>\u201cBad, so bad. My demon wanted\u2014\u201d His words halted as the shadows and the screams swirled around him more intently.</p><p>They now had another target. And for once Nightmares didn\u2019t seem to notice or care that the new target was Gideon. The hunger was simply too great, she supposed.</p><p>In the next instant, thousands of tiny spiders appeared on his body, crawling all over him.</p><p>\u201cNot a lie, not a lie, not a lie,\u201d he chanted, unable to hide his alarm. He was trying to remind himself that the images were an illusion, she knew.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your demon?\u201d she asked to distract him. She wound her arms around him, elbows catching under his arms, and cupped the back of his neck. He was so hard, so hot. \u201cTell me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want...a go...at yours.\u201d He was tense, clearly fighting the urge to slap at the little creatures. But to slap at them would have been to believe they were there. He would have lost the battle against his mind.</p><p>\u201cThen let him have a go at mine,\u201d she said. Hopefully, a tangle with Lies would distract Nightmares.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s not dangerous at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it and I\u2019ll let you kiss me.\u201d If he still wanted to do so, that is. After everything she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He still wanted to kiss her; her relief was palpable. \u201cHow will I kiss you? By pressing my lips to yours, thrusting my tongue into your mouth and savoring your delicious flavor.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched at the corners. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Good. He was properly distracted. And he wanted to know how he could let his demon have a go at hers. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. I thought you did. My best suggestion is maybe...give up control? When I lose control of myself, Nightmares leaves me, like now, even though he remains tied to me.\u201d</p><p>Gideon ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cLies didn\u2019t take over earlier today or yesterday, or whenever. He wasn\u2019t overcome with anger and didn\u2019t force himself out of me. So maybe you\u2019re wrong. Maybe I can\u2019t make it easier for him. But if he caresses you...\u201d</p><p>If he hurt her. \u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Maybe. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d Please work, please work, please work. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>A nod. Gideon closed his eyes, expression tightening with concentration. Several moments passed, but nothing happened. He was a warrior, and relinquishing control would be difficult, so Scarlet planted little kisses along his jaw, reminding him of what awaited him should he succeed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s...not working.\u201d Slowly, so slowly, a dark mist began to seep from his skin. An eternity seemed to eke by before that mist finally pulled free of him entirely, taking the shape of a tall, scaled creature with horns that protruded from its head, its shoulders. Hell, from every inch of it.</p><p>At last Nightmares stilled, the screams quieting, leaving only a deafening silence. Then, with a groan, her demon took shape, as well, growing into an even taller scaled creature, with fangs that cut a path to its chin and muscles that put every Lord of the Underworld to shame.</p><p>The two creatures rushed forward, meeting in the middle and throwing their gnarled arms around each other. Their lips were the next to meet, and then those scaled bodies were falling to the ground, writhing together, Nightmares grinding a huge erection against the smaller Lies, whose legs were open.</p><p>\u201cMy demon\u2019s a girl?\u201d Gideon said, astonished.</p><p>Truth. He\u2019d just spoken the truth, but he wasn\u2019t suffering. Did he realize? \u201cYou didn\u2019t know? I\u2019ve always known mine was male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019re the smarter of us.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met, and they shared a husky laugh.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s expression softened, and he gifted her with the sweetest little nip to her chin. \u201cGods, I adore your laugh.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes misted, and she quickly returned their conversation to the demons. Before she cried like a baby in front of him. \u201cI think they like each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they love each other.\u201d He sobered, frowned. \u201cI\u2019m speaking the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cyet I\u2019m not in any pain.\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t. \u201cAre you...happy about that? That you can speak truthfully, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. She would\u2019ve hated herself if she\u2019d beseeched him to do this and he ended up regretting it.</p><p>Grinning, Gideon peered down at her with adoration in his eyes. \u201cI have so much I want to tell you, and I was so afraid I\u2019d lose you before I had the chance. I love you. You\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Hearing him speak his mind was odd, and at first, she found herself trying to decipher his meaning.</p><p>\u201cI admire your strength and courage and want to spend my life with you. I want you to marry me for real this time. I want to have babies with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Steel,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but whisper.</p><p>\u201cLike our darling Steel,\u201d he said, and they shared a tender look. And yet, his grin faded and his expression tensed. \u201cHow do you feel about me, Scarlet? I have to know.\u201d</p><p>And she could deny him nothing. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell you. I just... You\u2019re my weakness. You can be used against me, and have, time and time again, and you\u2019ve been hurt for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your weakness?\u201d His grin returned, a leisurely lifting of his lips.</p><p>Her pulsed fluttered as she nodded. She was treading on thin ice\u2014with cleats. \u201cYes, and as long as we\u2019re together, you\u2019re in danger. Which makes me a selfish bitch for wanting to be with you anyway, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself.\u201d</p><p>Another nod. \u201cI want you to know that I\u2014I like...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger against her mouth, silencing her. \u201cAll that matters right now is that we want each other. We\u2019ll figure everything else out later. Right now, my darling girl, I\u2019m going to romance the hell out of you like I\u2019ve been craving.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>GIDEON PRESSED his lips against Scarlet\u2019s and savored her sudden intake of breath, as if she was breathing him in, savoring him as he was doing to her. Some part of him\u2014his cock\u2014wanted to rush, to get inside her as quickly as he could so that they would be joined, one being. And damn, it felt like forever had passed since he\u2019d last enjoyed her. But he was determined to take his time. To make this sensual assault last. To do everything he hadn\u2019t done last time.</p><p>Like lick every single one of her tattoos. Like watch her lick every single one of his. Besides, he needed to prove he had some skills in this arena. Last time, he\u2019d come from a single thrust; his manhood was at stake now. He could last, damn it, and he would.After their tongues rolled and thrust for minutes, hours, after he had no more air in his lungs, he lifted his head and peered down at this woman he so loved. \u201cCan you not\u2014 Sorry.\u201d He had to get used to telling the truth. \u201cI mean, can you take us somewhere else? A daydream?\u201d Away from the moaning, writhing demons beside them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied softly.</p><p>\u201cDo it. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze pulled from him and circled their surroundings. A moment later, the bed they lay upon seemed to be whisked out of the bedroom where the two demons were locked in a live porno, and to a tranquil beach with glistening white sand. Crystalline water washed onto the shore, and birds soared overhead, singing softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to lounge on a beach and watch the sun set with you,\u201d Scarlet said with a blush. \u201cMovies don\u2019t compare, do they?\u201d</p><p>Such a simple desire, but so telling. She\u2019d been born in a prison, with walls always closing her in. Then, after her possession, she\u2019d lost her ability to walk during daylight hours. And even though the times she slept varied, she was never really free to do what she wanted, at any time she wanted. Now, she craved what everyone else took for granted. What he took for granted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d he replied, then rasped straight into her ear, \u201cThough not as lovely as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she snapped, pushing at his chest. \u201cYou just called me...lovely.\u201d She shook her head, frown vanishing. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not used to you telling the truth. I\u2019d almost rather you called me ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgly, ugly, ugly,\u201d he whispered now, cupping her jaw and forcing her to look up at him. \u201cThere\u2019s no woman uglier, no woman I crave less....\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, and it was a full-on invitation.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re asking for it, angel.\u201d He dipped his head and once again claimed her mouth, their tongues playing together, her decadent flavor consuming all his senses. Driving him wild. Don\u2019t rush...</p><p>Her arms began to wrap around his waist, but he stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He gripped the hem of her T-shirt and pulled the material over her head. That soft fall of hair tumbled to her bare shoulders. Gorgeous pale skin, a lacy black bra. \u201cNow you can hold me.\u201d</p><p>Their lips met yet again, and she wrapped those strong arms around him, fingers dabbling at the waist of his pants before gliding up his back, massaging his muscles. Her hands were callused from holding blade hilts, and created the most erotic friction.</p><p>Heat sparked through his bloodstream, warming him up, urging him on. Slow. But maybe he could speed this up a little. He unhooked her bra and cast the garment aside, exposing her dazzling breasts.</p><p>With a moan, Gideon tore his own shirt off. He moaned again when his flesh met Scarlet\u2019s. Fan-freaking-tastic. Her nipples were hard little pearls of pleasure. Oh, yes, she was asking for it.</p><p>More. He worked at her pants. Lucky fabric, having been so close to her. Soon he had the leather off, along with her panties, leaving her completely bare, and his gaze ate her up. She didn\u2019t try to cover herself and didn\u2019t blush. She bit her lower lip and undulated her hips, letting him know how much his scrutiny aroused her. Hell, it aroused him. She was magnificent. All that creamy skin, lean legs, flat stomach, small, firm breasts with the rose-tinted nipples and elegantly curved shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWet for me?\u201d he asked roughly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him, suddenly unsure. \u201cBut I...I thought I was in charge in this area, so shouldn\u2019t I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take turns. Right now, I\u2019m in charge. Let me see.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, she parted her thighs, giving him a peek into heaven. Her pink folds were damp, hiding the sweetest spot he\u2019d ever had the privilege to see. His gaze moved, latching onto the colorful butterfly tattooed nearby, and his mouth watered.</p> <p>Lucky tattoo.</p><p>Lucky me. Gideon bent down and traced his tongue along the wings, riding the length of her inner thigh. Goose bumps broke out over Scarlet\u2019s limbs. Her fingers tangled in his hair, her nails digging into his scalp. He licked and sucked and nibbled that brand, paying it proper homage, as it was one of the reasons they were together right now.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she groaned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Though he wanted to fall into her and eat her up, consuming every drop of her, he palmed her hips and flipped her over. She gasped, looked at him over her shoulder, expression confused.</p><p>\u201cThe others need a little attention, too,\u201d he explained. Then, starting at the top, he worked his way down her back, kissing every single tattoo she possessed. TO PART IS TO DIE he laved until he was panting. Sweating. Hurting.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop there. Couldn\u2019t. He paid her ass equal attention, nibbling on those sweet cheeks and tonguing the crease between bottom and leg, all the while teasing that moist, waiting sex by blowing and humming but never actually touching.</p><p>When she was writhing, begging him to penetrate her, even reaching between her legs to assuage the ache herself, forcing him to grab her wrists and pin them behind her back, he finally stilled. Took stock. His cock was straining against the fly of his jeans, and every breath he dragged into his lungs was like fire.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d she gasped. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Pain was mingled with arousal in her voice, and he frowned. He wanted her out of her mind, yes, but not pained.</p><p>\u201cNeed the edge taken off, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, yes.\u201d</p><p>Releasing her wrists, he flipped her back over and finally allowed himself to do what he\u2019d wanted to do all along. Taste her fully, deep and thrusting, as if his tongue was possessing her. Instantly she screamed, hips bucking up, meeting him, sending him even deeper.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yesssss!\u201d</p><p>Her orgasm rocked her, her skin like fire, her knees clamped against his temples, her fingers fisting the sheets. He swallowed every drop of pleasure she gave him, her sweetness better than ambrosia as it flowed through his veins, branding him, delighting him.</p><p>Only when she stilled did he raise his head, licking at his mouth as he sought her gaze. Every drop belonged to him, even those. Her eyes were at half-mast, her chest quickly rising and falling in shallow succession, and her arms and legs draped at her sides as if they were too heavy to lift. Never had a woman looked more sated. And never had he experienced more pride. He had done this. He had given this to her.</p><p>The sunlight she\u2019d created caressed every inch of her, adding a golden tint to her skin. At the base of her neck, her pulse hammered wildly. Her nipples were darker now, as if blushing under his scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she rasped. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she heard the pain in his voice, because she eased up on her elbows, gaze roving to his straining erection. \u201cWant me to take care of that?\u201d she asked huskily. \u201c\u2019Cause, darling, it looks so good.\u201d</p><p>He almost choked on his own saliva. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Barely audible. Not until she was out of control again, desperate for him.</p><p>\u201cA lie, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth. Kind of. I just need a little more of you.\u201d Gideon lowered his head and flicked the tip of his tongue over one of those beautiful nipples. He plucked at the other, not wanting it to feel left out.</p><p>This was his woman. His darling. Every moment with her was precious. And torturous. Gods, he hurt. Will be a man. Will act like a man. Will last for her.</p><p>When she was once again arching against him, and shit, rubbing that sweet, wet spot against his shaft, causing it to pulse and lengthen as never before, he slid his fingers down her stomach, past that tiny tuft of dark, silky hair and into her sheath. Wet again, dripping. Ready.</p><p>Sweet heaven.</p><p>Gideon pulled from her, severing all contact. He ripped at his clothes, gentleness not even a concern. Soon the material lay in tatters around him, and he was back on top of his woman, her legs opening for him, her black gaze glistening like polished onyx.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d A croak.</p><p>\u201cBeyond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna hit you so deep.\u201d He positioned her legs on his shoulders, so that her calves were pressing into his back, and then fed his cock into her opening. He didn\u2019t press inside, though. Not yet, not yet, not yet. He already wanted to explode. You gotta calm down.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? I need it!\u201d</p><p>If he had to do fucking math equations in his head, he was going to last. \u201cJust...need...to...breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m already starting... Gideon! I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>Just the thought of him being inside her sent her over the edge? Fuck, yeah! He thrust to the hilt, slamming forward with a single rocking of his hips. Those warm, wet walls closed around him, tight as a fist, squeezing him just right. Shit, the pleasure. Once again, it was almost too much. Especially since her second orgasm was causing her to pump against him. But he chewed the inside of his mouth, drawing blood, and began to move.</p><p>Once, twice, yes, yes. So good. So damn good. He kissed her, tongue mimicking cock, thrusting, retreating, thrusting. Her hands found their way to his ass, her nails cutting past skin as they urged him forward, deeper. This was it, what he\u2019d craved his entire life.</p><p>\u201cYou are...everything,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cGideon! I love...I love...this.\u201d</p><p>Was that what she\u2019d meant to say? He wasn\u2019t sure, and even the thought that she might love him excited him so much that he went caveman. Claim her. Fully.</p><p>\u201cScarlet!\u201d Hard, deep, so hard, pistoning in and out, feeding his cock to her over and over again, riding the waves of her climax so very hard that he sent her body spiraling into a third.</p><p>She clutched at him, practically jerking the seed out of him in the next instant.</p><p>The release was so intense, so mind-numbing, he actually saw stars winking behind his eyes as his every muscle petrified to stone. He couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t breathe, could only feel. And then he collapsed on top of her.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s stamina,\u201d he panted however long later.</p><p>A laugh escaped her. A true, honest-to-the-gods laugh, and it delighted him to his soul. Was more satisfying than even the sex, causing his chest to constrict. She didn\u2019t laugh enough, but by the gods, she would laugh in the future. He would make sure of it. A vow he would see through with his dying breath and every one in between. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon rolled to his side, pulling Scarlet into the curve of his body. \u201cI want to marry you. For real.\u201d It was a need. \u201cBut I already told you that.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, tried to pull away, but he wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d he said with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re overlooking the fact that I\u2019m a liability to you. I think I had decided to stay with you. Right now I can\u2019t even remember my name. But what if you\u2019re hurt because of me? I would rather die\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve overlooked nothing. I just don\u2019t care.\u201d His arms tightened around her, this precious treasure he wouldn\u2019t give up. \u201cI want you in my life, and that\u2019s all there is to it. I want to pledge my life to yours like the warriors of old pledged their lives to their kings. And there\u2019s no better time, either. I can proclaim the truth right now.\u201d</p><p>The thick, oppressive silence that followed razored him.</p><p>Still, he gave Scarlet the time she needed to digest his admission and come to grips with what he wanted. No way would he pressure her. That would make him a little too much like that bitch NeeMah. But gods, he wanted to. He wanted to force the issue with every possessive instinct raging inside him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand this, Gideon.\u201d A tortured whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to understand? I love you.\u201d So easily admitted, after he\u2019d fought it so long. How foolish he\u2019d once been.</p> <p>\u201cBut you could do better,\u201d she said, agonized.</p><p>But, but, but. He was sick of that stupid word. \u201cDo better than you?\u201d He rolled back on top of her, smashing her and holding her in place. \u201cThere\u2019s no one better than you. You are ugly and weak and I never get aroused just by thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched, but she fought her amusement and never gave him a full-on grin. \u201cWhat if you later regret this decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d never been more certain of anything in his life.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because there\u2019s no undoing it once it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve said all day. Even better than \u2018yes, yes, more.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Still no full-on grin, but there was now a twinkle in her dark eyes. \u201cYes, but how can you know you won\u2019t regret it? I mean, what if my aunt screws with my memory again and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery couple has problems, angel.\u201d He cupped her cheeks, forcing her gaze to remain locked with his, to probe deeply, to perhaps catch a glimpse of just how much he meant to her. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Tears muted the twinkle, and each droplet cut at him. \u201cYeah, but it would hurt you and I\u2019ve hurt you so many times already.\u201d</p><p>What could he say to make her understand? \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t noticed, I considered all those times foreplay.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched again, and she couldn\u2019t cut off her amused snort. Damn, he was getting good at this. At making her find the humor in any situation.</p><p>See? They were perfect for each other.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said on a sigh, the tears gradually drying. \u201cWe can get married for real, but I swear to the gods, Gideon, if my aunt screws with my memory again, if my mother abducts you, I\u2019m leaving you.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. \u201cRhea, I\u2019m not worried about,\u201d he replied, heart beating so hard, he knew the organ would be forever bruised. \u201cNeeMah, though? We\u2019ll track her down and kill her. I mean, what better honeymoon for us?\u201d No way would he let Scarlet get away, not for any reason, but he wouldn\u2019t tell her that and spook her. Wouldn\u2019t tell her that he\u2019d follow her wherever she went, for as long as necessary. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait. And like I said, I do want to do this old school. But if you want a big wedding, too, we can do that later.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled him to his back and straddled his waist. \u201cI don\u2019t need a big wedding. But if you\u2019re going to do this old school, so am I. I\u2019m a warrior, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d That was one of the things he loved about her. All that strength...shit, he was getting hard again and his body should have been unresponsive for weeks considering the pleasure it had just experienced.</p><p>Blended with that arousal was straight-up excitement. He was about to marry the woman he loved.</p><p>Scarlet leaned over and down, nipples brushing him. He licked and sucked and she gasped and moaned. When her head cleared just a little, she remembered to palm one of the blades hidden under his pillow. As she straightened, she sliced the tip between her breasts. Skin ripped open and blood beaded before trickling and running down her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d she asked shakily. \u201cLast chance to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took the knife and slashed himself in the center of his chest, exactly as she had done. No hesitation. Blood ran in both directions, raining down his ribs, up to his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my too-long life. Now come here.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet eased down until she was lying on top of him, their blood mingling. She was trembling.</p><p>He stared into her eyes, those perfect dark eyes. \u201cI am yours, and you are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I am yours and you...you are mine,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He claimed her free hand and flattened it over his pounding heart. \u201cFrom this moment, until the end of time.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers jerked against him, but she didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cFrom this moment...\u201d</p><p>Come on. Say it. Ancient power swirled around them, as thick as the silence had been. Waiting...</p><p>\u201cFrom this moment...until the end of time.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes! Finally.</p><p>A stream of fire slammed into him, and he cried out. The same must have happened to Scarlet, because her shout blended with his. That fire blazed along his soul, tearing it in two. But then, a sweet, cool ice crystallized, filling the wounded void. Making him whole again. Making him more than Gideon. Making him Scarlet\u2019s man.</p><p>\u201cAnd so it\u2019s done,\u201d he said, voice rumbling with his satisfaction. So simple, so easy. And yet, she was his. She was his wife. Now...always. Every bone in his body, every cell, vibrated with the knowledge. \u201cTo part is to die,\u201d he added, sure now that he\u2019d come across the phrase when she had entered his dreams all those centuries ago. They\u2019d been connected, even then.</p><p>\u201cI hope you never regret this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He urged her closer for a soft, quick kiss, then smiled. \u201cNow don\u2019t you have something else to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo part is to die,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd I want you to know...I was never with another man. After I came down here and saw you. I lied to you.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected the confession, and his eyes closed for a moment, exhaling a warm breath. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I understood why you\u2019d done so, but I\u2019m glad you lied. So damn glad. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she said brokenly, as if the word was impossible to believe.</p><p>One day she would. Completely. Two of his fingers stroked the ridges of her spine. \u201cSo, who are you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScarlet...Lord.\u201d</p><p>Sweet mercy, but he liked the sound of that. That was as close to a declaration as he was going to get. Because, knowing her as he did, and he liked to think he knew her pretty well, she wasn\u2019t going to cop to her feelings. And yes, she had them, he knew it, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have married him. But until her aunt was dead and her mother dealt with, she\u2019d try to maintain some kind of distance.</p><p>Which he would see to, all of it. At least Cronus was no longer a threat. Otherwise, the king wouldn\u2019t have helped him heal Scarlet. Still, Gideon knew he would receive no more aid. He\u2019d be on his own. But battling two beings that were stronger and more powerful than he was didn\u2019t scare him. Not when the prize was Scarlet\u2019s heart.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>ARMS SPLAYED, Strider turned in a circle while standing in the center of the Temple of the Unspoken Ones. This was his last resort, his only resort. Otherwise the female Hunter, Ex, would escape him. With the Cloak of Invisibility in her possession. He would be a failure, a loser, and she would have won the challenge between them.</p><p>That, he wouldn\u2019t allow.\u201cI need your help,\u201d he called. \u201cI\u2019ve come to bargain.\u201d</p><p>Last visit, they\u2019d made him wait. This time, their reaction was immediate. A huge beast materialized between two of the pillars, exactly as before. He was totally nude, but then, he didn\u2019t need clothing. His skin was furred as if he were a horse. And rather than hair, thin snakes hissed from his head. Like the creature, those snakes possessed fangs.</p><p>Muscle was stacked upon muscle, his nipples pierced by two large silver rings. Metal chains circled his neck, wrists and ankles, and while he had human hands, his feet were hooves.</p><p>Beside him, between two other pillars, another beast appeared. A male whose lower half was covered by dark red fur and whose upper half boasted human skin. Skin that was a mass of scars. He, too, was bound by chains.</p><p>Those chains didn\u2019t detract from the menace radiating from either of them.</p><p>A third beast appeared, this one female. Unlike her friends, she wore a leather skirt. Her breasts were bare, wonderfully large, and her nipples pierced, as well. Only, she wore diamonds rather than silver hoops.</p><p>She stood in profile, and Strider could see the small horns protruding from her spine. The horns he actually liked, almost as much as her breasts. Her face, however, was beaked like a bird\u2019s. That wasn\u2019t something a man could get over easily. She, too, was furred and chained.</p><p>A fourth and fifth appeared in quick succession, both so tall and wide they were like living mountains. They didn\u2019t have snakes for hair, though. What they had was worse. One was bald, yet shadows seemed to seep from his skull. Thick and black and putrid. And hungry. Yeah, they looked hungry.</p><p>The other creature had blades. Small but sharp, they spiked from his scalp, each glistening with something clear and wet. Poison? Probably, though nobody had been able to gather tangible data about the creatures\u2019 powers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a reason these fiends were known as the Unspoken Ones, after all.</p><p>As before, the female stepped forward, her chains rattling. \u201cAnd so a Lord of the Underworld returns to our midst. There can be only one reason for that. We requested Cronus\u2019s head. Where is it?\u201d Her voice brought to mind a thousand souls bound together, desperately trying to escape. They screamed from her, echoing through the temple, their tears practically soaking him.</p><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t actually have it,\u201d he said, and the Unspoken Ones immediately began hissing and growling at him, tugging at their chains to reach him and, he was sure, claw him into pieces. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he added in a rush.</p> <p>Yes, they were willing to give him the fourth artifact\u2014the Paring Rod\u2014in return for Cronus\u2019s head, and yes, they\u2019d offered the same bargain to the Hunters. But Rhea was leading the Hunters, and if her life truly was bound to Cronus\u2019s, as Torin had told him last time they\u2019d spoken on the phone, then Rhea wouldn\u2019t allow her men to take her husband\u2019s life.</p><p>Humans would have a hard time destroying a god, anyway. So Strider wasn\u2019t worried about the Hunters winning the Rod anymore. And if there was no competition, the Unspoken Ones had no bargaining room. It was all about supply and demand, baby. They had the supplies, but he had the demands.</p><p>Win. Defeat snarled, making its demands known.</p><p>I will.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d the female demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI want to give you another artifact.\u201d</p><p>That silenced them. They stared at him intently, confused, probably trying to figure out his angle. Why would a Lord of the Underworld, a warrior who had been valiantly searching for the very things that would lead him to Pandora\u2019s box, thereby preventing his enemy from ending his life, give up something he needed to win the war?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the female finally asked. \u201cAnd what would you expect in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a human female on this island. I want her. Flash her here, and I\u2019ll give you the Cloak of Invisibility.\u201d He would have to be careful with Ex, though. She could thieve without his notice and hide things so that he couldn\u2019t see or sense them. How she did it, he didn\u2019t know, but he was determined to find out.</p><p>The female grinned, revealing teeth sharper than daggers. \u201cShe is here, yes, though she will not be so for much longer. And once she leaves this island, we will no longer be able to locate her or flash her anywhere. This is our only place of power.\u201d For the moment, her words clearly implied. \u201cWhy do you want her?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Ex was about to leave the island? That quickly? What a fucking time crunch, he thought, urgency rushing through him. \u201cShe killed my best friend. I must punish her.\u201d Surely these creatures would understand the need for revenge. They wanted Cronus\u2019s head because he\u2019d enslaved them, after all.</p> <p>The female\u2019s horns seemed to grow, wrapping from her spine to her arms. \u201cThe girl has the Cloak, however. Not you.\u201d</p><p>Shit, he thought again. He\u2019d hoped they wouldn\u2019t realize that.</p><p>One of the males, the one with snakes atop his head, stepped forward. \u201cWe cannot take from a human. That is forbidden.\u201d He sneered the last. \u201cTherefore, if we bring her here, you must take it from her.\u201d</p><p>Forbidden, huh. One of Cronus\u2019s rules, most likely, and as the god king\u2019s slaves, they had to obey him. They shouldn\u2019t have admitted to that. It was like giving him the ace he needed for a four of a kind. \u201cAgreed.\u201d Besides, that\u2019s what he\u2019d planned to do, anyway.</p><p>\u201cAs do we,\u201d the female said with a nod. \u201cThe girl is yours in exchange for the Cloak.\u201d Perfection.</p><p>Strider had to cut off his grin. This had worked out for him in so many ways. These creatures already had one artifact, and were keeping it safe. Now they would have two to guard, and the Hunters would never be able to take them.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get this done before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Ultimately, Strider would have to return and retrieve both artifacts. Somehow, some way. Perhaps even bargain with them, finally giving them what they wanted. Or perhaps Cronus would find a way to retrieve the artifacts. He wouldn\u2019t want these creatures to have them, and he didn\u2019t want the Lords to die. They were the only ones who could keep his wife in line. Win-win.</p><p>The creatures reached out and joined hands. Once they formed a complete circle, a hum of power rent the air, dust motes thickening to jelly. Jelly that wavered and glistened. A muted buzz filled Strider\u2019s ears, and that buzz quickly grew in volume. Grew so much, he dropped to his knees, hands covering his ears, temples throbbing sharply.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, the buzzing ceased. He removed his hands, saw that blood was smeared over his palms, and pushed to shaky legs. His heart was pounding in his chest at the thought of seeing\u2014</p><p>Ex materialized just in front of him.</p><p>Win, win, win.</p><p>His blood instantly heated. Pink hair was plastered to her head and cheeks, dirt smudged every inch of her and her clothing was ripped. She was panting, sweating, spinning around with wild eyes, clearly trying to figure out where she was and what had happened.</p><p>She screamed when she spotted the Unspoken Ones.</p><p>The Cloak lay at her feet, as if she\u2019d had it draped around her but the flash from one location to another had forced it from her shoulders.</p><p>Win! Strider lunged for the small square of material, swiping it up before Ex even realized he had moved. She latched onto his arm, not to snatch the Cloak but to jerk him in front of her and use his body as a shield. Won. We won!</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>Pleasure shot through him, filling him up, giving him strength and hell, making him hard as a rock. \u201cThey\u2019re your downfall, sweetheart.\u201d He raised the Cloak high in the air. \u201cThis is now yours.\u201d None of the creatures reached for it, but the material disappeared. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be speaking with you again, Defeat,\u201d the female Unspoken One said. \u201cOf that, I have no doubt.\u201d</p><p>With that, all of the creatures disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Ex said on a trembling breath. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Strider spun, facing her, and gripped her upper arms. Arms that were still so shockingly chilled. He couldn\u2019t help it, he was grinning. \u201cI traded them for you, sugar. Which means you. Are. Mine.\u201d</p><p>MARRIED. She was married. It was the first thought to fill Scarlet\u2019s mind as she opened her eyes from the deep, healing sleep she\u2019d just enjoyed. After making love with Gideon. After marrying him. There was that word again.</p><p>Moonlight streamed through the bedroom window, muted and pretty. The air was clean and smelled of freshly washed linen. Their demons were back inside their bodies, resting after hours of fornicating. As if they, too, were married.Married.</p><p>She\u2019d actually done it. She\u2019d actually said the vows that bound her to Gideon for all eternity. One part of her wanted to luxuriate in joy. The other part of her wanted to run before something bad happened to this man she so loved. A man sleeping beside her, turned toward her, his arm thrown over her belly and his leg bent over hers. Possessing her, even in slumber.</p><p>She tried to sit up, but the scabs riding the length of her throat pulled, threatening to split open, so she remained prone. Funny. She hadn\u2019t noticed the injuries while making love with Gideon. Or marrying him.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>Intruder! Breath froze in her throat as she searched the chamber and stealthily reached under Gideon\u2019s pillow. After the wedding ceremony, she\u2019d returned his blade there. Now she gripped the hilt, inching the weapon from hiding. Protect!</p><p>A man leaned against the far wall, his arms crossed over his chest. He had white hair, dazzling green eyes, black brows and a face more beautiful than, well, hell, anyone she\u2019d ever seen before. He was innocence mixed with wicked and sprinkled with heroin.</p><p>How many women had fallen under his spell?</p><p>She pressed the cool metal of the blade against her forearm, preventing the man from seeing it as she turned toward him, all the while inching over Gideon to be his shield. If the intruder approached, she would slice his heart in half before he realized she\u2019d left the bed.</p><p>\u201cPlotting my death, I see. Well, you can stop. I\u2019m Torin,\u201d he said, raising a hand covered by a black glove and waving. \u201cKeeper of Disease. Gideon\u2019s friend. We\u2019ve chatted before.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes. Disease, self-proclaimed protector of the universe and the guy who hadn\u2019t wanted her to kill her aunt because Gideon hadn\u2019t yet issued permission. Scarlet liked him already. With an apologetic grin, she slipped the blade back under the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you and Gideon to wake up,\u201d he said.</p><p>Waiting? \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew days.\u201d</p><p>Days? Damn. While she\u2019d been sleeping, her aunt was out there, healing. Probably fully healed by now, in fact.</p><p>Beside her, Gideon stretched. His eyelids flickered open, and then he was peering over at her, lips edging into a grin. \u201cGood\u2014\u201d He blinked, frowned. \u201cBad morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>His demon wasn\u2019t going to let him tell the truth, she realized. She didn\u2019t mind. She actually liked his lies. \u201cYes. Bad morning.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and gently cupped her nape, drawing her closer for a kiss. The action hurt her neck, but she didn\u2019t allow herself to grimace. She would endure much, much worse for a kiss from Gideon. Her husband.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she breathed against his lips. \u201cNow it\u2019s a good morning.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled huskily. \u201cIt\u2019s about to get much worse.\u201d</p><p>Torin cleared his throat. \u201cMuch as I\u2019d like to watch you guys make out, I have to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>Frowning again, Gideon looked over at his friend. \u201cStay. Want you here.\u201d Meaning, Get lost, you\u2019re a pest. Of course, Torin didn\u2019t take the hint.</p><p>Grinning, the bad boy held up both hands in a display of blamelessness. \u201cYesterday I summoned Cronus and showed him the video of Mnemosyne trying to kill Scarlet. He was pissed that the goddess blamed him for the attempt. Said he had no need to hire out for such a thing, that he was well able to take care of Scarlet on his own. If that\u2019s what he so chose. I suspect that\u2019s why he helped you, Gideon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All those years ago, Cronus, too, had tried to kill her. That\u2019s why he\u2019d aged the way he had. So, why would he have changed his mind about her? Even to prove himself innocent of her aunt\u2019s claims?</p><p>\u201cCron means to on her now?\u201d Gideon lashed out.</p><p>On her? Took Scarlet a moment to translate, and when she did, her gaze sharpened on Torin. Did Cronus mean to off her?</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say. Anyway,\u201d Torin continued, \u201cI\u2019m supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d a new voice interjected. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Cronus.</p><p>Suddenly the king stood beside Torin, his white robe as pristine as always, his dark hair pulled back in a ponytail and without a single strand of gray. His skin was smooth, his eyes bright. He\u2019d never looked so young.</p><p>Gideon whipped upright, palming the dagger Scarlet had returned to him. The mattress bounced, making her cringe, and he kissed her bare shoulder in apology, though his attention never left the god.</p> <p>Bare?</p><p>She glanced down at herself and saw that she was topless. Hurriedly she dragged the sheet up, covering her breasts as her cheeks heated. Normally, she didn\u2019t care about such things. Having been trapped in the same cell with men for most of her life, she couldn\u2019t care about such things. But she was married now, no longer out to punish Gideon, and knew he didn\u2019t like for other men to see her. He wanted her all to himself, and that delighted her.</p><p>\u201cAs Torin said, I didn\u2019t command Mnemosyne to kill Scarlet,\u201d the god said, his displeasure clear. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here to kill her myself, either.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed, then Gideon looked at Scarlet, confused. \u201cHe\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>So. Truth. \u201cThen how did my aunt hide those stars from the Lords?\u201d Scarlet demanded. \u201cShe was wearing a slave collar. A collar that\u2019s supposed to glow when its owner is in possession of a weapon. It wasn\u2019t glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sister, my darling wife, visited her, exchanged her collar for a fake, and they planned your murder together,\u201d Cronus replied evenly. \u201cAnd no, Torin, you wouldn\u2019t have seen her on your cameras. Like me, she can tamper with such things. She meant to kill you, escape, and for Gideon to hunt her, either keeping him busy or allowing Mnemosyne to convince him to join the Hunters. Against me.\u201d</p> <p>Proof that Scarlet\u2019s reservations about marrying Gideon, about being with him, hadn\u2019t been in vain. Had her aunt succeeded in killing her, Gideon would have gone after the goddess. Her aunt would have manipulated him, and he would have willingly become that which he despised most.</p><p>She should have felt betrayed by her family, but she didn\u2019t. Maybe she\u2019d come to expect this. Maybe she\u2019d gotten used to it. Either way, they had to die. It was the only way she could stay with Gideon and not destroy him. And she desperately wanted to stay with him.</p><p>\u201cI know of your bargain with Rhea,\u201d Cronus said to her. \u201cYou are to stop Gideon from giving me what I asked of him. Finding Amun so that I might deduce Mnemosyne\u2019s intentions.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, refusing to respond. She didn\u2019t want to get Gideon in trouble for not yet keeping his end of the bargain.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Cronus continued, \u201cI no longer have need of such a service. I know Mnemosyne has betrayed me.\u201d His gaze swung to Gideon, flickers of relish lighting his irises. \u201cTherefore, I\u2019m changing the terms of our bargain. I ask now that you live in misery. Which means you,\u201d he said, gaze returning to Scarlet, \u201care to stop him from doing so.\u201d</p><p>Shock overwhelmed her, and her jaw dropped. He...what? Surely she had misheard him.</p><p>Gideon chuckled, warm and rich, her only anchor in the sudden tempest of her uncertainty.</p><p>Cronus frowned, clearly irritated with their reactions. \u201cDo not think me soft. My motives are hardly selfless. I know the fury my wife will face when she realizes that her daughter is happy because of her bargain. But you will leave the queen alone. Do you understand? Or I will finally strike at you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gideon said with an easy nod.</p><p>That, too, she should have expected. Her aunt had told her that Rhea and Cronus were somehow connected, and that when one died, the other would follow. But she hadn\u2019t let that stop her from planning her mother\u2019s murder.</p><p>\u201cDo you. Understand?\u201d Cronus gritted out.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Scarlet barely worked past her now raw throat. She did a good job of keeping her horror from her voice. Did a good job of hiding the tears now burning her eyes. She\u2019d already realized that there were two things she needed to do to be able to stay with Gideon, to keep him safe. Only two damn things. Kill her aunt. And kill her mother.</p><p>That\u2019s why she\u2019d allowed herself to marry him. Because she\u2019d believed there was hope. A chance. Now...with Cronus trying to stop her...she would fail. Should she even approach her mother with death on her mind, Cronus could very well hurt Gideon in punishment.</p><p>\u201cAnd no, thank you,\u201d Gideon added, so happy he looked ready to burst. \u201cBut why are you not helping us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, why am I helping you when Scarlet is supposed to kill me?\u201d</p><p>Every bit of warmth drained from her. Why pursue that line of thought further unless he meant to act?</p><p>\u201cTouch her and live.\u201d Rage had clearly replaced Gideon\u2019s happiness as his mind clearly went in the same directions as Scarlet\u2019s. He shoved her behind him, causing her to flop to her back. She quickly righted herself, inserting herself beside him again.</p><p>Cronus rolled his eyes. \u201cAs you\u2019ll recall, Lies, she isn\u2019t the only one foreseen to end me. That monumental task has also been bestowed upon Galen. So which vision is correct? One? Both? Impossible. And that means visions can be changed, the future altered. I will alter mine, even as I alter yours. And Mnemosyne\u2019s.\u201d Gideon relaxed.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Cronus continued, \u201cI have a wedding present for you.\u201d He clapped his hands and Scarlet suddenly found herself caught up in the clouds. Again. Only this time, she wasn\u2019t in the Titans\u2019 heavenly palace, but in a vast expanse of...nothingness. Of white. Scentless, endless.</p><p>Gideon stood beside her, and both of them were dressed in the clothes of a warrior. Flexible shirts, leather pants. Mnemosyne stood in front of them, out of striking distance but without her slave collar. Fake or otherwise. She was completely healed, as Scarlet had feared.</p><p>Cronus bridged the gap between them, arms extended to prevent anyone from attacking.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the goddess demanded. When she spotted the king, she softened her expression. \u201cCronus, darling, I\u2019m so glad you found me. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He peered at her, devoid of emotion. \u201cMnemosyne, your sister was only too happy to betray you and admit what the two of you planned. She does like to boast, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Mnemosyne\u2019s cheeks leached of color. \u201cNo, I\u2014 Rhea lied. I swear to you, she lied. I would never act against you. I love you. We\u2019re meant to be together. Don\u2019t you remember? We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished. I enjoyed our time together, but you betrayed me and that I will never forgive.\u201d Cronus smiled with genuine humor. \u201cHowever, I will not destroy you myself. Rather, I will give you a chance to redeem yourself. All you must do is defeat...one of them.\u201d</p><p>Her wide-eyed gaze flew to Scarlet before darting to Gideon. \u201cWh-what? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have removed all of your weapons, as well as theirs, so this will be hand-to-hand. You may choose whom you desire to battle, Mnemosyne. Gideon or Scarlet. But doubt me not. There will be a fight this day. This petty feud will end, for I need my soldiers\u2019 undivided attention.\u201d</p><p>The goddess studied Gideon, who looked stronger than ever, rested as he was from his truth-curse. She then studied Scarlet, who was still pale and whose neck was still scabbed.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, my king.\u201d Slowly Mnemosyne grinned. \u201cI choose Scarlet.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>MISTAKE, Gideon thought. He might have killed her quickly. Even weak as Scarlet was, she was going to make her aunt suffer. He\u2019d never been more confident about anything. Except, perhaps, how much he loved his woman.</p><p>He gripped her wrist with one hand and her jaw with the other, pulling her close while forcing her to face him. Her gaze remained on his mouth. \u201cI hate you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re going to fail.\u201d Even injured, she wouldn\u2019t lose. Too much was at stake. Too much rage was directed at that bitch of a goddess.Silent, she nodded, still refusing to look up at him.</p><p>He frowned. What was this? \u201cHey. Don\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d Cronus said, impatient, and Gideon scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need a moment,\u201d he snapped, returning his attention to Scarlet. The fight could wait. \u201cDevil. Don\u2019t look at me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Slowly her gaze rose. Tears swam in those beloved eyes and dripped down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDevil,\u201d he said, chest constricting. \u201cWhat\u2019s right?\u201d Wrong.</p><p>\u201cI will kill my aunt. You\u2019re right about that. But afterward, I can\u2019t stay with you. When I thought I could find and kill my mother, too, there was a chance that I could make you happy. But now...with her alive...she\u2019ll use me to get to you, and I can\u2019t allow that. Which means I must leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d No, no, no. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear Cronus. You are to keep me miserable, and I can\u2019t be miserable without you in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, yes. But what happens after she sends her soldiers to attack you for the tenth time? The twentieth? The hundredth? What happens when she tries to abduct and seduce you again? She\u2019ll never stop. You make me happy, so she\u2019ll never stop. You\u2019ll get tired of it, and in turn, become tired of me. And you really will be miserable then.\u201d</p><p>He shook her violently. \u201cAlways. I\u2019ll always be tired of you.\u201d Never. For eternity.</p><p>The tears streamed down, one after the other, and she sniffled. \u201cI can\u2019t be with you and lose you again. I just can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose me.\u201d He was desperate to make her understand. \u201cI can be happy without you. Your mother matters, she really does. What do I have to do to dissuade you of that? Keep her alive?\u201d Kill her. He would do it. He would betray Cronus in a heartbeat. Anything to keep Scarlet with him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve hurt you enough. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Okay. Time for tough love. He hadn\u2019t reached her any other way. \u201cI thought I had married a weak woman, but look at you. Strong. Look how confident you are. Look how confident you are in me.\u201d He forced the words to emerge on a sneer. \u201cThis isn\u2019t disappointing at all. Here I am, unwilling to give you everything that I am. My heart, my life, my support, and here you are, willing to stand beside me, unflinching. You are absolutely the warrior I thought you were.\u201d</p> <p>Gods, had that hurt to say. A far different pain than when he lied, mental rather than physical, and yet, so much worse.</p><p>Shocked, she blinked up at him. \u201cYou thought I was strong but now you think I\u2019m weak? You think I\u2019m not confident? You\u2019re disappointed in me?\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to nod.</p><p>Eyes narrowing, she popped her jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll show you. Just for that, you\u2019re stuck with me. I don\u2019t care how many times my mother approaches you. You\u2019ll have to deal with it, you cruel bastard.\u201d</p><p>He knees almost buckled, so great was his relief. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t be my pleasure. Now. Don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t fight your aunt. And when you\u2019re done, we won\u2019t go on a real honeymoon. One with lots of violence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she said again, but there was no heat in her tone. For the sweetest moment, she rested her forehead against his sternum. \u201cYou used reverse psychology on me, without the reverse. Right?\u201d</p><p>Rather than admit it, he simply said, \u201cI hate you, Scar. So much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, but I hate you, too.\u201d And with that, she severed contact and stepped forward, ready to begin.</p><p>She hated him, he thought, a grin bursting forth. She really hated him! She\u2019d never said the words before, and now that she had, he just kind of collapsed on the ground, laughing and crying and happier than he\u2019d ever been. Yeah, that other happiness, when he\u2019d married her, paled in comparison.</p><p>Soon as the fight was over, he was going to hold his woman and smother her with his love. And he didn\u2019t care how chicky that made him.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Cronus said on an exasperated sigh. \u201cI give a gift, and I\u2019m ignored. And for the oddest conversation I have ever heard.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You recall my presence now? You desire what I offered?\u201d</p><p>What a baby.</p><p>After a little more huffing, Cronus said, \u201cLadies. You may begin.\u201d In the next instant, he appeared at Gideon\u2019s side with a bowl of popcorn. \u201cThis is what humans enjoy during spectator sports, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly isn\u2019t.\u201d Gideon grabbed a fistful of the kernels and popped them in his mouth. Without weapons, this wouldn\u2019t be too bloody of a fight, but it would be violent. That, Gideon would stake his life on.</p><p>Scarlet was finally going to get her pound of flesh.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>There was no trash talk, no circling each other. Scarlet simply lunged at NeeMah, ready. Contact. The two women were propelled to the ground in a tangle of arms and legs. Amid screeches, punches were thrown, nails were bared and used (by NeeMah), and elbows and knees were slammed (by Scarlet).</p> <p>When they pulled apart, a wheezing NeeMah got lucky, grabbing Scarlet by the shirt, swinging her around and tossing her. Cronus must have erected some sort of air shield because Scarlet crashed into nothing before sliding to the floor. She didn\u2019t stay down long. A split second later, she was on her feet, blowing the hair out of her face and stomping forward.</p><p>Bitch goddess was gonna be sorry now.</p><p>\u201cGot hot sauce for this disgusting snack?\u201d he asked Cronus as he reached into the bowl for another helping.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The king shuddered. \u201cWhy would you want hot sauce? Who puts hot sauce on popcorn?\u201d</p><p>Just before Scarlet reached her aunt, she whipped out her arm as if she were throwing a blade. Only, her demon flew from her fingers, black and writhing, arcing a swift path to NeeMah. That black cloud hit, and she screamed, dropping to her knees and slapping at her skin.</p><p>Spiders? he mused hopefully.</p><p>Scarlet closed the rest of the distance, balled her hands and struck, flinging the goddess to the ground, on her side and still slapping at herself.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d When Scarlet held out her hand, the darkness raced back to her as if she\u2019d switched on a vacuum. \u201cNo. It\u2019s mine.\u201d With an unholy screech, NeeMah kicked out her leg, connecting with Scarlet\u2019s ankles. Scarlet toppled beside her, air abandoning her in a whoosh.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve everything I\u2019m going to do to you,\u201d Scarlet growled as she stood.</p><p>NeeMah jumped up, attention never wavering. \u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhore.\u201d</p><p>Good girl, Gideon thought when his Scar repeated herself. Why deviate from the truth?</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m killing you,\u201d NeeMah said, circling her as she hadn\u2019t gotten to in the beginning, \u201cI\u2019ll make you thank me. I can make you do anything I desire. Remember how you cried for Gideon? Remember how you ached for Steel?\u201d</p><p>Without a sound, Scarlet kicked out her legs and sent the whore to her ass. A second later, Scarlet had again closed the distance between them. She fisted the goddess\u2019s robe, momentum giving her strength as she flung the goddess around and around before releasing her and sending her soaring.</p><p>Like Scarlet had done, NeeMah slammed into nothing. She wasn\u2019t as quick to get up, though, and Scarlet used that to her advantage, rushing forward and elbow-diving for all she was worth. Smack. Bone cracked.</p><p>Gideon couldn\u2019t help himself. He whooped, slinging popcorn in every direction.</p><p>Cronus leveled him with a glare.</p><p>What? he silently mouthed, then turned back to the massacre.</p><p>Blood dripped from NeeMah\u2019s nose and mouth, her bottom lip was split and her jaw sporting a swollen knot, all courtesy of Scarlet\u2019s elbow. An elbow that wasn\u2019t done. Boom, boom, boom. As the goddess flailed to sit up, pushing at her, Scarlet nailed her three times in a row, knocking teeth right out of NeeMah\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Sweet heaven. Sexiest sight ever.</p><p>NeeMah\u2019s pain must have given her strength, an adrenaline rush, something, because she finally managed to land a punch in Scarlet\u2019s throat. Scarlet fell backward, gasping for air, probably seeing stars.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Cronus said.</p><p>\u201cHeaven\u2019s about to reign,\u201d Gideon replied confidently. The fires of hell were going to rage.</p><p>NeeMah lumbered to her feet, and Scarlet did the same. The goddess obviously expected to circle her prey again, stealing a few minutes to recuperate, because she stepped to the side. Scarlet simply lunged and popped the goddess in the chin, causing her head to whip to the side, her feet to stumble.</p><p>Scarlet jumped on top of her, straddling her and sending her skull cracking into the ground. Her aunt clawed blindly, and actually managed to rake a hand down Scarlet\u2019s stitches, ripping every single one open.</p><p>\u201cMy former mistress is such a...girl,\u201d Cronus said, disappointed. \u201cWhere are the pounding fists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my man ain\u2019t got no skills,\u201d Gideon replied proudly. He wanted to stand up and point to himself and shout that Scarlet was his. That she belonged to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you just wait and see.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence, then Cronus shook his head and said, \u201cHow do the others stand you?\u201d</p><p>Gideon ignored him. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, devil,\u201d he called.</p><p>Maybe his \u201cpraise\u201d gave her strength, because she shook her head as if clearing her mind. Blood trickled down her neck, and savage brutality pulsed from her. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the strength to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Panting, expression dark, she tackled the rising NeeMah even as she bit into the woman\u2019s throat and ripped. The goddess screamed so vehemently, even Gideon cringed. But as she lay there, gasping for breath, Scarlet straddled her waist a second time and grabbed her head, slamming it over and over against the ground.</p><p>NeeMah dug her fingers into Scarlet\u2019s neck wounds and tore them further. \u201cGive up,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cYou want to give up. You deserve to die by my hand. You want to die by my hand. Remember how I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Scarlet punched again, seemingly unaware of her own injuries. Blood sprayed, and the ground actually trembled. \u201cI...don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I want to give up.\u201d</p><p>While the goddess tried to shield her face with one hand, she again reached out blindly with the other...until flattening her palm over Scarlet\u2019s heart. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hurt me.\u201d Gritted, barely audible. \u201cYou want to save my life, don\u2019t you? Remember? Just as I once saved yours.\u201d</p><p>Scarlet stilled, panting.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to die. You\u2019ve always thought so. You want to die. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cNot a foul. Not a damn foul!\u201d Gideon tried to stand, but Cronus latched onto him and held him in place. Popcorn scattered. If Scarlet\u2019s memories were tampered with, she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cScarlet used her demon,\u201d Cronus said. \u201cThe goddess is allowed to use her powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gideon watched in horror as Scarlet\u2019s head canted to the side and her eyes glazed over. As she nodded. \u201cYes. I deserve. I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you, devil,\u201d he shouted. \u201cPlease, forget how much I hate you. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to save me, because I saved you,\u201d NeeMah said, voice stronger now as she continued to weave her tale. \u201cI saved you from Gideon. He\u2019s the reason you\u2019re cut and bleeding. He\u2019s the reason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Scarlet suddenly hissed. \u201cNo. These are my memories, and I love them. I do not want to save your life. I want to end it. I do not want to die. Gideon loves me. Me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow can you be sure?

But she could recover from that, and Scarlet had to know.</p><p>Gideon opened his mouth to tell her she would have to find a way to remove the head from the body, but she beat him to it. She found a way. With her bare hands.</p> <p>That\u2019s my girl.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t kill her for good, will it?\u201d he asked Cronus, just wanting assurance. Worked for immortals, but he\u2019d never delivered the deathblow to a straight-up god or goddess.</p><p>\u201cTime will tell,\u201d Cronus replied cryptically.</p><p>Gideon would just go ahead and take that as \u201cbitch was wasted forever.\u201d</p><p>Panting all the harder by the time she finished, Scarlet straightened. He jumped to his feet and ran to her, the air shield gone, but just before he reached her, Cronus swept the two of them back to Gideon\u2019s bedroom. So when he collided with her, they tumbled backward into his bed. A bed he never wanted to leave again.</p> <p>\u201cI did it,\u201d she said, peering up at him through swollen eyes, split lips curled into a grin. \u201cI really killed her.\u201d</p><p>Gideon planted little kisses all over her face, careful of her injuries. \u201cNot proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Shaky arms wound around him. \u201cWhen she tried to get inside my head, I felt her this time. I knew it was her, and knew that what she was trying to convince me of was false. Because my real memories were so strong. And cherished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot glad, not glad.\u201d He hugged her tight. \u201cGods, I hate you so much.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she kissed him back. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>This was even better than hearing her repeat his lie. She loved him. He seriously couldn\u2019t ask for more than that. Oh, wait. He could. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll leave me, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d she said without hesitation. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019ll piss off Mommy Dearest and as much as I hate to admit I have something in common with Cronus, I\u2019m starting to enjoy messing with her. Or at least I\u2019m not scared to cross her anymore. Look what I did to her sister. I\u2019ll do the same to her if she comes near you. And who knows. Maybe I can help you find Pandora\u2019s box and we can lock my mother inside. Now wouldn\u2019t that be fun?\u201d</p><p>Now this was the confident, vengeful Scarlet he so adored. They were going to be so happy together.</p><p>There was a bang at his door, and Torin called, \u201cStop playing around, you two. Amun, Aeron and William just returned home with Legion. And you\u2019ll never believe who came with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow doesn\u2019t he always know where we are and what we\u2019re in the middle of doing?\u201d Reluctantly Gideon disengaged from his woman. If he\u2019d hadn\u2019t missed his friends so much, if he hadn\u2019t needed to see for himself that they were all right, he would have ignored Torin\u2019s summons.</p><p>Scarlet stood beside him, a little wobbly on her feet, and linked their fingers. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s check on them. Plus, you need to officially introduce me so they\u2019ll stop trying to capture and kill me.\u201d</p><p>Such a darling girl, and so understanding. \u201cNo deal.\u201d</p><p>They strode out of the bedroom, down the hall, down the stairs and into the foyer, only to stop short at the sight that awaited them. A contingent of angels stood in a circle, murmuring to each other. Bright lights glowed around each of them, and they were so physically perfect it actually hurt to gaze upon them. Most were males, but there were a few females. No matter their gender, they all possessed white wings threaded with gold, stretching and invading every inch of space.</p><p>Determined, Gideon pushed his way through them. Where were\u2014 He spotted his friends in the center of that circle. They were lying on their backs, barely breathing. They were more ragged and injured than he\u2019d ever seen them before. And shit, he\u2019d seen Amun fucked up pretty badly. They were covered in soot and countless bruises and abrasions and reeked of sulfur.</p> <p>Olivia, Aeron\u2019s female, had the warrior\u2019s head in her lap and she was smoothing the hair from his brow. William was moaning, calling for Gilly, one of his arms nearly detached from his body. Legion wasn\u2019t moving at all, just lying in a pool of her own blood.</p><p>Amun, though...Amun was the worst. He was clutching his ears and biting his lower lip, clearly lost in an agony even Gideon couldn\u2019t comprehend.</p><p>\u201cDo not look him in the eyes,\u201d Lysander, leader of all the warrior angels, said. \u201cHis mind is infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Scarlet asked, suddenly beside Gideon and wrapping a comforting arm around his waist. She squeezed him, offering support.</p><p>\u201cDemon,\u201d Lysander replied.</p><p>Gideon just blinked over at him.</p><p>\u201cWe know that,\u201d Scarlet said for him. \u201cWe\u2019re all infected by a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lysander insisted. \u201cHe is fully demon. You are merely bonded with one, but his mind is evil, no goodness is left inside it. If he looks at you, he will see into your soul and poison it with darkness.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit, Gideon thought. He drew Scarlet deeper into his side. He loved Amun, but he wouldn\u2019t risk his woman. \u201cWhat can\u2019t we do to help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe means, what can we do to help him?\u201d Scarlet interpreted.</p><p>He squeezed her this time.</p><p>\u201cKill him,\u201d Lysander said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Gideon shouted. No!</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not gonna work for us,\u201d Scarlet said.</p><p>The angel sighed. \u201cWe wanted to imprison him in the heavens, but Olivia convinced us to bring him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Scarlet assured him, as well as the other angels. \u201cWe\u2019ll help him. Without killing him,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cBianka wouldn\u2019t want you to give us time,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>\u201cMeaning she would,\u201d Scarlet clarified.</p><p>A muscle ticked below Lysander\u2019s eye. Bianka was his mate, or wife, or whatever the angels called their significant other, and Lysander lived to please her. And as Bianka was sort of related to Amun, in a roundabout way, she truly wouldn\u2019t be happy if Amun was killed.</p><p>\u201cVery well. You can try to save him,\u201d the angel said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Scarlet said for Gideon.</p><p>\u201cBut I cannot give you long. A week, perhaps two. And do not think to run with him.\u201d Every word hardened into iron. \u201cWe would only find you. And we would be...angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted,\u201d Scarlet said.</p><p>After that, the angels began disappearing, one by one. Gideon helped cart the three men and Legion to their beds. Amun, he noticed, never tried to look at them, but kept his eyes closed. As if some part of him knew what had happened to him, and still thought to protect them.</p><p>When everyone was situated, Gideon and Scarlet stood at the side of Amun\u2019s bed. Olivia was caring for Aeron and Legion, and Gilly for William.</p><p>\u201cHe needs a doctor trained to tend immortals,\u201d Scarlet said. \u201cI know you guys don\u2019t have one, but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find one. Your friend will heal.\u201d</p><p>Truth or lie, Gideon didn\u2019t know. He faced her, took her hands. \u201cI hate you,\u201d he told her again. He\u2019d tell her a thousand times a day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. And just so you know, if I ever hear you tell me you love me, I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. He had learned how to ease her from her dark moods, and she had clearly done the same for him. \u201cSo I\u2019m not stuck with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re stuck with me. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said, and she laughed. They shared a soft kiss. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry the honeymoon doesn\u2019t have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But just being with you is a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the back of her hand now. He owed her more than this, and he would one day give her more, but her support meant so much to him. Especially since she couldn\u2019t be fond of his friends. But because she loved him, she was willing to forget how they\u2019d treated her.</p><p>More than ever, he knew he didn\u2019t deserve her. But would he give her up? No. She\u2019d chosen him, and his Scarlet got what she wanted. Or else.</p><p>Of all the tasks he\u2019d ever undertaken, ensuring she was happy was the most important to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get through this,\u201d she said. \u201cSuccessfully. And so is he.\u201d She motioned to Amun with a wave of her chin. \u201cI promise. He\u2019s infected by hundreds of demons, but so what. We\u2019ll find a way. We always do.\u201d</p><p>Yes. They would find a way. Before the angels returned. Nothing was impossible; he knew that now. Otherwise, he never would have won Scarlet\u2014goddess slayer, warrior tamer...future queen of the gods, if the vision Cronus had spoken of was to be believed.</p><p>\u201cGideon? Do you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re wrong, devil. We\u2019ll fail.\u201d No pain, no weakness. Lies.</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder, snuggling close. \u201cGood. Because it\u2019s time Team Gidlet kicked some ass.\u201d</p><p>Team Gidlet? Despite the direness of the situation, he found himself once again fighting a grin. \u201cI\u2019ll love you for a single day, devil,\u201d he said, as close to a declaration of eternal devotion as he could get.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll love you for a single day, too. And then all the ones that follow.\u201d</p><p>For them, to part really was to die. And he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. </p> </body></html>"]
