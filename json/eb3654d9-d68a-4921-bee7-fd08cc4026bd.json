For a moment she was disoriented and wondered what had woken her, but then she became aware of footsteps overhead. She lay still and listened as someone puttered in the kitchen at the top of the stairs, but tensed when the footsteps paused and she heard the slide and click of first one, then another, and finally a third bolt being slid open.</p><p>A moment of silence passed before the door swung open. Light immediately raced down the steps and across the basement\u2019s concrete floor. By the time it reached her cage, it was weak and dull, but even that bit of light made her blink after the pitch black they were left in most of the day.</p><p>She could hear the other women stirring and feel the tension building behind her. Fear was suddenly a living, breathing thing in that dark, dank room. Valerie tried not to let it claim her as well and began counting backward from one hundred to distract herself. A clear head was necessary if she wanted to escape. Fear led to panicky actions and reactions. It led to mistakes, and there was no room for mistakes if she wanted to get herself and the others out of this house of horrors.</p> <p>Her attention was claimed when the bit of light from above was suddenly blocked by a large figure filling the doorway. It was Igor with a tray in hand, she saw as the light framed his silhouette. That light danced around his body and shifted on the floor as he started down. The heavy thud of his boots on the wooden stairs was loud in the sudden hush. The women were now as still as deer caught in headlights.</p><p>Valerie held her breath and waited as Igor reached the bottom of the steps. He walked past her cage without a glance, heading for the back of the room and the cages there. He always started at the back, distributing a bottle of water and bowl of oatmeal and fruit to each captive until he reached the front. Everyone would get a meal except for the woman who had been chosen for that night\u2019s fun. Knowing that, Valerie tried to make out who was getting food and who wasn\u2019t, but her cage at the front of the room and the virtual darkness the other women were in made it hard to see anything. She thought Igor had stopped at every cage but couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>When he stopped in front of her cage and Valerie realized that he was now dangling the tray by one handle alongside his leg, empty, she let her breath out on a slow, silent hiss. It was her turn for a \u201cnight out\u201d then. Finally. She remained still as he set the tray on the ground and retrieved his keys from his front pants pocket. The tray would remain there until he returned her to her cage. He\u2019d use it to carry away all the bowls he\u2019d just handed out, she knew.</p><p>Well, he would if he were to return, but she didn\u2019t intend to allow that.</p><p>The door of her cage swung open, but Valerie waited for his terse, \u201cCome,\u201d before shifting to her hands and knees to crawl out. Her home for the last ten days was four feet high, four feet wide, and the same deep. There wasn\u2019t room to stand, or even lie inside it. For ten days she\u2019d either lain curled in a ball on the floor, or sat with her knees tucked to her chest. The only time she got to straighten her legs fully was when she was let out of the cage, like now, and that had only happened once before since she\u2019d been dragged here. Other than that, she\u2019d spent all her time in this cage, eating and even relieving herself there in the bedpan provided. The bedpans were removed once a day when he collected their bowls after feeding, and returned after emptying.</p> <p>\u201cUp,\u201d came the terse order as she paused on her hands and knees on the cold concrete floor. Valerie wasn\u2019t surprised when the order was accompanied by Igor grasping her arm and dragging her upward. After so long without being able to straighten her legs, she needed the help and barely restrained a groan of pain as she came upright. She was even grateful for his supporting hand on her arm as he walked her silently up the stairs.</p><p>Much to Valerie\u2019s relief, the worst of the pain eased by the time she reached the top step, but she continued to lean into his hold, even deliberately stumbling on the last step to give the impression that she wasn\u2019t completely steady on her feet. He\u2019d expect that. Normally, the drugs they put in the oatmeal would only now be wearing off and she would be expected to be slow and a little uncoordinated.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Valerie had stopped eating the oatmeal after her last \u201cnight out.\u201d She was clearheaded. Her only worry was that she would be weaker than usual after four days without food. But there was nothing she could do about that and would just have to count on her skills, her strength, and the element of surprise to see her through what was coming. She had no intention of dying in her own filth in that damned, stinking cage in the basement.</p><p>Valerie continued to lean into Igor\u2019s hold and throw in an occasional stumble as he led her across the kitchen. She let her head hang forward as if she was too weary and stoned to hold it up. Doing so allowed her to dart her eyes swiftly around under the cover of her long hair as she searched for a possible weapon, or chance at escape.</p><p>There was nothing. The kitchen counters and table were clear of anything useful. There were no knife handles sticking out of a handy knife block, no glasses or cups sitting about that she could shatter and use as a weapon, not even a coffee machine or toaster. It could have been an empty house.</p> <p>Valerie continued forward, eyes searching as he led her into a hall and up another set of stairs to the top floor of the house. She wasn\u2019t surprised when he steered her left at the landing, urging her toward the back of the house. She\u2019d been this way before, but had been drugged at the time. Her recollections of the hallway, the renaissance portrait on the wall, the paneled walls, and the blue carpet were all slightly distorted in her memory.</p><p>The hallway ended at a large bedroom. She refused to look at the old-fashioned four-poster bed as they walked past it to the en suite bathroom. The house was probably over a hundred years old, but the bathroom spoke of a renovation at some point. She\u2019d guess it had taken place in the fifties or sixties. It was green; the walls were painted green, the toilet was green, the sink was green, and there was a green tub with small green tiles covering the wall around it.</p><p>It was incredibly ugly, Valerie thought as Igor urged her to the side and moved past her to bend over the tub and start a bath running. Valerie knew what came next, but refused to panic. Her gaze slid around the small room, settling on a collection of items on the sink counter: a towel, a washcloth, a bar of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and a clean white robe. All of it was meant for her, set neatly on the sink counter to \u201cprepare her for dinner,\u201d as Igor called it.</p><p>Valerie had started to look away from the collection when she had second thoughts. Igor was straightening from setting the stopper and turning on the taps. He would turn his attention to her next. With no time to lose, Valerie snatched up the shampoo, popped the lid, and squirted it at Igor\u2019s face as he turned toward her. When the man gave a startled cry, fingers reaching for his eyes, she followed up with a roundhouse kick to his abdomen.</p><p>Valerie had hoped to send him tumbling backward into the bath, but either he was more steadfast on his feet than most, or she was weaker than she\u2019d expected after four days without food. He did stagger back a step, but that was it, and even as he did, he lashed out with one arm, hitting her in the chest.</p><p>The blow was like an explosive charge going off in front of her. Valerie was sent flying through the air, and out of the bathroom. She landed on something with enough impact that it collapsed beneath her weight with a clatter, and then her head was bouncing off the floor. Valerie was left gasping for air with stars exploding behind her closed eyes.</p><p>Fighting off the pain radiating through her head and body, she sucked in great drafts of air, relieved when her lungs expanded. For a moment she\u2019d feared the wind had been knocked out of her, which would have left her temporarily helpless, and she didn\u2019t have time for that. Igor was even now stumbling out of the bathroom, wiping the shampoo from his red, angry eyes.</p><p>Valerie turned onto her stomach, intending to push herself to her feet and start running, but she paused when her hand came down on a shaft of wood. It was the better part of one of the legs from the dressing bench that had sat at the foot of the bed.</p> <p>So that was what she\u2019d landed on, Valerie thought as she noted that the once rectangular leg had splintered diagonally as the bench had collapsed. It left a rather pointed tip. A stake of sorts, she thought, grasping the item just as Igor\u2019s hand clamped onto her shoulder. His fingers dug painfully into skin and muscle as he jerked her over onto her back.</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t fight. Instead, she used the momentum to help her stake the oversized bastard in the chest. They both froze then and simply stared at each other, but then Valerie glanced down to his chest to see where she\u2019d got him. It had all happened so quickly, she hadn\u2019t had much chance to aim. Luck had been with her, however, because she\u2019d hit him dead on in the heart. If he had a heart, she thought grimly, refusing to feel guilty for what she\u2019d just done.</p><p>A raspy breath from Igor drew her eyes back up as he released her. He stumbled back a step, gaping at the makeshift weapon in his chest, and then he suddenly fell back. Igor hit the hardwood floor with a solid thump that didn\u2019t cover the sound of his head cracking on the wood.</p><p>For a moment, Valerie allowed herself the luxury of simply staying where she was. Her chest was burning where Igor had landed the punch that had sent her flying, her head was pounding like crazy from its meeting with the floor, and the rest of her body\u2014her back especially\u2014was complaining about the abuse it had suffered when she\u2019d landed on the bench. But she\u2019d felled the monster who had subjected them all to such rough treatment and humiliation.</p><p>Well, one of the monsters, Valerie acknowledged on a sigh. Igor was not the one in charge. He worked for the bastard who had dragged her off the street and brought her here. And since Igor had been preparing her for dinner, his boss was no doubt expected back soon. She didn\u2019t have time to sit about re-gathering her strength or nursing boo-boos.</p><p>Grimacing, Valerie forced herself to sit up straight, then grabbed the nearest bedpost and pulled herself to her feet. Her head spun and a shaft of pain shot through her back, but she managed to get upright. As she waited for the spinning to stop, Valerie glanced down and saw that there was a bloodstained piece of wood poking up through the also bloodstained upholstered seat of the broken bench she\u2019d landed on. It seemed Igor wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d gotten staked.</p><p>A quick search revealed that the back right side of her filthy T-shirt was bloodstained. Valerie jerked up the cloth and craned her head to get a better view of the damage. Much to her relief, it looked like it was just a flesh wound. It was bleeding freely, but as far as she could tell, no vital organs had been hit.</p><p>Valerie pressed her hand to the wound, trying to slow the loss of blood, and then spared a glance for Igor. He lay prone, seemingly dead. Reassured, she turned her attention to the room itself. There was a phone on the bedside table farthest from the en suite bathroom. Like the d\u00e9cor, the phone was old, but she didn\u2019t care so long as it worked.</p><p>Pushing away from the post, Valerie moved to the bedside table, a bit alarmed to find she was unsteady on her feet. Ignoring it, she dialed 911.</p><p>Her legs were shaking and her head swimming as she waited for her call to be answered. Afraid she\u2019d collapse, Valerie almost sat on the bed, but then changed her mind. She might not be able to get back up.</p><p>Fortunately, the table was between the bed and the outer wall, and a window was only a foot away. Pulling the old-fashioned cord taut, she eased to the window and leaned against the sill as her call was answered.</p><p>\u201c911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the police and an ambulance. Immediately,\u201d Valerie said, frowning at how weak and shaky her voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your emergency and the address?\u201d the dispatcher asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the address. I\u2019ve been kidnapped and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnapped?\u201d the dispatcher interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes. And there are six other women in the basement. Or were,\u201d she added grimly, glancing toward Igor. \u201cI think he took too much blood and one or possibly even two of them might be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook too much blood?\u201d the dispatcher asked, surprise showing in his previously professional voice. \u201cDid you say you\u2019ve been kidnapped, ma\u2019am? And were these other women kidnapped too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019ll need more than one ambulance. I\u2019m wounded, Igor\u2019s dead, and then there are the other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgor?\u201d the dispatcher\u2019s voice took on an edge of suspicion as he picked out the name Valerie and the other women had given to their caretaker. \u201cDid you say that Igor is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, closing her eyes with frustration and wishing she\u2019d kept that bit for the emergency workers to learn when they got there. Since she hadn\u2019t, she had to explain or risk the dispatcher thinking she was crazy. \u201cLook, Igor\u2019s just the name we called him. None of us knew his real name. He was the one who fed us and fetched us from our cages for his boss to bite us. And, yes, I\u2019m pretty sure I killed him. I staked him in the heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you say bite? And that you staked him in the heart?\u201d There was definite suspicion now. No doubt he now thought she was pulling a prank call or something.</p><p>Valerie leaned her cheek wearily against the window. The glass was cold against her skin as she tried to clear her increasingly sluggish thoughts and sort out the best way to ensure her call was taken seriously and help was sent.</p><p>She finally said, \u201cI realize some of what I\u2019ve said probably sounds crazy and I\u2019m sorry. The man who kidnapped us is a nutcase. He likes to play vampire and bite us. But I think he took too much blood from Janey and Beth. They haven\u2019t talked much the last couple nights and if they aren\u2019t dead, they\u2019re probably dying. You need to send help, EMTs and the police, lots of them, and fast. He\u2014\u201d She paused and stiffened as she became aware of a faraway whirring sound. The automatic garage door opening, she realized as adrenaline shot through her. It was probably the only modern item in this place and she was grateful as hell for the warning it was giving her.</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d the dispatcher asked when she went silent.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back. Send help,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s back?\u201d the dispatcher asked.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think?\u201d she asked harshly. \u201cThe man who kidnapped us. And when he gets up here and sees that Igor is dead, he\u2019ll probably kill me and maybe even the other women. Send help now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, just stay calm. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you traced the call yet? Do you know the address?\u201d she interrupted, and then as the whirring stopped she added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll leave the phone off the hook. Trace the call and send help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I need you to remain calm and stay on the line. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I need an UZI and silver bullets, but I guess we\u2019re both out of luck,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the phone off the hook and booking it. Trace the call and send help,\u201d she repeated grimly as the whirring below started again. The garage door closing, obviously, Valerie thought as she set the phone on the table. He\u2019d parked and would enter the house and come up here next. She only had moments.</p><p>Rather than risk moving back through the house and running into the monster she was trying to escape, Valerie turned to the window, relieved when it slid up easily. She was even more relieved to find there was no screen to have to deal with. Thank God it was an old house and obviously let go. If it had been a new house with those fancy newfangled windows that didn\u2019t open all the way and had screens, she\u2019d have had to take a chance and leave the room to find an exit.</p><p>Valerie leaned out the window and peered down. She was on the second floor overlooking a large backyard. There was no handy tree or trellis to climb down from, but bushes lined the house below. If nothing else, they\u2019d break her fall.</p><p>Grimacing at the thought, she swung one leg over to straddle the ledge, then paused as she heard a door close somewhere in the house. Probably the door from the garage to the house, Valerie realized and threw her other leg over the ledge, only to pause again. There was a window below this one. She didn\u2019t know the layout of the house very well and had no idea if he might now be in the room below her. If he was and he saw her drop past the window . . .</p> <p>Valerie closed her eyes and forced herself to wait and listen to the faint sounds of movement in the house. But the moment she heard the thud of footsteps on the stairs, she pushed herself off the ledge.</p><p>Anders stepped out onto the porch and sucked in a breath of fresh air. The house he\u2019d just left didn\u2019t smell pretty, but then the situation it presented wasn\u2019t pretty either. He hadn\u2019t seen many worse.</p><p>Spotting Justin Bricker coming back up the driveway, he started down the porch steps, asking, \u201cDid you handle the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone and dusted,\u201d Bricker assured him as they both stopped. Glancing curiously to the house, he asked, \u201cDid you find the caller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anders said grimly, his gaze now sliding over the house as well. Their team had been brought here thanks to a 911 call that had suggested there might be something unusual about the situation. One didn\u2019t usually wish for silver bullets or stake mortal attackers.</p><p>All 911 calls were monitored for anything that might include rogue activity in need of cleaning up. This call had definitely fit that bill, but they\u2019d arrived to find the mortal police already on scene. A quick read of their minds had alerted Anders and the others to the fact that this was no crank call and that inside they would find seven cages in the basement: one empty, five holding live women, and one with a dead woman. There were also half a dozen corpses in a back room. All of them, both the living and dead, had bite marks that had completely bewildered the mortal officers.</p><p>Unable to open the locks on the cages, the officers had done a cursory search of the main and upper floor of the house for the 911 caller, but then had come outside to call for back up, and find something to break open the locks on the cages and release the women. That was when Anders and the others had arrived. While Bricker had seen to erasing the memories of the police officers, the rest of the Enforcers had entered the house.</p><p>They\u2019d searched the main and upper floor first, much more thoroughly than the police had. When that hadn\u2019t turned up the 911 caller, the others had gone to the basement to free and tend the caged women while Anders came out to continue the search for the missing woman.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an open window in the master bedroom. She may have escaped,\u201d Anders announced now.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Bricker grimaced. \u201cIf she gets to the authorities and tells them about this she\u2019ll undo all the work I just did erasing those cops\u2019 memories before sending them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. She\u2019s wounded,\u201d Anders said. He didn\u2019t bother mentioning that there were signs of a fight and a hell of a lot of blood in the master bedroom. Or that if even half of that blood was hers, she couldn\u2019t have got far on her own.</p><p>\u201cWounded, huh?\u201d Bricker frowned at the house. \u201cShe might not have got away at all then. The rogue might have caught and taken her with him. He did return during her call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA possibility,\u201d Anders acknowledged and thought it would be a shame if it were true. How terrible would it be if this nameless, faceless caller had escaped long enough to alert the authorities, saving the other women, only to be recaptured and taken by the rogue before those authorities arrived to save her?</p><p>\u201cI suppose we have to be sure, though,\u201d Bricker muttered.</p><p>Anders nodded. \u201cDecker and Mortimer are seeing to the women in the basement while we look around and make sure she isn\u2019t lying out here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Bricker\u2019s gaze slid over the house front again. \u201cWhere was the open window?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer, Anders turned and led the way around to the back of the house.</p><p>They\u2019d rounded the corner and Anders had just spotted the open second-floor window of the master bedroom when Bricker\u2019s phone began to ring. Pausing, he glanced to the younger man as he retrieved his phone and checked the caller I.D. When Bricker then sighed, Anders raised his eyebrow in question. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lucian.\u201d The explanation was accompanied by a grimace.</p><p>Anders managed to smother the smile that tried to claim his lips. Lucian was the head of the Immortal Council as well as the Enforcers who hunted down those who ignored or broke council laws. He also had a wife who was a week overdue giving birth to their child . . . which was making the man a little crazy and prone to annoy his Enforcers with phone calls to keep on top of things.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better take it then,\u201d he suggested mildly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Bricker sighed the word and then muttered, \u201cHe probably wants me to pick up something else Leigh is craving. Lord knows he couldn\u2019t leave her alone and go get it himself.\u201d</p><p>Lips twitching, Anders left him to it and continued forward alone. It was late, past midnight, but there was a full moon tonight and his eyes worked nearly as well in the darkness as in light. He headed first for the bushes along the back of the house, eyes scanning for any signs of disturbance or blood on the ground as he went. Anders was standing in the dirt below the window before he saw any indicators of someone having been that way. The bush there was crushed, with broken branches, and loose leaves lying around it. The dirt surrounding it was also disturbed.</p><p>Anders followed the trail along the back of the house for ten feet and then paused when he spotted a foot sticking out from under the bushes. His eyes moved past the bare foot to the bottom of a pair of jeans. But he couldn\u2019t see the rest of the body, which was well hidden by the bush.</p><p>It had to be the female who\u2019d made the 911 call, Anders decided. And from the markings in the dirt, it looked like she\u2019d dragged herself here and tried to hide herself under the bush before passing out . . . or dying, he thought grimly. The noise of his approach hadn\u2019t stirred her at all.</p><p>Bending, Anders caught her ankle and stepped back, dragging her out from under the foliage. She was a young woman with a filthy face, and equally dirty long, light brown hair. Her clothes were an utter mess, the jeans looking more brown than blue, and her T-shirt was both dirty and bloodstained, leaving only a patch here or there to tell that it had once been white. Her chest was rising and lowering though. She was alive.</p><p>Squatting, Anders tugged her T-shirt up in search of wounds, but brought it quickly back down when he saw that her chest was not only woundless, but braless. He sat her up then and immediately spotted the puncture wound on the side of her lower back. It was a good-sized hole, and still bleeding, he noted, but didn\u2019t want to tend to it here in the dirt. He had to get her back to the van and the first-aid kit there.</p><p>Anders was scooping her up off the ground when he heard Bricker speak behind him.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s found her.\u201d</p><p>A glance over his shoulder showed Bricker approaching, his phone still pressed to his ear.</p><p>\u201cLucian wants to know if she\u2019s alive,\u201d Bricker said, pausing behind him.</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d Anders straightened with his burden. \u201cWounded though. Her back. She needs Dani or Rachel to look at her.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Bricker to relay that information, Anders started away. He\u2019d just reached the front yard when Bricker caught up.</p><p>\u201cLucian says we\u2019re to bring her to his house,\u201d Bricker announced, falling into step beside him. \u201cHe wants to talk to her as soon as she\u2019s conscious. He\u2019ll have Dani or Rachel come there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best go tell Mortimer then,\u201d Anders said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you at the van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Bricker split away and headed for the front porch, leaving Anders to carry his burden to the van. He managed to get the side door open on his own with a little juggling of the woman, then set her inside and reached for the first-aid kit they always brought along. He had turned her on her side and was cleaning her wound when she regained consciousness and cried out in pain. Anders automatically slipped into her thoughts to soothe her so he could finish his work unhindered. And failed.</p><p>Eyes widening with surprise, he peered at the woman more closely, noting that she had a pretty face under all that dirt, and that her hair was a greasy blond rather than the light brown he\u2019d first thought. She also had beautiful green eyes that were staring up at him uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She continued to stare, eyes searching . . . for what he didn\u2019t know, but apparently she found it because she suddenly relaxed, some of the fear slipping from her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked, trying to slip into her thoughts again. But it was no use. He couldn\u2019t get into her head. And that never happened.</p><p>\u201cValerie.\u201d The name was a rasp of sound.</p><p>\u201cValerie,\u201d Anders repeated softly. It suited her, he thought and said, \u201cYou\u2019re safe, but wounded. I need to stop the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in understanding.</p><p>Anders hesitated, but there was nothing he could do to lessen her pain and it needed to be done, so he set to it and quickly finished cleaning the wound. He wasn\u2019t terribly surprised when she passed out halfway through his work. She\u2019d lost a lot of blood and between that and the pain he was unintentionally causing . . . well, he was just surprised that she\u2019d withstood it as long as she had without screaming in pain.</p><p>By the time Bricker rejoined him, Anders was done cleaning and bandaging the wound and simply standing at the door of the van staring at the mortal woman.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to drive?\u201d Bricker asked, peering curiously at the woman in the van.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Anders hadn\u2019t intended to say that, but wasn\u2019t surprised when the word slipped out. It was a good idea. Bricker could drive and he could ride in the back with Valerie. If she woke during the journey, he would be there to keep her calm and prevent her doing herself further injury during the drive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s move,\u201d he ordered, getting into the back and pulling the door closed.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Valerie woke up feeling like a train wreck victim. Every inch of her seemed to be aching or sore. But when she tried to shift to a more comfortable position she learned her back right side was the worst. Moving had sent a shaft of pain shooting through her that made her suck in a sharp breath. Memory followed on the heels of the pain, crashing into her head like an angry bull. Her eyes immediately shot open. They just as quickly blinked closed when they were assaulted by bright light. After ten days spent mostly in utter darkness, it appeared her eyes were sensitive. But she had to know where she was and what the situation was. Valerie was pretty sure she was no longer lying in the dirt outside the house of horrors, but where was she now? Had help come? Was she in a hospital? Or had her kidnapper spotted her outside on the ground under his bushes and taken her with him? The bright light rather than the pitch black she was used to suggested she was safe, but Valerie had to know for sure.</p> <p>She forced her eyes open a crack, and then a little more, and more still until she could make out the white ceiling overhead. That was reassuring, she told herself and opened her eyes a little further, her head shifting on what felt like a pillow so that she could take in her surroundings. The first thing she saw was an IV stand to her left with a half-empty bag of clear liquid in it.</p><p>She allowed herself to relax a little then, but continued to force her eyes open and peer around. Some of her tension returned when she noted the dark wood furnishings in the room and the pale blue walls. She was lying in a sleigh bed, but there was also a dresser, two bedside tables, and then a chair against the wall on one side of the bed, and two chairs and a small table by a window with baby blue blinds on the other side of the bed. It was all very attractive and soothing . . . and not a hospital.</p><p>That realization had her trying to sit up. It was a bit of a struggle. She was weak and so achy and sore everywhere, but she managed the feat and followed it up with removing the IV needle from the back of her left hand.</p><p>Valerie gave herself a moment to enjoy the first accomplishment, then shifted her feet to the floor and eased off the edge of the mattress to stand on shaky legs. So far, so good, she told herself when they didn\u2019t collapse under her.</p><p>\u201cOh good, you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p> <p>That cheerful voice drew her gaze to the door to see a very pregnant brunette entering . . . extremely pregnant. The woman was petite everywhere except for having an almost freakishly huge stomach bulging out in front of her. Valerie didn\u2019t know how the woman was carrying that burden around without some kind of sling around it to aid her in bearing the weight.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m huge,\u201d the woman said, rubbing her stomach with a self-conscious laugh as she approached the bed.</p><p>Realizing she was staring rudely at the protuberance, Valerie forced her eyes to the woman\u2019s face. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>The question came out in a cracked, raspy voice and actually hurt her throat. It felt like someone had scoured the lining of her throat with an SOS pad while she was sleeping. Nasty.</p><p>\u201cA safe house,\u201d the brunette answered as she reached her side. She then leaned past her to pick up a glass of clear fluid from the bedside table. She offered the beverage to Valerie. \u201cIt\u2019s water. Room temperature by now, I\u2019m sure, but it will wet your whistle.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated, but then accepted the glass. She didn\u2019t know the brunette from Eve, but she\u2019d said this was a safe house, and the woman was pretty non-threatening. It was hard to imagine her being in league with the likes of Igor or his boss and drugging her water, so she risked it and took a tentative sip. When she didn\u2019t taste anything amiss, Valerie relaxed and gulped down half the glass in one go. The liquid was silky and soothing in her mouth and throat, and made her realize how parched she\u2019d been.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie murmured as she lowered the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d The brunette smiled widely and held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Leigh Argeneau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie Moyer,\u201d Val responded, placing her free hand in the woman\u2019s to shake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Valerie,\u201d Leigh said with a smile. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore, weak, and like I need a shower,\u201d Val answered honestly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re sore,\u201d Leigh said with a nod. \u201cYou took a heck of a beating. You have bruises everywhere, and your back wound is probably tender as well. I\u2019m afraid only time is going to help with that,\u201d she added apologetically. \u201cBut we can do something about a shower. Can you walk on your own, or shall I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d Valerie assured her.</p><p>\u201cThen follow me,\u201d Leigh said, turning on her heel. She headed for a door on the other side of the bed, adding, \u201cThe weakness shouldn\u2019t last long. You lost a lot of blood before our doctor could get you sewn up, but she gave you a couple of pints to replace it before switching you to saline in the IV. Hopefully, between that and the fact that you only sustained a flesh wound, you should quickly regain your strength and feel more yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie didn\u2019t comment, but suspected Leigh was right. She was already feeling less shaky, and suspected after a shower and some food she\u2019d feel better still. She couldn\u2019t wait. But she also had some questions. \u201cThis safe house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my home,\u201d Leigh said as she opened the door and led her into a bathroom decorated in dark shades of blue. Casting a smile over her shoulder, she added, \u201cWell, mine and my husband\u2019s, Lucian. He runs the Enforcement team that responded to your 911 call.\u201d She paused and then turned to Valerie to admit, \u201cWell, actually Mortimer is the one in charge of the men, but he answers to Lucian.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAnyway, they found the other women in the basement and then searched and found you in the bushes. They took the other women to the Enforcer house, but brought you here so the doctor could tend you. It\u2019s for the best,\u201d she added quickly when Valerie frowned at the knowledge that she\u2019d been separated from the other women. \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough beds at the Enforcer house for all of you and this way you could get more individual attention.\u201d</p><p>Valerie relaxed and nodded, but asked, \u201cWhy not a hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kidnapper got away and they were afraid you wouldn\u2019t be safe in a hospital,\u201d Leigh said quietly.</p><p>Valerie stiffened at this news. She\u2019d killed Igor, but his boss, the one behind all of the ills that had befallen her, had got away with it. Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe here,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cLucian won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t comment. She was more pissed than worried about the escape of Igor\u2019s boss. She might have been knocked out and dragged off once, but she wouldn\u2019t allow it to happen again. And she resented the fact that the bastard had got away with it. However, there was nothing she could do about that, so she pushed the thoughts away as Leigh said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone to take your bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather shower than bathe,\u201d she said with a grimace.</p><p>Leigh paused at the door and turned to face Valerie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s better if you bathe this time. You aren\u2019t very steady on your feet and I don\u2019t want you to slip in the shower and add to the bruises and bumps you already have. Besides, Dani said you weren\u2019t to get your bandages wet and this is the easiest way to ensure that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cDr. Dani Pimms,\u201d Leigh explained. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who sewed you up and took care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie murmured, then sighed and moved to the tub to set the stopper and turn on the taps, muttering, \u201cI suppose a bath will have to do then.\u201d</p><p>Leigh smiled faintly at her grumbling, and moved over to collect a washcloth and towel from the cupboard beside the sink, saying, \u201cThe shampoo, conditioner, and soap are on the side of the tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie said, taking the towel and washcloth from her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I guess I\u2019ll leave you to it then,\u201d Leigh said cheerfully, moving to the door. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you aren\u2019t supposed to get your bandages wet, so you don\u2019t want the water too deep. I\u2019ll stay in the bedroom in case you run into any problems. Yell if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Valerie said, \u201cthank you,\u201d again as the door closed, then turned to survey the bath. The water was almost halfway up the tub and that was without her in it. She set the towel and washcloth on the closed toilet seat and turned off the water, then straightened and peered down at herself.</p><p>Her eyebrows rose as she took in the pretty white cotton nightgown she wore. It wasn\u2019t really her style. An overlarge T-shirt was her usual nightwear. Valerie suspected it was probably Leigh\u2019s, put on her after her arrival here.</p><p>Whether it was her style or not, she appreciated the loan. Her clothes had been filthy after ten days in them, but jumping out the window and crawling through the dirt under the bushes had made them positively disgusting.</p><p>Maybe even more disgusting than her hair presently was, she thought, catching sight of herself in the mirror over the sink. Either Leigh or the doctor had obviously made some attempt to clean her up because her face was clean, as were her arms, but her blond hair was greasy and limp, with clumps of dirt in it, and her scalp was brown between the strands. Cripes, she didn\u2019t recall landing after jumping out of the window, but if she were to guess from looking at her head, she\u2019d say she\u2019d landed on it.</p><p>Smiling slightly at the ridiculous thought, Valerie turned and quickly stripped off the nightgown, then stepped into the tub. She settled carefully into it, but had to shift her foot under her butt and sit on it to keep her bandage above the water line. With all her aches and pains, it wasn\u2019t a comfortable position. It was going to be a fast bath.</p><p>As she quickly washed away almost two weeks of sweat and stench, Valerie thought of all the things she hadn\u2019t asked Leigh yet. Her host had said the other women had been taken to the Enforcer house, which Valerie assumed was a real safe house. But Leigh hadn\u2019t said how they were physically and mentally and that was something Valerie was wondering about now that she knew she was safe.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Leigh called through the door.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Valerie answered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably need help washing your hair,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re ready and I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie gave a noncommittal grunt, but she was now considering the problem. She couldn\u2019t just lie back and dunk her head in the water. She was supposed to keep her bandage dry.</p><p>Her gaze slid to the showerhead a good distance above the tub taps. It was one with a long metal-covered hose attached. It could be used as a normal showerhead, or removed from its holder and handheld for more interesting angles.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Valerie murmured as she stood up and stepped out of the tub. After quickly drying herself, she wrapped the towel around herself sarong style and then turned back to retrieve the handheld showerhead. She was standing outside of the tub, bent forward, soaking her head over the tub when she thought she heard her name. Pausing, she glanced toward the door and listened, but wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d heard anything or not over the rush of water. Then the door suddenly opened and Leigh peered worriedly in.</p><p>\u201cOh, good, you\u2019re all right,\u201d she said, and then set another white cotton gown on the counter as she explained, \u201cI stepped out for a minute to fetch you a fresh nightgown and called out to be sure you were okay when I got back, but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d She hesitated, then stepped into the room, saying, \u201cLet me help with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d Valerie assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can, but it will be faster with help and I\u2019m concerned about you pulling your stitches.\u201d</p><p>Since the stitches in her back were already tugging a bit painfully, Valerie didn\u2019t protest further. The moment she lowered her arms, the pulling eased so she supposed it was for the best.</p><p>\u201cI meant to ask earlier,\u201d she said as Leigh finished dampening her hair and squirted on some shampoo. \u201cHow are the other women? Did they all make it out all right?\u201d</p><p>Leigh was silent as she finished lathering her hair, then sighed and admitted, \u201cI\u2019m afraid one of the women was dead when the men arrived. Another died during the first night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany and Janey,\u201d Valerie said, her mouth tightening. If she were walking down the street and ran into any one of the women from that house of horrors, she wouldn\u2019t even recognize them. She only knew them as voices in the dark, but those voices had helped keep her sane. They\u2019d all encouraged and given each other hope in that hell. However, Bethany and Janey had grown quieter each day she\u2019d been there. Janey had fallen completely silent the second to last night there, Bethany that last night. Valerie had feared the worst and it seemed her fears had been well founded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe others are all right though,\u201d Leigh continued encouragingly as she started to rinse out the shampoo. \u201cOne or two were pretty weak, but bounced back after a few good meals and a couple nights\u2019 sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple nights\u2019 sleep?\u201d Valerie asked with a start and instinctively tried to turn her head to look at her, but jerked her head down again when she got a face full of water.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Are you all right? Do you want a towel or something to dry your face?\u201d Leigh asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right.\u201d Valerie wiped the worst of the water away with her fingers. She then asked, \u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should have said,\u201d Leigh muttered as she rinsed her hair. \u201cThis is the third night that you\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here three nights?\u201d Valerie asked with disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of it until waking up here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Leigh assured her. \u201cDani cleaned the wound and gave you antibiotics the minute she got to you, but it was too late. Infection had already set in. You were feverish until this morning. There. All done,\u201d Leigh added and quickly turned off the water. \u201cHang on, I\u2019ll get you a towel for your hair.\u201d</p><p>Valerie remained bent over the tub and wrung out her hair as Leigh set the showerhead back in its holder and moved away. The woman was back at her side a moment later with a towel in hand.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Valerie took the towel and wrapped it around her head before straightening.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Leigh asked as Valerie turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cMuch,\u201d she said and meant it. She already felt a hundred times better. After something to eat and drink, Valerie was sure she\u2019d be almost completely back to normal . . . well, except for some aches and pains and a healing gore wound in her back, she acknowledged wryly to herself. But she was used to aches and pains. Valerie had taken martial arts since she was five and had been in competition since shortly after she started. Bumps and bruises were the norm for her.</p><p>\u201cOne of the men is going to fetch clothes for you from your house, but for now I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re stuck with this,\u201d Leigh said, picking up the fresh nightgown she\u2019d brought for her.</p><p>Valerie peered from the nightgown to Leigh and asked carefully, \u201cHow do they know where my house is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was on your driver\u2019s license. They found your wallet the night they raided the house. No purse though, just a wallet and some keys in the pocket of a coat in your cage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a purse,\u201d Valerie said, relaxing. Smiling faintly, she added, \u201cSo you didn\u2019t need me to introduce myself earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leigh acknowledged. \u201cBut introductions are always a nice way to start a conversation.\u201d</p><p>For some reason that drew a small laugh from Valerie. Shaking her head, she took the nightgown Leigh was holding out. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Leigh said, and then glanced toward the bathroom door as a knock sounded from the other room. \u201cThat will be Anders. He\u2019s the Enforcer who found you at the house. My husband assigned him the task of keeping you safe until they catch the rogue who kidnapped you and the other women,\u201d she explained and then grinned and added, \u201cHe\u2019s here to guard your body.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled faintly at her teasing, but asked, \u201cEnforcer? You keep saying that. You mean police officer, don\u2019t you? Or is he RCMP?\u201d</p><p>Leigh hesitated, and then said, \u201cThey\u2019re neither police nor Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They\u2019re a special unit that handle unique cases such as yours.\u201d Before Valerie could ask any more questions, she added, \u201cWhile you were bathing I went down and asked him to fetch you some soup. You haven\u2019t eaten since you got here and must be starved.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. Not only had she not eaten in the three days since getting here, she\u2019d refused to eat for four days before that to avoid the drugs they were putting in the oatmeal. She wasn\u2019t complaining. It had worked and she was free, but one of the aches and pains she was suffering was definitely gnawing of hunger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him in. Come on out when you\u2019re ready,\u201d Leigh said, opening the bathroom door. \u201cThere\u2019s a hairbrush in the drawer to the right of the sink.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie waited until the door closed behind the woman, then let her towel drop and quickly pulled the borrowed nightgown on over her head. She had a lot of questions, but most of them could wait until after she\u2019d eaten. She had no idea what the special unit was that Anders and Leigh\u2019s husband worked for, but apparently the 911 dispatcher had sent them in response to her call. Or perhaps the police had responded first and these Enforcers had taken over when it turned out to be a kidnapping. Kidnapping was a federal offense, wasn\u2019t it? Or was that only in the States?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. She was free and safe. The other women were free and safe. She was hungry and everything else could wait until she\u2019d eaten.</p><p>Valerie moved to the sink and peered at her reflection. Her face was pale but clean. It was her neck though that drew her attention. A large, angry red scab covered the right side of her throat; a second almost healed wound was on the left side.</p><p>Mementos from the house of horrors, Valerie thought grimly and wished she had a scarf or something to cover them. She didn\u2019t, however, and wishing wouldn\u2019t make one appear, so it was best just not to worry about it, she told herself and tugged the towel from her head. Her hair fell around her shoulders wet and tangled and she searched in the drawer for the brush Leigh had mentioned. It was exactly where she\u2019d promised it would be and Valerie quickly dragged it through her hair until all the tangles were gone and her hair lay in quickly drying waves around her face and neck. It wasn\u2019t as good as a scarf, but hid the worst of her neck and the wounds with it.</p><p>Deciding she was ready, Valerie turned and opened the door to head back into the bedroom, but then paused in the doorway. Leigh was standing at the table by the window, taking bowls and spoons from a tray and setting them out in front of each of the two chairs. But it was the tall man dressed all in black that brought her to a halt. She watched silently as he carried the third chair from the other side of the bed to join the two at the table, noting that he was slim hipped and had a narrow waist, but that in comparison his arms and chest were rather large under his tight T-shirt. He had one of those gorgeous figures that sculptors loved to sculpt and companies hired to model their swimsuits and underwear. She could imagine him sprawled on a beach, skin glistening with suntan lotion, lips spread in a wide smile and those big beautiful eyes dancing with the joy of life.</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t know why that thought popped into her head. He was nowhere near smiling right now. In fact, his face was expressionless and kind of grim.</p><p>Leigh had talked about an Anders, and Valerie presumed this was him. She hadn\u2019t expected him to still be here, though. She\u2019d expected he\u2019d bring up the soup and leave, but it looked as if he were going to join them.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Leigh said cheerfully, and when Valerie glanced her way, she gestured to the seat across from her and said, \u201cCome, sit down while the soup is hot.\u201d</p><p>Valerie moved to the chair and paused behind it, her attention on the bowl Leigh had set at that place setting. It appeared to hold a beef soup, hearty and thick with potatoes, carrots, turnip, and what appeared to be homemade noodles. It smelled amazing and the gnawing in Valerie\u2019s stomach quadrupled in response.</p><p>Swallowing the saliva suddenly filling her mouth, she glanced toward the man as he set down the chair he\u2019d fetched, placing it between hers and Leigh\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThis is Anders,\u201d Leigh introduced as she took a glass of milk from the tray and set it beside Valerie\u2019s bowl.</p><p>Valerie nodded at the man and he nodded back.</p><p>Leigh raised an eyebrow at the silent greetings, and then shook her head and said, \u201cSit down and eat, Valerie. You must be starved.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need a third invitation. Valerie sat down, glancing around with a start when Anders moved up behind her chair to shift it in for her. It was an old-fashioned, courtly gesture that she didn\u2019t recall ever having witnessed outside of old movies. She\u2019d certainly never enjoyed it herself until now . . . and for some reason it left her a little flustered.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she muttered, embarrassed when her voice came out raspy.</p><p>When Anders merely grunted in response, Leigh pursed her lips and said dryly, \u201cHe\u2019s a man of few words.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled crookedly and turned her attention to the bowl of food in front of her. The most delicious aroma was coming from it, and her stomach was growling impatiently and tying itself in knots demanding she feed it. She scooped up a spoonful of the fragrant meal and raised it to her lips for a tentative taste. She could have wept when the flavor burst on her tongue. It was hearty and so flavorful. Definitely homemade. Valerie dug in with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, woman,\u201d Leigh said on a laugh a moment later. \u201cI\u2019m pleased you\u2019re enjoying my cooking, but you haven\u2019t eaten in a while. Your stomach may not be able to handle too much too fast.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grimaced, but set her spoon down for a moment to allow her food to settle. She drank some milk while she waited, something she hadn\u2019t had since she was a kid, but she figured it couldn\u2019t hurt. Milk was good for you, right? Unfortunately, things that were good for you often didn\u2019t taste good. Valerie didn\u2019t care for milk and set it back with a grimace after one sip.</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d She glanced to Leigh in question.</p><p>\u201cThe other women were fed one meal daily. But when Dani examined you, she seemed to think you hadn\u2019t eaten for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was given oatmeal and fruit once a day like the other women,\u201d Valerie said slowly. \u201cBut I figured out that the oatmeal was drugged to keep us docile, so I stopped eating. The night I called 911 was the fourth night I didn\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they let you simply not eat?\u201d Leigh asked.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Valerie smiled grimly. \u201cThe other girls warned me that if I didn\u2019t eat, Igor would force-feed me, so I hid my daily portion in my jacket, bunched up in a corner of my cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that explains it,\u201d Leigh said with amusement, and then told her, \u201cOne of the Enforcers said your coat was soiled. He thought it was vomit. Must have been the oatmeal.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded.</p><p>\u201cIgor didn\u2019t catch on?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>Valerie glanced at him, startled by his deep sexy voice. She shouldn\u2019t have been, because it suited him perfectly, she thought, and then turned her attention to her soup and picked up her spoon again. \u201cHe would have had I been there much longer. It was starting to smell.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and then said, \u201cTell us about Igor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnders, let her eat,\u201d Leigh said, sounding annoyed. \u201cYou can grill her for information later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Valerie said quickly. She didn\u2019t think she had much information that could help them, but if she did and it led to the capture of Igor\u2019s boss, she was willing to answer now.</p><p>Turning to Anders, she peered at him for a moment. Up close he was even more good-looking. It wasn\u2019t just his body that would look good in glossy prints, his face was worth a look or ten. His skin was a lovely mocha, perfect and unblemished, his eyes, large and black with what appeared to be gold flecks in them, though she was sure it was pale brown and a trick of light or something. His lips were nice too, full and soft looking. They were the only thing on the man that looked soft though. He definitely worked out. As she\u2019d noted, his chest was ripped, the muscles rippling under his tight T-shirt. His shoulders were wide, his arms muscular and his stomach flat. She was now curious to see him from behind. She suspected he\u2019d have a nice tush too.</p><p>Startled by the path her mind had taken, Valerie cleared her throat and glanced down at her soup as she tried to gather her thoughts. What had they been talking about?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure a description of Igor can wait a few minutes while we finish our soup,\u201d Leigh said gently.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d Valerie said with relief as her memory was nudged. He wanted to know about Igor, she thought and then raised her head and stared at Anders. \u201cWhy would you need a description? You should have seen him. He was the dead man on the bedroom floor.\u201d</p><p>When Anders and Leigh exchanged a silent glance, she sat back slowly in her seat. \u201cHe is dead, right? I killed him. At least, I think I did. He should have been there on the floor.\u201d</p><p>When Anders just shook his head, Leigh suggested, \u201cHis boss must have taken him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It would have slowed him down. He wouldn\u2019t bother. Unless he wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d Valerie frowned at the possibility. She\u2019d never thought that she\u2019d want to hurt anyone, let alone take their life. But after her experiences in the house of horrors, she was coming to think there just might be some people that didn\u2019t deserve to live. Was that horrible? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps this Igor was dead and was taken because his identity would reveal his boss\u2019s identity,\u201d Leigh suggested.</p><p>\u201cHow did you kill him?\u201d Anders asked and for some reason the question made Leigh glance at him sharply.</p><p>\u201cI stake\u2014stabbed him with one of the legs from a broken bench,\u201d she answered and then added, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I got him in the heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou made the 911 call right afterward?\u201d Anders asked and when she nodded, added, \u201cAnd his master returned during the call. That couldn\u2019t have been more than five minutes later.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyebrows rose at the use of the word master, but she nodded again.</p><p>Leigh and Anders exchanged another glance and then Leigh said, \u201cThen I\u2019m sure he was dead.\u201d</p><p>The woman was a rotten liar. It seemed obvious that she wasn\u2019t sure at all, but Valerie didn\u2019t know how that could be. Unless everything she\u2019d witnessed, and all the suspicions the other women had spoken were true. A vampire? But that was ridiculous. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cThe other women said you arrived ten days before the 911 call,\u201d Anders said now, distracting her from pursuing that line of thought . . . which was probably good. She was pretty sure that way lay madness.</p> <p>Nodding in response to his question, Valerie peered down at her soup, staring at the bits of beef and potato half submerged in the thick broth. \u201cThat\u2019s my count too. Ten days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere and when did he grab you?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cTen o\u2019clock on Wednesday night. I was walking Roxy before bed and . . .\u201d She paused at the thought of her dog. Despite her own situation, she\u2019d worried repeatedly about Roxy while in the house of horrors, but this was the first time she\u2019d given a thought to the German shepherd since waking up here. That realization roused some guilt in her. Had anyone found Roxy or fed her these past two weeks?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go look for her,\u201d Valerie said, pushing back her chair.</p><p>\u201cFor who?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cRoxy,\u201d Leigh explained as he stood and stepped in front of Valerie as she got to her feet.</p> <p>Valerie stared at the wall that was Anders\u2019s chest, noting with some distraction that he smelled rather lovely, and that his chest was incredibly wide, his tight T-shirt seeming to highlight the curve of his muscles and\u2014why was it so warm all of a sudden? She wondered as a wave of heat slid over her. Perhaps her fever hadn\u2019t completely passed, she worried, unaware that Leigh had stood up too and moved around the table until she touched her arm, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Relieved by the distraction, Valerie turned to Leigh, but asked with confusion. \u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo searching for Roxy. You\u2019re in no shape to go anywhere just yet. You need to rest and recover,\u201d Leigh said.</p><p>Roxy, Valerie remembered. How could she forget Roxy? Frowning, she gave her head a shake and said, \u201cShe\u2019s been out there for two weeks, Leigh. Anything could have happened to her. She might be at the pound. What if they put her to sleep or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t put her to sleep,\u201d Leigh assured her firmly, urging her back into her chair. \u201cShe has a license, doesn\u2019t she? Maybe even a name tag with your number on it? They\u2019d know she has a home and have probably been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd haven\u2019t been able to find me. I should go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got any clothes, Valerie,\u201d Leigh pointed out patiently. \u201cAnd you\u2019re taller than me. None of my clothes would fit you. The best thing you can do right now is sit down and eat and rebuild your strength. I\u2019ll call around to the animal shelters myself while you eat. Go on,\u201d she added firmly when Valerie didn\u2019t pick up her spoon right away. She didn\u2019t wait for her to start, but turned away, saying, \u201cAnders, make sure she eats while I make the calls.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p> <p>Anders watched Valerie as Leigh left the room. The woman\u2019s expression was full of concern and dissatisfaction. She obviously cared for, and wasn\u2019t pleased not to be looking for, her pet. His gaze slid over Valerie, noting that her hair was nearly dry and now fell in soft, golden waves around her face. Her clean face, he noted. Anders hadn\u2019t seen Valerie since delivering her to the Enforcer house. The dirt that had covered her then had hidden what he now saw were very fine features.</p><p>The woman had incredible eyes: wide, almost emerald green, with long thick lashes surrounding them. She had a pert nose and lips that were lovely: full and puffy like tiny perfect, pale, rose pillows that needed kissing. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cDo I have something on my face?\u201d</p><p>Anders\u2019s gaze flickered at the question as he realized he\u2019d been caught staring. Shaking his head in answer to her question, he glanced away, but then he shifted his eyes back and gestured to her bowl. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>Valerie picked up her spoon, but she didn\u2019t start eating. Instead, she simply fiddled with the utensil and bit her lip, her gaze shooting to the door again. Thinking about her dog, he guessed.</p><p>Sighing, she set down the spoon. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not hungry anymore. I mean, it\u2019s very good, but it is a very thick soup, more like stew, really, and I haven\u2019t eaten much lately. I should be hungry, ravenous even. I\u2019ve always been a healthy eater, and . . .\u201d She paused, biting her lip, and then muttered, \u201cSorry. I\u2019m rambling. I guess I\u2019m worried about Roxy.\u201d</p><p>Anders began loading Leigh\u2019s empty bowl and glass back onto the tray, and simply said, \u201cDrink your milk and finish telling me about the night you were taken.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, but didn\u2019t speak right away. Instead, her expression became thoughtful and Anders suspected she was mentally taking herself back to the night she\u2019d been kidnapped. It worried him. He couldn\u2019t read or control her. If putting herself back in that moment upset her to the point of hysterics, he couldn\u2019t slip into her mind and soothe her. He was just thinking that it might have been better if he\u2019d waited for Leigh or someone else to be present to ask these questions, when she began to speak. Much to his relief, her voice was perfectly calm.</p><p>\u201cIt all happened very fast. I\u2019m not even sure what exactly took place. I remember Roxy going suddenly still and barking, and then I felt someone grab me . . .\u201d She paused and Anders watched her closely. Several expressions flickered across her face in quick succession. Fear, anxiety, and anger were among them. Finally she said unhappily, \u201cI think he kicked Roxy. I remember her yelping in pain and then he dragged me up against his chest and . . .\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated again and he suspected she was trying to decide what she should and shouldn\u2019t tell him. No doubt she felt mentioning fangs and being bitten might make him think she was crazy. He wasn\u2019t surprised when she suddenly shook her head and muttered, \u201cThe next thing I knew I woke up in that cage in the dark. My neck was bleeding and I was weak and disoriented. I couldn\u2019t see anything, but I could feel the bars of my cage and hear a woman sobbing. I called out and . . .\u201d She closed her eyes briefly before continuing, \u201cThey answered one by one, scared voices in the dark; Cindy, Bethany, Janey, Kathy, Billie, and Laura. One of us for every night of the week.\u201d Swallowing, she met his gaze and said, \u201cLeigh told me Bethany and Janey didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>It was a statement rather than a question, but he nodded anyway, verifying that it was true.</p><p>Valerie sagged in her seat, looking more resigned than anything as she said, \u201cBoth of them sounded pretty weak and exhausted the night I arrived. They just got worse as the days passed. They\u2019d been there the longest and weren\u2019t doing well. I guess that\u2019s why they weren\u2019t taken up the first week I was there. It was only five days after I was kidnapped that I was taken upstairs myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ate at first?\u201d he asked, but thought she must have. She\u2019d been there ten days. She wouldn\u2019t have had the strength to do what she had if she hadn\u2019t eaten the whole time.</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cThe first daily ration of oatmeal and fruit was brought around the night after I got there. At least I\u2019m guessing it was a full day and night after.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIgor took Cindy upstairs after passing out the bowls. I asked the others why he\u2019d taken her and where, but they didn\u2019t want to talk about it and just told me to eat or Igor would force-feed me. I was starved, so I ate.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThings got pretty fuzzy after that. I know he came back and cleaned Cindy\u2019s cage while she was gone. But I don\u2019t think he collected the bowls until he brought Cindy back. I\u2019m not sure. Like I said, things got fuzzy and all I wanted to do was sleep.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI should have realized it was the oatmeal, that it was drugged, but I just thought the exhaustion and constant sleeping were due to the wound on my neck.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded, and then asked, \u201cWhen did you figure out the food was drugged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my own first \u2018night out,\u2019 \u201d she answered with a grim smile.</p><p>\u201cNight out?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we called it. The night out of our cage. Not a full night, just a couple hours really.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cFive nights after I got there, everyone else got a bowl but me, and I was taken upstairs.\u201d</p><p>She paused again, this time holding her breath, and Anders tensed, afraid that these memories might be too much for her, but after a moment, she let her breath out on a small puff and continued, \u201cI don\u2019t usually lose my cool in a crisis. I mean running a veterinary clinic can sometimes be as stressful as a hospital ER. Dogs are hit by cars, or have other accidents or ailments and are rushed in, and we have to be able to jump into action. We can\u2019t freak out, or fall apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said when she fell silent. It seemed to encourage her.</p><p>\u201cBy the time Igor came for me it had been twenty-four hours since our last feeding, and the drugs must have been wearing off, but I was still off balance. My vision was affected, or maybe it was my brain,\u201d she muttered grimly. \u201cWhatever it was, everything seemed distorted, my hearing was going in and out like a bad radio station, and my emotions were exaggerated and all over the place. But worst of all, my coordination was non-existent and I couldn\u2019t seem to remember a damned thing from my martial arts training. It was like all those skills I\u2019d honed and practiced for years had just fled.\u201d</p><p>She sounded bewildered, and maybe even a little betrayed by that fact, Anders noted. He tried to think of something to say to make her feel better, but before he came up with something, Valerie continued wearily, \u201cBy the time Igor got me upstairs, forced me through a bath and into the white silk robe, I was a complete mess. There didn\u2019t seem to be a lick of my usual calm, rational self left. I was just this bundle of raw emotion and terror when he dragged me out into the master bedroom. I was sure I was going to be raped. I mean why keep seven women if it wasn\u2019t rape, right? There were no men in the basement. So it had to be rape, and that infuriated me because I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it. I didn\u2019t seem to have the wherewithal or coordination to fight it.\u201d</p><p>She was obviously still angry about that, Anders decided, noting the way she was clenching her hands. Her knuckles were white.</p><p>\u201cIgor\u2019s boss was dressed in a red velour robe and lounging against a mound of pillows on this huge king-sized bed like some pasha or something,\u201d she said suddenly with disgust. \u201cI struggled, but . . . damn, Igor was a huge guy. A behemoth. And superstrong too. There was just no escaping at that point.\u201d</p><p>When she paused again, Anders waited patiently. But this time there was a huge struggle taking place on her face. He didn\u2019t have to be able to read her mind to know that she was having an inner battle over what to say next. And it wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d been raped. Anders knew she hadn\u2019t been. While he couldn\u2019t read Valerie, he hadn\u2019t had any problem reading the other women who had been prisoners along with her. Each of them had experienced the very same thing on their \u201cnight out,\u201d so he had no doubt she had too. Aside from that though, Dani had examined Valerie thoroughly. She hadn\u2019t been raped. But she had been terrorized and mauled, her throat mangled by what she would call a vampire. She\u2019d hardly think she could tell him that though. None of the women had felt they could. They\u2019d all said he was crazy. That he thought he was a vampire. That he had fake teeth or something, or maybe it was a knife, but he\u2019d messed up their neck somehow.</p><p>Anders had no doubt Valerie would say the same thing; partially to avoid sounding crazy, and partially because speaking the truth was intolerable. Her mind simply couldn\u2019t accept that such things existed. It was too horrible for most mortals to contemplate . . . and that was his big worry. If she couldn\u2019t accept that vampires existed, he\u2019d never convince her to be his life mate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound of the door opening made them both glance toward it. Leigh was back.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not at any of the animal shelters,\u201d Leigh announced, waddling across the room to reclaim her seat at the table. \u201cSo I called Lucian and he said one of the men was at your house collecting some clothes for you and he\u2019d have him check with the neighbors. I\u2019m sure someone recognized and took her in until your return. He\u2019ll find her and bring her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie said quietly, but worried what she would do if Roxy wasn\u2019t with one of the neighbors. What if the blow that had caused Roxy to yelp had killed her?</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is that she can\u2019t be dead,\u201d Leigh continued. \u201cOtherwise she would have been taken to one of the shelters to be disposed of and they would have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Valerie said slowly and felt some of her tension ease. If Roxy was alive, she\u2019d find her. She\u2019d had a chip put in the dog when she was just a pup. If one of the neighbors didn\u2019t have her, she\u2019d call and have the chip tracked.</p><p>\u201cNow, what did I interrupt?\u201d Leigh asked cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cValerie was telling me what happened,\u201d Anders said quietly, then glanced to her and reminded her, \u201cIgor made you bathe and don the white robe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she muttered, memory taking her back to that room again and her terror that she was going to be raped. She hadn\u2019t been raped, but what had happened had been almost as bad. As soon as she was close enough, Igor\u2019s master had caught one of her flailing hands and pulled her out of Igor\u2019s grip and onto the bed.</p> <p>At first, he\u2019d just held her in place and laughed cruelly at her terrified struggles. But then he\u2019d toyed with her, playing with her like a cat plays with a mouse, letting her think she was getting loose, that she might escape, then catching her and flipping her back onto the bed before him to laugh some more. He\u2019d seemed to enjoy tormenting her, but when her struggles weakened, he\u2019d grown tired of the game. He\u2019d grabbed her by the scruff of the neck, dragged her onto his lap, smiled into her ashen face and opened his mouth, revealing huge, pointy fangs.</p><p>Valerie had freaked out. It was like some waking nightmare. In fact, she hadn\u2019t been sure it wasn\u2019t one. But then he\u2019d ripped into her throat with those fangs and the agony that tore through her had convinced her it was no dream. The sound of his sucking and slurping away her lifeblood had only added to the nightmare quality of the whole experience.</p><p>As least that\u2019s what she\u2019d thought she\u2019d experienced. When she\u2019d woken up in her cage the next day as Igor had come to hand out the bowls of oatmeal, Valerie had convinced herself it was nuts, a ridiculous hallucination brought on by terror, exhaustion, and the situation.</p><p>Realizing that they were waiting for her to say something, Valerie blurted out, \u201cAfter the bath and making me put on the robe, Igor took me to his boss who was a whacked-out freak vampire wannabe who gnawed on and tore up my throat with fake fangs.\u201d</p><p>Valerie paused briefly, noting an exchange of glances between Leigh and Anders, but not terribly surprised by it. She was just surprised they weren\u2019t gasping, \u201cFake fangs?\u201d</p><p>Since they weren\u2019t, she continued, \u201cI lost a lot of blood the night he kidnapped me, but this was worse. I passed out and when I woke up I was in the cage and Igor was distributing the next night\u2019s oatmeal and taking Cindy away again.\u201d Her mouth tightened at the memory of Cindy begging through her sobs not to be taken up again. She couldn\u2019t bear it. Please just kill her.</p> <p>Valerie swallowed and pushed those memories away, saying, \u201cI wasn\u2019t hungry, and I was too weak to even chew anyway, but I didn\u2019t want to be force-fed, so like I said, I upended the bowl in my jacket, and pushed it in the corner. Then I just curled up in a ball and slept until he came again the next night with food. I was feeling better by then, a little stronger, hungry even, but also clearheaded for the first time since the night I was kidnapped. Which is how I realized they were drugging the food,\u201d she explained.</p><p>It was also when Valerie had decided that, one: the drugs had been playing tricks on her and she hadn\u2019t really seen fangs, at least not real ones. And two: that she wasn\u2019t going to eat again while held in that cage, that she would skip the meals to avoid the drugs and keep enough of her wits about her to escape the next time she was taken for her \u201cnight out.\u201d</p><p>Clearing her throat, Valerie shrugged. \u201cSo I stopped eating. I drank the water, because that was in bottles and didn\u2019t seem to be drugged. But I kept dumping the food in my jacket and pushing it into the corner of my cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this Igor didn\u2019t notice?\u201d Leigh asked with interest.</p><p>\u201cNo, though he would have in another day or two; it was starting to stink.\u201d Valerie fell silent. She\u2019d left out quite a bit, including the fact that the other women had told her they were sure Igor could read their minds. Because of that she\u2019d made sure to recite song lyrics in her head every time he\u2019d come around. It had been hard to concentrate enough to remember lyrics by the end. She\u2019d been so hungry . . . and trying to figure a way to escape with one part of her mind while reciting lyrics with the other had been difficult. The only thing that had kept her going was Bethany and Janey. Their continued silence had worried her. But she\u2019d also counted on their worsening state making Igor skip them that time around, and he had. He\u2019d also skipped Laura, who wasn\u2019t as bad as the other two, but was starting to flag. That was probably the only reason her plan had worked. She wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d have been strong enough to pull it off had she had to go another night without food.</p><p>\u201cSo you escaped by not eating the drugged food,\u201d Leigh said with a nod. \u201cVery clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and taking him by surprise. And a lot of luck,\u201d Valerie said dryly, thinking that if that bench hadn\u2019t shattered under her, giving her a weapon, or if he\u2019d tossed her just to the side of it, or if her aim had been off . . . Really, it had been a heck of a lot of luck and now she told them about shooting the shampoo into his face and using the broken bench leg to stab him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up in the bushes?\u201d Anders asked when she fell quiet again.</p> <p>Valerie glanced his way, noticing only then that while he\u2019d brought food and drink for her and Leigh, he had neither. She was frowning over that as she answered, \u201cI put down the phone and went out the window when Igor\u2019s boss came home. But I was injured and the best I could do was crawl ten feet or so away along the house and roll myself under the bushes before passing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough of this unpleasant business,\u201d Leigh announced abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s time to relax and\u2014\u201d She cut herself off and frowned as she saw Valerie\u2019s soup bowl. \u201cYou didn\u2019t finish your soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m full,\u201d Valerie said apologetically, and then quickly added, \u201cBut it was very good. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Leigh nodded, but gestured to her barely touched milk. \u201cNot a big fan of milk I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry. Never cared much for it. Even as a child,\u201d Valerie admitted.</p><p>Leigh nodded and stood. \u201cThen let\u2019s go down and find you something else to drink. We need to replenish your fluids as much as we can and we can have it on the verandah. After being stuck in a cage all that time, some fresh air will do you a world of good and we have a lovely shaded verandah where we can enjoy this sunny day.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stood and reached out to collect her bowl and glass, but froze when her hands collided with Anders\u2019s as he reached out to do the same thing. She stood completely still for a moment as a strange sort of charge sparked through her hands from the point of contact, then sought out his eyes. But his head was bowed, his gaze focused firmly on the tabletop. She couldn\u2019t tell if he was experiencing what she was or not. Biting her lip, she withdrew her hands, breaking the contact, and he quickly set the items on the tray and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Leigh said cheerfully.</p><p>Valerie swallowed, and moved quickly to follow as the other woman led the way to the door.</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I could do with some fresh air myself,\u201d Leigh added dryly as she started into the hall. \u201cMy husband is fussing over the baby and hasn\u2019t let me out much the last three weeks. He\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll go into labor in the car or something.\u201d</p><p>She said it as if the idea were ridiculous, but as Valerie followed her up the hall, she decided she didn\u2019t blame the man for his worry. Leigh did look ready to pop. She didn\u2019t say as much though, but asked, \u201cWhen are you due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week,\u201d Leigh said dryly, one hand moving to her stomach. \u201cLittle one here is as stubborn as her daddy though, and taking her own sweet time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s a girl?\u201d Valerie asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Leigh answered even as Anders said, \u201cNo,\u201d behind them.</p><p>When Valerie raised her eyebrows and glanced over her shoulder at the man following them, Leigh drew her attention back by admitting, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what an ultrasound would do so didn\u2019t want to risk it, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard that ultrasounds are bad for babies,\u201d Valerie said with surprise as they reached a set of stairs.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t for mort\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeigh.\u201d The warning growl came from Anders and stopped the woman abruptly.</p><p>She blinked once or twice, then forced a smile and said, \u201cOh dear, I forgot. The men insist I hold onto the rail when I go down the stairs,\u201d as if that was what the growling of her name had been about. She then made a show of grabbing the rail and started down the stairs saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure ultrasounds are fine, but you know how modern technology is. They say one thing is good or bad for you one minute, and then change their tune the next. Butter was bad and we should all eat margarine and then it turned out margarine was bad and we should use olive-oil-based spread and so on. And then there\u2019s that drug that was supposed to be fine and then got pulled off the market because pregnant mothers were miscarrying or having mutant babies or whatever. It\u2019s just better to be safe than sorry.\u201d</p><p>Valerie followed the woman, amusement curving her lips. Leigh had babbled that all out in one go and without taking a breath. Amazing, she thought.</p><p>In the next moment, her attention was diverted by her surroundings. The bedroom she\u2019d woken up in had been nice, and the hallway had just been a hallway, but halfway down the stairs she noted that dead ahead of her was a two story wall of windows around a set of double doors. Beyond the glass was a huge yard with trees, ponds, pagodas, and gardens. It was gorgeous, and a far cry from the dark, dank basement she\u2019d spent ten days in.</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Leigh said, pausing two steps below her to look outside herself. \u201cI\u2019ll never tire of this view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine you will,\u201d Valerie said softly, noting that beyond the manicured lawn was what appeared to be a forest of trees. \u201cIs this the back of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the front,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cThe road is beyond those trees and the driveway is just out of sight to the right there.\u201d She gestured with her hand and then explained, \u201cWhat looks like a forest is only about twenty or thirty feet deep. The true forest is behind the house. It goes for miles there.\u201d She continued down the stairs, adding, \u201cThere are trees lining the sides of the yard too, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the neighbors seeing you in my nightgown.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced down at herself, suddenly aware that she\u2019d been sitting around in the thin cotton for the last half hour or so with two complete strangers. She should have been uncomfortable. She hadn\u2019t been. Although, now Valerie glanced self-consciously back at Anders and felt herself flush when she saw the way his eyes were skating over her figure in the thin material.</p><p>Turning abruptly forward, she hurried after Leigh, who was already stepping off the last step and turning right. Valerie had reached the bottom step herself when a doorbell suddenly chimed out, seeming to echo through the house. She stared at the large double doors before her, able to see a young man in black leather through the glass windows of the door.</p><p>Anders slipped past her with the tray. He set it down on a table beside the stairs, and then moved to unlock and open the door to the tall, smiling man carrying a suitcase and overnight bag that looked remarkably like hers.</p><p>\u201cJustin!\u201d Leigh returned to stand at the foot of the stairs beside her. \u201cAre those Valerie\u2019s clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d he said cheerfully, stepping into the house and smiling at Valerie. His eyes traveled appreciatively over her in the nightgown as he set down the cases. \u201cEverything from skivvies to shoes. Marguerite came along to do the actual packing,\u201d he added with a reassuring smile for Valerie as he straightened and looked her over again. \u201cI\u2019m just the beast of burden.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter known as an ass,\u201d Anders muttered and Valerie gave a startled laugh.</p><p>\u201cMarguerite?\u201d Leigh asked, moving to the door to look out. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulius called as we pulled up. She stopped to speak to him and told me to come on in without her,\u201d Justin said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be along in a minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Leigh turned to smile at Valerie. \u201cI should make tea. Do you like tea?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood, we\u2019ll have tea then,\u201d she decided and headed toward the back of the house, adding, \u201cYou\u2019ll like Marguerite. She\u2019s my sister-in-law, well, Lucian\u2019s sister-in-law really, and just the loveliest lady. Oh, this will be nice . . . tea and a visit on the verandah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get out much,\u201d Justin said with amusement when Valerie stared after her babbling host.</p><p>She glanced to him, noting the smile of appreciation was still on his face and he was looking her over again in the nightgown. Her gaze then shifted to Anders as he suddenly bent to pick up the bags Justin had put down.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably like to dress,\u201d he said as he straightened.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Valerie said at once.</p><p>Nodding, he moved past her to the stairs with the bags. \u201cI\u2019ll take these to your room.\u201d</p><p>As Valerie followed, he added over his shoulder, \u201cMake yourself useful, Bricker. Help Leigh with the tea.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait in the hall,\u201d Anders said, setting her bags on the table they\u2019d been seated at just moments ago.</p> <p>Valerie almost said he needn\u2019t wait for her, but then realized that if he didn\u2019t she might have trouble finding the others when she was done. She didn\u2019t know this house, and judging by the length of the upper hallway she\u2019d traveled twice now, it was huge. So she nodded and said, \u201cThank you,\u201d as Anders left her alone.</p><p>She had her suitcase and overnight bag open and was examining the contents before he\u2019d pulled the door closed behind him. It was strange to see so many of her personal items neatly packed inside. Valerie recognized them, they were all hers, but they seemed somehow alien after her experiences. It made her wonder if everything would strike her that way.</p><p>Shaking her head, Valerie picked out underwear, a bra, a T-shirt, and jeans and began to dress. As she did, she recalled Leigh saying the man who went to fetch her clothes would check with her neighbors about Roxy, but the dog hadn\u2019t been with Justin. He hadn\u2019t found her with one of the neighbors then, Valerie realized, and frowned. She\u2019d have to call about having Roxy\u2019s chip tracked. That thought uppermost in her mind, she finished dressing and then hurried out into the hall to find Anders waiting patiently, leaning against the wall, legs crossed at the ankles and arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat was fast.\u201d He complimented her as he straightened.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Valerie agreed with distraction, starting up the hall. When he fell into step beside her, she said, \u201cRoxy wasn\u2019t with that fellow Justin or Bricker or whatever his name is.\u201d Leigh had called him Justin, but Anders had called him Bricker. She wasn\u2019t sure how she should refer to him.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Justin Bricker,\u201d Anders said quietly. \u201cBut, no, he didn\u2019t have a dog with him. I\u2019ll ask him what he found when we get downstairs. If he\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>They were both frowning at that afterthought as they started down the stairs. But they needn\u2019t have worried, Justin Bricker was still there. Valerie could hear the murmur of a male voice as they started up a hall toward the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cThere they are,\u201d Leigh said brightly as Anders led Valerie into a combination kitchen/living room.</p> <p>It was a large open area that appeared to take up the entire back half of the main floor. The kitchen was on the left, separated from the sitting area on the right by a long, granite covered island with chair-backed stools around it. Both sides were decorated in wood and earth tones. Like the front of the house, the outer wall here was more glass than anything else with French doors on both sides leading out onto a covered verandah. And Leigh hadn\u2019t been kidding about a nice shady verandah. Vines grew thick and healthy up the posts and along the edges, adding to the charm and providing more shade. The view beyond was as incredible as the view out the front of the house, only here there was also a pool.</p><p>\u201cCome meet Marguerite, Valerie.\u201d</p><p>Tearing herself away from the view, she moved into the kitchen, where Leigh and a second woman were leaning against the counter on either side of a steaming teakettle. Valerie peered at the newcomer curiously as she approached. Marguerite was almost a head taller than Leigh, with a figure most women would kill for. She wore a summery red dress that looked lovely with her pale complexion and long flowing auburn hair, and she had quite the loveliest face Valerie had ever seen. Like Anders, the woman could have been a model. Also like Anders, she looked to be in her mid- to late twenties, but then so did Leigh and Justin.</p><p>\u201cHello, Valerie,\u201d Marguerite said smiling widely and offering her hand as Valerie came to a halt before the two women. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too,\u201d Valerie said politely, shaking the offered hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t find your dog,\u201d Marguerite said apologetically as they finished shaking and released each other\u2019s hands.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s shoulders slumped. It was what she\u2019d expected, but was still disappointing. Forcing a crooked smile, she said, \u201cThank you for trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she admitted wryly. \u201cThat was Justin. I was packing your clothes while he checked with your neighbors. But not everyone was home. He\u2019s going to go back tonight, so he may yet find her,\u201d Marguerite said encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cActually, there were more people not home than home,\u201d Justin Bricker said, entering the kitchen through the French doors. \u201cMiddle of the afternoon, most people were working. The only people I found home were two houses close to the corner and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mrs. Ribble next door,\u201d Valerie finished for him with a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cNo. The house across the street from yours,\u201d Bricker corrected.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyebrows rose at this news and she said, \u201cBut Mrs. Ribble is at least eighty years old. She\u2019s always home.\u201d</p><p>Bricker\u2019s pursed his lips thoughtfully. \u201cWhich next-door neighbor is she? The left or right side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right side if you\u2019re facing the house from the street,\u201d Valerie answered.</p><p>\u201cThere was no answer there,\u201d Bricker said firmly, and then added thoughtfully, \u201cBut a dog barked when I knocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a dog,\u201d Valerie said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cBricker, I think you may have found Roxy after all,\u201d Anders commented.</p><p>Valerie glanced at him with surprise, but then realized he was probably right. He had to be . . . unless Mrs. Ribble had got herself a dog in the last two weeks, it was probably Roxy that Bricker had heard barking. Straightening, she said, \u201cI have to go see if it\u2019s Roxy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You have to stay here,\u201d Anders said firmly. \u201cBricker will go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t open the door to him the first time, what makes you think she\u2019ll open it for him if he goes back?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019ll answer to you?\u201d Anders asked. \u201cYou only moved in next door a week or so before being kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>Valerie scowled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking permission to go. I\u2019m not a prisoner here . . . or am I?\u201d she added grimly.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Leigh said at once, moving to her side to add her support. \u201cAnd I think we should all go see if it\u2019s Roxy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Anders said at once. \u201cLucian would have my hide if I let you out in your condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Valerie isn\u2019t a prisoner, but I am?\u201d Leigh asked sweetly.</p><p>Anders scowled. \u201cNeither of you are prisoners, but it\u2019s in your best interests to remain here. You, Leigh, because you could go into labor at any moment, and Valerie because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure a quick drive to Valerie\u2019s house and back wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Marguerite interrupted soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d believe that if I didn\u2019t know that Valerie lives in Cambridge, Marguerite,\u201d Anders said dryly. \u201cThat\u2019s a forty-five minute drive and if Lucian came back while we were gone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Marguerite assured him. \u201cA couple of new hunters flew in today and he\u2019s meeting with them. He told me to tell Leigh to call if anything happened, but otherwise he\u2019d be a little late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have new hunters?\u201d Anders asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bricker said with a grin. \u201cLucian said with his men dropping like flies we needed the extra support.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned. How dangerous was the job of hunting men like the one who had held her captive? Pretty dangerous, she guessed, but pushed that aside in favor of her worry over Roxy. The German shepherd was her responsibility . . . and she loved the dog. She wanted to know if she was all right and where she was. Shifting impatiently, she asked, \u201cLeigh, can I use your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, Valerie,\u201d she said at once. \u201cBut what for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling a taxi to take me home,\u201d she answered, spotting the phone at the other end of the kitchen and heading for it.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Leigh smiled uncertainly at her and then turned to Anders and snapped, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Valerie was picking up the phone when she heard Anders release an exasperated sigh.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cHang up, Valerie. I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated, but then hung up and turned to face him. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Leigh said happily. \u201cMaybe we can stop for ice cream on the way. I know this great place that sells Rocky Road sundaes with marshmallow topping and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going,\u201d Anders interrupted firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll take Valerie, but you\u2019re staying here with Bricker. I\u2019m not risking the wrath of Lucian so you can have ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Leigh,\u201d Marguerite said reassuringly. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait till they leave and then get Bricker to take us for ice cream . . . and maybe some shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Leigh said, suddenly smiling, and then added excitedly, \u201cOooo, if Lucian\u2019s going to be late, dinner out would be nice too, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBricker is not taking you anywhere,\u201d Anders said firmly.</p><p>Marguerite shrugged. \u201cThen we\u2019ll wait till he\u2019s busy and take Leigh\u2019s car and go ourselves.\u201d She smiled sweetly at Anders and added, \u201cHe can\u2019t watch us every minute. He\u2019ll have to go to the bathroom sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Much to Valerie\u2019s amazement, Anders actually growled under his breath with frustration. But then he threw up his hands in defeat and turned to head out of the kitchen saying, \u201cFine. Come with us. But it\u2019s straight there and back. No stopping for ice cream. No lunch. No shopping. There and back and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, this really is good,\u201d Valerie murmured, dipping her spoon into her ice cream and scooping out a large mouthful.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was.\u201d</p><p>Valerie shifted around in the front seat and smiled at Leigh. The pregnant woman was seated between Bricker and Marguerite on the SUV\u2019s backseat where all three of them were each gobbling up their own Rocky Road sundae with marshmallow topping, nuts, and a cherry.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d Valerie assured her and then settled back in her seat, her gaze sliding to a scowling Anders in the driver\u2019s seat. The man had been scowling since leaving the house. Her gaze dropped to the sundae sitting on the floor between them and she said, \u201cYou really should pull over and eat yours before it completely melts, Anders. It will only take a couple minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a sundae,\u201d Anders said grimly. \u201cThat\u2019s Leigh\u2019s. She said she wanted two, so she has two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you I lied so you could have one because I knew you were too annoyed to order one for yourself,\u201d Leigh said patiently. \u201cPull over and eat it, Anders. I promise you it\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, Marguerite said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you feed him, Valerie. That way he doesn\u2019t have to stop, but can still enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust pretend he\u2019s a sick and cranky child you have to feed,\u201d Marguerite said with amusement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie\u2019s eyes shot to Anders in time to catch him casting a dirty look into the rearview mirror, no doubt at Marguerite. Since the woman suddenly chuckled, she supposed Marguerite caught the look.</p><p>Valerie glanced down at the melting sundae. It did seem a shame for it to go to waste. It was good ice cream. And it hadn\u2019t been cheap.</p><p>\u201cJust give him a taste, Valerie, so he\u2019ll stop and eat it,\u201d Leigh suggested.</p> <p>Valerie hesitated, but they were pulling up to a red light and it wouldn\u2019t interfere with his driving, so she scooped up a healthy selection of her own ice cream and topping and leaned over to offer her spoon to him.</p><p>Anders eyed the offering, but didn\u2019t at first open his mouth. She was just about to give up, sit back and eat it herself when he suddenly did. Valerie moved the spoon between his open lips, watching silently as he closed his mouth around the spoon and ice cream. She could have sworn the gold flecks in his eyes flashed bigger and brighter in the black irises and then he closed his eyes on a long moan that sounded almost sexual.</p><p>Valerie stared wide-eyed as he savored the food, then withdrew the now clean spoon and sank back in her seat uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cTold you you\u2019d like it,\u201d Leigh said with amusement from the backseat.</p><p>When Anders didn\u2019t respond, but remained still, eyes closed, Bricker said, \u201cYo, A-man. The light\u2019s changed.\u201d</p> <p>Anders blinked his eyes open, saw that Bricker was telling the truth, and urged the car forward again. He only drove half a block though, before pulling into a mall parking lot to finish his sundae.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dog is Roxy?\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced around in surprise at that question from Leigh. She\u2019d dozed off in her seat shortly after they\u2019d finished their ice cream and continued on the drive. She hadn\u2019t meant to, but supposed she\u2019d sleep a lot for the next little while as she healed. In truth, she was still tired and would no doubt still be asleep if her head hadn\u2019t fallen off the headrest and bumped into the side window. Clearing her throat, she shifted around so she could see the people in the backseat and answered, \u201cShe\u2019s a German shepherd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she?\u201d Marguerite asked with interest.</p><p>\u201cAbout three,\u201d Valerie said, and then added, \u201cShe was a rescue animal. She\u2019s one of several dogs who were brought into my clinic after a raid on a puppy mill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour clinic?\u201d Anders asked, sparing her a glance before turning his eyes back to the road.</p> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m a vet,\u201d Valerie explained. \u201cI have a clinic in Winnipeg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a clinic in Winnipeg, Manitoba, but live in Cambridge, Ontario?\u201d Bricker asked, and before she could answer, commented, \u201cThat\u2019s one hell of a commute.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled faintly, but shook her head. \u201cThe house in Cambridge is a rental. I\u2019m just staying there while I take some courses at the University of Guelph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging careers?\u201d Anders asked curiously.</p><p>Valerie shook her head. \u201cNo,the courses are actually at the veterinary clinic at the university. I\u2019m just brushing up on the career I already have,\u201d she said and when he raised an eyebrow in question, she explained, \u201cI got my degree and training there. There have been advancements in the field the last couple of years and I wanted to get caught up on the latest techniques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo all vets do that?\u201d Leigh asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your clinic? Did you have to shut it down while you\u2019re away?\u201d Bricker asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd aren\u2019t there veterinary schools in Winnipeg?\u201d Marguerite chimed in. \u201cThis seems a long way to go to brush up.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie grimaced at the barrage of questions, but answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know if other vets take courses to stay current. I have a partner, and two other vets work at the clinic; they\u2019re covering things till I get back. And Guelph is where I got my original degree. It just seemed easier to return for these courses than to apply somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Her answers were mostly true, and they were also the explanations she gave to everyone else. It was nobody\u2019s business that she\u2019d chosen to brush up and to do so in Ontario because she\u2019d wanted to be out of Winnipeg for a while.</p><p>\u201cSo were you born and raised in Winnipeg, or Ontario?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cCambridge, Ontario,\u201d Valerie answered reluctantly, knowing what question would come next.</p><p>It was Bricker who asked it. \u201cThen how did you end up opening a clinic in Winnipeg?\u201d</p><p>Valerie considered how best to answer, but really there was only one answer. \u201cA man.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the SUV briefly and then Anders said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really phrased as a question, more like a command, she thought, and wondered about that, but said, \u201cNo. I\u2019ve never been married. But I started dating another student my first year at university. We dated all seven years of school, but he was from Winnipeg. He wanted to go back when we graduated and he asked me to go.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI moved there with him and set up shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t marry?\u201d Anders asked and she glanced over to see that his eyes were narrowed on the road. There was a tension about him she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned to stare out the window at the passing scenery and said, \u201cWe split up eventually, but by then the clinic was successful and I\u2019d made friends there. I stayed.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d split up nine months ago after ten years together. Ten years during which he\u2019d claimed he never wanted to marry\u2014a marriage certificate meant nothing to him. They didn\u2019t need one. Two weeks after they split up he was dating Susie; six weeks after that he asked Susie to marry him. It seemed it wasn\u2019t that he never wanted to marry, he\u2019d just never wanted to marry Valerie. And she had no desire to be in town when he said I do to the woman he did want to marry. It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t over him. She\u2019d been over him long before they\u2019d got around to breaking up. It wasn\u2019t her heart that couldn\u2019t take it. It was her pride. It hurt that Larry had never wanted to marry her, yet had popped the question to his new girl within weeks. What the hell was up with that? Why hadn\u2019t she been the type he\u2019d marry?</p><p>She had no idea and that bothered her.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re here,\u201d Marguerite said suddenly. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Valerie blinked and focused on the view out the window to see that they . . . were driving past her house? She turned to Anders in question. \u201cWhy\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut this on,\u201d he interrupted, holding out a baseball cap and sweatshirt.</p><p>Valerie recognized them. He\u2019d made a trip upstairs to fetch them before they\u2019d left, and set them on the floor when they\u2019d got in the vehicle.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately accept the items, he asked, \u201cHave you forgotten Igor and his boss already? They may be watching your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d she asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhy did they take you in the first place?\u201d he countered and then admitted, \u201cThey might not be watching, but they just as easily could be, and isn\u2019t it better to be safe than sorry?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, took the items, and quickly shrugged on the sweatshirt over her own clothes, then pulled the ball cap on her head.</p><p>\u201cTuck your hair under,\u201d Anders instructed as he cruised past her house again, his eyes scanning the area as they went.</p><p>Valerie took the hat off, caught her hair in a ponytail, twisted it around into a bun on top of her head and then held it in place as she slid the hat over it. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over, nodded, then turned his attention back to the road, but made one more circuit around the block before pulling into Mrs. Ribble\u2019s driveway.</p><p>Valerie had the door open and was hurrying up the driveway almost before the SUV had fully stopped. She didn\u2019t head for the front door, however, but straight up the side of the house to the fence running across the end of the driveway from the house and going around the backyard. She didn\u2019t need to go to the door and ask Mrs. Ribble if Roxy was there. She could see Roxy in the backyard.</p><p>She was halfway to the gate when the German shepherd spotted her and raced to the fence barking excitedly. Grinning, Valerie ran the last few feet and reached over the gate to unhook the latch. She\u2019d barely started to swing it open when Roxy burst through the narrow opening like a bullet. The dog circled Valerie, barking wildly, and then, tail wagging like a mad thing, she rubbed up against her legs and turned in circles in front of her. Roxy was happy and excited, but not so excited she\u2019d forgotten that she wasn\u2019t supposed to jump up on people.</p><p>Laughing, Valerie dropped to her knees to hug the dog and ruffle her fur. Then she caught her face in her hands and massaged her cheeks and ears, saying, \u201cHi baby. Are you okay? I was worried about you. I missed you too,\u201d she cooed happily as the dog licked her face.</p><p>\u201cEwww. Seriously? You let her lick your face?\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced around at Bricker\u2019s words to see that he, Anders, Leigh, and Marguerite had followed her. While Anders looked tense and was dividing his attention between watching her greet her dog and the street, Leigh and Marguerite were smiling indulgently. Bricker, however, looked thoroughly disgusted. Chuckling at his expression, she said, \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t have a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut Anders has been looking into getting one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Valerie asked, glancing to Anders with interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been researching breeds to see which would be a good fit for me,\u201d he said quietly, his eyes shifting briefly to Roxy before he glanced around the area again.</p><p>\u201cRoxy? Roxy girl! Where\u2019d you get to?\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced toward the backyard at that trembling old voice. She gave Roxy one last pet and stood up to walk to the gate and peer toward the back door of the house. \u201cHi, Mrs. Ribble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d the woman said sourly, squinting to see her better.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you for looking after Roxy for me. I appreciate it,\u201d she said, glancing down and petting the dog as she leaned up against her side.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, she was sitting out on your stoop whining one night and I couldn\u2019t sleep so I brought her in,\u201d Mrs. Ribble said, and scowled at Valerie. \u201cNot that you care. Two weeks you left the poor girl on her own. She could have died.\u201d The old woman scowled harder and added, \u201cI don\u2019t think you should have her back if you can\u2019t take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie was gone two weeks and you didn\u2019t bother to call the police and report her missing?\u201d Anders countered, suddenly behind Valerie. He sounded pretty angry.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d the woman scowled. \u201cHow did I know she wasn\u2019t just out partying or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d Anders said with quiet certainty. \u201cBut you wanted the dog.\u201d</p><p>Valerie peered at him with surprise and then back to Mrs. Ribble as she suddenly shifted on the back stoop, guilt plain on her face before she turned away. \u201cJust take her and go. And don\u2019t expect me to watch her the next time.\u201d</p><p>The door closed behind the old woman with a clack and Valerie raised an eyebrow in Anders\u2019s direction, saying carefully, \u201cYou were kind of tough on her.\u201d</p><p>Anders quit scowling at the now closed door and glanced to Valerie, but shook his head. \u201cNot tough enough. She knew you were missing and that something must have happened, but didn\u2019t do a damned thing about it. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to call the police. She was afraid they\u2019d take Roxy away and she wanted the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she protested on a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Valerie challenged.</p><p>Anders opened his mouth, paused briefly, and then said, \u201cI drove around the block three times, each time her front curtain twitched and she looked out. I guarantee that woman sits in her front room watching the street. She probably sees everything that goes on, including the attack the night you took Roxy for a walk. It might have been slightly blurry for her at that distance, but she would have seen shapes and been able to tell enough to know that you were attacked and dragged off and Roxy came limping home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know the attack took place on this street?\u201d she asked with surprise.</p><p>Anders paused again, but then shrugged, \u201cYou\u2019re a woman. I imagine you\u2019d stick to your street that late at night and circle it several times rather than venture farther away.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned. It all sounded likely enough. Common sense and logic really, but there was something about the way he was avoiding her eyes that suggested to her that there was more to it than that.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d Anders said suddenly, taking Valerie\u2019s arm and turning her back to the driveway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t protest, but allowed him to walk her back to the SUV. Roxy stuck to her other side like glue, bumping up against her with every step. The others fell into step behind them and they were almost to the vehicle when Valerie suddenly stopped.</p><p>\u201cI should get Roxy\u2019s dog food while we\u2019re here,\u201d she announced when Anders paused and eyed her in question.</p><p>He frowned, his eyes traveling over the street and then to her house.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea, Anders. Roxy has to eat,\u201d Marguerite pointed out. \u201cBesides, there may be things Valerie needs that I didn\u2019t think of when I packed her bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy computer,\u201d Valerie announced at once. \u201cI need it for classes. And I need my class notes and books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Anders said grimly and turned to hand Bricker his keys. \u201cMove the SUV to Valerie\u2019s driveway. It\u2019ll be easier for loading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d the man answered as he withdrew another set of keys from his own pocket and held them out. \u201cYou\u2019ll need these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy keys,\u201d Valerie said as she recognized them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s how we got in earlier to pick up your clothes,\u201d Bricker explained. \u201cThey were in your coat pocket at the house.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, recalling Leigh mentioning that the men had found her wallet and keys in a coat in her cage at the house.</p><p>Anders took the keys and urged her in the direction of her rental.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come help,\u201d Leigh announced, trailing after them. When Anders slowed and glanced back, she added, \u201cIt will be quicker.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he nodded and picked up speed again.</p><p>It was just as strange entering her rental as it had been going through the clothes they\u2019d brought her. It all felt just a bit alien. Valerie shrugged that feeling aside and set about what she was there for. She headed for the kitchen first to gather Roxy\u2019s food dish and water dish, the big bag of her dry dog food, the spare leash, her bed and a couple of her favorite toys. Valerie set them on the kitchen table as she collected each item, but when she then found a grocery bag to stuff the smaller items in, Marguerite took it from her.</p> <p>\u201cLeigh and I will pack this. You go ahead and get your computer and whatever else you need,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Valerie said and slid from the room, aware that Roxy and Anders were hard on her heels. She found her computer case and the backpack with her notes and books for her courses in the living room. She started to pick them up, but Anders simply took them from her and slung both over his own shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She hesitated, but then headed for the bedroom to survey her wardrobe. Marguerite had done a good job of picking clothes for her, but there were a couple of items Valerie thought might come in handy. She pulled them out of the closet, and quickly rolled up and packed them into a duffel bag Anders pulled down from the closet\u2019s upper shelf for her.</p><p>The bathroom was last, and Valerie was very aware that Anders was standing a foot away, waiting patiently. She would have liked to ask him to leave, but she was a grown-up, he was a grown-up and old enough to know about the physiology of the female body, so she took a deep breath, knelt to open the cupboard under the sink and pulled out tampons and pads. Her period should come in the next week or so and she didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d have to stay at Leigh\u2019s house.</p><p>Valerie set the feminine items on the counter, and then moved to the other end of the cupboard to gather some makeup and moisturizer from a drawer there.</p><p>When she turned back with the new items, Anders was calmly packing her feminine hygiene products away in the duffel with her clothes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured self-consciously as she dumped the new items in. Valerie then moved to the medicine cabinet. Her birth control pills were still there. She didn\u2019t know if Marguerite had missed them or if she\u2019d just thought that since Valerie had been without them for the last two weeks and was now in protective custody for an unknown length of time, she wouldn\u2019t need them, but Valerie took them and threw them on top of the other items in the duffel bag Anders was holding.</p> <p>She zipped it shut with a cheerful, \u201cAll done,\u201d then bent to pet Roxy, who was nosing her side.</p><p>\u201cThank you for working quickly,\u201d Anders responded quietly, the words drawing a laugh from Valerie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only speed I know,\u201d she admitted wryly as she led him out of the bathroom. The clinic was always busy and rush was the speed she\u2019d become used to.</p><p>Leigh and Marguerite were waiting in the living room, Leigh holding the grocery bag with the smaller, lighter items. Marguerite had Roxy\u2019s bed under one arm, and was dangling the large bag of dog food from one hand as if it weighed nothing. Both women smiled at their arrival, but it was Leigh who asked, \u201cAll set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set,\u201d Valerie agreed. \u201cWe can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m dying for a cup of coffee,\u201d Leigh announced, leading the way to the door and out onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were avoiding coffee until you had the baby,\u201d Anders said, following the women out of the house.</p><p>\u201cI was. But the baby is overdue and mama wants a coffee,\u201d she said rebelliously, sailing across the porch. Pausing at the top of the stairs down to the sidewalk, she turned back with a grimace and said, \u201cBut I\u2019ll settle for decaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Anders muttered as he locked the door with Valerie\u2019s keys. \u201cI suppose that means you want to hit a coffee shop on the way out of Cambridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suppose right,\u201d Leigh said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a coffee myself,\u201d Valerie said apologetically. \u201cThat ice cream left me thirsty and\u2014\u201d She paused and glanced around as Roxy went suddenly stiff beside her and began to growl low in her throat. Noting that the dog was staring across the street, Valerie glanced that way herself as she put a soothing hand on the dog\u2019s neck, and then she froze. There was a man standing in the late-afternoon shadow cast by the house across the street and she was sure it was Igor. The shape and sheer size were his, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d Anders moved up beside her and took her arm. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She glanced to him briefly, and then back, eyes widening when she saw that Igor was gone. If he had ever really been there, Valerie thought and reminded herself that he was dead. She\u2019d killed him. No man could survive a stake through the heart . . . and neither could a vampire, if that\u2019s what he\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, letting her breath out slowly. She scanned the street, aware that Anders was doing the same, but there was nothing to see now. Literally. It wasn\u2019t quite three o\u2019clock yet. Still early enough that the kids weren\u2019t yet home from school and the parents were still at work. Or, at least, most of them would be. So there were no cars, no people, and no pets, just silent houses and a couple of squirrels running about.</p><p>Actually, it was kind of spooky it was so still, she decided as a chill ran up her back. Giving Roxy one last pat, Valerie forced the feeling aside and lied, \u201cRoxy probably saw a squirrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Anders agreed mildly, but she could tell he didn\u2019t believe that. He was now stiff with tension. So were Leigh and Marguerite.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Bricker asked, stepping out of the SUV now parked in the driveway of Valerie\u2019s rental.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, forcing a smile and starting down the three steps off the porch. \u201cRoxy just caught a scent or saw something. Probably a squirrel or chipmunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Bricker turned to peer across the street now too, but the others were following Valerie and Roxy as she led the dog to the SUV. They were all silent as they loaded her bags into the back of the SUV. Valerie was afraid Anders would want Roxy to ride back there too, but he closed the door without the dog inside and patted his leg to get her to follow as he led Valerie up to the front passenger door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move your seat back to give her more room in front of you,\u201d Anders announced as he opened the door, and Valerie could have hugged him. She\u2019d just got her dog back and didn\u2019t want to be parted even by a few feet. Judging by how close Roxy was sticking to her, she felt the same way, but Valerie was surprised Anders was sensitive enough to understand that. It was nice. For all his attempts to be stern, he was nice, Valerie thought as she watched him push the button to make the seat slide slowly back on its track. The proof was that they were all there despite his initial refusal to bring them. And the ice cream, she thought with amusement, recalling his undeniable pleasure when she\u2019d given him a spoonful to taste. You\u2019d have thought he\u2019d never tasted ice cream before.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as far as it will go,\u201d Anders said straightening and offering her a hand to help her in.</p><p>Valerie placed her fingers in his hand, and then stilled, her eyes shooting to his when a jolt of sensation shot from the point of contact and up her arm. This time there was no doubting that Anders felt it too. He met her gaze, his own eyes wide. They were also more golden than black, she noted with some confusion, then glanced down to Roxy when the dog suddenly nosed between them, whining.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Valerie told the dog, retrieving her hand from Anders to pet the German shepherd. Then she turned and got into the front seat unaided.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Anders said to Roxy once Valerie was settled. The German shepherd immediately jumped up onto the floor in front of her mistress. She circled once in the confined space before settling between Valerie\u2019s legs and laying her head on her knee.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie said, avoiding looking at Anders\u2019s eyes again by petting Roxy\u2019s head.</p><p>She saw him nod out of the corner of her eye. He closed the door, then opened the back door and helped Leigh step up inside. The pregnant woman settled in the seat with a little relieved sigh, her hands rubbing her stomach as if to soothe the little one inside as she muttered, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to be born.\u201d</p><p>Valerie forced a smile and glanced around to ask, \u201cIs this your first baby?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen any signs of children at the house, but then she hadn\u2019t seen it all yet either. Besides, there may have been signs she just didn\u2019t recognize. Valerie had never had children herself and was beginning to think she never would. She was thirty years old, with a busy, successful career but no husband, or boyfriend, or even prospects in sight. She also had no social life to speak of. She had female friends, but little time to spend with them and even less to meet men. And she was only getting older and busier as the clinic continued to grow.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is baby number one,\u201d Leigh answered and then grimaced. \u201cAnd he\u2019s already proving to be as stubborn as his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Valerie teased gently. \u201cI thought you were sure it\u2019s going to be a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, that was then. Now it\u2019s a boy,\u201d Leigh said with a touch of self-mockery and explained, \u201cIt changes twenty times a day.\u201d</p><p>Valerie chuckled at that and then did what she\u2019d been avoiding doing and glanced around the street. Much to her relief there was nothing and no one of note. Letting out the breath she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been holding, she turned forward to see what was holding up the others. Marguerite, Bricker, and Anders were having a powwow a little distance from the van.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re debating whether they should check out what got Roxy upset,\u201d Leigh announced and when Valerie turned to her, eyebrows raised, she said, \u201cI read lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Valerie turned back to eye the others. She could see their lips moving, but didn\u2019t have a clue what they were saying. She couldn\u2019t read lips.</p><p>\u201cAnders wants to, but Marguerite thinks we should just go and keep an eye out for anyone following us. She figures since Roxy\u2019s calm now that whatever or whoever it is, is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably right,\u201d Valerie said, shifting her gaze from the trio to the houses across the street again. Much to her relief, there was still nothing to see.</p><p>\u201cMarguerite usually is right,\u201d Leigh said with amusement. \u201cOh, here they come. She must have won the argument.\u201d</p><p>Valerie peered back to the trio. It didn\u2019t look like anyone had won. They all had grim expressions and were scanning the area as they approached the vehicle. It seemed obvious they were pretty sure Roxy had picked up on a threat, but they\u2019d agreed it was probably gone now. But gone where? And would it return?</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Anders said as they all piled back into the SUV. \u201cDirect us to the nearest coffee shop, Valerie, and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping peacefully. No nightmares right now,\u201d Marguerite said from the backseat, and Anders tore his eyes away from Valerie to watch the road ahead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman had pinpointed exactly what he\u2019d been worrying about. Valerie had suffered nightmares while in her feverish state the last three days. He\u2019d been able to hear her screams all over the house when he was there; they\u2019d haunted his dreams as he\u2019d slept, and every single one had made him want to soothe and reassure her that she was safe and all was well. But the women had been overseeing her\u2014Leigh, Marguerite, and Marguerite\u2019s daughter Lissianna, as well as Marguerite\u2019s daughter-in-law Rachel. They had taken turns, and though he\u2019d offered, he hadn\u2019t been needed.</p><p>The women had worried about Valerie coming out of the fever with her faculties intact. They\u2019d said she was out of her head and there was no calming her. So, when Anders had realized she\u2019d fallen asleep in the passenger seat, he\u2019d worried she might have more of those nightmares. Unfortunately, Valerie had nodded off with her head turned toward the window. He hadn\u2019t been able to see her face and read her expression to know if she was sleeping peacefully or having a nightmare from which he should wake her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll sleep a lot for the next couple days while she heals,\u201d Leigh commented. \u201cShe\u2019s doing very well though. She hasn\u2019t once complained about the pain she\u2019s in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in pain?\u201d Anders asked, glancing sharply to the rearview mirror to eye the woman in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cShe has a hole in her back, Anders,\u201d Leigh said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s healed a lot the last couple days, but it\u2019s still sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie has a rather impressive ability to block pain,\u201d Marguerite commented. \u201cIt must be from all those years of martial arts she\u2019s taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taken martial arts?\u201d Anders asked with interest, his gaze switching to the reflection of the older woman.</p><p>He saw Marguerite and Leigh exchange a glance and then Marguerite said, \u201cYes. But I probably shouldn\u2019t tell you any more. Half the fun of finding a life mate is peeling back the layers and learning about them, and we\u2019ve already taken a good deal of that away with our earlier questions on the ride out.\u201d</p> <p>Anders didn\u2019t comment but shifted his attention to Roxy. The dog had remained seated between her mistress\u2019s legs, head on her knee, for the last forty-five minutes. Unlike her mistress, however, Roxy wasn\u2019t asleep. Her eyes were open and alert. Standing guard, he thought, and nodded at the animal. She was a good dog.</p><p>\u201cAnders, we should stop for dinner on the way back,\u201d Leigh suggested suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, dinner sounds good,\u201d Bricker said with enthusiasm.</p><p>Anders scowled at Leigh in the rearview mirror. \u201cWe are not stopping for supper. You are pregnant and I am not delivering Lucian Argeneau\u2019s baby on the side of a country road because you wanted a burger.\u201d</p><p>He saw her roll her eyes and then she said, \u201cI promise I won\u2019t go into labor.\u201d</p><p>Anders snorted at the very words. That was a promise she couldn\u2019t keep. When the baby decided to pop out, it would, regardless of any promises she had made.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Anders, have a heart,\u201d Marguerite chided. \u201cValerie was locked in a cage in a windowless basement for ten days. Dinner out will do her good.\u201d</p><p>Anders\u2019s gaze slid to the sleeping Valerie and he frowned. After delivering Valerie to Leigh and Lucian\u2019s, he\u2019d been sent to collect the other women from the house of cages. The building had been an old farmhouse in the country, probably a good 150 years old, by his guess. The basement hadn\u2019t been finished. The floor had been concrete at the front and dirt at the back, the stone walls had been wet with mold growing in crevices, and the whole place had smelled like death thanks to the bodies they\u2019d found piled up in a room behind the larger one where the cages were. The women they\u2019d found in the cages weren\u2019t the first occupants. And the owners of the old farmhouse had been in that tiny back room along with previous tenants of the cages.</p><p>After her nightmare stay there, he had no doubt Valerie would enjoy dinner out. Certainly she deserved it. She was a hero. She\u2019d saved herself and those other women. But if his long life had taught him one thing, it was that you don\u2019t always get what you want or deserve and he couldn\u2019t agree to dinner out . . . especially when he suspected Valerie had seen Igor across the street from her house. Marguerite had told him what Valerie hadn\u2019t when the three of them had powwowed in front of the van. She said Valerie had spotted Igor across the street, but convinced herself it was her imagination when he\u2019d disappeared so swiftly. He\u2019d wanted the three of them to spread out and search for the man when he\u2019d heard the news, but it hadn\u2019t taken him long to realize that was a bad idea. Igor might have been bait to take him, Bricker, and Marguerite away to search while his master went after Valerie. Leigh would have been next to useless in her present state and both women would have been vulnerable. As much as he wanted to catch the bastard who had hurt Valerie, safety came first. He\u2019d kept a sharp eye out on the way home though, but hadn\u2019t seen anything to indicate they were being followed.</p><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t actually go eat in a restaurant, maybe we could just go through a drive-thru,\u201d Leigh suggested, her tone now wheedling. \u201cSwiss Chalet is on the way home. It would only take a couple minutes and we can eat it out on the verandah. I\u2019m sure Valerie would enjoy that almost as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Anders muttered under his breath with frustration. Give him rogues to deal with any day. He had no problem saying no to them, and if they didn\u2019t listen, he could shoot them. But Leigh and Marguerite were a different matter altogether. They saw \u201cno\u201d as a challenge, and when they put their minds to it, they could be a real pain. Sadly, he couldn\u2019t shoot them.</p><p>Rather than say no, he tried reason. \u201cAre you sure you want more junk food, Leigh? We\u2019ve already had it twice today and you should be eating healthier. You have the baby to think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream and coffee are not junk food,\u201d Leigh informed him stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThen what are they?\u201d he asked dryly.</p> <p>\u201cNecessities.\u201d That answer came from Valerie and drew his gaze her way as she straightened in her seat and ran her hands over her face to wipe the sleep away. Turning, she smiled at him sleepy-eyed and said, \u201cCoffee is always a necessity. Ice cream less so. But coffee definitely is. And Swiss Chalet isn\u2019t really junk food. It\u2019s more like a Sunday-dinner-type meal. Chicken roasted over a spit, potatoes, and a bun.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively healthy, certainly healthier than a burger, and that way we don\u2019t have to cook.\u201d</p><p>The last part was the nail in the coffin of Anders\u2019s resistance. Valerie was injured and still recovering and Leigh was pregnant and had been complaining of swollen feet. Neither woman should be on her feet working in a kitchen. As for him, he didn\u2019t know a damned thing about cooking. It made stopping for dinner the logical solution. Anders liked logic.</p><p>\u201cVery well. We\u2019ll stop for takeout at Swiss Chalet,\u201d he said and was rewarded with a smile from Valerie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother ordering meals for Bricker and me,\u201d Marguerite said moments later, putting away her phone as Anders pulled in to the Swiss Chalet drive-thru. \u201cBricker has to take me back to the Enforcer house to collect my car. Julius just texted and his plane lands in an hour. I want to go home and spruce myself up before he arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulius is Marguerite\u2019s husband,\u201d Anders told Valerie as Bricker groaned in the backseat about missing out.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She smiled at him and then turned to pet Roxy as the dog shifted restlessly and tried to look out the window as the SUV came to a halt.</p><p>\u201cNot home yet,\u201d Valerie told the animal, rubbing her ears as she added, \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>The dog settled back and eyed Anders balefully, as if blaming him for the delay in getting somewhere where she could get out and stretch her legs. Shaking his head at the thought, Anders glanced around. \u201cWhat am I ordering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quarter-chicken dinner, white meat, for me,\u201d Leigh announced.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>Nodding, Anders turned to the speaker box as a muffled voice asked what he\u2019d like. Unsure what he\u2019d like, he simply followed the ladies\u2019 lead and said, \u201cThree quarter-chicken dinners. All white meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it four, Anders,\u201d Leigh piped up suddenly. \u201cLucian will probably be hungry when he gets home.\u201d</p><p>He changed the order. If they were lucky, the food might mitigate some of Lucian\u2019s anger over his taking the women to Cambridge. He doubted it, but one could hope, Anders thought as he drove around to the window to pay and claim their order.</p><p>\u201cDamn, that smells good,\u201d Bricker said as Anders set the bags of food on the floor between the front seats several moments later.</p><p>Anders didn\u2019t respond, but silently agreed. It smelled damned good and made his stomach tighten with what he suspected was hunger. That was something he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked feeling it now. But he was beginning to understand how finding a life mate could mess with a man\u2019s instincts. Smells that he used to hardly notice now seemed to bring about physical reactions in him that were extremely distracting. And Valerie? He glanced to her to find her looking at him. When she smiled, he felt his own lips crack into a crooked smile in response, and then he quickly turned forward again.</p><p>This life mate business wasn\u2019t anything like he\u2019d expected. In fact, he wasn\u2019t at all sure Valerie really was his life mate. His gaze slid to her again. She\u2019d taken the sweatshirt off as they\u2019d left Cambridge, leaving her in her own T-shirt and jeans. She had a good figure and he thought she was pretty, but he\u2019d met thousands of prettier women in his life. And then there was the fact that Decker, Mortimer, and the others he\u2019d witnessed with life mates couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of their women, but he didn\u2019t look at Valerie and have any great urge to \u201cjump her bones,\u201d as Bricker would call it.</p><p>However, he was eating again, and when he\u2019d taken her hand to help her into the truck earlier, he had felt a strange shock of awareness race up his arm and through his body. She\u2019d felt it too. He was pretty sure about that. It hadn\u2019t been the first time either, and it made him want to touch her again and see what would happen.</p><p>Anders shook his head at his own confused thoughts. Was she a life mate or not?</p><p>\u201cOf course, she is,\u201d Marguerite said softly behind him, and Anders grimaced at her being able to read his mind. Another sign of meeting a life mate. Damn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you bring Valerie\u2019s things in before I take Marguerite back,\u201d Bricker offered as Anders parked in front of Lucian and Leigh\u2019s house several minutes later.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Anders said, turning off the engine and opening his door. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Bricker to open the side door and help the women out, Anders walked around to the back of the SUV to retrieve the backpack, computer case, and duffel bag they\u2019d brought back. He slung those over one shoulder, then reached for the bag of dog food and the grocery bag holding dog dishes and other doggie accessories as well.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t carry all that,\u201d Valerie protested, coming around the back of the SUV with the Swiss Chalet bags in hand and Roxy at her side. She grabbed the dog bed and tried to take a bag from him, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he assured her, nudging the SUV door closed with his elbow, and then nodding her toward the house.</p><p>Shaking her head at his stubbornness, she turned toward the house, but paused beside Leigh at the front of the SUV to say good-bye to Marguerite and Bricker and thank them for all their help today. Anders waited patiently for the women to finish their nattering, and then followed Leigh and Valerie inside the house as Marguerite and Bricker got back in the SUV.</p><p>\u201cRoxy might need to go out,\u201d Valerie said with a frown as Anders set down her bags and closed and locked the front door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going out too,\u201d Leigh said cheerfully. \u201cI thought we\u2019d eat on the verandah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds nice.\u201d Valerie smiled and followed Leigh toward the back of the house with Roxy trailing her.</p><p>Leaving Valerie\u2019s bags for later, Anders grabbed the dog food and the bag with Roxy\u2019s things and followed the women.</p><p>While the women headed out onto the verandah, Anders stopped in the kitchen to fill one of the dog dishes with water and the other with food before joining them.</p><p>\u201cOh, that was nice of you. Thank you,\u201d Valerie said with surprise when she turned from watching Roxy nose curiously around the backyard and saw that Anders had brought food and water for the dog. Grimacing, she added, \u201cI should have thought of it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were carrying the human food,\u201d Anders said with a shrug as he set the dishes on the edge of the covered verandah. Straightening, he glanced to Leigh, who was setting out the plastic containers on the patio table. \u201cI\u2019ll get drinks. What would you ladies like?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing for me,\u201d Leigh said, picking up the second bag of food containing the two meals she hadn\u2019t set out, and heading for the French doors. \u201cI\u2019m going to put this in the fridge, take a nap, and heat it up to eat with Lucian when he returns. But there\u2019s a good selection of drinks inside, Valerie. You should take a look and see what you want. Anders can show you.\u201d</p><p>Anders stared after the woman with vexation. She was the one who\u2019d wanted to stop to eat. Now she was going to wait for Lucian? She was up to something, and he didn\u2019t have to work hard to figure it out. What had started out as a simple dinner for three was quickly turning into a romantic dinner for two on the verandah in the setting sun.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t hesitate to use the candles,\u201d Leigh announced suddenly, popping her head back out the door. \u201cThe sun will be gone soon and you\u2019ll want to be able to see what you\u2019re eating.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Valerie said with a smile as the woman disappeared back inside. She obviously had no clue this was a setup, but then she didn\u2019t know the people she was dealing with here.</p><p>Shaking his head, Anders headed for the French doors. \u201cCome. We\u2019d best get our drinks and eat before the food cools.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Valerie cast one last glance at Roxy before trailing him into the house.</p><p>\u201cWill she be all right out there?\u201d Anders asked as he led her to the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cYes. She won\u2019t run off or anything. Roxy stays close. In fact, if she notices I\u2019ve left the verandah, she\u2019ll probably come looking for me,\u201d Valerie assured him.</p> <p>Nodding, he opened the fridge door and eyed the contents. There were juices, milk, and several varieties of pop . . . and he didn\u2019t have a clue what was good. He waited until she\u2019d selected something called Dr. Pepper and then took one for himself as well.</p><p>\u201cA glass and ice cubes?\u201d Anders asked as he closed the door.</p><p>\u201cYes please. Just tell me where to find the glasses and I\u2019ll get them,\u201d she added.</p><p>Anders opened a cupboard door by the sink and they each took a glass. They then stopped at the refrigerator ice machine to get ice before heading back to the verandah. Roxy was just approaching the doors as they came out. She\u2019d obviously noticed her mistress\u2019s absence and had been about to search for her as Valerie had said she would.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Valerie praised, holding both her glass and can precariously in one hand so she could pet the dog with the other in passing. Anders wasn\u2019t sure what she was praising the dog for, but the dog liked it and wagged her tail wildly, her butt moving with the action. Valerie chuckled, but said, \u201cGo eat now.\u201d</p><p>Roxy immediately walked over to sniff the food he\u2019d set out for her, and then settled down to eating with serious intent.</p> <p>Shaking his head, Anders followed Valerie to the table and sat down across from her. As he opened his pop and poured it over the ice, he commented, \u201cShe listens well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s a good dog,\u201d Valerie said, glancing to Roxy as she poured her own pop.</p><p>\u201cWell trained,\u201d he countered, turning his attention to opening the lid of his meal and surveying the contents. It smelled amazing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d Valerie said with a shrug, opening her own meal. \u201cI was able to take Roxy into the clinic and keep an eye on her full-time. And the other animals there helped socialize her as well.\u201d</p><p>Anders glanced to the dog and admitted, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I haven\u2019t got a dog yet. I want one, but my hours aren\u2019t exactly regular and I don\u2019t want to stick the poor thing in a cage for hours on end. And what would I do with it if I had to be away for days?\u201d he added with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of the dog first. That\u2019s the sign of a good pet owner,\u201d Valerie said approvingly. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t consider things like that when they get a dog. They want one, so they get it. Then they\u2019re upset and think there\u2019s something wrong with the dog when it isn\u2019t easily trained or pees in the house.\u201d Opening the plastic bag her fork, knife, and napkin were in, she asked, \u201cHave you considered a training nanny for the first six months to a year?\u201d</p><p>Anders raised his eyebrows in question. \u201cA training nanny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not have anything like that here,\u201d she said with a frown and then explained, \u201cWe have a gal in Winnipeg who gets referrals from us. She takes puppies while the owners are working and helps train them. A dog sitter slash trainer . . . puppy nanny.\u201d She pursed her lips and then admitted, \u201cIt can be a bit pricey, but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to see if there\u2019s anyone like that here,\u201d he said thoughtfully and then they both fell silent as their attention turned to their food.</p><p>Anders\u2019s first bite of the chicken was a revelation. He\u2019d thought the ice cream was the most delicious thing he\u2019d ever tasted, but the chicken was easily its equal and he had to wonder if it was the food or this life mate business. Perhaps everything would be the most delicious thing he\u2019d ever tasted now. He supposed he\u2019d find out the answer to that as he sampled more and different foods.</p><p>As he ate, Anders thought perhaps he should stop being so hard on Bricker for his constant desire to stop for food here and there. He suddenly understood that desire. Although Bricker\u2019s hunger was only because he was young enough to still eat.</p><p>A satisfied sigh from Valerie drew his attention from his nearly empty container. His eyebrows rose when she pushed her half-finished meal away and sat back in her seat.</p><p>\u201cAll done?\u201d he asked, eyeing the chicken and fries remaining in the container.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. My stomach really must have shrunk. I\u2019m stuffed,\u201d she said, and then offered, \u201cDo you want to finish it?\u201d</p><p>When Anders nodded eagerly, she laughed and pushed the container across the table to him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said and quickly moved her left-over chicken and fries to his own container. He really shouldn\u2019t have room for the food either. His stomach had to be the size of a pea after centuries without solid food in it, and truth to tell, he was already past full himself, but he just couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of the tasty fare.</p><p>Valerie smiled indulgently as she watched him eat her food, but she began to yawn as he was finishing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d Anders commented as he returned both empty containers to the bag they\u2019d come in.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI didn\u2019t use to be such a lightweight, but I\u2019ve been falling asleep all over the place today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your body recovering. It\u2019ll pass,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Valerie nodded and then glanced to Roxy as the dog returned from a trip to relieve herself and settled at her side. Petting the German shepherd, she asked, \u201cHow long do you think I\u2019ll be here?\u201d</p><p>Anders hesitated. They had told her she was here because her captor had escaped, and that was partially true. There was a slim chance the man might come after her . . . if she\u2019d seen anything and was able to identify him. But they weren\u2019t holding out much hope of that. None of the other women had been able to tell them much of use. If the rogue had half a brain, Anders thought he had probably moved far away to start over and was even now terrorizing others. The real reason Valerie was here and hadn\u2019t been moved to the Enforcer house was because Anders had been foolish enough to admit to Lucian that he hadn\u2019t been able to read or control her at the house. Lucian now suspected she was Anders\u2019s life mate and wanted to find out for sure if she was, and if she would agree to be a willing life mate to him, before deciding how to handle her.</p><p>If she couldn\u2019t accept what he was, and was unwilling to be his life mate, her memories of her captivity and her stay here would be wiped from her mind and she\u2019d be returned to her life. But if she was willing . . .</p><p>Anders didn\u2019t allow himself to think about that. It would be too easy to imagine a whole life around this woman as his life mate. He could see it now, eating ice cream and other foods that didn\u2019t taste like sawdust, having a companion without having to constantly guard his thoughts . . . And then there was the supposedly hot life mate sex. He was very curious about that.</p><p>\u201cAnders?\u201d</p><p>Realizing he\u2019d not answered her question, he finally said, \u201cProbably not long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll capture him quickly, then?\u201d Valerie asked, tilting her head. \u201cHave you got a lead on him or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered honestly, and then gathered the remains of their meal together and stood. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that now. You need to relax and sleep to regain your strength. Let us worry about the rest. Come on, I\u2019ll carry your bags upstairs for you so you can go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated, obviously wanting to ask more questions, but another yawn caught her. Covering her mouth, she stood and nodded. \u201cTomorrow is soon enough to worry about things like that I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Anders agreed and led her and Roxy into the house. He detoured to the kitchen to throw out the garbage, and then led her back to the bags waiting at the front door.</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d Valerie said as he began to collect the bags. When he didn\u2019t respond, she moved to his side and picked up the computer case before he could, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not completely helpless, Anders.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d actually spoken his name and Anders found himself stilling briefly at the sound of it on her lips.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He straightened with the other bags and gestured for her to lead the way up the stairs.</p><p>Shrugging, Valerie turned and started up the stairs. This time Roxy didn\u2019t follow, but sat at the foot of the stairs. Anders paused to look at her, but the German shepherd seemed confused and looked from him to Valerie and back without moving.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you,\u201d Valerie announced, pausing halfway up the stairs to glance back when she realized he wasn\u2019t following. \u201cShe\u2019s been trained not to go up the stairs until the people have. It prevents her getting under your feet and tripping you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He started up the stairs, marveling once again at how well trained the dog was. Once he reached the top, the jingle of Roxy\u2019s name tag and license clinking together told him she was following. Shaking his head, he trailed Valerie up the hall. It wasn\u2019t until she stopped to open her door that he realized he\u2019d been staring at her derriere the whole way. The realization was rather startling. He\u2019d never been an ass man, but the shift and sway of her behind had held his fascination all the way up the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t expected to stand guard outside my room all night, are you?\u201d Valerie asked curiously as she led him into her room.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m in the room next door.\u201d Anders set her bags on the table by the window. \u201cClose enough to hear you shout if you need me. But there shouldn\u2019t be any problems. The alarm system here is state of the art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Valerie said with relief. \u201cI would have felt horrible thinking you were stuck standing in the hall all night. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to sleep,\u201d she added with a smile.</p><p>Anders turned to peer at her and hesitated. He wanted to kiss her. More out of curiosity than any great desire. The more he got to know this woman, the more he liked her. He admired her courage and strength, and was impressed by how well she\u2019d trained her dog. The loyalty the animal showed her mistress spoke well. And so far, he liked everything about her. But he wasn\u2019t lusting after her, and wanted to know if kissing her would bring on the life mate passion he\u2019d heard so much about. Unfortunately, it had been a while since he\u2019d wooed a woman and he wasn\u2019t sure how to go about it. Did he just grab and kiss her? Or was he expected to wait for some sign from her?</p><p>\u201cWell, I should get ready and go to bed,\u201d Valerie said finally and Anders smiled wryly. That was definitely a sign, he supposed, but not one suggesting she would welcome his kissing her.</p><p>Nodding, he turned and headed for the door. \u201cYell if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie said softly as he opened the door.</p><p>Pausing, Anders glanced back, his gaze shifting to the dog. \u201cDoes Roxy sleep with you, or should I take her downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. She sleeps with me,\u201d Valerie said, glancing to Roxy herself.</p><p>\u201cLucky dog,\u201d he murmured and caught her surprised glance before he stepped out and pulled the door closed.</p><p>Anders paused there briefly, silently kicking himself in the ass for not kissing her, but then shrugged and headed for the door to the room he\u2019d been given for the duration of his stay here.</p><p>He\u2019d kiss her tomorrow, he thought, and he wouldn\u2019t wait for a signal to do so. In the meantime, he was rather tired himself. He usually slept during the day, but Valerie\u2019s waking around noon had cut into his sleep. He\u2019d been up all night and then all day. He suspected his hours were going to be all screwed up for the next little while. Valerie probably kept normal hours and he\u2019d have to do so too to spend time with, and keep an eye on, her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roxy\u2019s whining woke Valerie. Opening her eyes to the dimly lit room, she took in the open bathroom door and the light spilling out of it. Despite Roxy being with her, she hadn\u2019t been willing to sleep in complete darkness. Valerie had been afraid she might wake up and think she was back in that cage.</p><p>Roxy whined again and Valerie shifted up onto her elbow to peer to the bottom right corner of the bed, but the German Shepherd wasn\u2019t there. She was standing on the floor beside the bed, whining unhappily. When Valerie glanced her way, she turned and moved to the door and then back.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go out, huh?\u201d Valerie asked, recognizing the signal. Sighing with resignation, she tossed her covers aside and sat up, wincing as a shot of pain caught her by surprise. She\u2019d forgotten about her back. Moving more carefully, Valerie stood up and glanced around for her robe, then recalled that it was still in the duffel bag. She\u2019d been too tired to bother unpacking it, and had simply stripped off her clothes, pulled on the oversized T-shirt she slept in, and crawled between the sheets.</p> <p>Valerie headed for the bags Anders had set on the table, but another, more urgent whine followed by a bark from Roxy made her change direction. Her T-shirt covered everything and the dog obviously really needed to go out. It made her wonder how long Roxy had been trying to wake her with her whines.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered as she reached the door. \u201cBut quietly. People are sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Roxy whined and wagged her tail and Valerie opened the door. The German shepherd was out the door at once, completely forgetting her manners. That said more about her urgency than anything else had and Valerie didn\u2019t waste time reprimanding her, but hurried up the hall after her, grateful for the night-lights in the plug sockets that lit her path.</p><p>Roxy remembered her manners at the stairs and paused to let Valerie go down first. There were no night-lights here, but they started again at the bottom of the steps and Valerie moved carefully down with one hand on the stair rail.</p><p>As she led Roxy toward the back of the house with the help of the night-lights, Valerie wondered what time it was. She glanced around for a clock as she crossed to the French doors and began to work the lock, but hadn\u2019t spotted one before she got the door unlocked. She pulled it open and Roxy bolted out just as an alarm suddenly started to blare. Valerie froze, only then remembering Anders saying something about a state-of-the-art alarm system. She\u2019d just set it off.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>The sudden screech of the alarm had Anders abruptly awake. A wash of adrenaline pumping through him propelled him out of the bed. Before he even knew what he was doing, he was at the door and dragging it open. Movement at the end of the hall caught his attention as he started forward. Anders slowed when he saw that it was Lucian coming out of the master bedroom.</p><p>Like himself, Lucian was shirtless. However, he did have his pants on. Undone, but on. Either he had just been undressing to go to bed, or he had thought to pull his pants on before exiting his room. Something he hadn\u2019t thought to do, Anders realized, suddenly aware that he was wearing only his boxers.</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d Lucian barked.</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Anders shouted as he hurried forward, but he couldn\u2019t be sure the other man heard him. He himself hadn\u2019t really heard Lucian say Valerie\u2019s name so much as read it on his lips. But he didn\u2019t bother to clarify what he\u2019d said. Moving swiftly again, he hurried to Valerie\u2019s door and thrust it open, only to find her bed empty. The bathroom door was open and that room appeared empty too. No Valerie and no Roxy.</p><p>Fear clutching at his chest, Anders didn\u2019t bother closing the door, but continued forward, shaking his head to tell Lucian she wasn\u2019t in her room. Anders got to the top of the stairs first and immediately started down, aware that Lucian was right behind him.</p> <p>Groaning, Valerie leaned her forehead against the door and closed her eyes as she listened to the thud of feet overhead. She\u2019d woken up everyone, of course.</p><p>Sighing, she straightened and turned to peer toward the stairs at the front of the house as she listened to the sounds coming from above. The thudding that had started out at opposite ends of the house was converging overhead, and then they started down the stairs.</p><p>Valerie really didn\u2019t want to stand there and wait for them, but had no choice. She\u2019d accidentally set off the alarm. This was on her. Besides, what else could she do? Rush outside and hide in the bushes, then sleep on the lawn furniture till morning?</p><p>\u201cValerie!\u201d Anders shouted, skidding to a halt as he rushed into the room and spotted her by the doors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she yelled to be heard over the alarm as a second man, tall and blond, pushed past Anders to rush to the French doors on the living room side of the room and began to punch numbers on a panel there. \u201cRoxy had to go out and I forgot about the alarm!\u201d</p><p>The last word was shouted into sudden silence as the alarm died abruptly. Valerie hardly noticed, however; she was too busy gaping at Anders and what he was wearing. Or not wearing. The man was barefoot and barechested, in his boxers . . . and damn, he looked fine. He was also staring at her as if he\u2019d never seen her before, she realized and bit her lip as she switched her gaze to the blond. The blond, though, was ignoring her entirely. He\u2019d picked up a nearby cordless phone and was now punching numbers into that.</p><p>He was calling the security office, Valerie realized when he recited a seven-digit number and then growled that everything was fine, the alarm was set off accidentally. He set the phone down and turned to glare at her then, irritation in every line of his body.</p><p>Valerie was sure she was about to get a blistering reprimand, but Leigh\u2019s cheerful voice intervened.</p> <p>\u201cWell, thank goodness we weren\u2019t asleep yet,\u201d the pregnant woman said, drawing attention to her arrival as she hurried across the room in a long pink robe to the blond man\u2019s side. She patted his arm soothingly, and then stretched up to whisper something in the man\u2019s ear. Finally, she turned to Valerie and smiled. \u201cAnd this works out well, because I was supposed to change your dressing before you went to bed, but you were sleeping when Lucian got home and I got up. I can do that now though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnders will do it,\u201d the blond growled. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lucian, it will only take me a minute. I can\u2014\u201d Leigh\u2019s protests died on a gasp when the blond picked her up and started across the room with her.</p><p>\u201cSee to it,\u201d the blond ordered as he passed Anders. \u201cAnd make sure she doesn\u2019t set off the alarm again.\u201d</p><p>Anders grunted in response and watched his boss stride up the hall carrying Leigh. When the couple disappeared upstairs, he turned back to Valerie again.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d she said quietly, trying to avoid looking directly at him. Honestly, no man should look that good, Valerie thought, but when he didn\u2019t respond, she risked a look. His shoulders had relaxed and he was running one weary hand over his short hair.</p><p>\u201cAccidents happen,\u201d Anders said finally, his hand moving down to the back of his neck now, kneading as if trying to remove tension there. Then he gestured behind her. \u201cRoxy\u2019s done her business I think.\u201d</p><p>Turning, she saw that the German shepherd had returned and now stood outside the door, peering in. Valerie hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d closed the door, but opened it now and let Roxy in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better see to your dressing,\u201d Anders muttered.</p><p>Valerie glanced around as she closed the door, but Anders had headed out of the room. She hesitated, but then followed, noting that he had very fine, muscular legs, and a nice rounded tush. Forcing that thought out of her head, she trailed him upstairs and to her room with Roxy on her heels. He had the bedside table drawer open when she entered and was removing items from it. He closed the drawer and turned to stride back to the door, but paused abruptly when he spotted her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He blinked at her. \u201cI was going to do it downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Valerie said at once, and spun to lead the way back downstairs. It seemed like a better idea than doing it there in her bedroom. Less personal. And there was no bed downstairs. Valerie wasn\u2019t sure why that made a difference, but didn\u2019t want to analyze it too much.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen has better light,\u201d Anders said as he followed her into the open-concept kitchen/living room and hit a switch, lighting up both sides of the room.</p><p>Valerie headed for the kitchen. Roxy stuck to her side at first and then suddenly jogged ahead. Someone had brought in her food and water dishes and set them on the floor by the stove. Roxy had spotted them and now picked up the food dish and carried it back to drop at Valerie\u2019s feet, bringing her to a halt beside the island.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Valerie asked with a frown as she bent to pick up the dish.</p><p>Anders glanced toward the microwave as he moved past her into the kitchen. \u201cSix thirty.\u201d</p><p>Valerie followed his gaze, noting the digital time glowing green in the top right corner of the appliance and wondered how she\u2019d missed that earlier. Not to mention how she\u2019d thought it was the middle of the night when the sky was actually lightening outside. There was no sign of the sun yet, but the sky was blue gray rather than black.</p><p>\u201cFeeding time I gather?\u201d Anders asked with amusement when Roxy sat down in front of Valerie and whined pitifully.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted wryly, carrying the dog dish around the island. \u201cRoxy\u2019s better than an alarm clock. Six thirty every morning she\u2019s up and outside and wants her breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Anders bent and retrieved the bag of dog food from a cupboard in the island and opened it, then poured it into Roxy\u2019s dish.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, when he\u2019d finished and began to close the bag.</p><p>She carried the dish over and set it down beside the water dish someone had thoughtfully refilled. She straightened then, but it wasn\u2019t until she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d that a hovering Roxy lunged forward. She was immediately snout deep in the food dish, gobbling up the colorful dry food.</p><p>\u201cShe has a healthy appetite,\u201d Anders said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI swear she has a hollow leg.\u201d Valerie turned and moved back to lean against the island. It was a strategic move. It hid her bare legs from his view. She, herself, was steadfastly ignoring his bare legs . . . and bare chest . . . and bare belly. Well, trying to anyway. Sighing, she raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cWhere did you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best light is here,\u201d Anders said, patting the island, and it was true, she acknowledged. The light was centered over the sink in the middle of the island and shone down bright and strong there.</p><p>After a hesitation, Valerie slid around the island and moved up beside him to lean over the sink, leaving her back under the light.</p><p>\u201cToo low,\u201d he said, his voice gruff.</p><p>Valerie straightened and turned with a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words ended on a gasp as Anders caught her by the waist and lifted her to sit on the island. He released her just as quickly as he\u2019d picked her up, and had moved around to the other side of the island almost before she\u2019d re-gathered her wits. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw him setting out the items he\u2019d fetched from her room: a large gauze pad, white medical tape and antibiotic ointment.</p><p>Valerie turned forward again with a grimace as she realized she\u2019d have to lift her shirt and she was presently sitting on it. Sighing, she leaned to one side, lifting one butt cheek off the island so that she could tug the cloth out there, then leaned the other way to do the same for that side. Then she tugged the cloth up and caught it under her arms so that it stopped just under her breasts in the front and\u2014she hoped\u2014at the same height in the back. She was extremely aware that it left her sitting there with only her pink panties covering her lower body. It made her wish she\u2019d worn her black boy-cut panties. They at least looked more like shorts.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Anders said behind her and she wondered if he was catching a cold. His voice had been gruff earlier and now it was husky.</p><p>That worry fled as he began to remove the bandage presently covering her wound. He was working slowly, obviously trying to be as gentle as possible, but the tape was well adhered to her skin and it stung enough that she wondered if she had back hair there or something. Biting her lip, Valerie focused on the lit digits on the microwave and tried to ignore the pain he was inadvertently causing. She sagged with relief though, when it was done and the bandage was off.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healing,\u201d Anders said.</p><p>That was good, she supposed. But \u201cit\u2019s healing\u201d didn\u2019t really tell her much. Was it a great gaping hole? Probably not, Valerie acknowledged. Leigh had said Dr. Dani had sewn her up, so it was probably a large, nasty puckered one. Lovely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put the salve on now. It might sting,\u201d he warned quietly.</p><p>Valerie nodded, and braced herself.</p><p>Again, she could tell that Anders was trying to be gentle. His fingers barely feathered over her skin, but it was tender enough that even that stung. Grinding her teeth, she held her breath and waited, trying to keep her mind blank.</p> <p>\u201cDone,\u201d Anders announced and Valerie let her breath out on a sigh, only to suck it back in as he laid the gauze over the wound. The first brush of it was nasty, but after that it seemed fine and she was able to breathe normally as he taped the pad in place.</p><p>\u201cAll done,\u201d Anders said. \u201cYou can let go of your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Valerie immediately lifted her arms, allowing the cloth to drop back down. She would have slid off the island then, but Anders had come around and was standing in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hi,\u201d she said like a brainless twit.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Anders responded and reached for her waist. She thought he was going to lift her down. She thought wrong. Instead, he clasped her waist, stepped between her legs and kissed her. It was just a gentle brushing of his lips at first, then firmer, and then his tongue slid out to nudge her lips open. It all got pretty fuzzy after that. Her brain seemed to shut down and give itself up to the rush of sensation that suddenly exploded through her. Honestly, the man could kiss. He did things to her lips and tongue that she\u2019d never before experienced. Her ex, Larry, hadn\u2019t been much of a kisser. More a pecker. Frankly, if he had a tongue, she wouldn\u2019t know. Anders definitely had one and knew what to do with it.</p> <p>When Roxy barked and they broke the kiss with a start, Valerie glanced down to see that she\u2019d tried to climb the man like he was a tree trunk. Her legs were wrapped around his hips, her ankles hooked behind his legs, her arms around his shoulders, her hands cupping his neck and head, and her butt was off the counter and in his hands. Valerie stared at Anders, and said, \u201cMmmfph.\u201d</p><p>Anders\u2019s response was to let his lips curve into the sexiest damn smile she\u2019d ever seen. Valerie stared back wide-eyed and bemused. She hadn\u2019t thought the man could smile. But then she hadn\u2019t known he could kiss either, Valerie thought as his mouth lowered toward hers again for another kiss, one that never landed because Roxy barked again, this time rearing up on her back paws to plant her front ones on them.</p><p>That was enough to get Valerie\u2019s attention. Roxy never jumped up on people.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Rox?\u201d Valerie gasped, pushing at Anders\u2019s chest to get him to set her down. He did, easing her to the floor as she swung her feet down from around his hips.</p><p>Now that she had her attention, Roxy immediately turned and ran to the door, where she barked and turned back to look at Valerie, legs shifting restlessly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie sighed and hurried over to open the door. Roxy needed to go out . . . desperately, Valerie thought when the dog bolted across the verandah and barely reached the grass before squatting.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need to get some waste pick-up bags,\u201d Valerie muttered and then gave a start when Anders rested his hands on her shoulders from behind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that when the stores open,\u201d he promised, pulling her back against his chest and bending his head to press butterfly kisses to her ear. Valerie was melting into him when he started to move her hair aside to kiss her neck. She immediately stiffened and pulled away, one hand rising self-consciously to be sure her throat was covered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide it from me, Valerie,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your neck.\u201d</p><p>Finished with her business, Roxy returned then, nudging Valerie\u2019s hand with her nose. She glanced down at the dog and petted her, relieved at the excuse to look away from Anders. He may already have seen her neck, but it didn\u2019t make her less self-conscious about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still tired. I think I\u2019ll go sleep for a little longer,\u201d she lied, heading out of the room with Roxy at her side. He didn\u2019t say or do anything to stop her and Valerie walked calmly upstairs to her room. She stepped inside, waited for Roxy to clear the door, then shut it and leaned weakly back against it, her eyes closing.</p><p>The memory of those few moments, or maybe more than a few moments, in Anders\u2019s arms, immediately washed over her. The passion had been staggering . . . mind-blowing. Valerie hardly knew the man, but if Roxy hadn\u2019t needed to go out, she suspected she\u2019d even now be riding that horse called sex. And where the hell had that passion come from? The guy was good-looking and everything, but until his lips had met hers, she hadn\u2019t really been thinking lusty thoughts about him. She\u2019d admired his pretty face and trim figure like one would admire a well-designed dress or shoe, but there had been no real spark of sexual interest.</p><p>Well, except when their hands had met on the soup bowl . . . and when he\u2019d taken her hand in Cambridge to help her back into the SUV, she acknowledged. Yeah, heated awareness had shot through her both times, but nothing like what had happened downstairs just now. That had been like a flash fire.</p><p>Roxy\u2019s wet nose against the palm of her hand stirred Valerie from her position. She glanced down at the dog, and gave her a pat, muttering, \u201cI\u2019ve lost my mind. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Shaking her head, she walked over to the bed and lay down. It hadn\u2019t yet been nine P.M. last night when she\u2019d lain down. She\u2019d slept straight through to six in the morning. More than nine hours. Valerie didn\u2019t expect to sleep, but she did want to avoid Anders for a while. At least until she thought she could be around him without trying to climb him like a telephone pole again.</p><p>Anders dropped onto the sofa and leaned his head back with a sigh. He stared at the ceiling overhead, but he was seeing Valerie\u2019s face after Roxy had broken up their kiss. Her lips had been swollen from his kisses, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes heavy-lidded with passion and hunger. He didn\u2019t doubt he\u2019d looked just as aroused. Just the memory of her lips under his, her body pressing eagerly against him, was making him hard again.</p><p>Damn, it had just been starting to go down, he thought with a grimace. On the bright side, there was now no question in his mind that Valerie was his life mate. Well, if there really had been before. There shouldn\u2019t have been\u2014he\u2019d had all the other symptoms\u2014but Anders had been hesitating about admitting it because of the lack of passion. It seemed he just had to touch her to ignite it. And he now understood the horn-dog type behavior of his comrades. Because now that he\u2019d tasted it, he couldn\u2019t wait to taste more. So much so that it was a struggle not to follow her up to her room. One kiss and she\u2019d melt in his arms like butter on a hot griddle.</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>Anders glanced around with a start. He found Lucian leaning against the door frame, eyeing him with amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, sitting up straight.</p><p>\u201cHow everything can change so swiftly,\u201d Lucian said dryly, moving into the kitchen.</p><p>Anders watched him get a glass out of the cupboard before asking mildly, \u201cAnd what is it you think is changing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days ago when you first realized you couldn\u2019t read her and that she might possibly be your life mate, you weren\u2019t happy,\u201d Lucian said. He filled the glass with water, took a drink, and then continued, \u201cYou didn\u2019t like the idea of anyone stealing so much of your attention, of having something to lose, of becoming a mother hen like me, or of being led around by your dick. Now you want to follow that presently very evident dick upstairs and claim Valerie by any means necessary.\u201d</p><p>Anders glanced down to note that not only did he still have an erection, but it was very evident in his boxers. Grabbing one of the couch pillows, he dragged it over his lap and muttered, \u201cYou caught all that from reading my thoughts, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear as glass,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Anders said and grimaced at the knowledge that Lucian had read his less than complimentary thoughts about his worry for Leigh and being led around by his dick. Raising an eyebrow, he asked, \u201cDo I owe you an apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I can hardly complain when I was eavesdropping on your thoughts.\u201d He took another drink of his water. As Lucian lowered the glass, he swallowed, and added, \u201cBut I\u2019d go softly with Valerie. I wouldn\u2019t want you to rush things and blow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice,\u201d Anders said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Lucian said softly.</p><p>Anders stilled. As a rule, Lucian could be counted on to growl, grunt, or bark. His voice only got that soft, solemn sound on very rare occasions. When it did, you were smart to listen. Anders nodded. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just experienced a nightmarish two weeks at the hands of what she thinks is a vampire. One of our kind,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cTen days and nights in the flesh and three in fever-driven nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we aren\u2019t vampires,\u201d Anders pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019re immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemantics,\u201d Lucian said with a shrug. \u201cIt won\u2019t make any difference to her whether we are the mythological cursed and soulless beast Stoker wrote about, or scientifically evolved mortals turned nearly immortal by bio-engineered nanos that were introduced into our blood before the fall of Atlantis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScientifically evolved mortals who need more blood than the human body can produce to power those nanos,\u201d Anders added wearily.</p><p>Lucian nodded. \u201cWe have fangs, we don\u2019t age, we are hard to kill and we need blood to survive. To her and many others, we are vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe drink bagged blood to survive now,\u201d Anders argued. \u201cThe immortal who kidnapped and held Valerie and the other women is a rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Lucian agreed. \u201cUnfortunately, Valerie\u2019s first encounter with our kind was via that rogue. She, understandably, is not going to be very receptive to the possibility that there are good guys among our kind. She needs to get to know and trust us, you especially, before you reveal too much.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded, seeing the wisdom in what he said. Then he cleared his throat and asked, \u201cBy don\u2019t reveal too much, you aren\u2019t including\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucian said, rare amusement curving his lips. \u201cBed her all you want, just keep your mouth shut while you do. At least until you think she can handle it. Otherwise,\u201d he warned, \u201cyou could lose the chance of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>On that note, Lucian set the glass down and headed for the door.</p><p>Anders was just relaxing into the couch to contemplate what had been said when Lucian paused at the hallway and glanced back to add, \u201cOf course, if you do something as stupid as take my very pregnant and overdue wife on another three-hour road trip, you won\u2019t live long enough to enjoy that chance of a lifetime anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lucian didn\u2019t wait for a response, but strode away, leaving the threat hanging in the air.</p><p>Grimacing, Anders closed his eyes. He wasn\u2019t surprised by Lucian\u2019s threat. He\u2019d expected it to come eventually. When Valerie had retired, Anders had lain down too, stripping down to his boxers for comfort\u2019s sake. But he\u2019d fully expected to wake up in an hour or so and come down to face the music if Lucian was back, or wait to face the music if he wasn\u2019t. However, he\u2019d slept right through the night until the blaring house alarm had shaken him from sleep.</p><p>Christ, that had been an experience and a half. After all the panic and hurry, he\u2019d charged downstairs only to find Valerie standing by the French doors in the kitchen looking guilty, mortified, and cute as a button in an overlarge T-shirt.</p><p>The memory brought a smile to his face that quickly faded as he considered Valerie and how to gain her trust enough that she wouldn\u2019t run screaming for the hills when he eventually risked explaining who and what he was. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Valerie blinked her eyes open and found herself staring into Roxy\u2019s furry face. The dog immediately whined. It probably wasn\u2019t the first time. Grimacing, Valerie sat up and glanced to the bedside clock. It was a little after noon. She\u2019d fallen asleep again. She hadn\u2019t intended to, and hadn\u2019t thought she would after sleeping so long already. Valerie had only intended to lie down for a bit until the others got up. It seemed to her that having others around might be a good thing if she didn\u2019t want another heated session with Anders.</p><p>\u201cSorry, girl,\u201d Valerie said, ruffling Roxy\u2019s fur. \u201cYou must be bored stiff and ready for a run. You probably haven\u2019t had one while I was gone. It\u2019s hard to imagine Mrs. Ribble walking you, let alone taking you for a run. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m in no shape to take you for one either right now. I\u2019d probably flake out in five minutes,\u201d she added with a frown, and then suggested, \u201cHow about a game of fetch though?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roxy barked. Smiling, Valerie gave her another pat and then stood up. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go see who\u2019s up and then I\u2019ll take you out in the backyard and throw the ball for you.\u201d</p><p>Roxy followed closely as Valerie walked to the door, bumping up against her leg repeatedly as if herding her along. It made Valerie smile and pat the dog\u2019s head as she walked. She didn\u2019t encounter anyone in the hall, or on the main floor. It looked like everyone else was still sleeping. But then it had been night when she\u2019d called 911 and these men had been working. She supposed they worked nights and slept most of the day. Which was a bit worrisome. Did that mean the alarm was on again and would be every morning when Roxy needed out? She fretted over the possibility as she walked to the panel by the French doors in the living room. Much to her relief, the panel read \u201cready,\u201d which she knew from the alarm at her clinic meant it wasn\u2019t on.</p><p>Relaxing, she fetched Roxy\u2019s ball from the bag Anders had set next to the island last night, and then led the German shepherd outside to throw the ball for her to fetch. It turned out she wasn\u2019t in much better shape for that than running. Every time she threw the ball, the stitches in her back made their presence known. Even using her left hand didn\u2019t help much, and her throws were pretty lame.</p> <p>Valerie was about to give up the game when she heard the French doors open behind her. She turned to look around at once, half relieved and half disappointed to see Leigh smiling at her from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d the brunette called cheerfully, stepping out onto the sheltered verandah.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Valerie responded, offering a smile. She threw the ball one last time for Roxy, and then turned to approach the other woman. \u201cSorry about waking you up this morning.\u201d</p><p>Leigh waved that away. \u201cWe\u2019d just gone to bed. We weren\u2019t asleep.\u201d</p><p>Valerie raised her eyebrows. \u201cNight owls?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d Leigh laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re up now if you only went to bed at six thirty,\u201d she commented.</p><p>\u201cI napped earlier, remember?\u201d she said with a shrug and rubbed her stomach as she admitted, \u201cI find I\u2019m having trouble sleeping for anything more than a couple hours. I can\u2019t get comfortable and tend to take a lot of short naps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Valerie nodded, her gaze dropping to Leigh\u2019s belly. She supposed it would be hard to find a comfortable position in her condition.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for breakfast?\u201d Leigh asked suddenly, turning to lead the way back into the house.</p><p>\u201cActually, yes. I\u2019m starved,\u201d Valerie admitted at once and whistled for Roxy as she followed her inside. As she waited by the open door for the dog to come in, she added, \u201cBut why don\u2019t you sit down and let me cook? Just tell me what you want and where to find it and I\u2019ll play chef.\u201d</p> <p>When Leigh hesitated, looking tempted, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do for your letting me stay here.\u201d</p><p>Leigh chuckled at the claim, and then heaved a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome here and don\u2019t have to work off your stay, Valerie.\u201d Grimacing, she added, \u201cBut I would appreciate some help with breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Valerie assured her.</p><p>Nodding, Leigh walked over to a cupboard and opened it to survey the boxed and canned food inside.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about pancakes?\u201d she asked as she pulled out a box of buttermilk pancake mix.</p><p>\u201cLove them,\u201d Valerie said at once.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Leigh beamed and opened another cupboard to retrieve a big bowl. \u201cCan you grab the eggs and milk out of the fridge while I start the coffee?\u201d</p><p>They chatted amiably as they worked. Once they had the batter for the pancakes mixed, Leigh decided they should add sausages to the breakfast. She set the electric grill up on the island and sat in one of the chairs to cook the sausages while Valerie flipped pancakes at the range.</p> <p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced around at that gasped comment from Leigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014nothing, I just\u2014\u201d She wrinkled her nose and then admitted, \u201cI know you probably thought we had, but we never contacted your family to let them know you\u2019re okay, Valerie. They\u2019re probably worried sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Valerie turned back to her pancakes and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no one to contact or worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one?\u201d Leigh asked and she could hear the frown in her voice.</p><p>Valerie shook her head. \u201cI was an only child. My grandparents died one after another of heart attacks and cancer as I was growing up and my parents died three years ago in a car accident. There\u2019s just myself and an aunt who moved to Texas thirty years ago. I\u2019ve only seen her twice since then. At her parents\u2019 funerals.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOther than Christmas cards, we don\u2019t stay in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Leigh said softly and fell silent.</p><p>\u201cWhat about friends?\u201d Anders asked, and Valerie nearly jumped out of her skin. Both at his sudden joining of the conversation and because of his chest brushing her back as he reached around her to set a small Petsmart bag on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWaste pick-up bags,\u201d he murmured by her ear, his fingers drifting lightly over her bare upper arm as his hand withdrew. \u201cSince Lucian was here to keep you safe, I popped out and picked them up for you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stared blankly at the bag, aware that shivers were running down her spine and goose bumps were popping up on her skin where his breath and fingers had passed. She had to wonder how she could be staring at something so unsexy and be so turned on at the same time.</p><p>A muffled laugh drew Valerie\u2019s confused gaze to Leigh and the other woman grinned at her as she said, \u201cThat was sweet of you, Anders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Valerie said and then paused to clear her throat when it came out froggy. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind you,\u201d Leigh added. \u201cRed roses might have been sweeter than red doggie pooh bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind for next time,\u201d Anders responded.</p><p>Valerie flushed and turned back to the pancakes. What Leigh was suggesting would have been appropriate if they were dating or something, but they weren\u2019t, and she did appreciate his running out to get her the bags. She didn\u2019t want to repay Leigh for allowing her into her home by leaving little Roxy gifts all over their yard . . . And what did his response mean exactly?</p><p>\u201cSo, you have no family, but what about friends?\u201d Anders asked, reminding her of his earlier question.</p><p>\u201cI have friends, of course. But they\u2019re back in Winnipeg. They won\u2019t even know I went missing.\u201d She flipped the pancakes and added, \u201cI only moved to Cambridge the week before I was kidnapped and I spent most of that week rushing around getting things I needed for the house and for classes. I hadn\u2019t made any friends here yet.\u201d She lifted the pancakes out of the frying pan and slid them onto a plate in the oven to keep warm, then poured two more onto the griddle before admitting, \u201cMrs. Ribble is the only person I\u2019d even talked to besides store clerks and school officials and that was because she came out to say that Roxy better not be a barker or she\u2019d call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then the old bat goes and tries to steal her,\u201d Leigh muttered.</p><p>Valerie shook her head at the comment and glanced around with amusement. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you guys have it in for the woman. She did look after Roxy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor purely selfish reasons,\u201d Leigh said grimly. \u201cTrust me, that woman is the most selfish, bitter old biddy I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Valerie turned to stare at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even talk to her. Have you met Mrs. Ribble before or something?\u201d</p><p>Leigh opened her mouth, and then paused briefly before saying, \u201cI know someone who knows her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Valerie turned back to the pancakes. She wasn\u2019t terribly surprised to hear Mrs. Ribble was a mean-spirited old woman. She\u2019d already developed that opinion herself even before the last encounter. In the week that she\u2019d been living next door to the woman, she\u2019d heard or seen her giving hell to three neighbors for things that were none of her concern, and harass the local kids for infractions as small as accidentally stepping off the sidewalk onto her grass. The woman seemed to delight in making other people miserable. And she was good at it. Lots of practice, Valerie suspected.</p><p>\u201cSo, it could have been quite a while before anyone noticed you\u2019d gone missing,\u201d Anders said thoughtfully, and Valerie glanced around to see that he was getting himself a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYes, quite a while,\u201d she acknowledged, turning back to her pan. \u201cNone of the other women had family or friends in the area either. We figured that out pretty quick while talking. Not one of us had anyone to worry or raise a fuss over our going missing. We thought that was probably the reason he chose us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d Leigh said solemnly. \u201cAnd it was smart of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt explains why we didn\u2019t get on to him sooner,\u201d Anders said, and then pointed out, \u201cIf he continues with that pattern it will be harder to track him down.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned at the thought of this monster out there somewhere preying on other women even as they spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt will take him a while to set up somewhere else,\u201d Leigh said, her thoughts apparently moving along the same line as Valerie\u2019s. \u201cHe needs to find a new home base, gather cages and whatnot . . .\u201d She paused, and then asked, \u201cValerie, was there anything else you had in common with the other women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Valerie asked uncertainly, turning sideways so she could keep one eye on her cooking and one on Leigh.</p><p>\u201cWell, there has to be a way that he set his sights on each of you. It can\u2019t be a coincidence that none of you had family and friends. Likely he chose each of you because of that, but how did he find it out?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs there some welcoming organization or something? Did you all use the same realtor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Valerie admitted with a frown. They hadn\u2019t followed that line of questioning. After discovering each of them had that in common, they\u2019d mostly talked about each other, their memories of better times, their lives, their regrets over things they hadn\u2019t yet done, their dreams for the future when they were free, and what foods they\u2019d most like to eat. They\u2019d even talked about books they\u2019d read and movies they\u2019d seen, anything to take them temporarily from their grim reality. Now she wished she\u2019d thought of this and asked these questions of the others. It could be a way to find the man.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Leigh said brightly, using her tongs to turn the sausages she was cooking. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to do that now. We can get you all together and let you talk until we sort out what place or person you all have in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced beyond Leigh to see Lucian standing just inside the room. His hair was sleep ruffled, and he wore jeans, but was shirtless. However, a T-shirt dangled from his fingers and even as she looked his way he started to pull it on.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it possible, Lucian?\u201d Leigh asked. \u201cAll we have to do is take Valerie to the Enforcer house to chat with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would be nice except that the women have been returned to their lives,\u201d he said, moving forward to kiss his wife on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Leigh said with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get them all together,\u201d Valerie said reasonably.</p><p>Leigh bit her lip as Lucian and Anders exchanged glances, and then Lucian said, \u201cOf course, we can contact them and ask if they\u2019d be willing, but I suspect they all just want to forget what happened and get on with their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I imagine they do. But surely they\u2019ll want the man who kidnapped us captured and off the streets,\u201d she pointed out with a frown.</p><p>Lucian made a noncommittal sound and moved around the island to fetch himself a cup of coffee. He fixed it sweet and white, took a gulp, and then turned to eye her. \u201cBefore they were returned to their lives, the other women were asked what this Igor of yours and his boss looked like. None of them seemed to be able to answer that.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grimaced and shook her head as she switched out the latest pancakes for fresh batter. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. We were in the dark most of the time. Igor was just a large silhouette who delivered food and water and dragged one of us away every day. And whatever was in that oatmeal was some nasty stuff. The first time he took me upstairs I was under the influence and it was like a bad acid trip, faces coming out of the wall, their faces and bodies distorted as if looking through the bottom of a pop bottle, and the whole house spinning dizzily around me.\u201d She shook her head at the unpleasant memory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut the last time you weren\u2019t under the influence,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>Valerie nodded, but concentrated on cooking for several moments, before saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t see Igor\u2019s boss at all, and I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t pay much attention to Igor himself. I was busy looking for a weapon or an escape route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do your best to describe him,\u201d Anders said quietly before Lucian could speak again.</p> <p>Valerie sighed. She stared at the pancakes as she said, \u201cHe was big. Bigger than you two, even. And crazy strong. When he hit me it was like being hit by a train. He sent me flying right out of the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Anders said when she fell silent. \u201cWhat color was his hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark brown,\u201d she answered as an image of him bent over the tub came to mind. \u201cShort and dark brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his face? Was there anything notable about his features?\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned and tried to remember. She hadn\u2019t looked at him from the cage all the way up to the bathroom. Her eyes had been darting around looking for a way to escape. She pictured him turning to her in the bathroom, but all she saw was the shampoo squirting out over his face. But then she saw him coming out of the bathroom after her. There had still been shampoo on his face, but he\u2019d wiped the worst of it away.</p> <p>\u201cI think he had a big nose,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cAnd small mean eyes under a high forehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his mouth?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cThin lipped I think,\u201d she said uncertainly. \u201cAnd he had big ears.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell briefly when she finished and then Lucian said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get Valerie together with a sketch artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know one?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can borrow one, either from the local police or somewhere further afield,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cI\u2019ll call Bastian after breakfast and see if he can arrange something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of breakfast, the sausages are done,\u201d Leigh announced. \u201cValerie, how are we doing on the pancakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last two are in the pan,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll get plates and silverware\u2014\u201d Leigh began to get off her seat, but Lucian immediately put a hand on her shoulder to stop her.</p><p>\u201cAnders and I will get plates and silverware. You just sit and relax,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cValerie, do you have a coffee?\u201d Anders asked as he retrieved plates from the cupboard.</p><p>\u201cNo. It only finished dripping just before you came in,\u201d she answered, turning the last two pancakes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to grab one.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment, but a moment later set a fresh cup of coffee down beside her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie murmured and picked it up to take a tentative sip. Her eyes widened as she tasted it.</p> <p>\u201cCream and one sugar, right?\u201d Anders asked uncertainly when he noted her expression.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s good. I was just surprised you remembered how I ordered it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was driving. I ordered it for you,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you had to order five different coffees. I\u2019m just surprised you remembered how I take mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mental note of it,\u201d Anders said simply as he moved away.</p><p>Valerie stared after him as he retrieved maple syrup for the pancakes, and ketchup for the sausages under Leigh\u2019s instruction. He\u2019d made a mental note of how she liked her coffee. What did that mean? Why had he gone to the trouble? For her? Did that mean he liked her? Was he interested in her? Well, okay, those kisses earlier suggested he was definitely interested, but that was just . . . well, chemistry. Physical. The consideration revealed in taking note of how she took her coffee was . . .</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what it was, but it had taken Larry years to remember how she took her coffee, and Anders had taken the trouble to remember it the first time out. It gave her something to think about.</p><p>Shaking her head, Valerie turned her attention to removing the last two pancakes from the pan. Breakfast was ready.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Anders, your pacing is driving me wild,\u201d Leigh said with exasperation. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Anders paused with surprise and turned to peer at the brunette curled up in the corner of the couch with a book in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not pacing, I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrows, waiting, and he sighed.</p><p>\u201cPacing,\u201d he acknowledged and sank onto the nearest chair. He rested his elbows on his spread knees, allowing his hands to dangle between them, and stared out the window. After several minutes, he dropped back in the chair with a heavy sigh, then straightened and asked impatiently, \u201cWhat the devil is she doing up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s checking with her academic advisor to ensure that missing the first two weeks of classes won\u2019t bugger her up for the term,\u201d Leigh reminded him patiently.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that should have been a five-minute conversation. She\u2019s been up there over an hour,\u201d he complained. Valerie had helped clean up the kitchen after breakfast, then had taken Roxy with her and escaped upstairs on the pretext of calling the veterinary college to be sure she was still welcome after missing the first two weeks of the semester.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, perhaps whoever she needs to speak to wasn\u2019t available and she\u2019s waiting for a call back,\u201d Leigh suggested. \u201cOr maybe they had work for her to do to keep from falling behind and she\u2019s up their reading her textbooks and studying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe she\u2019s hiding,\u201d Anders said unhappily.</p><p>Leigh tsked with irritation. \u201cWhy would she be hiding?\u201d</p><p>Anders didn\u2019t respond, but in his mind he was remembering their kiss that morning . . . well, kisses. Or maybe one kiss. He wasn\u2019t sure how to classify it. Did you have to come up for air to classify it as more than one kiss? Or was it counted in minutes or seconds? Because it had been a constant devouring of each other\u2019s mouths for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cOh my, yes. I see,\u201d Leigh murmured.</p><p>Anders glanced up at her murmur and noted her narrowed concentration on him. She\u2019d read his damn mind.</p><p>\u201cYes, that might have made her want to hide out,\u201d she said sympathetically. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when I had my first encounter with life mate passion. It was pretty terrifying. And she didn\u2019t have any idea what was happening. I mean, as an immortal you had heard about it, had some idea of what to expect, and yet you were still overwhelmed by it. Imagine how she must feel. She got hit by a nuclear explosion of passion out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Anders sighed and ran one hand wearily over his closely cropped hair. Leigh wasn\u2019t saying a damned thing he hadn\u2019t already thought of. Which was why he suspected Valerie was hiding out. The question was, how long would she hide? And how was he supposed to get her to know and trust him if she wouldn\u2019t come out of her room?</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Leigh set aside the book she\u2019d been reading, and uncurled her legs from under her to stand up. \u201cI\u2019ll go see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Anders was on his feet at once. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to see what the situation is first,\u201d she pointed out patiently.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He nodded.</p><p>\u201cJust sit down and try to stop looking like an expectant father. You\u2019re giving me contractions here.\u201d</p><p>Anders eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoking, Anders,\u201d Leigh said with exasperation as she waddled out of the room.</p><p>He stared after her until she disappeared on the stairs, and then lifted his eyes to the ceiling, mentally following her journey to Valerie\u2019s room. When he heard her knock on the door, he stood frozen for a moment, then suddenly hurried to the bookshelf beside the television and grabbed a random book. Taking it back to his chair, Anders dropped to sit and opened the book to the middle so that he could pretend to be reading if Leigh lured Valerie back down.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cA swim?\u201d Valerie said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m supposed to get exercise, but walking makes my ankles swell, and, frankly, carrying this baby around is like having a sack of potatoes strapped to your waist, but the water makes it all easier,\u201d Leigh explained. \u201cHowever, Anders doesn\u2019t swim, and I don\u2019t want to be in the pool by myself in case I go into labor or something, so I thought maybe you\u2019d like to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Valerie hesitated. She really didn\u2019t have any excuse to say no. She\u2019d made her phone call as soon as she\u2019d got up here, and managed to get through to her advisor. The conversation hadn\u2019t lasted long, but afterward, Valerie had been self-conscious about facing Anders again. She maybe shouldn\u2019t be, she\u2019d spent time with him since their kiss. But having him come into a room where she was, was different from her having to enter a room where he was. So, she\u2019d made poor Roxy sit in this room for the last hour, and that after making her sleep in here for hours. The poor dog was probably sorry she was back. At least at Mrs. Ribble\u2019s she got to go out in the yard.</p><p>Now Valerie considered Leigh\u2019s words and shifted from one foot to the other. A swim. Being in a bathing suit in front of Anders. But with Leigh . . . who was afraid to swim and rightfully so in her state. And who had also been kind enough to allow Valerie into her home to help keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cI can loan you a swimsuit if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I actually picked up my swimsuit when we were at the house. I thought with the pool . . .\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Leigh beamed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just go put mine on and meet you at the top of the stairs then. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Valerie smiled, and saw her out, then turned and went to dig her bathing suit out of the drawer. She\u2019d finally unpacked the bags after coming up after breakfast. Now she pulled her swimsuit out and quickly changed. Once done, she then just stood there and stared at herself with alarm. Her body hadn\u2019t been anywhere near a razor in two weeks. She was a bloody gorilla!</p><p>Groaning, Valerie closed her eyes briefly, then moved to the makeup case Marguerite had packed for her. She hadn\u2019t checked inside when she\u2019d taken it out of her suitcase and plunked it on the bathroom counter. Now, Valerie quickly unzipped the bag, silently praying that\u2014</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed when the first two items to spill out were her razor and a container of blades.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Marguerite,\u201d Valerie breathed. She was standing with one foot in the sink when a knock sounded at the door. Shouting, \u201cCome in,\u201d she continued her work, scraping the razor swiftly over her skin.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re grabbing a towel, don\u2019t bother. I have a couple of beach towels for us. They\u2019re bigger and\u2014Oh.\u201d Leigh paused as she reached the bathroom door. \u201cGee, I hadn\u2019t thought about. Well . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither had I,\u201d Valerie admitted wryly, quickly drying the first leg before shifting positions to work on the other one. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I saw the koala bear legs I had developed that I remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they aren\u2019t that bad,\u201d Leigh said.</p><p>\u201cYes, they are, or were,\u201d Valerie countered, thinking Leigh really was a bad liar.</p><p>Apparently she agreed, because she suddenly grimaced and admitted, \u201cYes, they are. Girl, you could almost braid that hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Valerie said on a laugh as she soaped her second leg.</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t really have to shave. We\u2019d have been a matching pair. I mean I haven\u2019t been able to even reach my legs in over a month.\u201d</p><p>Valerie chuckled at the suggestion as she shaved. \u201cYeah, but you have an excuse. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Leigh nodded. \u201cI suppose being kidnapped and locked in a cage for ten days and then being unconscious for three days are no excuse for hairy legs.\u201d</p><p>Valerie blinked at her, and then felt a reluctant smile curve her lips before she agreed, \u201cNo excuse at all.\u201d</p><p>Finished with her second leg, Valerie grabbed the towel and quickly dried it, wiping away the remaining soap. She then paused and peered at herself, feeling a bit self-conscious in her swimsuit and T-shirt. Which was really just silly. She\u2019d worn less at the beach. But then Anders hadn\u2019t been at the beach. The thought made her grimace. One kiss and she was suddenly shy of the man?</p><p>\u201cCome on, beauty, you\u2019ve vanquished the hairy beast. Now let\u2019s go get wet,\u201d Leigh said turning toward the door.</p><p>\u201cBeast? Nice,\u201d Valerie said with amusement, and hurried to follow her from the room, patting her leg to command Roxy to follow.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me take those.\u201d She relieved Leigh of the beach towels as they reached the stairs so the pregnant woman could hold the rail, and then followed her silently down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anders was sitting reading in the living room when Valerie followed Leigh into the room. She cast one nervous glance his way, then focused on the woman in front of her.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and go see how the temperature of the water is. I\u2019m just going to grab some suntan lotion for us,\u201d Leigh said, suddenly veering toward the kitchen.</p><p>Valerie hesitated briefly, but then continued resolutely to the French doors and outside, Roxy on her heels. It was only as she closed the door and inhaled that she realized she\u2019d been holding her breath since entering the kitchen/living room.</p> <p>\u201cYou can quit pretending. She\u2019s outside.\u201d</p><p>Anders glanced up innocently from the book. \u201cWhat makes you think I was pretending?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s that or you\u2019ve taken a sudden interest in The Joy of Pregnancy,\u201d she said dryly, retrieving the suntan lotion from a kitchen drawer.</p><p>Anders flipped the book over with dismay to stare at the cover. It was indeed The Joy of Pregnancy.</p><p>Closing the drawer, Leigh added, \u201cAnd you were reading it upside down.\u201d</p> <p>Cursing under his breath, Anders tossed the book on the coffee table and stood up. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going swimming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can thank me later,\u201d she added, heading for the French doors.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cGo change into a swimsuit and come out in about ten minutes. I\u2019m going to be exhausted and get out and you\u2019ll have to stay to watch Valerie.\u201d She put a hand on the doorknob, but paused and looked back. \u201cBut remember what I said and go easy with her.\u201d</p><p>Anders watched her leave, and then hurried upstairs to his room to change into his swim trunks, glad he\u2019d thought to throw them in when he\u2019d packed his bag. The house had come with the pool when Lucian bought it, and Anders knew he\u2019d often used it at night, but after marrying Leigh he\u2019d put an awning over it that blocked the UV rays and not the sun. It allowed her to swim in sunlight without having to ramp up the amount of blood she needed. It was an awesome experience and Anders had been seriously considering putting in a pool at his place with the same setup.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t why he was eagerly yanking off his clothes and dragging on his swim trunks though. He\u2019d have risked the sun to swim with Valerie. Although, swimming wasn\u2019t what was on his mind. Holding her nearly nude and wet body in his arms in the sun-warmed water was what was making him as eager as a teenage boy.</p> <p>Anders padded out of his room and back downstairs, but paused at the French doors. Leigh had said ten minutes. Did that mean he shouldn\u2019t go out before ten minutes had passed? Shifting impatiently, he glanced at his wristwatch, only to realize he hadn\u2019t checked it earlier. By his guess it had taken him thirty seconds to hurry upstairs, thirty seconds to hurry down, and maybe two minutes to change his clothes. Or three, he thought. So he maybe had another six minutes.</p><p>He patted his leg impatiently, eyes narrowing on the women. Both of them were already in the pool, only their heads visible as they talked and laughed. When Valerie turned and suddenly disappeared under the water, Anders checked his watch. Only two minutes had passed since he\u2019d arrived at the door.</p><p>\u201cScrew it,\u201d he muttered and headed out.</p><p>Leigh was mounting the steps out of the pool by the time he reached it. Snatching up one of the towels that lay neatly folded on the lawn chair closest to the steps, Anders carried it over to her.</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing,\u201d Leigh announced as he took her arm to ensure she didn\u2019t lose her footing as she stepped onto the pool surround. \u201cShe\u2019s swimming laps, so can\u2019t protest my leaving or announce she\u2019s tired and escape with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarguerite\u2019s rubbing off on you,\u201d Anders said dryly.</p><p>\u201cFlattery, Anders? Really?\u201d she said, grinning as she accepted the towel he now held out. Leigh didn\u2019t bother drying herself, simply wrapped it around her torso and headed for the house. \u201cHave fun. I\u2019m lying down for a nap. All this fresh air has just exhausted me.\u201d</p><p>Anders smiled at her exaggerated tone of voice, glad Valerie didn\u2019t hear it. She would have known right away that the woman was just clearing the way for them to spend time alone. Speaking of which . . .</p> <p>Turning, he eyed Valerie in the pool. She was on a return lap, swimming toward his end of the pool, her arms knifing through the water, legs kicking below the surface, and body beautiful in a royal blue two-piece swimsuit.</p><p>Anders had always liked women with some meat on them and Valerie had that. She\u2019d never walk the runways in Paris, but she\u2019d featured pretty constantly in the runways in his head since their kiss that morning. Constantly. Only she wasn\u2019t on a runway, and she wasn\u2019t wearing anything, let alone the latest fashions.</p><p>Damn. He was just as bad as the other immortal men he\u2019d seen fall under the life mate spell, Anders acknowledged. He\u2019d been pretty smug as he\u2019d watched the others flounder at work, unable to concentrate and focus on anything but their life mate. It made him grateful no one was here to witness his own idiocy but Leigh and Lucian. Neither of them would tease or taunt him over this . . . much. But Bricker? Oh yeah. The young immortal would love to have something over him.</p><p>Valerie touched this end of the pool wall, took a breath, did a half somersault in the water and pushed off the pool to propel herself toward the opposite end. Anders watched her go, and then walked down the steps into the water, enjoying the cool liquid sliding up over his feet, calves, knees, thighs\u2014 Yeehaw! The pool was sun-warmed, but still cooler than his skin and the first splash of it against his groin was a shocking awakening. Damn. It was almost enough to dampen his hunger for Valerie. Almost being the key word in that thought, Anders acknowledged with a wry, self-deprecating smile as he moved through the water to stand where she had turned at the end of her last lap. He then simply stood and waited as she did her flipping thing at the other end and started back.</p><p>Anders was actually disappointed when Valerie paused little more than halfway back and surfaced. Pushing the hair and water off her face, she glanced around, no doubt in search of Leigh as she laughed and said, \u201cGeez, two weeks makes a difference. I can\u2019t do half the laps I used t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice died, her smile fading as she noted that Leigh was missing and Anders was now submerged in the water ahead of her. Swallowing noticeably, she asked, \u201cWhere\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeigh tires easily right now,\u201d Anders answered, interrupting the question. He started to move toward her through the water, adding, \u201cShe asked me to spot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her expression growing wary, Valerie moved sideways toward the side of the pool. \u201cWell, I should probably get out too then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Anders said, stopping where he was and giving her space. \u201cBesides, if you get out, who\u2019s going to spot me?\u201d</p><p>Valerie paused, looking uncertain. \u201cLeigh said you don\u2019t swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell she was wrong, and I\u2019d like a couple laps myself if you\u2019re willing to stick around and keep an eye on me. It\u2019s never good to swim alone, and I need the exercise or I get flabby.\u201d It was a bald-faced lie. Nothing he did would ever make him flabby, but his words had the effect he\u2019d hope for. Her eyes widened and dropped over what was visible of his chest above the water line.</p><p>\u201cYou? Flabby? Yeah right,\u201d Valerie said with a snort of derision. \u201cHow many hours a day do you work out to get that twelve pack? Ten, fifteen hours?\u201d</p><p>Anders chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t take much credit. Just lucky enough to have an extraordinary metabolism.\u201d That wasn\u2019t entirely true. He did work out some to improve on the lean and mean body the nanos gave him.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Valerie asked with disgust. \u201cMind loaning me that metabolism for a while?\u201d</p><p>Anders grinned. He\u2019d like to give it to her for life, a very long life, but didn\u2019t say so. Instead he said, \u201cWhy? You have a beautiful body.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grimaced. \u201cNo one mentioned you had vision problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one told me you had body image problems,\u201d he countered gently.</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman on the planet who doesn\u2019t. If they aren\u2019t skinny and wanting to be bigger, they\u2019re bigger wanting to be smaller. The ones in between want bigger breasts, or think they don\u2019t have hips, or they have a fat butt, or, or, or.\u201d She sighed. \u201cTruly, we are in an era of women made neurotic about our bodies.\u201d</p><p>Anders could have told her she was right. He\u2019d read enough female minds to know there were a very few who didn\u2019t have some complaint about their figure. At least mortal women did. Immortal women, on the other hand, were a different creature. They knew the nanos made them their optimal self, with a body in peak condition. It took away the possibility of self-criticism. It was rather like scoring high on an IQ test. With scientific results saying you were smart, it was hard to feel stupid. In the same way, knowing that you had a perfect body made it hard to imagine you were fat, or imperfect physically. Of course, it didn\u2019t stop them thinking they had a big nose, or thin lips or a myriad other imperfections, but at least it cut out a portion of the self-flagellation humans seemed determined to torment themselves with.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018Anders\u2019 short for?\u201d</p><p>He blinked his thoughts away and glanced to Valerie. She was looking more relaxed now that he wasn\u2019t approaching, and her head was tipped curiously as she waited for his answer.</p><p>Apparently he wasn\u2019t quick enough answering, because she went on, \u201cOr is it your last name like you call Justin by his last name Bricker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a short form of my last name,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. \u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndronnikov.\u201d</p><p>That made her eyes widen. \u201cWhat\u2019s your first name?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, but suspected now that she knew she didn\u2019t even know his first name, Valerie would hardly be willing to kiss him again, let alone anything else if he didn\u2019t tell her. Women could be funny about wanting to know the name of the guy sticking their tongue down her throat while groping her. \u201cMy first name is Semen.\u201d</p><p>She blinked several times at this news, and then simply breathed, \u201cOh dear.\u201d</p><p>At least she wasn\u2019t laughing, Anders thought wryly, and explained, \u201cIt\u2019s Basque in origin. Based on the word for son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cEveryone just calls me Anders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see why,\u201d she muttered, and then cleared her throat and said, \u201cSo your father was Russian, and your mother Basque and neither of them spoke English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s that or they had a sick sense of humor,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cThat\u2019s like naming a daughter Ova. Worse even. I\u2019m surprised you survived high school with a name like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve met a couple of women named Ova over the years,\u201d Anders said with amusement.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Anders chuckled and moved sideways, not drawing any closer, but moving to grip the edge of the pool as she was doing so that they faced each other with their sides to the pool rim.</p><p>Valerie smiled, and then said, \u201cSo were you raised in Basque Country or Russia or Canada?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRussia to start,\u201d he answered solemnly, easing a step closer in the water.</p><p>She nodded, seemingly unsurprised and said, \u201cYou have a bit of an accent. Not a thick one, but a bit of it. I figured you weren\u2019t raised here from birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I came here later,\u201d Anders acknowledged. Much later, but he kept that to himself for now and eased another step closer.</p><p>\u201cAnd is there a Mrs. Andronnikov?\u201d</p><p>The question startled him, and made him pause mid-step. Affronted by the very question, he said stiffly, \u201cI would hardly have kissed you earlier if I was married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d she said and glanced away almost shyly.</p><p>Anders took advantage of her lack of attention and closed the distance between them. When Valerie turned back, he was only inches away. Close enough to grab her arm and pull her into his embrace, but he didn\u2019t. This was him trying not to rush and scare her off. His best behavior. It was damned hard. He really just wanted to kiss her, rip her bathing suit off, and take her there in the water up against the side of the pool.</p><p>Of course, he couldn\u2019t do that without endangering her life. She\u2019d surely drown at the end when they both went into the life mate post-coital faint. That knowledge was enough to make Anders behave himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you decide to be a vet?\u201d he asked to distract her from his nearness.</p><p>Valerie smiled faintly, some of the tension that had gripped her when she saw how close he was, easing. \u201cI think every girl wants to be a vet and take care of sick and injured animals when she\u2019s little,\u201d she said wryly and then shrugged. \u201cI just never grew out of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, still a child at heart?\u201d Anders suggested quietly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she acknowledged and then tilted her head and asked, \u201cWhy did you join law enforcement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery little boy wants to save the damsel in distress and be a hero when he\u2019s growing up. I guess I just never outgrew that,\u201d Anders said lightly.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t amused as intended; instead, Valerie frowned. \u201cIs that how you see me? As a damsel in distress?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised a bark of laughter from Anders and he shook his head. \u201cHardly. I see you as incredibly brave and strong. You rescued yourself from that house. You didn\u2019t need a hero. You are one.\u201d</p><p>Valerie lowered her head as he spoke, and didn\u2019t look back up. It made him frown and ask, \u201cShould I not have brought it up? Does it upset you to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment, and then raised and shook her head. Her cheeks were a bit pink and he realized she\u2019d ducked her head to hide a blush.</p><p>\u201cNo. Surprisingly enough, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d She glanced to the side, checking on her dog, he realized when he followed her gaze and noted Roxy was sleeping by the chair with Valerie\u2019s towel on it. He supposed the dog had been roaming the yard when he\u2019d come out, but he hadn\u2019t noted her absence then. He\u2019d been too eager to get to Valerie.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why it doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Valerie acknowledged wryly, drawing his attention back to her. \u201cI guess maybe because I was drugged and slept through most of it. I mean, the kidnapping was pretty traumatizing, and the first night out too, but the last night . . .\u201d She hesitated and then admitted, \u201cIt felt good to fight back.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded in understanding.</p><p>\u201cMind you, if I hadn\u2019t managed to escape it would have been a different story,\u201d she added wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just escape, Valerie,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou saved those other women too. Each of them owes you her life. You are a heroine.\u201d</p><p>She looked uncomfortable and shifted in the water, and then asked, \u201cDo you think Lucian\u2019s right and the other women won\u2019t agree to a meeting?\u201d</p><p>Anders hesitated. He didn\u2019t want to lie to his life mate, but didn\u2019t know how not to. Lucian wouldn\u2019t ask the other women to get together. He couldn\u2019t. When he\u2019d said the women had returned to their old lives and probably wanted to forget, he\u2019d meant they had been returned to their old lives after they\u2019d been made to forget. Their memories had been wiped. They wouldn\u2019t recall anything of what had happened. Bringing them back together would probably undo all of that, but that was risky. They\u2019d wiped them because more than one wasn\u2019t as strong as Valerie and had been ready to crumble. Wiping their memories had been the kindest thing to do. Lucian wouldn\u2019t reverse it unless it was absolutely necessary.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ll agree to meet either, do you?\u201d Valerie asked when he remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p>Deciding distraction was the best tactic in this situation, Anders pulled her into his arms and kissed her. That was all he\u2019d intended for it to be. A kiss, maybe two, to distract her from a question he couldn\u2019t answer honestly.</p><p>He was an idiot, Anders acknowledged seconds later when, after an initial hesitation, Valerie opened her mouth to him. Any thought of stopping at one or two kisses flew out the window the moment she began to kiss him back. He was hardly aware of her arms twining around his neck, his senses were rocking under the impact of what their mouths were doing, and the feel of her body pressing against his in the water.</p><p>Groaning, Anders turned her and pressed her back up against the cold tiles of the pool, holding her there with his body as his hands began to roam down her sides.</p><p>Had he thought the water was cool when he\u2019d entered? It seemed to be warm now, hot even, as if their bodies were heating it, Anders thought as his hands found her breasts through her swimsuit top and Valerie moaned into his mouth. A sound he echoed as her pleasure rolled through him as well. Eager for more, Anders tugged the cups of her bathing suit top aside and covered her breasts with his hands. The moment he did, Valerie broke their kiss on a gasp of excitement, her legs wrapping around his hips, and fingers scraping over his short hair as he squeezed and kneaded the soft globes. When he removed his hands to clasp her by the waist, she moaned in disappointment, then cried out as he lifted her out of the water enough to clamp his lips on one rosy nipple.</p><p>Anders groaned as her excitement shot through him, a punch to the gut. He suckled eagerly at one breast, then the other, then couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and lowered her back down enough to claim her mouth again. Their kiss this time was almost violent, a battle of tongues as he ground his hips forward, rubbing his groin against her. She ground right back and this time he was hit with a double whammy of excitement and need as their pleasure commingled, vibrating through him in growing waves.</p><p>Clasping the cheeks of her behind in both hands, Anders squeezed and pressed her even tighter to him, then slipped one hand down to find her hot core. He\u2019d nearly reached that sweet spot and his body was throbbing with the anticipation of it, when he heard his name barked in an unmistakable voice.</p><p>Anders froze, torn between groaning and cursing. Then, he slowly withdrew his hand and eased some space between himself and Valerie.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered when she moaned at the loss. Sighing with regret, he tugged her bathing suit top back into place and glanced past her toward the house. Lucian stood in the open French doors, face expressionless.</p><p>\u201cBring Valerie. The sketch artist is here,\u201d he said simply. He didn\u2019t shout. He didn\u2019t have to. Anders heard him just fine.</p><p>Sighing, he nodded, then lowered his forehead to Valerie\u2019s and briefly closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asked, her voice shaky.</p><p>\u201cThe sketch artist is here,\u201d Anders answered solemnly.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie breathed.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go in,\u201d he added gently.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she murmured, but didn\u2019t move. It was Anders who gently unwrapped her legs from around his hips.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Valerie muttered, seeming only then to become aware of where her legs had been. She removed her arms then too, grabbing for the side of the pool as if unsure her legs would take her weight, and Anders understood thoroughly. His own legs were a little shaky at that point. He was also sporting one hell of an erection.</p><p>\u201cLet me just take one lap and I\u2019ll see you out,\u201d he said, backing away from her and hoping the distance and one lap would give his erection a chance to dissipate enough that it wouldn\u2019t look like he had a tent pole in his swim trunks when he got out.</p><p>Nodding, Valerie turned away and pulled herself up and out of the water enough to rest her chin on her crossed arms on the pool rim. It was then that Anders spotted the bandage on her back and recalled her wound.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you when I pressed you up against the side of the pool, did I?\u201d he asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder with confusion, and then seemed to recall her back wound and shook her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s okay, I\u2014oh crap!\u201d</p><p>Anders started back with concern. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to get it wet,\u201d she said with vexation, trying to twist around enough to see her wound. \u201cI forgot all about that when Leigh suggested a swim today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, so did she,\u201d Anders said quietly, moving up beside her to pull himself out of the water. He stood and turned back, caught her under the arms and quickly lifted her out as well. Valerie\u2019s eyes were wide when he set her on her feet and for a moment he thought it was the strength he\u2019d revealed with the action, but then he realized her eyes were locked on his groin.</p><p>Glancing down, he viewed the pop-tent in his trunks and grimaced. Even he was impressed by the size of it. Christ, she\u2019d inspired a small Eiffel tower down there. Sadly, she looked more worried than impressed.</p><p>Sighing, Anders moved past her to grab her towel, only then realizing he hadn\u2019t thought to grab one. Shaking his head, he turned to open it for her, but she shook her own head.</p><p>\u201cI think you need it more,\u201d Valerie said, biting her lip as she continued to eye his erection.</p><p>Mouth tightening, Anders wrapped it around her shoulders and then physically turned her, pointing her toward the house. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll follow in a minute. I just want to swim a couple laps.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated, but started to walk when he gave her a gentle push. Anders watched until she reached the French doors with the faithful Roxy following, then turned and dove into the water. He suspected it was going to take more than a couple laps to rid himself of the hardness presently acting like a rudder in the water.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cHis ears were a little bigger, and his eyes a little smaller,\u201d Valerie said, leaning forward and watching Bryan, the sketch artist, do his thing.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Bryan asked, turning the picture toward her after making the corrections.</p><p>Valerie peered silently at the image for several minutes, but then nodded her head. The sketch lacked the personality and terror-inducing life of the real man, but she suspected it was as close as they were going to get with a drawing.</p><p>The moment she nodded, Lucian leaned over and took the drawing from the sketch artist. He stared at it with a frown and then turned it toward Anders. \u201cDo you recognize him?\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced to Anders, her eyes automatically dropping to his now dry swim trunks. He\u2019d managed to rid himself of the telltale tent in his swimming trunks before coming inside, but it had taken him several minutes and she suspected a heck of a lot of laps to accomplish it. But the fact that it was no longer there didn\u2019t eradicate the image from her memory. Dear God, the man was huge. Or at least he\u2019d looked huge to her out there, but then it wasn\u2019t as if she had a lot of people to compare him to; a boyfriend in high school and Larry were the extent of her experience.</p><p>God, she was lame, Valerie thought unhappily. Most women her age had more experience. Didn\u2019t they? She had no idea. Certainly they did if you could believe Sex and the City and some of the other shows, past and present, on television. The female characters seemed to change men almost weekly on those shows.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anders said finally and Valerie managed to drag her gaze and mind up to his face as he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Lucian peered at the picture for another moment, then let the hand holding it drop. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have Mortimer make copies and circulate it. I\u2019ll have him fax it to Bastien in New York too. He can have it distributed there. Someone should recognize him.\u201d His gaze moved to Bryan as he finished packing away his things. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready I\u2019ll take you back to the airport first.\u201d</p><p>Bryan nodded and stood. \u201cAll set.\u201d He turned to Valerie and held out a hand. \u201cMs. Moyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie responded, shaking his hand. When he then turned to Leigh, she stood up, wincing at the pulling sensation in her back. It was the first bit of discomfort she\u2019d felt since coming in from the pool, but then she\u2019d been sitting in one spot and one position since coming in, her attention focused on the image growing on the sketch pad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go change,\u201d Valerie said to no one in particular as she slipped away from the distracted foursome and headed out of the room. The bathing suit had dried on her. It would be nice to put on clean clothes that didn\u2019t smell of chlorine. But she also wanted to try to look at her back and see if the swim had done any damage to her wound. Valerie was hoping a fresh application of ointment and a clean bandage would set things right, but if not, it was better to take care of it than leave it any longer.</p><p>She had reached her room and just pushed the door closed behind her when someone knocked. Frowning, Valerie swung back and opened it, her eyes widening when Roxy slipped inside leaving Anders on the threshold with ointment and gauze in hand. She was less surprised at Anders\u2019s presence than the fact that she\u2019d forgotten all about her dog.</p><p>\u201cI need to take a look at your back,\u201d Anders said apologetically, drawing her attention back from the German shepherd, who had walked over to the bed and dropped to lie beside it.</p><p>Valerie hesitated briefly, but then nodded. It had to be taken care of. She knew what could happen to wounds that weren\u2019t cared for properly and she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d risk dying of an infected wound after surviving that hell house.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom?\u201d she asked as she turned away.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Anders said and she was aware of him on her heels as she crossed the room. When the German shepherd started to get up to follow, she put her hand out and shook her head. \u201cStay Roxy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dog settled back down and Valerie led Anders into the bathroom. Once there, she watched him set down the gauze, tape, and ointment.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, glancing her way.</p><p>Valerie turned her back to him and let her towel drop. She\u2019d worn it sarong style since entering the house and being introduced to the sketch artist, Bryan. She\u2019d wanted to go get dressed, but Lucian had said she was fine and didn\u2019t want her to take the time.</p><p>\u201cFast or slow?\u201d Anders asked and when Valerie glanced over her shoulder he explained, \u201cIt seemed pretty painful for you when I did it slowly this morning. One quick yank might be better.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie bit her lip, but nodded and then turned to face away from him again.</p><p>\u201cDeep breath,\u201d he said.</p><p>Valerie started to suck in a slow deep breath, but halfway through, it became a sharp inhale as he ripped the bandage from her back.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Anders asked with concern.</p><p>Valerie nodded, letting her breath out slowly. It really had been better than the slow way. It had hurt, but had been one quick jolt of pain rather than the long drawn-out constant pulling pain from that morning.</p> <p>\u201cHow does it look?\u201d she asked, raising her arm and craning her head around to try to see her wound.</p><p>\u201cLess red than it was this morning,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m going to put the salve on.\u201d</p><p>Valerie gave up trying to look at it and nodded as she turned forward again. She felt him brush the ointment on. It was cool, but not cold, and didn\u2019t sting quite as much as it had that morning, which made her wonder if the chlorine from the pool had dried out the wound a bit. The swim may even have done it some good, she thought as he pressed the gauze over it.</p><p>She waited patiently as he taped the gauze in place, barely restraining a shiver as his warm fingers moved over her skin. His touch, as methodical as it was, sent shafts of pleasure through her that were hard to ignore. It was actually a relief when he said, \u201cFinished.\u201d Until his hands settled on her shoulder and he pulled her back against his chest.</p><p>Valerie closed her eyes, stealing herself against the warmth that seeped through her. It radiated from where his chest pressed against her back, but seemed to then gather and slide to pool low in her belly.</p><p>\u201cYour skin is so soft,\u201d Anders whispered by her ear, his breath stirring her hair, his fingers sliding down and then up her arms.</p> <p>When she felt his lips brush her ear, Valerie tilted her head slightly to the side and then moaned as he pressed a kiss to her neck and then her earlobe. They were soft caresses, light as a butterfly\u2019s wings, and the brush of his fingers over her arms was just as light, but it all made her body tremble in his hold.</p><p>Hungry for his kiss, Valerie turned her head back and up toward Anders and was rewarded with his mouth closing over hers. It was an awkward angle, but she didn\u2019t care as his tongue thrust between her lips. She cared even less about the angle when his hands shifted from her arms to close over her breasts through her swimsuit.</p><p>Moaning into his mouth, Valerie turned in his arms, momentarily dislodging his hands. As she\u2019d hoped, though, they were quickly back. Even as she slid her arms around his shoulders and pressed close to him, his hands found and covered her breasts. Squeezing her eager flesh through the thin cloth, he was able to kiss her properly.</p><p>Valerie moaned and sucked on his tongue, her fingers following the muscles and lines of his back, kneading and urging him closer against her. She was vaguely aware of one of his hands drifting away from one breast, but didn\u2019t realize why until the front of her bathing suit top came loose and fell to catch between their bodies, barely cresting her nipples. He released her other breast then and caught her by the waist to lift her onto the sink counter. Valerie instinctively spread her legs and drew him between them as he quickly undid the lower fastening of her bathing suit top and removed it entirely.</p><p>Anders broke the kiss and pulled back to peer down then.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he breathed and lowered his head to claim one nipple.</p><p>Valerie cried out, feet pressing against the cupboard door and her butt lifting off the counter as she arched into the caress. He immediately slid one hand beneath her, holding her up and urging her tight against him as he suckled at first one breast and then the other.</p><p>\u201cSemmy,\u201d she moaned and pressed her open mouth to the top of his head as their lower bodies ground together.</p> <p>Anders immediately stilled and lifted his head. Meeting her gaze, he raised his eyebrows. \u201cSemmy?\u201d</p><p>Valerie felt the blush that claimed her. \u201cWell, calling you by your last name at a time like this seems . . . er . . . wrong,\u201d she said awkwardly, and then admitted, \u201cBut I just can\u2019t call you Semen.\u201d She shrugged helplessly. \u201cBut Semmy sounds like a good nickname. If you don\u2019t mind it,\u201d she added and then bit her lip and waited.</p><p>Anders stared at her for several minutes and then suddenly grinned. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she asked with relief.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said, and raised a hand to brush his fingers lightly over her cheek. Valerie turned her head to kiss his fingers and he smiled, and then let his fingers drop to brush lightly over one nipple and added, \u201cI like everything about you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie gasped at the shafts of excitement the light caress sent through her, and raised her own hand to clasp his neck to draw his mouth back to hers. Their lips had barely touched when a knock sounded at her bedroom door. They both froze. When a second knock sounded, Valerie urged Anders away and slid off the counter to grab her towel and quickly wrap it around herself as she headed for the door.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t terribly surprised to open it and find Leigh there. Lucian had been talking about taking the sketch artist to the airport and heading to the Enforcer house when she\u2019d left. If he\u2019d done that, Leigh was probably looking for company.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d better see how your back is,\u201d Leigh admitted with a grimace. \u201cI just remembered that you weren\u2019t suppose to get it wet. Yet big dummy me, I suggested a swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Anders said behind her and Valerie glanced around to see that he\u2019d followed her out of the bathroom. \u201cI changed her dressing. It actually looks better than it did this morning. I don\u2019t think any harm was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good.\u201d Leigh looked relieved. \u201cBut I\u2019ll still feel better once Dani has a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming by after work tonight, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>Leigh nodded. \u201cShe should be here at about four thirty, and Lucian said he\u2019d be back about then as well.\u201d She smiled wryly. \u201cI guess I should start thinking about making dinner in case we need to do some shopping or it\u2019s a meal that needs a lot of prep time. I wonder if Dani and Decker would like to stay to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecker?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cDani\u2019s husband,\u201d Anders answered behind her. \u201cHe\u2019s Lucian\u2019s nephew.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyebrows rose and she glanced back at Anders. \u201cLucian has a nephew old enough to be married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has several nephews old enough to be married. And a couple nieces,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Valerie nodded slowly. Her best friend in school had been the niece of one of their classmates. It was unusual, but certainly not unheard of. She supposed Lucian had been the youngest of his parents\u2019 brood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with supper,\u201d she offered. \u201cI just need to change out of my swimsuit first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d Leigh said with a smile and then glanced at Anders. \u201cAnd are you going to change too? Or do you plan to just hang around half naked and looking studly to make Lucian and Decker jealous?\u201d</p><p>Anders snorted at the suggestion. \u201cThose two wouldn\u2019t even understand the word jealous. They know they have you and Dani locked down,\u201d he said, stepping around Valerie. He gave her arm a squeeze in passing and murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll see you downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly, then flushed when Leigh grinned from one to the other. Grimacing at the matchmaking gleam in the woman\u2019s eye, she added, \u201cOh go on, I\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Leigh said cheerfully and slid her arm through Anders\u2019s, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, will you?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t want you to get lost,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>Shaking her head, Valerie closed her door and turned to cross the room. Leigh obviously realized something more had been going on than his changing her dressing. Her lack of a bathing suit top might have helped with that, Valerie supposed, glancing down at herself as she removed the towel she\u2019d wrapped around her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh well, c\u2019est la vie. Right Roxy?\u201d she said, glancing to the dog lying beside the bed. At the sound of her name, Roxy stood and moved to her side, tail wagging.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Valerie murmured, giving her a pet. \u201cWant to help me decide what to wear?\u201d</p><p>Roxy barked, tail wagging more furiously, and Valerie grinned. She didn\u2019t for a moment think the dog understood what she\u2019d asked her. She just understood her name and the tone of voice was a question, so she responded. Still, it was nice to have someone to talk to. It made a gal feel less crazy than talking to herself.</p><p>Valerie debated what she should wear briefly and settled on a pale peach halter dress that left most of her back and her sides bare. It would make it easier for Dr. Dani Pimms to look at her wound without her having to disrobe.</p><p>She changed quickly, switching the swimsuit bottoms for a pair of peach panties and slipping the dress on. Valerie then ran a brush through her hair, applied some lipstick and headed downstairs with Roxy on her heels.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello. That was quick.\u201d Leigh smiled at her from her seat at the island. Anders was there as well, retrieving a large pot from the cupboard under the range. He straightened at Leigh\u2019s words and nodded in greeting, his gaze appreciative as it slid over her.</p><p>\u201cHello. Did you decide on what we\u2019re making?\u201d Valerie asked as she led Roxy to the French doors and let her out.</p><p>\u201cHow does chili sound?\u201d Leigh asked. \u201cIf we start now it can simmer till everyone gets here. Then we just have to throw some fries in the oven and have Anders throw some hot dogs on the barbecue before we can eat. We can have Coney Island hot dogs and chili fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCravings?\u201d Valerie guessed, closing the French doors and turning to peer at her.</p><p>\u201cSerious cravings,\u201d Leigh admitted on a sigh. \u201cAnd they keep changing. First it was sweets: ice cream and chocolate. Now it\u2019s chili dogs and fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think it sounds yummy,\u201d she assured her, moving around the island into the kitchen. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>Valerie sat back in her seat and sipped at her wine, doing her best to ignore the way Anders\u2019s leg was pressing against her own under the table. He had been touching, brushing up against, or sneaking caresses all night. First under cover of their working together in the kitchen and then under cover of the table as they\u2019d eaten. He was driving her wild.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Leigh. That was good,\u201d Dani said, sitting back in her own seat with a satisfied little sigh. \u201cI haven\u2019t had chili dogs since I was a teenager.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled at Dani. She liked the good doctor. They\u2019d finished making the chili and it was bubbling away on the stove when the woman had arrived with her husband, Decker. While Anders had offered Decker a beer, the three women had all gone upstairs to Valerie\u2019s room so that the doctor could check her wound. Dani had examined it, announced that it was healing nicely, and then redressed it.</p><p>One would expect that it would have been a quick trip. It hadn\u2019t. The women had begun chatting about this and that as they mounted the stairs, and continued that chat throughout the examination. Afterward, they had simply stood there in her room, talking for several minutes more before heading down to rejoin the men.</p><p>Dani and Decker had kissed and hugged as if she\u2019d been gone for days instead of the hour the women had dallied upstairs. They\u2019d then cuddled up on the couch, his arm around her and her hand on his leg as the group had chatted. The two had seemed as connected mentally as they had been physically; finishing each other\u2019s sentences and exchanging loving smiles and the occasional affectionate caress of the cheek or hair. It was enough to make Valerie envious.</p><p>By the time Lucian had returned home and they\u2019d sat down to dinner, Valerie had come to the conclusion that Dani and Decker were great. They were also perfect for each other.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Decker said now as he finished and sat back as well. Reaching for his wife\u2019s hand, he drew it onto the arm of his chair and caressed it absently with thumb and fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve actually never had them before at all. But they were good. My compliments to the chef.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChefs,\u201d Leigh corrected with a laugh. \u201cValerie and Anders did most of the work.

I\u2019d never heard of them before tonight either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it was your son who gave me the bizarre craving for chili dogs and fries,\u201d she said as if that should be obvious.</p> <p>Lucian stared at her briefly, and then shrugged. \u201cWell, at least he has good taste. I agree with Dani. It was good.\u201d</p><p>Leigh chuckled and squeezed his arm as he popped the last half of his chili dog in his mouth and chewed away. \u201cYou think everything is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you serve me is good,\u201d he said after swallowing. \u201cFortunately, we appear to have similar taste in food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do we,\u201d Dani commented. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s why the nanos\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Leigh interrupted, her drink suddenly crashing over on the table.</p> <p>There was only a bit of water left in it, but it seemed to run everywhere, and Valerie quickly grabbed up her napkin to help soak up the liquid even as Lucian did on Leigh\u2019s other side.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Leigh said.</p><p>\u201cNo harm done. It was only water and there wasn\u2019t much of it,\u201d Valerie pointed out and set her wet napkin on her plate. She then stood up and started gathering plates. Everyone seemed to be done, and the clutter was only likely to lead to more accidents.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Leigh protested, getting up as well. \u201cYou and Anders did all the cooking. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down and relax while the rest of us fill the dishwasher,\u201d Lucian said firmly, standing up as well.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Leigh,\u201d Dani said, getting up. \u201cWith all of us helping it will only take us a minute. Put your feet up and relax.\u201d</p> <p>They were quick about clearing the table and filling the dishwasher. Valerie then put coffee on before joining the others at the table. As she sat down, Dani said, \u201cLeigh mentioned that you\u2019re a vet in Winnipeg, here to take some courses to update your skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Valerie grimaced. \u201cThat was the idea, but if they don\u2019t catch this guy in the next day or two, I\u2019ll have to give up the courses until next semester and if that happens, I might as well head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Anders turned on her sharply.</p><p>Valerie bit her lip, not very happy at the thought herself. She would have liked to get to know him better, but if she couldn\u2019t do the course now, she\u2019d have to do it next term and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to be away from the clinic that long. Sighing at the very thought, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s what my academic advisor said when I talked to him today. I\u2019ve missed the first two weeks of class already. He said if I\u2019m not back by Monday, then I might as well give it up and reapply for next term.\u201d</p><p>Anders frowned, his gaze shooting to Lucian.</p><p>It was Leigh who said worriedly, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home, Valerie. Not with him still out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s probably better if I did,\u201d Valerie said and pointed out, \u201cHe can\u2019t know I\u2019m from Winnipeg, so I\u2019d be safe there, and Anders wouldn\u2019t have to waste his time playing babysitter so he could help hunt for him.\u201d</p><p>Dead silence met this announcement as the others all exchanged glances.</p> <p>\u201cBut your courses,\u201d Anders said finally. \u201cYou wanted to upgrade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I still do, but I can\u2019t do that if I can\u2019t attend classes,\u201d she pointed out reasonably.</p><p>Another moment of silence passed with everyone exchanging glances she didn\u2019t understand and then Lucian said abruptly, \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to attend classes.\u201d</p><p>When Valerie stared at him with surprise, he added, \u201cAnders will accompany you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She hesitated briefly and then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll let him attend with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might,\u201d Dani said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people auditing classes. I even knew someone who audited a couple of mine. She had to get permission from the instructor, and the department chair, and I think her program counselor first though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll get permission,\u201d Lucian said as if it were the simplest thing in the world. When Anders frowned at this news, he added solemnly, \u201cIt\u2019s that or we put her and Roxy on a plane home to Winnipeg.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, those words sounded ominous to Valerie, and certainly Anders reacted as if they were. His mouth tightened grimly, and he nodded once. It was Friday now, but apparently come Monday, she was attending class and Anders was coming with her. The thought made her smile. She didn\u2019t really want to go home, and not because she wanted to avoid her ex anymore. But because she didn\u2019t want to leave Anders. He made her feel things she\u2019d never experienced before, and she wanted more of that.</p><p>She wanted him.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Anders finished sucking back his second pint of blood and glanced to the clock on the bedside table as he threw out the empty bag. A frown claimed his lips when he noted that it was six thirty. Despite staying up late to visit with Dani and Decker last night, he\u2019d set his alarm for 6:15 this morning to be sure he was awake and downstairs before Roxy woke Valerie to go out. He\u2019d hoped to prevent another incident like the morning before with the alarm blaring and rousing Lucian and Leigh. But apparently it had taken longer than he\u2019d expected to jump in and out of the shower and don jeans and a black T-shirt. Hopefully he\u2019d still beat them down there though.</p><p>Padding barefoot to the door, Anders stepped out and started up the hall, slowing when he approached Valerie\u2019s door and saw that it was cracked open. Pausing, he knocked lightly. When there was no answer, he slid it open and peered inside. The bed was empty, as was the bedroom itself, and through the open bathroom door he could see that it, too, was empty.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, Anders rushed for the stairs, desperate to get to Valerie before she opened the French doors. With every step he took, he kept expecting the sudden blare of the alarm going off. But he made it all the way to the living room without it happening. He spotted Roxy first. The German shepherd was in the kitchen, gobbling down her food. Valerie was at the French doors, staring at the security panel with slumped shoulders. Anders exhaled a relieved breath and said, \u201cI\u2019ll get that.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced over her shoulder with surprise as he crossed the room toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou said Roxy goes out at six thirty, so I set my alarm,\u201d he explained, pausing beside her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry you had to get up. Grateful, but sorry,\u201d Valerie said softly, keeping her voice low to avoid disturbing anyone\u2019s sleep as he reached past her to punch the numbers into the security panel that would turn off the alarm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d he assured her. Finished with the panel, he turned back and glanced toward Roxy who was now licking the empty bowl in search of any leftover crumbs. \u201cI see you found a way to distract Roxy from going outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to do something, she was whining most pitiably until I produced food. That made her briefly forget she needed to go out,\u201d Valerie said wryly.</p><p>\u201cShe is a dog who likes her food,\u201d Anders said dryly as the dog turned and headed toward them. He reached down to open the door, but paused when he spotted the leash hanging from Valerie\u2019s hand.</p><p>Seeing the direction his eyes had taken, Valerie smiled and raised the leash. \u201cI promised Roxy a walk after she does her business and eats,\u201d Valerie explained. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t had one since . . . well, in a while.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he opened the door to let Roxy slip out. \u201cJust let me grab my shoes and we\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t want to bother you,\u201d she protested at once. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBodyguard, remember?\u201d Anders said gently. \u201c I have to be with you to guard your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Valerie muttered, blushing as she slipped past him to follow Roxy out of the house. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded, then pulled the door closed behind her, his gaze finding Roxy\u2019s hunched shape beside the pool. His eyes narrowed as they moved back to Valerie. He hadn\u2019t seen any bags in her hands. Knowing she\u2019d need them, he swiftly crossed to the kitchen and retrieved a roll of them from the kitchen drawer where they\u2019d been stored. He got back to the door just as Valerie suddenly turned and headed toward it. Opening the door, he reached out, roll of bags on the palm of his extended hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Valerie said with a small laugh as she reached for the roll. \u201cI just remembered them.\u201d</p><p>The moment her fingers touched the bags, Anders\u2019s closed his over hers. He immediately drew her forward even as he slid the door wider and leaned out to kiss her. It was just a swift brush of his lips over hers, he couldn\u2019t risk any more than that. As powerful as the life mate shared pleasure was, they could end up rolling around naked on the verandah if he risked more than that. Even just the brushing of lips stirred the desire for more in him, but he managed to break the kiss and pull back to utter a husky, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was weak and breathy as she responded, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Anders smiled slowly, then withdrew inside and closed the door between them again. He was aware that Valerie didn\u2019t turn away, but stood and watched him walk away. He could feel her eyes on him as he left the room.</p><p>Valerie glanced around at the sound of the door opening and offered a shy smile when Anders reappeared, running shoes on. He\u2019d been fast about getting his shoes on, but Roxy had been faster. She was done, leash on and standing by Valerie when he stepped out to join them.</p><p>\u201cThe road or the woods?\u201d Anders asked as he approached.</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t need to ask what he meant. Did she want to walk Roxy along the street, or through the woods? She debated the matter briefly. The woods would be more interesting, but she had no idea if there were trails through it, and while the sun was just making its appearance, it wouldn\u2019t be able to penetrate the trees. It would be darker in there, maybe dark as night.</p><p>\u201cIs it safe to walk on the road?\u201d she asked finally.</p><p>\u201cSafe enough,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Road it is then.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Anders took her arm and started her walking, steering her around the house to the front yard. Roxy immediately fell into step beside Valerie.</p><p>\u201cWhat time did Dani and Decker leave last night?\u201d she asked, to fill the silence as they walked.</p><p>\u201cLate,\u201d he said dryly, which made Valerie smile.</p><p>\u201cAnders, it was late when I went to bed and they weren\u2019t showing signs of moving. How much later is late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour or so after you went to bed,\u201d he answered and then added, \u201cThey, like Leigh and Lucian, are night owls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, so you\u2019ve had even less sleep than me,\u201d Valerie said apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I appreciate it. I don\u2019t know what I would have done with Roxy once she\u2019d finished eating if you hadn\u2019t been here to unlock the door. She would have been desperate then.\u201d</p><p>Anders shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I can always take a nap later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably do that too,\u201d she murmured as they started up the driveway to the road, and then asked suddenly, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>It was a question she\u2019d begun to ponder last night when she\u2019d gone to bed. Everyone she\u2019d met since waking up here appeared to be twenty-five to thirty years old. Most of them closer to twenty-five by her guess. Anders, though, seemed closer to thirty, but perhaps that was just wishful thinking on her part since she was thirty herself. Valerie had never dated anyone younger than herself. Although, she supposed a couple years difference wouldn\u2019t be that big a deal. Her grandmother on her mother\u2019s side had been four years older than her grandfather, and her mother had been two years older than her father. It seemed to be a trend in her family. She could handle a couple years\u2019 age difference, if that was all it was.</p><p>\u201cOlder than you,\u201d Anders said finally, regaining her attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty,\u201d she said, just in case he thought she was younger.</p><p>\u201cI know. Your driver\u2019s license was in your wallet,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d Valerie said wryly, and then asked dubiously, \u201cAnd you\u2019re older?\u201d When Anders nodded, she peered closely at his face, but just didn\u2019t see it. \u201cHow much older?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it rude to ask a lady her age, but not rude to ask a man?\u201d he queried rather than answer and Valerie considered the question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI suppose because men aren\u2019t usually sensitive about their age,\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Valerie turned to him with surprise. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t tell me your age?\u201d she asked with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNot right now. But I will later,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLater when?\u201d she asked with interest.</p><p>\u201cWhen we know each other better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Valerie muttered, falling silent for a moment and glancing around as they reached the end of the trees lining the drive and stepped out onto the road. They were in a rural area: the nearest house was the one across the road and that was half a field to the right of them. The next house over on this side of the road was a full field away, and by her guess that field was about the size of two football fields.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I know why it\u2019s so quiet when we\u2019re sitting outside,\u201d she commented as they started up the road.</p><p>Anders smiled, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you won\u2019t tell me your age, tell me how many brothers and sisters you have,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Anders asked with amusement.</p><p>\u201cBecause as much as I enjoy your kisses, I don\u2019t like being kissed by people I know nothing about,\u201d Valerie said bluntly, and then stopped to turn to him in question when she realized his steps had faltered and he\u2019d come to a dead halt. His expression was priceless, she had to say. It briefly looked like he\u2019d swallowed his tongue.</p> <p>Raising her eyebrows, she asked, \u201cWhat? Like it was a big surprise that I like your kisses?\u201d</p><p>For some reason that made a slow smile creep over Anders\u2019s face. \u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m just surprised you\u2019re willing to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Valerie snorted and turned to continue walking. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t make it obvious. I mean, I was all over you the last two times you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you were,\u201d Anders agreed with a grin.</p><p>\u201cGloat much?\u201d she asked with dry amusement, and then prompted, \u201cSo? Brothers and sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d he answered at once.</p><p>\u201cOh dear, an only child,\u201d she said with an exaggerated wince.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Anders asked with surprise.</p> <p>\u201cThe only child is spoiled rotten. They get all the attention, all the focus, all the toys, all the everything that is normally doled out between multiple siblings,\u201d she answered simply, and then added, \u201cI ought to know. I was an only child too.\u201d</p><p>Anders chuckled, but then said, \u201cWell perhaps that\u2019s true of yourself and most only children. But there isn\u2019t much spoiling when you\u2019re an orphan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you orphaned?\u201d Valerie asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Valerie peered at him silently and then turned forward again, muttering, \u201cWell, that is an entirely different kettle of fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that sound bad?\u201d he asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good?\u201d he suggested and Valerie grinned at his disgruntlement. For some reason she enjoyed ruffling his feathers. Perhaps because she suspected his feathers weren\u2019t often ruffled.</p><p>Being more serious, she asked, \u201cHow old were you when your parents died?\u201d</p><p>Anders was silent for a minute, debating how to answer that, and how to answer all the questions that would follow. He didn\u2019t want to lie to her. He wanted her for a life mate and lying wasn\u2019t a good way to start, but he couldn\u2019t tell her the full truth right now. She\u2019d either think he was mad, or he\u2019d then have to explain about immortals, and he didn\u2019t think she was ready for that explanation yet. She may never be.</p><p>Sighing over the depressing thought, Anders decided the best thing to do was to tell her as much of the truth as he could and just leave out any details that might need explanations . . . like the fact that he\u2019d been born in 1357.</p><p>\u201cMy father, Ilom, died before I was born,\u201d he said quietly, thinking that was safe enough to tell. \u201cAnd my mother, Leta, when I was twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Valerie said quietly, and then asked, \u201cWill you tell me about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was from Sofala,\u201d he said, leaving out that his father had been a Zanj slave.</p><p>\u201cSofala?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a province of Mozambique. South of Pemba on the coast of East Africa,\u201d he explained, not mentioning that it was Nova Sofala now and had been for a while. Continuing on with what he could tell her, he said, \u201cMy father\u2019s father was an Arab. His mother was a local Bantu woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother? Leta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpanish?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and then frowned. That wasn\u2019t completely true. She had come from Atlantis originally, but she\u2019d settled in the Basque country and considered it her home for centuries. It had been her home when she\u2019d met his father.</p><p>\u201cHow did they meet?\u201d Valerie asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cMy mother traveled a great deal. She was visiting a friend my father . . . worked for,\u201d Anders finished, and Valerie peered at him curiously. He supposed she suspected he had been about to say something else, and she would be right. He\u2019d almost said that his father had been a slave of this friend of his mother\u2019s, but had caught himself in time.</p><p>\u201cSo she met him through this friend?\u201d she asked. \u201cWere they in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were life mates,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cThey planned to spend their lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did your father die?\u201d</p><p>That question made him hesitate, but finally he said, \u201cHe was killed for choosing my mother.\u201d</p><p>Valerie blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Anders grimaced. It was getting a bit tricky now to not lie. His father, Ilom, had been the slave of another immortal, Alecto. She had been a friend of his mother\u2019s for some centuries. His mother had gone to visit her during one of the periods when she\u2019d had to leave her home so that no one would notice her not aging. Had things not gone as they had, his mother would have returned ten or twenty years later, claiming to be the daughter, or a niece of herself, who had inherited everything. It was how most of them had handled the not aging issue in the old days.</p><p>However, his mother had met his father and realized he was her life mate. The problem was that he was one of the slaves belonging to Alecto\u2019s family and when his father was brought to her attention, Alecto, who had apparently never bothered much with the slaves before that, claimed not to be able to read or control him either. She\u2019d claimed he was a possible life mate to her as well, and as he was her family\u2019s slave, Alecto wanted him for herself. His father, though, had already given himself over to his mother and chosen her over his mistress.</p><p>That had not gone over at all well. Alecto had tried to keep his parents apart, and Ilom and Leta had fled. And had been hunted for it.</p><p>Speaking slowly and carefully, he said, \u201cThere were those who didn\u2019t think my parents should be together. My father and mother were hunted. They planned to escape on a ship. My mother managed to, but my father was killed before they reached it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced to Valerie to see how she was taking this part of the story and found her deep in thought, a frown on her face. Anders suspected she was thinking the problem had been the color difference, his father being a black man and his mother a white woman. And that might have been a problem among other people of that era, but it had never been an issue amongst Atlanteans. However, it was handy if she thought it was the problem. But only if she didn\u2019t ask about it and force him to either evade the question or lie, which he wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Much to his relief, she let the issue lie and simply asked, \u201cIf your father was African and your mother Spanish, how is it that your last name is Andronikov? Was that the name of the family who adopted you after your mother died?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, it was the name of the man who gave my mother a safe haven to give birth to me when she landed in Russia. She had to change her name and hide out after they killed my father. She chose his name for us to live under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDid he raise you after your mother\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Anders smiled at the thought. Andronik, now known as Saint Andronik, had been the hegumen of a monastery. The Russian equivalent of an abbot. Anders had not been raised in a monastery. He hadn\u2019t even been born in one. Andronik had given his mother safe haven in a small cabin near the monastery and had taken her food. But neither of them had ever set foot in the monastery.</p><p>\u201cNo. He was long gone by then,\u201d Anders said finally. \u201cOr I should say, we were. My mother only accepted his aid until she\u2019d given birth to me. Once she\u2019d recovered enough, we moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who raised you from twelve on after she died?\u201d Valerie asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWe should turn back,\u201d Anders said rather than answer.</p><p>Valerie glanced around, noting how far they were from the house, and then nodded, and swung back the way they\u2019d come. After a few steps, she repeated, \u201cSo, who raised you from twelve on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was adopted by the family of a friend I\u2019d made,\u201d he answered truthfully, his voice growing gruff. The memory was a painful one for him.</p><p>\u201cWhy the family of a friend? Did you have no family?\u201d Valerie asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Valerie frowned over that and asked, \u201cHow did your mother die?\u201d</p><p>Anders hesitated, but then sighed and admitted, \u201cThe same people who killed my father killed my mother.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stopped walking with dismay. \u201cYour mother was murdered too? And twelve years after your father . . . by the same people? Dear God, who does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetermined people who have nothing better to do?\u201d he suggested, trying for a light tone that failed miserably. What he said was true, or at least part of the truth. Time wasn\u2019t the same for an immortal, twelve years was a paltry amount of time when you lived centuries. Even so, there was more to it than that Alecto was determined and had nothing better to do. The way she saw it, she\u2019d been robbed of a possible life mate and wanted to punish someone for it. That had become her obsession. She had hunted them high and low with the help of her family, forcing them to move often and repeatedly. His childhood with his mother had been a series of different homes and constant running and hiding. Unlike Alecto, Leta hadn\u2019t had a large support network. She had come out of Atlantis alone except for friends, and her best friend had become her worst enemy. She\u2019d been on her own.</p><p>In truth, his mother hadn\u2019t had a chance and the fact that she\u2019d survived so long was a combination of dumb luck and sheer determination to see her son survive. And he had. She\u2019d managed to keep them both alive until he was twelve. On his twelfth birthday, she\u2019d sent him out on his first solo hunt for a blood donor. They had been practicing for the last couple months, with his going out on his own and her following in case there was trouble. But that night she\u2019d sent him completely on his own, warning that she wouldn\u2019t be there to watch his back so he must be very careful. And he had been; he\u2019d returned that night full of pride and triumph only to find she had been less careful, or perhaps less lucky.</p><p>Anders had seen the wagon and several horses as he\u2019d neared the cabin. They\u2019d only been living there for a couple weeks. They hadn\u2019t made friends, they never did. He and his mother had only once dared stay in one place long enough for things like that and this hadn\u2019t been that time.</p><p>Using the cover of the woods, he\u2019d slipped around to the back of the cabin and snuck up to a window. His mother\u2019s body was sprawled on the floor; her head, however, had been set on the table and Alecto was ordering her men to ride into the village so the horses wouldn\u2019t scare him off when he returned. One of the men had suggested she just leave Anders alone. Leta had paid, there was no need to carry on Alecto\u2019s vendetta with the son, but she\u2019d refused. The boy, as she\u2019d called him, would replace his father as her slave.</p><p>Anders had slipped away and managed to evade them. He\u2019d returned to that cabin some weeks later to find they\u2019d burned it to the ground. There was nothing left of his life with his mother, not even a trinket or keepsake to carry with him. He\u2019d left again then and had wandered briefly, but memories of the happy summer he\u2019d spent in a small village in Spain the summer before had led him back there. It was the only place they\u2019d stayed more than a handful of weeks and he knew the only reason they\u2019d stayed there so long was that his mother hadn\u2019t had the heart to drag him away from the only friend he\u2019d managed to make during his lonely childhood of running and hiding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pedro Alvarez had been eleven like himself that summer. He\u2019d also had a bit of the devil in him, as they\u2019d called it then. Now they would have called him a troublemaker or hell raiser. Pedro was forever escaping his nanny and tutors and slipping away from the castle his family inhabited. Which was what he\u2019d done the night Anders had encountered him. Anders himself had been sent out to find wood for their campfire while his mother was on the hunt. She\u2019d taken him out earlier in the evening to oversee his feeding, and then had returned him to their camp, suggesting he find some firewood while she went out to find her own meal.</p><p>He\u2019d barely begun his task when Anders came across Pedro fishing perhaps a quarter mile along the lakeshore from their camp. After an initial start at his sudden appearance, Pedro had greeted him fearlessly and cheerfully and invited him to share in the cheese, bread, and wine he\u2019d smuggled with him from the castle kitchens.</p><p>It had been the start of a firm friendship. The two had quickly become as close as brothers. Pedro would sneak out of the castle every night and Anders would be waiting for him. The two would then run through the forest and fields, always ending at the waterside, where they lay in the grass, stared up at the stars, and shared their dreams for the future. Pedro planned to be a brave knight and lord to his people, and Anders dreamed of a day when he would slay the evil Alecto, avenging his father and ensuring his mother wouldn\u2019t have to run and hide anymore and they could stay in one place at least for more than a matter of weeks. Pedro was the only person Anders had ever revealed his history to. Not all of it, of course. He hadn\u2019t told him he was immortal. Just that the jealous Alecto had killed his father and now hunted him and his mother as punishment for his father loving his mother. Pedro had solemnly vowed to help him slay Alecto.</p> <p>Every night when Pedro had left, Anders had returned to the camp he shared with his mother, terrified it would be the night she\u2019d say they had to break camp and move on. In the end, nearly an entire summer had passed before she\u2019d made the dreaded announcement. When he\u2019d instinctively tried to protest and convince her to stay, she\u2019d revealed that she knew about his friend, knew it would be hard to leave him, but they\u2019d stayed too long as it was and their pursuers had caught up. She\u2019d spotted one of Alecto\u2019s men in the village that night. They had to move on. Anders hadn\u2019t even got the chance to say good-bye to his friend. They\u2019d left at once.</p><p>Looking back, Anders suspected that his mother\u2019s kindness in letting him have a friend for that summer had been the beginning of the end for them. For all of them, including Pedro and his family. Alecto and her people had caught their scent in that village and had been on them like a pack of hounds, constantly nipping at their heels over the following six months until she\u2019d caught up to them on his birthday and butchered his mother. Six weeks later, Anders had found himself back by that lake in Spain, waiting for Pedro.</p><p>On hearing of his mother\u2019s death, Pedro had insisted he come home to the castle with him. He\u2019d been sure his parents would welcome him as his friend. Anders had been less certain. Kindness hadn\u2019t been a commodity he\u2019d much experienced in his life, but Pedro\u2019s mother had felt sorry for him being orphaned, and on learning that his mother had taught him to read and write, Pedro\u2019s father had decided he would make a fine page after some intensive personal combat training to catch him up to other pages of his age. He could then squire for him and eventually become one of his knights, Pedro\u2019s father had assured him.</p><p>What had followed was the most wonderful six months of Anders\u2019s life. With a little mind control he\u2019d managed to arrange his training so that he had as little exposure to sunlight as possible. But he\u2019d also worked hard to please Pedro\u2019s father as page, and had been treated with kindness and affection . . . right up until the night Alecto and her men had tracked him there, slid into the castle during the night and butchered the entire family, including Pedro\u2019s three younger sisters.</p><p>Anders and Pedro had been out running, playing at battle and then fishing as they did most nights when it happened. It wasn\u2019t until they were slipping back into the castle that they realized anything was amiss. It was the blood. Anders had smelled it the moment Pedro had pushed open the stone door from the secret tunnels into the upstairs hall where the bedchambers were. His mortal friend hadn\u2019t caught the scent, but Anders, with the exceptional olfactory sense immortals possessed, had, and the scent had made him stop abruptly in the opening and sniff the air with sudden alarm.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until Pedro had hissed, \u201cCome on, or we\u2019ll be caught,\u201d that Anders had realized while he\u2019d stopped to scent the air, Pedro had continued and was now at his bedchamber door. Even as Anders had opened his mouth to hiss a warning and call him back to the safety of the tunnels until they knew what was about, Pedro\u2019s bedchamber door had opened and one of Alecto\u2019s men had been on his friend. There had been no questions, no threats, no warning. The bastard had caught the startled Pedro by the scruff, lifted him, and ripped out his throat in one blurred motion.</p><p>Anders had frozen in shock and horror. While he\u2019d spent his entire life running and hiding from these people, he\u2019d never actually seen Alecto and her men in action. Even with his mother, the attack had been over and she\u2019d been dead by the time he\u2019d crept up on the cabin. The cruelty and violence of this attack was unfathomable to him, breathtaking. It had left him shaking and unable to move . . . until another door had opened and Alecto had led several men out of the bedchamber of Pedro\u2019s mother and father. He\u2019d barely counted six men pouring out of the room when a thump had drawn his wide eyes to where Pedro\u2019s lifeless body had been dropped on the hall floor like so much trash. One of the men had spotted him then and shouted, and Anders had jumped back, letting the stone door slide closed between them.</p><p>He\u2019d begun to run then, taking the stairs in the secret passage two at a time until he burst out into the tunnel under the castle. It led out to a cave on the edge of a clearing far beyond the castle walls and Anders had fled through it, his mind in utter chaos. Fear, fury, and loss had battled in his brain, leaving him unable to hold on to any one of the emotions. He\u2019d run until he couldn\u2019t run anymore, and then he\u2019d collapsed in the woods and lay weeping until the sun had risen.</p><p>Somewhat dazed and completely uncaring of the damage the sun might cause him then, Anders had returned the way he\u2019d come. He\u2019d known Alecto and her men would be gone by then and he\u2019d hoped to find that Pedro had somehow survived. He\u2019d also wanted, needed to know what had happened to the rest of the family who had welcomed him to their bosom.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even had to leave the tunnels. The hall had been crammed with weeping servants when he\u2019d unlocked the opening to the secret passage and a quick read of the nearest one had told him all he needed to know. Alecto and her men had slaughtered every member of the family down to their three-year-old daughter, and even some of the servants.</p><p>Anders had let the stone door slip closed and then simply sank to sit in the dust and cobwebs of the tunnel, overwhelmed with loss and guilt. He had brought this on Pedro and his family by being here. It had been a hard lesson. He\u2019d learned that no one would be safe near him so long as Alecto hunted him, and he\u2019d realized that Alecto would never stop hunting him so long as she lived. The woman was obsessed to the point of madness.</p> <p>After two days and nights huddled in that dark, cold passage with his grief, Anders had descended to the tunnels and made his way out into the clearing, reborn with a purpose. He would never again let anyone close to him. He would never stay anywhere long enough for Alecto and her people to catch up to him. He would grow, and train in combat, and when he was strong enough and had learned enough, he would kill that bitch and every one of the bastards who rode with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Anders glanced to Valerie then, and managed a smile. \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that long,\u201d she said sounding incredibly solemn, but then she was thinking that it had only been a decade or two when in reality it had been centuries. More than 644 years. A lot had happened since then, including his sending Alecto and every one of her men to join his father and mother in death. That had happened ten years to the day after his mother\u2019s death, and in the clearing where the cabin his mother had been killed in had once stood. He\u2019d chosen the place and date, and simply allowed Alecto and her men to catch up with him.</p><p>Anders doubted Alecto had even recognized the clearing or its significance. Finding his horse in the clearing where he\u2019d left it, she\u2019d sent her men out to search the woods for him and he\u2019d taken them out one at a time until there was only her left.</p><p>Anders had dreamed about that day so often over the years . . . He\u2019d thought he would feel relief or vindication when it came. But in the end he hadn\u2019t felt anything at all once he\u2019d confronted, fought, and beheaded the bitch. It hadn\u2019t brought back his mother, or Pedro and his family, and had taken away the only purpose he\u2019d had for the last decade. He\u2019d left there feeling like a hollow man, only half alive and going through the motions. He\u2019d continued to feel that way for a very long time. For centuries he traveled around, joining various groups of mercenaries and spending his life knee-deep in blood and corpses, hiring himself out for the coin, and never really caring much about the cause or his comrades. That had gone on right up until he\u2019d encountered Lucian.</p><p>Lucian Argeneau had a way about him. When he looked at you he seemed to see right down into your soul, and he\u2019d looked into Anders\u2019s soul and offered him what he needed: a purpose. Lucian had convinced him to become an Enforcer and help not only to keep mortals like Pedro and his family safe, but to prevent what had happened to his mother and father from happening to other unfortunate immortals. That purpose had helped him begin to feel human again. He was still reticent and careful about opening himself up much to others, but he counted Lucian as much a friend as a boss, and there were others he worked with that he called friend . . . And then there was Valerie. He thought he could open up to her. He wanted to. Certainly, he\u2019d told her more than most knew about his history. The problem was that once again someone he cared for was in danger. The only difference was that this time he didn\u2019t bring the danger.</p><p>\u201cWe need to change the subject,\u201d Valerie announced.</p> <p>Anders glanced her way at those words, smiled wryly, and arched one eyebrow. \u201cToo depressing for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted, and then patted his arm, adding, \u201cBut thank you for sharing.\u201d</p><p>For some reason that made Anders want to laugh, which wasn\u2019t something he often did. But then he\u2019d found himself amused and smiling a great deal since Valerie\u2019s arrival in his life . . . which he liked . . . and didn\u2019t want to lose. He had to succeed where he\u2019d failed with his mother and Pedro and his family. He had to keep her safe.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cI suppose it will be a while before Leigh and Lucian get up,\u201d Valerie commented as they approached the house.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. They usually sleep through the morning,\u201d Anders said. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re on our own for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Leigh would mind if we helped ourselves?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Anders shook his head and reached out to open one of the French doors into the kitchen for her. \u201cShe said we were welcome to whatever we like.\u201d</p><p>Valerie let out a little relieved breath as she stepped through the door. The walk had made her hungry, and she\u2019d worried that they would have to wait to eat until Leigh and Lucian got up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel like for breakfast?\u201d Anders asked, closing the door once Roxy trotted in.</p><p>Valerie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s available. I guess some toast will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToast? After that walk?\u201d Anders asked with raised eyebrows, pausing in front of her. As Roxy walked around him, sniffing the floor, he asked, \u201cWe have more choices than toast. There\u2019s bacon, eggs, sausage, cereal, grapefruit, or toast, if you like. But I liked those sausages we had with the pancakes yesterday and I was thinking of having those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose sausages were good,\u201d she agreed with a grin, and then stumbled a step forward, putting her hands up to Anders\u2019s chest to catch herself as something pressed into the back of her knees, throwing her off balance. Glancing down and around, Valerie saw that it was the leash. Roxy had walked around both of them and then back behind Anders to get to her dish.</p><p>\u201cDid you train her to do that?\u201d Anders asked, hands clasping her waist to steady her.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not,\u201d Valerie gasped, horrified that he might even think that. She relaxed though, when she saw the teasing twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell you did say you like my kisses,\u201d he pointed out, his voice a husky taunt as his hands crept around her back and urged her closer. \u201cPerhaps you were hoping for more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie could feel the heat flushing her cheeks. It was partially from his teasing and partially because her body was tingling everywhere they touched. Lowering her eyes to his chest where her fingers were now nervously plucking at the black cotton of his T-shirt, she murmured, \u201cPerhaps I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Anders whispered and when she glanced up wide-eyed, his lips settled on hers. Valerie had thought she must have imagined the passion that had exploded between them the last two times they\u2019d kissed. That somehow her memory had made it seem better or stronger than it really had been. But if anything, her memory had been like a faded picture, unable to hold onto the vibrancy and sheer strength of the heat and need that erupted inside Valerie as his lips met hers. She was a grown woman, it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d been kissed, but damn, no one had ever brought about as violent a reaction inside her as he did. She melted and imploded all at the same time.</p><p>When he broke the kiss to trail his mouth across her cheek, Valerie regained enough sense to become aware that she\u2019d dropped Roxy\u2019s leash and wrapped herself about him like clinging ivy . . . and he was just as wrapped around her. His arms were around her, his hands trailing over her back and sides, one leg between hers, the other hugging the outside of her leg as his lips found her ear and began to drive her wild. She withstood that briefly, but then twisted her head back in search of his again.</p> <p>Anders responded to her silent request and kissed her again, his tongue thrusting into her mouth aggressively as one of his hands drifted around to find a breast. They both moaned into each other\u2019s mouths as his hand cupped her breast. When the leg between both of hers rose up then and rubbed against her, Valerie thought the three-pronged assault of pleasure might kill her. It was incredibly overwhelming, seeming to come from everywhere, bouncing through her in wave after building wave.</p><p>Valerie wasn\u2019t aware of his pushing her T-shirt up until he tugged the cup of her bra aside and cool air reached her nipple. Groaning into his mouth, she pressed into his caress as he squeezed and kneaded the soft flesh, and then began to pluck at the nipple.</p><p>\u201cSemmy,\u201d she pleaded when he broke their kiss, then gasped when he bent her back over one arm and lowered his head to claim her nipple, drawing it into his mouth and sending a whole new riot of sensation through her. Valerie dug her fingers into his shoulders and groaned, a sound echoed by Anders. Both of his hands were at her back now, one supporting her while the other . . . worked at her bra, she realized when it suddenly loosened around her.</p><p>Anders immediately raised his head and claimed her mouth again. Valerie returned his kisses eagerly, gasping as she felt the cool leather of the couch against her back and realized he\u2019d lowered her onto it. In the next moment, his body covered hers and he broke their kiss. Raising himself on one arm, he used the other hand to push the silky cloth of her bra up over her breasts. His eyes then slid over her heated skin. Valerie squirmed under his gaze, then moaned as his mouth bent to claim one nipple.</p><p>When his free hand then covered the other, Valerie gasped and arched her back, one hand sliding around his neck, and the other covering his hand and squeezing even as he squeezed her. She was so overwhelmed by the sensations he was stirring in her that Valerie was slow to realize she wasn\u2019t doing anything in return. She had never been a selfish lover, but right now she was taking and not giving. And that right there spoke to the effect he was having on her. Cripes, all she was doing was holding on for dear life to keep from drowning in the passion washing over her.</p> <p>Releasing the hand she\u2019d been clutching, Valerie slid her hand to his back and ran it down to his behind. She squeezed one cheek, urging him harder against her and then started to slide her hand around between them. She had reached the top of his jeans when Anders immediately stopped what he was doing and reached down to catch her hand.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Valerie\u2019s protest ended when his mouth covered hers.</p><p>Anders\u2019s kiss was determined and hard as he caught both of her wrists in one hand and raised them above her head, holding them in place so that she couldn\u2019t touch him. Meanwhile, his other hand slid down her cheek, over her chest, down her belly and inside her jeans. It was only then that she realized that he\u2019d apparently undone her jeans at some point while she was distracted, allowing his hand to slide easily between her skin and panties and slip between her legs.</p><p>Valerie jerked beneath him, gasping and making little whimpering sounds into his mouth as his fingers brushed over her sensitive skin. She also eased her legs apart, giving him better access. Anders accepted the invitation at once, his fingers dipping into her moist center.</p><p>His touch set off an explosion of pleasure inside Valerie that built and rushed over her wave after wave under his caress. It was incredible, overwhelming, all encompassing and terrifying. She wanted him to stop and she never wanted it to end. She wanted to drown in the pleasure he was creating in her and was afraid she would.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s body was arched like a bow, taut and trembling. Her eyes were squeezed tightly closed and while she had been sucking desperately at his tongue when he first covered her mouth with his, now she couldn\u2019t find the wherewithal to do even that. Her mouth was just open to him as she panted little puffs of breath into his that grew faster and shallower with each brush of his fingers over her.</p> <p>When he suddenly pressed one finger into her while continuing to caress her, the tension inside her snapped like a thread. Valerie cried out into his mouth and bucked violently, and then she finally drowned under the pleasure assaulting her and sank into darkness.</p><p>When Valerie murmured sleepily and shifted, drawing her leg up along his, Anders opened his eyes to peer down at her. She was curled on her side, one arm and leg cast over him and her head on his chest. She shifted again, her leg now sliding down his. Damn. Even that small, unintentional caress in her sleep sent shivers of pleasure through him. But then his body was still sensitized after what had happened downstairs.</p><p>Anders had enjoyed every second of pleasure he\u2019d given Valerie, experiencing every ripple and wave of excitement and pleasure that had traveled through her, including the end orgasm that had overwhelmed them both. Valerie wasn\u2019t the only one who had passed out downstairs. But Anders had woken up first.</p><p>Aware that Valerie would be embarrassed if they were found on the couch by Leigh or Lucian, and unsure how long she\u2019d stay unconscious, Anders had scooped her up and carried her up here to her room. He\u2019d removed her jeans, T-shirt, and the already undone bra so that she would be more comfortable. Then he\u2019d stripped down to his boxers and climbed into bed with her. He wanted to be there when she woke up, to be sure that she hadn\u2019t been too freaked out by what had happened.</p><p>Intimacy between life mates just wasn\u2019t your everyday sexual experience. Anders had bedded hundreds, perhaps even thousands of women during the first century or two of his life, and had never experienced anything like it. Nothing even close.</p><p>His thoughts fled as Valerie shifted again and wiped a hand over her face. The action made him smile. She\u2019d been drooling on him for the last half hour while she slept. Apparently, she was waking up enough to feel the liquid that dribbled across her own skin before dropping onto his chest.</p><p>Lifting his head, Anders peered at her face in time to see her eyes blink open. A heartbeat later, she stiffened in his hold, and then jerked up, banging him in the chin with the top of her head. Wincing, Anders let his head drop back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d Valerie muttered, following closely with, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Anders said with a wry smile, rubbing his chin with the hand not presently wrapped around her back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in my room,\u201d she noted with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI carried you up here,\u201d Anders explained, and when she raised the sheet covering them both to peer down at herself, added, \u201cAnd took your jeans and stuff off so you\u2019d sleep more comfortably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left my panties on,\u201d she said, blushing.</p><p>\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, and then gave an embarrassed laugh. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s silly that I would have been embarrassed if you hadn\u2019t left them on, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would have,\u201d Anders finished with understanding.</p><p>Valerie nodded, and then tipped her head back, carefully this time, and eyed him uncertainly. \u201cI fainted, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019ve never fainted before. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Anders hesitated and then said, \u201cYour system is weaker than normal right now, and you were on your back, putting pressure on your wound.\u201d All of that was true of course, but it wasn\u2019t the reason she\u2019d fainted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel any pain,\u201d she said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou were rather distracted,\u201d he pointed out delicately.</p><p>Valerie flushed and lowered her head again briefly. When she raised it a moment later, there was a determined expression on her face. \u201cYes, I was definitely rather distracted. And selfish. You didn\u2019t get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Anders interrupted, knowing where her thoughts were headed. She felt like it had all been one-sided and that he had given her pleasure while not enjoying it himself. She couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, but he couldn\u2019t tell her that, or explain how he could have enjoyed her pleasure with her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet, Anders, but it\u2019s not fine,\u201d Valerie said on a sigh, and raised herself up enough to look him in the face. She began to slide her hand down his stomach as she said, \u201cI could do for you what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped abruptly when Anders caught the hand that had nearly reached the top of his boxers. As tempted as he was, he couldn\u2019t let her touch him. While it would certainly give him pleasure, Valerie, too, would experience that pleasure with him and he couldn\u2019t explain that without explaining everything. She wasn\u2019t ready to hear the truth of his origins yet.</p><p>Raising her fingers to his lips he pressed a kiss to them, then released her hand to slide his around her neck and draw her face down to his. His kiss was as light and gentle as it had been on her fingers. At least, he\u2019d intended it to be, but the moment their lips met, the passion came roaring back like a freight train. Reeling under the blow, Anders rolled in the bed, pressing Valerie into the mattress as his body covered hers. The feel of her flesh against his was exhilarating, her naked chest to his, her naked legs entwining with his . . . It all started a clamoring in his body it was impossible to ignore.</p><p>\u201cSemmy,\u201d Valerie gasped when he tore his mouth from hers to follow a trail down her neck.</p><p>Anders smiled against her throat at the nickname. No one had ever called him that. His mother had only ever called him Semen, and to everyone else he had given the name Anders and nothing else. But he liked Semmy. On Valerie\u2019s lips it sounded like an endearment or a prayer.</p><p>Valerie shifted beneath him, sliding her heels down the backs of his calves and then digging them in so that she could arch her pelvis into him. The action had an immediate effect. Blood rushed to his groin, turning the semi-hardness that had been building there into a full-on, raging hard-on.</p><p>Growling, deep in his throat, Anders caught the fingers of one hand in her hair and pulled, drawing her head back and elongating her throat as he thrust back. Both of them groaned at the passion that rushed through them, and Anders felt his fangs slide out. He froze briefly, and then allowed them to gently scrape across her flesh, shivering along with her before forcing them back where they belonged and continuing down to crest one breast and close over her nipple.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Semmy, Semmy, Semmy,\u201d Valerie breathed, cradling his head as he suckled.</p><p>Anders nipped at her flesh lightly, then raised his head to claim her lips again before sliding further down her body, his lips and tongue tasting her upper stomach, her belly, dipping into her belly button . . .</p><p>\u201cSemmy?\u201d She shuddered under his teasing, her legs shifting restlessly. When he hooked his fingers in the waistband of her panties and began to draw them down, Valerie lifted her behind to help. He slid them down her legs and off, then let them drop to the floor as he stood to remove his boxers. The moment he stood, Valerie rose up and reached to help him. Anders didn\u2019t think there was any harm in that until she reached for his erection while his boxers were still around his knees.</p><p>Anders sucked in a sharp breath at the shock of pleasure, but was almost immediately distracted by the gasp she released as she experienced that pleasure with him. When she raised confused eyes to him, Anders brushed her hand away and cupped her head to kiss her. It was a quick, hard kiss intended to distract her from the shared pleasure, but he knew before he raised his head that it hadn\u2019t worked, and wasn\u2019t surprised when she immediately frowned and said, \u201cAnders, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s as far as he allowed her to get. Catching her legs beneath each knee, he tugged her to the edge of the bed, dropped to his knees between her legs and sought out a more effective way to distract her. The moment his lips pressed against her warm core, Anders knew he\u2019d found the perfect way to make her forget what she\u2019d experienced. Heck, he was having trouble remembering what he was trying to distract her from himself as her pleasure began to course through him in growing waves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anders nearly pushed them both over the edge with his mouth; certainly, they were both teetering on that edge when Valerie suddenly cried his name and tugged at his ears almost painfully. He immediately recalled what had started all this. Her feeling that it had been unfair that he\u2019d pleasured her earlier without, she thought, gaining any pleasure himself.</p><p>Cursing, Anders stood at once, caught her legs in both hands again and thrust into her. He froze then, hardly aware of the long groan both he and Valerie issued together. All he was aware of for a moment was how damned good it felt to be buried in her, to have her warm, wet heat closing around him like a glove, squeezing and pulsing around him. Nothing in his life had ever felt this good and for a moment, he couldn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t want to. But then Valerie shifted, wrapping her legs behind his butt and arching against him.</p><p>Anders began to move then, withdrawing and thrusting in again. But as far along as they were, it was only a few thrusts before they were both crying out and then sinking into the dark well of pleasure.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Valerie opened her eyes and found herself staring at Roxy\u2019s furry face. She smiled wryly at the sight of her pitiful eyes, and then Roxy shifted and twisted a bit so that she could scratch her ear with her back paw.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Valerie breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Glancing around at Anders\u2019s question, Valerie smiled shyly when she saw that she was lying on her back with her head on his arm while he lay on his side, peering at her sleepily. The last thing she remembered was being splayed across the bed sideways with him between her legs. She supposed he\u2019d moved her again after she\u2019d\u2014\u201cI fainted again.\u201d</p> <p>Anders smiled slowly. \u201cWould that be due to my superior skill as a lover?\u201d</p><p>Valerie chuckled at the smug look on his face, but said, \u201cI guess it must be . . . that and my wound. Maybe I haven\u2019t built my blood back up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>A whine from Roxy drew her attention again and Valerie began to shift the sheets and blankets aside with a sigh, but paused when she recalled that she was naked.</p><p>\u201cShy?\u201d Anders teased lightly as he got up, completely, gloriously, and unabashedly nude.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Valerie admitted, her eyes roaming over his body. Damn, the man was beautiful. He was like a Greek god, muscles rippling under unblemished mocha skin. How did she dare show her own less-than-perfect body to him?</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Valerie managed to drag her eyes up to his face, but paused along the way as she noted the clothes he was holding out.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and dress. I need to use the bathroom,\u201d he said.</p><p>Valerie watched him cross the room, her eyes fused to his tight tush as he walked. Damn. This just wasn\u2019t fair. The man had a nicer behind than she did. And those legs? Wow. When the bathroom door closed, cutting off her view, Valerie gave her head a small shake and turned her attention to dressing as quickly as she could. She had no idea how long he\u2019d be in the bathroom.</p><p>Anders took long enough that Valerie had dressed, brushed her hair and was hooking Roxy\u2019s leash to her when he came out of the bathroom. Much to her amazement, he too was dressed. He must have taken his clothes into the bathroom with him earlier. How had she missed that? She didn\u2019t have to wonder hard about it. She\u2019d been so busy ogling his butt, he could have been wearing a moose head and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed, Valerie acknowledged wryly.</p><p>\u201cI imagine Roxy has to go out,\u201d Anders commented as he approached.</p><p>\u201cYes. Unfortunately, so do I,\u201d Valerie said as he paused in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI can take her out while you use the bathroom,\u201d he offered, taking the lead from her.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said with sincere gratitude. She really had to go. \u201cI\u2019ll be down in just a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hurry,\u201d he assured her, heading for the door with Roxy trotting dutifully behind him. \u201cTake a shower if you want.\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t wait to see him leave, but immediately headed for the bathroom. She hadn\u2019t originally intended to shower, but after taking care of other matters, she noted the still dripping showerhead, realized Anders must have had a quick shower before dressing, and decided maybe she wanted one after all. But a quick one.</p><p>With her long hair to shampoo and rinse and the need to shave, Valerie wasn\u2019t as quick as Anders, but she was still pretty quick. When she got out, she brushed out her hair, put it back in a ponytail and then went out into her bedroom to find fresh clothes. A glance out her window showed another hot and sunny day, so rather than the jeans she\u2019d worn that morning when it was cooler, Valerie donned a pair of red shorts and a white T-shirt.</p><p>Anders and Roxy were still outside when she got downstairs, so she headed out to join them, frowning and muttering another, \u201cDamn,\u201d when Roxy sat down to scratch herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Anders asked, moving toward her.</p><p>\u201cRoxy should have had her flea pill three days ago,\u201d Valerie answered.</p><p>Anders paused and glanced back to a still scratching Roxy. Frowning, he said, \u201cWell, surely fleas couldn\u2019t have infested her already?\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled. \u201cNo. She\u2019s probably just scratching because of dry skin or something, but if I don\u2019t get her her pill, she could get fleas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose her pills are in Cambridge?\u201d he asked with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted, but quickly added, \u201cThe nearest vet should be able to supply them, though. There\u2019s no need to drive all the way to Cambridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Anders said, obviously relieved. He glanced to the house, then to Roxy and finally to Valerie and said, \u201cWell, we could pick them up now. Maybe grab some breakfast out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr brunch,\u201d Valerie said wryly with a glance at her watch. It was after 11 now. They\u2019d been up for hours. Well, not really up, she supposed. More like up and down, she thought and then said, \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to take Roxy with us. I wouldn\u2019t want to leave her here alone. She might get up to mischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave her with me,\u201d Leigh announced, drawing their attention to her presence in the open French doors.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Valerie said, offering a smile and wondering why she was suddenly blushing. It wasn\u2019t like the woman knew what had happened between she and Anders while Leigh and her husband were sleeping just up the hall. They hadn\u2019t been that loud. Had they?</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Leigh responded, reaching out to squeeze her hand. \u201cYou two go ahead and get the pills. I\u2019m happy to look after Roxy while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d Leigh assured her. \u201cRoxy\u2019s a sweetheart, and she\u2019ll keep me company until Lucian wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Anders said. \u201cIs there anything you need while we\u2019re out?\u201d</p><p>Leigh hesitated, and then asked, \u201cWould you mind making a stop at the grocery store on the way back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back toward the house, and then said, \u201cI know we need bread and milk, but there may be a couple more things. I\u2019ll check and text you a list if that\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Anders said with amusement and then took Valerie\u2019s arm to urge her into the house. As he walked her through the living room and up the hall he said, \u201cGo grab your shoes and purse. I\u2019ll pull the car out of the garage and around to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Valerie agreed and started to turn for the stairs, only to have Anders swing her back and claim her lips. She hesitated under the caress, but then slid her arms around his neck and kissed him back when he deepened it. Damn, one kiss and she was ready to drag him up to her room again.</p><p>She\u2019d barely had the thought when Anders broke the kiss and smiled at her. \u201cGo, or we\u2019ll end up back in your bed and Roxy and Leigh will have to do without.\u201d</p><p>A bit dazed still from the kiss, Valerie nodded silently and turned to the stairs, flushing bright red when she glanced up the hall and spotted a grinning Leigh watching them from the kitchen.</p><p>Shaking her head, Valerie hurried quickly upstairs, trying to remember what she was going there for. It was damned embarrassing, but just one kiss from Anders left her a blithering idiot.</p><p>\u201cGeez, there isn\u2019t a single parking spot,\u201d Anders muttered, scanning the crammed parking lot of the veterinary clinic. \u201cI\u2019ll have to look for a spot on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could just double-park here and I could run in,\u201d Valerie suggested. When he frowned at the suggestion, she rolled her eyes. \u201cYou can see everyone coming and going from here and I should only be a minute. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips, then let his breath out on a sigh and nodded, \u201cOkay, but scream my name if you need me. I\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you will,\u201d Valerie said with amusement, and then leaned forward to kiss him, but caught herself at the last minute. It was just too risky. His kisses sent her up in flames. Besides, she wasn\u2019t sure she had the right. Valerie wasn\u2019t really sure what was happening between them yet. They\u2019d had sex, sure, really hot, mind-blowing sex, but that didn\u2019t mean she had the right to kiss him when she wanted to, or to treat him like a boyfriend. Heck, they hadn\u2019t even been on a date yet, and she had no idea if they would, or if he wanted to. Maybe she was just a fling to him.</p><p>Sighing at the situation she\u2019d managed to get herself into, Valerie forced a smile and slid quickly out of the car, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>The clinic was as busy inside as the parking lot suggested. Every seat in the place was taken and the floor was littered with dogs, cat carriers, and cages with smaller animals. There were also three people in line, waiting to register their animals.</p><p>Valerie took her place at the end of the line and glanced around as she waited. There was a Doberman pinscher with an injured paw, a sheltie lying down and looking miserable, a Lab who appeared to be losing its hair, a cat who was meowing nonstop . . . She mentally noted each animal, doing a quick assessment, and working out what treatment was required. It was a mental exercise to pass the time, but made her miss her own clinic quite a bit. Valerie loved being a vet, always had. You didn\u2019t go to school all that time for a career you didn\u2019t love and Valerie loved animals. Taking care of them was her dream job.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced forward, surprised to see that it was her turn at the counter. Either the two women running the desk here were particularly efficient, or she\u2019d spent more time analyzing the animals than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>Smiling, she stepped up to the counter and explained the situation. It turned out to be a little more involved than she\u2019d expected. This clinic was pretty strict and made her fill out a patient form for Roxy, listing her birthday, full name, date of last shots, etc. Valerie shifted along the counter to make way for the next person while she quickly filled out the pertinent information. She was half listening to the pet owners who stepped up to the counter after her, and had just finished filling out the form when a woman\u2019s voice caught her ear.</p><p>Pausing, Valerie lifted her head and glanced over, peering curiously at the petit, short-haired blond chatting easily with the receptionist. Her voice was familiar. She sounded an awfully lot like one of the women who had been caged in the house of horror with her, Cindy\u2014</p><p>\u201cSorry, Miss MacVicar,\u201d a man in a doctor\u2019s coat, one of the vets she supposed, said, appearing on the other side of the counter. \u201cI had to write up the file.\u201d</p><p>Valerie froze, her eyes running over the woman again. It was her: Cindy MacVicar. Her eyes slid to the cat carrier the woman carried. Cindy had told them she had a cat named Mittens.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Doc,\u201d the blond said with a smile. \u201cMittens and I are in no hurry.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, the man turned to the receptionist and began to give instructions and Valerie immediately stepped closer along the counter, saying, \u201cCindy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d The blond turned, a small scar by the corner of her mouth puckering as she smiled at her uncertainly. Tilting her head as she peered at Valerie, she frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said at once, and then admitted, \u201cWell, not by sight. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s me, Valerie Moyer,\u201d she explained and when the woman\u2019s expression remained blank, she added, \u201cFrom the house?\u201d</p><p>Cindy shook her head with bewilderment. \u201cWhat house?\u201d</p><p>The question made Valerie frown, but she explained, \u201cThe house with Igor and his boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgor?\u201d Cindy echoed with amusement, but shook her head again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie stared at her with bewilderment. She knew it was her. Her voice was somewhat distinct, sharp and quick. She sounded like the Cindy MacVicar from the house. And how many Cindy MacVicars could have a cat named Mittens?</p><p>Determined, Valerie stepped closer still and said, \u201cThe cages? You were kidnapped a week and a half before me. You were there for at least three weeks. You have to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I think you have me mixed up with someone else,\u201d Cindy said gently. Actually she said it as if unsure Valerie were quite mentally stable, and then added, \u201cI was on a month long vacation up until the day before yesterday. I just got back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere are the pills, Dr. Moyer. Are you done with the form?\u201d</p><p>Valerie turned with confusion as the receptionist set a packet on the counter. She stared at it blankly, and then nodded and handed over the form with Roxy\u2019s information. She started to take the pills, already turning back to Cindy, but the receptionist said, \u201cDo you want to pay in cash or debit?\u201d</p><p>Valerie grimaced. She\u2019d almost forgotten to pay. Opening her purse, she took out her wallet and retrieved the necessary cash.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll just get your change,\u201d the receptionist said when she handed it over. She then glanced to Cindy. \u201cMs. MacVicar, the doctor forgot to weigh Mittens. If you follow Joan, she\u2019ll do it now for the file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie watched Cindy follow the second receptionist from the room, bewilderment uppermost in her mind. Lucian had said the women wanted to get on with their lives and forget about what had happened to them, but this was ridiculous. It was as if Cindy really didn\u2019t have a clue what she was talking about. Maybe she wasn\u2019t the right Cindy, Valerie thought with a frown. But the voice . . . She was sure it was the same. However, she\u2019d never seen Cindy and couldn\u2019t be 100 percent sure.</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d the receptionist said, recapturing her attention. She was holding out her change.</p><p>Valerie accepted her change with a small sigh, murmured, \u201cThank you,\u201d and turned to head out of the clinic.</p><p>\u201cMs. Moyer?\u201d</p><p>Pausing, she glanced back.</p><p>\u201cRoxy\u2019s pills.\u201d The receptionist held them up.</p> <p>Valerie returned quickly to collect them, very aware that the room had gone quiet, everyone eyeing her with speculation now, including the receptionist. She supposed blurting out the bit about being kidnapped hadn\u2019t been too smart. And Cindy\u2019s complete denial hadn\u2019t helped. They were all wondering about her state of mind, she supposed. Look out for the crazy lady.</p><p>Forcing a smile, Valerie accepted the packet of pills and turned to hurry out.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Anders asked as she got back into the car a moment later.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Valerie muttered, shoving the packet in her purse and quickly doing up her seat belt. But then she asked, \u201cDid you see the house where we were kept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, frowning a bit.</p><p>\u201cThe cages?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking perplexed by the question.</p><p>\u201cDid you meet the other women?\u201d</p> <p>Anders frowned. \u201cValerie, why\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy MacVicar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort, blond?\u201d he asked uncertainly. \u201cScar by her mouth?\u201d</p><p>Valerie sank back in her seat without responding. It had been her. It had to be. Why hadn\u2019t she seemed to recall anything about their misadventure? Or was she just an excellent actress?</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>She could hear the frown in his voice without looking at him, but didn\u2019t at first react. Her mind was racing. She was recalling how certain Lucian had sounded when he\u2019d said the women wouldn\u2019t want to meet again, and wondering if that was because he knew they didn\u2019t even recall it? Had Lucian and the other Enforcers somehow erased their memories? But how and why would they do that?</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d Anders repeated, sounding concerned now. \u201cDid something happen inside the vet\u2019s clinic?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at once, instinctively keeping what had happened to herself for now . . . at least until she could figure out why Cindy didn\u2019t remember anything. Realizing that he was staring at her suspiciously, Valerie cleared her throat and lied, \u201cI was just thinking while I waited in line and wondering about the other women. I never saw them, you know. I wouldn\u2019t recognize them on the street if I bumped into them.\u201d</p><p>Much to her relief, that seemed to make him relax, which, in turn, made her suspicious. Why would he be relieved that she wouldn\u2019t recognize the other women? Fretting over that, she straightened her shoulders and lied again. \u201cI just recalled that there\u2019s a book I need for class on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Anders turned forward in his seat and switched on the engine. \u201cWell, the campus isn\u2019t far from here. We could swing by on the way to the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Valerie said and closed her eyes briefly. She\u2019d been about to suggest that, but he\u2019d done it for her. Billie had said she worked at the coffee shop in the bookstore and Valerie intended to find and talk to her. If she could find her.</p><p>Valerie tightened her hands around her purse. She had to find her. Billie was the only other woman Valerie had a chance of finding. Laura worked in a realtor\u2019s office, but hadn\u2019t said which one or where, and Kathy was unemployed and hadn\u2019t said anything that would lead to her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Anders said, peering around as they entered the bookstore twenty minutes later. \u201cWhat book are we looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a coffee first,\u201d Valerie said determinedly.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Anders asked, picking up speed to keep up with her as she hurried forward. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Tim Hortons in Pages on the upper level,\u201d Valerie announced. She had no intention of buying a book. Heck, she couldn\u2019t buy a book here for her courses. This was the university bookstore in the MacNaughton Building. To get books for any of her classes, she\u2019d have to go to the Ontario Veterinary College Book Barn in the OVC Lifetime Learning Centre. Fortunately, Anders didn\u2019t know a thing about the Ontario Veterinary College at Guelph University.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of hot for coffee?\u201d Anders asked as Valerie led him to the Tim Hortons counter.</p><p>She grimaced. He was right. The walk here from the car had left her hot and sweaty. \u201cWe can have iced capps then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced capps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced cappuccinos,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had them?\u201d Valerie asked with surprise as she turned back to scan the name tags of the workers behind the counter. She didn\u2019t have a clue what Billie would look like. Just that she\u2019d had a high, sweet voice. She\u2019d sounded about twelve, though she\u2019d said she was twenty-two.</p><p>\u201cNo. Are they good?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she answered absently. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of like drinkable ice cream. They\u2019re made of coffee, sugar, cream, and ice cubes all put through a blender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Drinkable ice cream sounds good,\u201d Anders said cheerfully.</p><p>Valerie smiled absently and urged him toward the counter. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you order us a couple. Two iced capps large,\u201d she added when he looked uncertain.</p><p>Anders nodded and headed for the counter, and Valerie returned to searching the name tags. She had read every the name of every worker behind the counter without spotting anything close to Billie and was about to give up when a tall, slender brunette with her hair in a ponytail came from the back of the store. She was pulling a hat on as she approached the sandwich station. Her name tag read BILLIE.</p><p>Valerie moved to the far end of the counter at once. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>The brunette glanced up and offered a polite smile. Her voice was the high and sweet one Valerie recalled when she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You have to place your order at the other end of the counter by the tills.\u201d</p><p>It was her. That voice was just too recognizable. There couldn\u2019t be two Billies with that voice working at this Tim Hortons. Valerie smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not placing an order, my . . . er . . . friend is,\u201d she said, unsure whether she had the right to call Anders her boyfriend or not. Though, really, at thirty, were they even called boyfriends? She supposed she could have said lover, but that was just giving away too much information.</p><p>Putting aside the issue of what to call Anders, she said solemnly, \u201cMy name is Valerie Moyer . . . from the house of cages.\u201d</p><p>Billie tilted her head. \u201cIs that a bar or a band or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Frowning, she shook her head. \u201cBillie, I\u2019m talking about the house where we were held captive in cages in the basement. Remember?\u201d Valerie coaxed when Billie just stared at her. \u201cThe cages we couldn\u2019t stretch out or stand in? Oatmeal once a day. The crazy guy and his boss who thought he was a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie!\u201d</p><p>Pausing at Anders\u2019s sharp voice, she glanced around with surprise when he took her arm and steered her away. \u201cWait. I wasn\u2019t done talking to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he said firmly, forcing her forward.</p><p>\u201cBut Semmy, she was one of the girls. Maybe we can figure out how he picked us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t help us. She doesn\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Valerie jerked her arm out of his hold and turned on him. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked grimly. She knew he was right. She\u2019d watched Billie\u2019s face the whole time she was talking and there hadn\u2019t been a lick of recognition or recall in her face. She hadn\u2019t remembered anything. Just like Cindy. And while that shocked her, Anders wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised.</p><p>Mouth tightening, she asked, \u201cWhat do you know that you aren\u2019t telling me?\u201d</p><p>Anders\u2019s gaze slid back to Billie, who was watching them curiously. Turning back, he urged the cardboard drink tray toward Valerie. When she automatically took one of the iced capps in it, he turned to urge her forward again and said, \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t protest or fight. She walked silently beside him until he paused on the main floor of the bookstore and glanced to her. \u201cDid you really have a book you needed to buy?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but then shook her head guiltily. Anders didn\u2019t seem surprised, but merely sipped at his drink as they started walking again. They were silent all the way to the car, but once there, Valerie turned on him. \u201cSo?\u201d she said. \u201cWould you care to explain why Billie and Cindy don\u2019t recall what happened to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cShe happened to be in the vet clinic,\u201d Valerie said grimly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t recall me either, or the house and Igor. She didn\u2019t remember anything. And neither did Billie.\u201d Valerie paused briefly, and then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Anders repeated, and when she opened her mouth to protest, he added, \u201cI need to concentrate on driving . . . at least until we get somewhere we won\u2019t be interrupted.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a breath, Valerie sank back in the passenger seat and did up her seat belt. She then turned her attention to her iced capp, sipping at it slowly to avoid a brain freeze. She thought he\u2019d take them back to Leigh and Lucian\u2019s, but when he stopped the car some time later it was at a farmhouse. It looked new, built during the last ten years by her guess, a large, red brick house with a couple of outbuildings, including a stable and paddock with half a dozen horses in it.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place,\u201d he said and got out of the car, leaving her to follow.</p><p>Valerie stared after him, unsure what to do. She was no longer certain she could trust him. She had no doubt he could explain, but that was because he was probably involved in whatever had happened to make the other women forget.</p><p>Should she be worried? Her gaze traveled over the man in front of the car as she tried to work out if he could be a threat to her or not. Valerie wanted to think no, but she had so many questions that had not yet been answered. What was this enforcement team Anders, Bricker, and Lucian worked on? Why had she been treated in a private home rather than in a hospital? They\u2019d said to keep her safe because their kidnapper had escaped, but surely a police guard would have kept her safe? And besides, if it was so dangerous, why had Anders suggested coming out to pick up the pills? Why hadn\u2019t Leigh protested? Hell, not only had she not protested, but she\u2019d requested they make an additional stop.</p><p>So, Valerie thought unhappily, was she in danger or not? And if she wasn\u2019t, why was she the only one at Leigh and Lucian\u2019s house? And the only one who still retained her memory? Well, if she was the only one. It was possible Laura and Kathy still retained theirs, but she suspected they didn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie stared at Anders as her mind twisted itself in loops trying to sort things out, but in the end she had to acknowledge that the only way to get any answers was to let Anders explain. And the only way to do that was to have enough trust in the man to get out of this vehicle and ask him the questions. That shouldn\u2019t be so hard. She\u2019d been naked, with this man inside her body, just hours ago. She had trusted him with her body, surely she could trust him with her well-being, for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Anders sipped at the last of his iced cappuccino while he waited for Valerie to decide if she trusted him enough to get out or not. Whether she did or not was important. He needed her trust, and knew that right now it was a bit shaken. But Anders needed to know just how shaken . . . and if he could regain it.</p><p>Sighing, he pushed away from the truck and moved the ten feet to the paddock fence he\u2019d parked in front of.</p> <p>The day had started so well and with such promise. He\u2019d thought he had more time, but Valerie\u2019s encounter with Billie was forcing his hand. Well, her encounter with both Billie and Cindy. His mouth tightened as he thought of Cindy. He had suspected something had happened when Valerie had come out of the clinic. She\u2019d seemed . . . off. Different. He couldn\u2019t have guessed, though, that one of her cage mates from the house had been inside the clinic. What were the chances?</p><p>The sound of the SUV door opening reached his ears and Anders sighed with relief. She still trusted him a bit, now he just had to hope it was enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you live on a farm,\u201d Valerie said quietly as she reached the fence and leaned against it next to him.</p><p>\u201cMost people are,\u201d he acknowledged with a faint smile. \u201cFor some reason everyone seems to expect me to have a condo in the city or something.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cI can see that. It\u2019s because you\u2019re so sleek and sexy.\u201d</p> <p>Anders blinked and glanced to her sharply. \u201cSleek and sexy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you didn\u2019t know?\u201d she asked with amusement. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first gal who threw herself at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t throw yourself at me,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Valerie murmured.</p><p>Anders watched a small smile claim her lips and then just as quickly fade.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they remember what happened to us?\u201d</p> <p>Straight to the point, he thought wryly and said, \u201cA couple of the women were traumatized badly by their time in that house. Lucian thought it was in their best interests to remove those experiences from their memory and allow them to live a normal life without those experiences haunting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they were willing to let that happen?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t asked for permission,\u201d Anders admitted reluctantly. He just knew that wouldn\u2019t go over well and wasn\u2019t surprised when her voice turned cold and hard.</p><p>\u201cSo, he just stole the memories without asking them if it was all right?\u201d</p><p>Sighing wearily, he turned to face her and asked, \u201cDo you really think they would have wanted to hold on to those memories? Do you enjoy the nightmares they give you?\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned and turned away, her face flushing.</p><p>Anders presumed she hadn\u2019t thought he knew about those, but he\u2019d held her in his arms through them just that morning in her room.</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t they take my memories?\u201d she asked sounding tired.</p> <p>\u201cThey could, if you want them to,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Valerie hesitated, biting her lip, and then asked, \u201cWhat do they do? Hypnosis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s more in-depth than that. They\u2019d have to wipe out your memory of what happened in that house . . . and everything since,\u201d he added solemnly.</p><p>\u201cEverything since?\u201d she asked, turning on him with amazement.</p><p>Anders nodded. \u201cEverything. Leigh, Lucian, their house . . . me. They\u2019d put new memories in their place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Valerie asked. \u201cI mean, sure, remove the memories of Igor and the house of horror, but why you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause remembering us might lead to your reclaiming the other memories,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAfter all, you were brought to the house to heal and recover from the injuries you got there. And we hunt people like Igor and his boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She was silent, working it out in her head. Valerie was a clever woman, he wasn\u2019t surprised when she said, \u201cSo would that mean you and I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t see each other again,\u201d he said what he was pretty sure she wanted to ask, but just couldn\u2019t. \u201cSeeing me might bring back the other memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut seeing me didn\u2019t bring back Cindy and Billie\u2019s memories,\u201d she protested. \u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCindy and Billie never saw you,\u201d he interrupted gently. \u201cFrom what I understand, none of you saw each other except as shadows and silhouettes in that dark basement. And, fortunately, your voice is normal so unlikely to spark a memory for them.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cNormal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it isn\u2019t unusually high like Billie\u2019s, or sharp and measured like Cindy\u2019s. It isn\u2019t unusual enough to be memorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Valerie said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lovely voice,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cJust not a memorable one,\u201d she said and before he could assure her that it was most memorable to him, Valerie continued, \u201cSo, Lucian called in the quacks to wipe the memories of the other women and then set them back in their lives. What happened to those supposed worries about the guy who kidnapped us? I thought that was why I was at Leigh and Lucian\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really expect further trouble from the rogue who kidnapped you and the other women. If he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s moved on rather than risk our catching up with him,\u201d Anders admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen why am I at Leigh and Lucian\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re there to heal,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d Valerie nodded. \u201cOf course you couldn\u2019t place me back in my old life minus the memories. The wound I gained in the house of horrors might spark my memory.\u201d</p><p>Actually, they could. They simply would have had to give her memories of an accident to explain them, but she didn\u2019t give Anders the chance to say as much.</p><p>\u201cSo I suppose they are waiting until I heal and then they\u2019ll wipe my memory and place me back in my life. I\u2019ll forget every moment of my time since being kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>She was scowling and obviously angry, but he didn\u2019t understand why until she added, \u201cAnd all of this . . . whatever this is that\u2019s going on between us won\u2019t even have happened in my mind?\u201d Valerie turned on him and accused, \u201cSo this is all just a short-term bang for you? No emotional entanglement, no clingy woman demanding to know what she means to you or expecting a relationship?\u201d</p><p>Anders\u2019s eyes widened as he realized where her thoughts were going, but again she didn\u2019t give him the chance to respond, and barked, \u201cNice. How many women have you enjoyed such short-term affairs with? How many women have there been? Is half the female population of the GTA running around without a clue that they had mind-blowing sex with a hot hunk who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anders shut her up by kissing her. It was the easiest way. Besides, he liked kissing her, and he really didn\u2019t want to hear any more accusations of his having bedded half the Greater Toronto Area, or GTA, as it was called by locals. Especially when it had been centuries since he\u2019d had sex before her. Ironically, he supposed it was fitting that his last name was taken from a monk.</p><p>The moment Valerie stopped fighting and kissed him back, Anders broke the kiss. He had to. Much more kissing and they\u2019d be rolling around naked on the ground rather than talking, and right now, talking was more important.</p><p>Releasing her slowly, he set her a step away and waited for the dazed look to fade from her face. But the moment it did and he saw her memory and anger returning, he said, \u201cI do not make a practice of making love to injured victims of the rogues we hunt. I have not bedded any other women in the GTA. In fact, it has been a very, very long time since I have been intimate with anyone. You are special, and I will explain just how special and answer all your other questions if you will give me the chance.\u201d</p><p>Much to his relief, Valerie relaxed slowly and then nodded her head. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, letting out a slow breath, and then taking her arm, he led her toward the house. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll show you my home and then we\u2019ll sit down and talk.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced around the cozy room, noting the bright yellow walls and warm wood cupboards. It was as surprising to her as the rest of the house. While Anders\u2019s wardrobe seemed to consist of nothing but cold, lifeless black, his home was a plethora of color. The living room had been cream with red accents, his dining room had been burnt umber, his bedroom a vibrant maroon and gold. The guest bedrooms and bathrooms had all been bright blues, greens, and aquas. If his home revealed his personality, there was a lot of depth and passion to the often silent and almost stern man. But then she\u2019d already tasted that passion and knew it existed. There was nothing cold about this man.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d Anders asked, moving to the refrigerator, only to pause without opening it. When he turned back with a frown, she raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 No,\u201d he said with a grimace. \u201cI just remembered that I don\u2019t have anything here for you to drink.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cI suppose you didn\u2019t bother with groceries since you were staying at Leigh and Lucian\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Anders glanced around before offering, \u201cWould you like some water?\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled faintly. \u201cSure. Water is fine.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he moved toward the sink and then paused and turned slowly, his gaze sliding over the cupboards as if trying to recall where the glasses might be. After a moment, he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d and headed for the kitchen\u2019s back door.</p><p>Valerie watched with amazement as he walked out of the house. Moving to the window over the sink, she watched him cross the yard and head for what looked like a guest house partially hidden by trees on the opposite side from the stables and paddock. Frowning, she waited until he disappeared from sight, then turned and surveyed the kitchen. The counters were spic-and-span, with nothing to clutter their sparkling granite surface, and the refrigerator and stove looked brand new, without a speck of grease or food drippings on them. It certainly didn\u2019t look like the average bachelor pad.</p><p>Reaching for the nearest cupboard, Valerie opened it and then froze. It was completely empty. She let it swing closed and moved to the next cupboard and then the next before starting on the drawers and lower cupboards. Every single one was completely and utterly empty. There wasn\u2019t a dish, cup, glass, pot or pan, or even a can or box of food in the cupboards.</p><p>Her gaze swung to the refrigerator and Valerie crossed to it and pulled it open, fully expecting to find the same situation there. Instead, she found the shelves lined with row after row of neatly stacked bags of blood.</p><p>The sound of the back door opening had her quickly slamming the door closed and whirling as Anders froze just inside the kitchen door, two steaming cups in hand. Neither of them moved or spoke for a moment, and then Anders said quietly, \u201cI can explain. Please trust me enough to let me.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stared, his words running through her mind. Please trust me enough to let me. It felt like an awful lot for him to ask when her heart was pounding like a mad thing in her chest and her mind was a riot of confusion and fear. The empty cupboards had confused her, but the sight of all that blood in the fridge had shaken her up. For some reason it made her think of the house of horrors, though she hadn\u2019t seen any bagged blood there. And there could be at least a dozen perfectly reasonable explanations for him to have bagged blood in his fridge. At least, that\u2019s what she wanted to believe. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t think of even one at the moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Anders repeated, and then held up the cups he carried. \u201cI have coffee.\u201d</p><p>A short bark of laughter escaped her and Valerie slapped her hand over her mouth. It might just be her, but it had sounded almost hysterical to her ears. Taking a deep breath, she nodded and moved silently to the kitchen table. It was a counter height table with barstool-type chairs. Valerie settled in one and then glanced to Anders.</p><p>There was no doubting his relief at her decision. Anders\u2019s shoulders actually sagged under the weight of it as he moved to set the cups down on the table and sat down across from her.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, pushing one of the cups toward her. \u201cMy caretaker had a fresh pot of coffee on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Valerie accepted the cup, and even wrapped her cold hands around it, but didn\u2019t drink any.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Anders repeated, and then sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry at the beginning,\u201d she suggested and for some reason that brought a short laugh from him.</p> <p>\u201cThe beginning. Right,\u201d he said dryly, and then straightened his shoulders. \u201cOkay, but you have to let me finish all my explanations before you freak out and run. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. That was one hell of an encouraging way to start.</p><p>\u201cValerie, I promise I won\u2019t hurt you. I would never hurt you,\u201d he added solemnly. \u201cBut what I\u2019m about to tell you might seem surreal, or crazy, or even scary. So, just promise me that you\u2019ll let me finish explaining everything before you react and you\u2019ll sit right there in that chair until I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t immediately agree. She did take a moment to consider the promise, but really she was sitting there looking at a man who had not only found her and saved her from the house of horrors, but who had treated her with gentle respect ever since, and had given her so much pleasure she\u2019d actually fainted from it. He was a man she liked, enjoyed spending time with, in and out of bed, and who she really, even then, just wanted to climb like a telephone pole. All of that was enough to trump what she\u2019d found in his kitchen now that she\u2019d got over the first shock of it . . . which made it hard not to make that promise. Valerie just wanted him to explain everything away and make it all better so that she could get on with lusting after the man, which she was doing anyway.</p><p>\u201cI am truly pathetic,\u201d she said under her breath.</p> <p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d Anders said at once and she glanced at him with a start, amazed that he\u2019d heard her whispered words.</p><p>Shaking her head, she waved her hand. \u201cI promise. Go on. Explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Anders nodded and then paused, and stared at the dark wood tabletop briefly before shaking his head and saying, \u201cOkay, I guess I can start with what I told you about my family this morning. My father being killed, my mother raising me to twelve and so on.\u201d</p><p>Valerie raised an eyebrow, half suspecting that he was going to tell her those were all lies.</p><p>\u201cIt was all true,\u201d he assured her. \u201cBut I left out a couple of pertinent details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat details?\u201d she asked warily.</p> <p>Anders struggled briefly, and then admitted, \u201cThat it all took place in the fourteenth century. I was born in 1357.\u201d</p><p>Valerie blinked as her brain tried to accept what he\u2019d said, and then she stood abruptly.</p><p>Anders immediately caught her hand. \u201cYou promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, and I would keep my promise if you\u2019d care to tell the truth, but you can\u2019t expect me to sit here and listen to some nonsense about\u2014\u201d Her voice died abruptly when he opened his mouth and his canines suddenly slid forward and down forming two very long, pointy fangs.</p><p>Valerie sat, not because she wanted to, but because her legs suddenly gave out on her. Memories were suddenly flashing through her head; cruel laughter, flashing fangs, excruciating pain . . .</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Anders said grimly, rubbing his thumb over her wrist and Valerie realized she was starting to hyperventilate. Trying to drive off the panic gripping her, she forced herself to take several slow deep, steady breaths. Once the threat of hyperventilating passed, she became aware that he was talking in a calm, soothing voice.</p><p>\u201cYou are safe with me. You saw the bagged blood in the refrigerator. I will never hurt you. I am not like the man who kidnapped you. He\u2019s a rogue. Lucian, myself, and the others hunt his kind. I would never hurt you. You are safe with me.\u201d</p><p>Valerie suspected he\u2019d said those things more than once, repeating them like a mantra until she\u2019d calmed enough to hear and accept them. And she did find herself accepting them. He had no need to bite and hurt her, there was a fridge full of blood behind her. Besides, if he\u2019d wanted to hurt her, he could have done that a gazillion times over since she\u2019d woken up in Leigh\u2019s house.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did the blood come from?\u201d she asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cA blood bank.\u201d His answer came swift and without hesitation. She suspected it was true.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a vampire and so was my kidnapper, but you\u2019re a good vampire who hunts bad vampires, and he\u2019s one of the bad vampires you hunt?\u201d Valerie asked, trying to wrap her brain around the situation. It did sound surreal, she thought grimly. Cripes, was she really going to now believe in vampires just because Anders flashed some fang? They could be as fake as she\u2019d assured herself her kidnapper\u2019s were. Of course, she hadn\u2019t really believed they were fake. It had just been reassuring to think so. It had helped her not feel so crazy.</p><p>\u201cWe prefer the term immortals to vampire,\u201d Anders said with a wince. \u201cBut essentially, yes, that\u2019s the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this enforcement team Leigh mentioned\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA collection of immortals who enforce our laws and hunt down rogue immortals who break them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnforce your laws,\u201d Valerie muttered, rather startled to think vampires would have laws. She didn\u2019t know why. It just seemed weird. But then a thought struck her and she glanced at him sharply. \u201cLeigh isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t born immortal, but she is immortal now,\u201d Anders answered the unfinished question.</p><p>Valerie stared at him blankly. Sweet, very pregnant and girl-next-door Leigh was a vampire . . . but she hadn\u2019t been. Frowning, she asked, \u201cHow did she become a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was attacked and turned by a rogue. A different one than yours,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cLucian rescued her when he and some of our other men raided the nest where she was being held.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d Valerie protested. \u201cVampires can\u2019t have babies, can they? Was she pregnant when she was attacked? So will she be pregnant forever? And are she and Lucian really a couple, or was that all just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeigh was turned several years ago now,\u201d Anders interrupted. \u201cShe was not pregnant at the time. Yes, our women can get pregnant. Her baby is Lucian\u2019s, and yes they are definitely a couple. They are life mates.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stilled. He\u2019d used that term before when talking about his parents. She\u2019d thought it was just a quaint way of saying life partners, or soul mates or something. But vampires didn\u2019t have souls. \u201cWhat is a life mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA life mate is . . .\u201d He paused and then sighed and shook his head. \u201cThey are the most valued treasure one of our kind can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? How?\u201d she asked at once.</p><p>\u201cTo understand that, I need to explain some other things first,\u201d Anders said quietly.</p><p>Realizing he was asking permission, Valerie nodded.</p><p>Anders said, \u201cWe are as human as you are.\u201d</p><p>A snort slid from her before she could stop it and Valerie covered her nose and mouth, and then muttered, \u201cSorry. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Anders was frowning, but after a moment explained, \u201cWe have the same ancestors as non-immortals. As yourself. However, ours were somewhat isolated for many centuries and developed much more quickly, technologically, than the rest of the planet.\u201d He paused to take a sip of coffee, probably as much to let her digest what he\u2019d said as because he was thirsty, and then continued, \u201cThey developed bio-engineered nanos that could be injected into the body to repair damage and fight infection and illness. These nanos had the added benefit of greatly extending our lives.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyes widened. She\u2019d read an article recently on research being done to use nanos to fight cancer. He was suggesting his ancestors had come up with them long ago. She supposed it wasn\u2019t completely impossible, but he was saying they didn\u2019t just fight cancer. He\u2019d said they repair damage and fight infection and illness. That covered a rather broad spectrum, which she supposed was possible.</p><p>\u201cExtending your lives for how long?\u201d she asked. \u201cSurely you weren\u2019t really born in 1357?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. I haven\u2019t, and won\u2019t lie to you, Valerie,\u201d Anders said solemnly, and then said, \u201cAs for how long our lives are extended for . . .\u201d He shrugged helplessly. \u201cNo one knows. Barring an accident that results in beheading or burning up the immortal in question, I suppose we might live indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndefinitely,\u201d she echoed weakly. That was a bit harder to accept. The fountain of youth was a nano?</p><p>Anders remained silent and simply sipped at his coffee as she digested that. He waited until Valerie sighed and said, \u201cGo on,\u201d before continuing.</p><p>\u201cThese nanos were a miraculous development. But they had one drawback\u2014well, two, I suppose, since our elders at the time didn\u2019t think that near immortality was necessarily a good thing,\u201d Anders said dryly. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cThe other flaw was that the nanos used their host\u2019s blood to perform their work and as a propellant or energy source. Unfortunately, they use more blood than a human body can produce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your scientists gave you fangs and turned you all into vampires?\u201d Valerie asked with disbelief.</p><p>Anders shook his head. \u201cNo. Our scientists gave us blood transfusions. The fangs didn\u2019t develop until after the fall of Atlantis. Then the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtlantis?\u201d she squawked with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019ve heard of it?\u201d he said, his tone dry.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, of course. But Atlantis was mythical and existed like a gazillion years ago,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cA gazillion is a bit of an exaggeration, but it was thousands of years ago. However, it wasn\u2019t mythical,\u201d Anders assured her.</p><p>Valerie frowned, but after a moment nodded. \u201cOkay. So you had blood transfusions in Atlantis, but it fell, and then your scientists developed fangs for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The nanos did,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThe scientists all died when Atlantis fell; only their guinea pigs, the patients who had been given the nanos, survived. None of them were from the scientific or medical field, so they had no way to get their transfusions anymore. They crawled out of the ruins of Atlantis to join a world much less developed than Atlantis had been. Without the transfusions, many of them died, but in others, the nanos forced a sort of evolution that gave their hosts fangs to get the blood the nanos needed to continue their work and ensure their hosts\u2019 survival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFangs and what else?\u201d Valerie asked, remembering how scary-strong and fast her kidnapper and Igor had been. And the other women had been sure they could read their minds, she recalled.</p><p>\u201cFangs, strength, speed, better night vision . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnything that would make them better predators to get what they needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like mind reading?\u201d she asked tersely.</p><p>When Anders nodded, Valerie cursed and tried to stand again.</p><p>\u201cYou promised,\u201d he repeated, catching her hand so swiftly the movement of his own hand was just a blur to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I did. But I\u2019m not very comfortable knowing that you can read my thoughts, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Anders said firmly.</p><p>Valerie hesitated, and eyed him narrowly. \u201cYou just admitted that one of the abilities the nanos gave you was mind reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut I can\u2019t read your mind.\u201d</p><p>She frowned now. \u201cWhy? Does that skill skip a generation or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anders said with a faint smile. \u201cI can read most mortals and even most immortals younger than myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThan why wouldn\u2019t you be able to read me?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>Anders swallowed and then said, \u201cBecause you are my life mate.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stared at him blankly as that word struck her again. His parents had been life mates. Leigh was Lucian\u2019s life mate . . . and she was his? \u201cWhat is a life mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would care to sit down, I\u2019ll explain,\u201d Anders said quietly.</p><p>Valerie sat down. She could hardly do anything else. She had to know what a life mate was. She suspected it was important. Vital, even. She just didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cMind reading is one of the skills that evolved through the nanos. Immortals can read most immortals younger than them, and occasionally even immortals older than themselves. But they can read all mortals unless they are mentally ill or suffering some sort of ailment like a tumor that might block the part of the brain where thoughts are processed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d Valerie denied, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>\u201cThen I have a tumor?\u201d she asked with horror. The news was devastating. Dear God, she was only thirty. Too young to\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Anders repeated, capturing her hands and chafing them between both of his. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a tumor, Valerie. That\u2019s not why I can\u2019t read you. Leigh, Lucian, and\u2014hell, everyone who has encountered you\u2014has been able to read your thoughts like a book. You are not ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Valerie let her breath out on a sigh and then frowned. Really it wasn\u2019t that good. While she was glad she wasn\u2019t ill, it was rather disturbing to think every one she\u2019d met since waking in Leigh and Lucian\u2019s house had been able to read her mind. Pushing that worry away for now, she asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you read my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re my\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLife mate,\u201d she finished for him, recalling his saying that earlier.</p><p>\u201cYes. And a life mate is that one person, mortal or immortal, that an immortal can neither read nor control, and who cannot read or control them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes them a life mate?\u201d Valerie asked uncertainly.</p><p>Anders nodded. \u201cIt is a special gift to us. With the rest of the world we have to constantly guard our minds to prevent our thoughts from being read, which can be exhausting. It\u2019s that, or restrict ourselves to a solitary existence.\u201d He paused and then said, \u201cBut with a life mate we don\u2019t have to do that. We can let our guards down around them, and just enjoy the company of another without fear that they\u2019ll read our thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m that for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Anders assured her as if it was a good thing.</p><p>Valerie frowned. Being a peaceful haven didn\u2019t sound all that sexy or exciting. And she simply didn\u2019t see how the passion that exploded between them every time they touched or kissed could be peaceful. He did experience that passion too, didn\u2019t he? She thought he did, and then there was\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re life mates.\u201d</p><p>Anders stiffened. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Valerie shook her head, actually sorry to have to disillusion him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but when we were . . . er . . . earlier in my room when I . . . er . . . touched you,\u201d she grimaced, but continued, \u201cI think I actually might have read your mind or something. When I touched you it sent a jolt of physical pleasure through me that, well, it must have been yours that I was picking up on and reading. I mean while I enjoy and want to touch you, I shouldn\u2019t actually experience the excitement you do.\u201d</p><p>Much to her surprise, rather than look devastated, Anders relaxed, a slow smile crossing his face. \u201cThat\u2019s called shared pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d she asked dubiously.</p> <p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a sign of life mates. When they mate, they share and experience each other\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie said faintly. Life mates. The words echoed in her head.</p><p>\u201cThat shared pleasure is something that you will not experience with anyone who is not a life mate,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd it is . . . rather overwhelming. It\u2019s the reason we both lost consciousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fainted too?\u201d Valerie asked with surprise. She\u2019d just assumed that she alone had fainted. He always seemed awake and fine when she woke up.</p><p>Anders nodded, \u201cYes. I lost consciousness both times as well. But I woke up before you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Valerie fell silent. She was sorting through everything she\u2019d learned, trying to think what to ask. She knew there were things that hadn\u2019t been covered and that she would wonder about later. For instance\u2014\u201cSo, you aren\u2019t dead?\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cNo. Just old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she muttered, shaking her head. He was born in 1357? The man was ancient. But he looked damned good for ancient, and he wasn\u2019t dead, so he presumably still had a soul. An old one, but a soul just the same. Valerie hadn\u2019t been to church since her parents had been taken from her, but was still glad she wasn\u2019t pissing off the big guy by getting tangled up with some soulless bloodsucker. Surely a bloodsucker with a soul was better than a bloodsucker without one, right?</p> <p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t bite us mortals to get the blood you need?\u201d she asked, eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. We are restricted to bagged blood now,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore?\u201d Valerie asked, managing not to wince. \u201cBut you did at one time?\u201d</p><p>Anders shrugged apologetically. \u201cBlood banks have only been around since the twentieth century. Before that, we were all forced to feed off the hoof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff the hoof?\u201d she echoed with disbelief. \u201cSeriously? You call it that?\u201d</p><p>He raised his hands in a helpless gesture. \u201cI didn\u2019t make up the term. We just all used it.\u201d</p><p>Valerie rolled her eyes and shook her head. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Anders said solemnly. \u201cI will try to remember not to use the term in front of you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she muttered, only slightly mollified. Off the hoof? Like they were cows or something, which she supposed they were to his kind. The idea was a bit lowering. Valerie stared at him silently for a moment and then asked what she really wanted to know. \u201cWhat does my being your life mate mean exactly?\u201d</p><p>Anders stared at her blankly, and then said, \u201cI told you, a life mate is a rare and precious treasure. They are someone an immortal can live with happily and in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d Valerie hesitated, a bit frustrated in her effort to verbalize what she wanted to know. Finally, she just asked, \u201cWhat do you want from me, Anders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said simply, and reached out to take her hands gently in his. \u201cI realize that your experiences in that house were horrible and traumatizing, and most likely turned you against my kind, Valerie. But I would remind you there are evil and bad mortals as well. All immortals are not like the one who attacked and took you from the street that night, then kept you in a cage to feed on.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stared at him silently, memories of the house running through her head. They were quickly followed by the memories she\u2019d made with this man. The drive to Cambridge and back, the pool, their walk, the shared meals, cooking together, the overwhelming passion, waking up cradled in his arms . . . Oddly enough, the horror and trauma from the house had paled somewhat next to the vibrancy of the memories she\u2019d started to make with Anders. They were like sepia photos next to new, modern, color ones.</p><p>Anders continued, \u201cAnd I also know that as a mortal you are more used to a long and slow courtship before making such an important decision. But for my kind it is different. A life mate is a gift to us and knowing we cannot read or control them, that we share pleasure, and that our other appetites are returning is enough in our minds to tell us that this is the one we are meant to be with. That this is the one who suits us in all ways. So, what I want is to spend the rest of my very long life with you at my side and in my bed. And if you agree to that, I promise I will never hurt or bring harm to you. I would sooner hurt myself.\u201d He squeezed her fingers gently. \u201cI would give my life for you, Valerie. Because having experienced the vibrancy and tasted the spice of life with you, returning to the dull, cold existence I had before you is unbearable to even consider.\u201d</p><p>Anders stared solemnly into her wide eyes as he said that, and then released her hands and sat back, adding, \u201cHowever, I know you may need more time to make up your mind about whether you are willing to be my life mate. And that is the real reason you were moved to Leigh and Lucian\u2019s home, to give you the chance to get to know me, to see if you could accept being my life mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I can\u2019t?\u201d Valerie asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThen your memories will be erased like the other women and you too, will be returned to your life to live it out as you choose without your experiences to haunt you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stared at him. In that moment, she didn\u2019t know what she wanted. Or perhaps she did, but was afraid to admit it. She wanted this man. All she had to do was look at him and she began to salivate like one of Pavlov\u2019s dogs. Even right then she wanted to jump up, rip his clothes off and experience some more of that mind-blowing shared pleasure that made her faint. Seriously, she was like a druggie jonesing for a fix, in that regard. So the lust factor was there. But she also liked him.</p><p>So far, Anders had proven himself thoughtful and considerate and a man who paid attention to details. He\u2019d set his alarm to get up just hours after retiring to turn off the alarm so that she could let Roxy out. When she had commented on needing doggie bags, he\u2019d gone out and got them for her without being asked. He was always fetching her coffee, or refilling her glass at meals . . . He listened to what she said and was attentive to her needs. To Roxy\u2019s needs as well. And at mealtimes, he didn\u2019t sit around expecting to be waited on, like her ex, Larry, had, either, but pitched in to help cook and set the table, etc.</p><p>Aside from that, he was intelligent, and seemed to have a good sense of humor. She had noticed he didn\u2019t talk much in the presence of others, but he could say more with a quirk of an eyebrow and a twist of the lips than Bricker could say in an hour of jokes and babbling, and from what she could tell, his opinions and beliefs seemed to line up with her own. While chatting with Dani, Decker, Leigh, and Lucian the other night, she\u2019d often found herself nodding at something one of the others said and glanced to him to see him nodding as well. And more than once she\u2019d heard her own words coming from his mouth, opinions she\u2019d stated in the past to others, verbalized succinctly by him.</p><p>All of that was enough to tempt her to throw caution to the wind, jump in with both feet and agree to be his life mate. However, one simply didn\u2019t jump into something like this. From what she could tell, agreeing to be his life mate was tantamount to agreeing to marry the man, and no one would consider making such an important decision after knowing someone less than a handful of days. They got to know the other person, learned how they handled day-to-day life, how they reacted in a crisis, if they were moody and hard to live with, or easygoing and dealt with life head-on. It was the smart thing to do.</p><p>Anders had said she had time, Valerie reminded herself. She suspected it wasn\u2019t a lot of time, but she would take what she could get and try to be more rational about all of this than her instincts were urging her to be. If for no other reason than because she suspected that what he\u2019d told her hadn\u2019t all sunk in yet. Otherwise, Valerie suspected she wouldn\u2019t be so calm. The man was telling her that vampires existed, or immortals did, as he called them. Atlantis and souls aside, they had fangs and sucked blood and that was a vampire. And according to him, Igor\u2019s boss, and probably Igor himself, had been a vampire, as the others had suggested in whispers in that dark basement. He\u2019d also told her that he was one too, though a good one, and that he wanted to spend his long life with her . . .</p><p>But there had been no mention of love. Not that there should be, she thought quickly. They hadn\u2019t known each other long enough to love each other. Still, when one was talking about forever, love was a word usually included. So did she wish he\u2019d mentioned love or not?</p><p>Sighing, Valerie rubbed her face, trying to clear her thoughts. They were a bit confused at the moment, but other than that . . . well, she suspected she shouldn\u2019t be as calm as she felt right now. But rather than being terrified, she was wondering if his giving her time to make up her mind meant no more of that wondrous passion they\u2019d shared so far, because, damn, she could use some of it right now. In fact, she wanted to drown in it again, and suspected part of that was a desire not to have to think about everything right now.</p><p>Reaching out, Valerie took one of his hands in hers and ran her fingers gently over it, then raised it to her mouth and kissed first the back of his hand and then his palm. She slid her tongue out and ran it between his first two fingers, barely repressing a smile when a shiver of pleasure drifted through her. This time he didn\u2019t stop her, but remained completely still. There was no need to prevent her experiencing the shared pleasure.</p><p>Standing, Valerie walked around the table to stand beside him. Anders immediately tipped his head back to watch her and she raised her free hand to run her fingers lightly down his throat, then bent to press her lips to his. That\u2019s when his stillness ended. Fingers tightening around hers, Anders turned in his seat and drew her forward between his legs as he began to kiss her back.</p><p>Valerie sighed into his mouth, and caressed his chest. When he reached for her, this time it was Valerie who caught his hands and stopped him.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d she muttered against his mouth and pushed him away. She\u2019d got a brief taste of this \u201cexperiencing the other\u2019s pleasure business\u201d earlier that morning, but she wanted to experience it properly, without his stopping her.</p><p>The tall chairs put Anders at just the right height that Valerie could slip her hands beneath his T-shirt and push it up to bare the taut flesh beneath. Little tremors of pleasure shot through her as she caressed him, squeezing his pecs before running over his belly. But when Valerie then let one hand drop to cup him through his jeans, she nearly cried out at the shock of pleasure that shot through her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn. He liked that, she guessed, and continued to caress him through the heavy cloth, feeling both his pleasure as well as the way he hardened beneath her touch. The combination was like a road map, telling her exactly where and how to caress him, and how much pressure to apply. It made her the perfect lover, she realized, and made him the perfect lover too.</p><p>Soon, touching him through his clothes wasn\u2019t enough, and Valerie turned her attention to quickly undoing his belt and the button of his jeans. The zipper was next. It slid down easily, allowing her to slide her hand inside both his jeans and his boxers and find that hot hardness to caress.</p><p>Her first touch made them both gasp as his body reacted. Valerie felt his stomach ripple with pleasure, but her own stomach was doing the same, jumping under the skin with excitement.</p> <p>\u201cValerie.\u201d Anders\u2019s voice was a rasp of sound.</p><p>Her response was to drop to her knees and take him into her mouth. She damned near bit into him with shock at the roar of sensation that was sent rushing through her body, but caught herself at the last moment.</p><p>Wow, this shared pleasure rocked, Valerie thought as she slid her tongue around his tip and began to move her mouth along his shaft. Anders\u2019s pleasure was her pleasure as she worked, excitement rolling over her in waves and centering at her core where it turned liquid. She was so caught up in what she was doing and the sensations it was causing that Valerie was taken completely by surprise when Anders suddenly caught her under the arms and lifted her up.</p><p>She actually growled with frustration at being forced to stop, but then Anders covered her mouth with his and began to tear at her clothes. He wasn\u2019t doing so carefully either. Valerie heard cloth tearing, but didn\u2019t care. She simply helped him strip herself and then him, though he only allowed her to lift his T-shirt off over his head. When she reached for his jeans, he pushed her hands away, shoved them off his hips, raised her onto the table and stepped between her legs.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Anders growled against her mouth as he slid home. He paused then and glanced briefly around.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped, digging her fingers into his behind to urge him to move.</p><p>Anders shook his head, and then lifted her off the table and lowered them both to the floor.</p><p>Valerie felt the cold tile press into her back and almost protested, but then recalled the fainting that would follow the pleasure. The floor was probably better, she acknowledged and then didn\u2019t care as he began to move.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Valerie frowned at the empty cupboard she\u2019d just opened in search of a water glass, and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have any dishes or food here? You eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating is a very recent occurrence for me,\u201d Anders said quietly as he tugged his T-shirt on over his head. \u201cI ate for the first hundred years or two, but food lost its interest after that. As did sex and many other things. Your arrival in my life has reawakened those old appetites though,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThat, by the way, is another sign of a life mate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her mind tried to consider the fact that she was his life mate, but Valerie wasn\u2019t ready for that yet and pushed it away. Closing the door, she turned to face him and commented, \u201cI suppose that explains how you\u2019ve never had a Tim Hortons iced capp then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled faintly. \u201cThey\u2019re very good. Everything I\u2019ve tasted so far has been good.\u201d</p><p>Valerie eyed him silently. He was rubbing his stomach and licking his lips. She suspected they were both subconscious actions he wasn\u2019t aware of, but it made her ask a little nervously, \u201cWhen did you last have blood?\u201d</p><p>Anders blinked, but answered, \u201cThis morning. I\u2019m good for a while. I am hungry for food though. We never did stop for brunch.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyebrows flew up. Her stomach had been gnawing at her since leaving the bookstore. She\u2019d assumed it was just a symptom of her anxiety and fear, but most of her fear had dissipated now, yet the gnawing remained. Hunger, she realized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have many questions,\u201d Anders said quietly, almost stiltedly. \u201cBut do you feel safe enough with me to go have that brunch we planned on, and then hit the grocery store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d she asked with disbelief.</p><p>He looked uncertain. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGeez,\u201d Valerie muttered and pointed out, \u201cI just woke up from passing out after jumping your bones. I think you can take it that I feel pretty safe around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Anders grinned, but then said, \u201cWell, one doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the other. The shared pleasure is pretty addictive. You might not have been able to help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your superior lovemaking skills?\u201d she teased, remembering his words from earlier that morning in her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said and walked over to pull her against his chest with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Valerie said, ducking the kiss he tried to grace her with. \u201cThat leads right back to getting naked which is awesome, but I need food. My stomach is killing me.\u201d</p><p>Concern crossed Anders\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have realized. Come. We\u2019ll leave right away.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled crookedly as he urged her toward the door. She liked his caring and concern. She could get used to it, she thought as they walked out to the SUV and got in.</p><p>They stopped at literally the first restaurant they saw. It was a little diner in the middle of nowhere with bench seats and a surly waitress, but the food was actually amazing. Valerie and Anders chatted amiably as they ate, but stayed away from the topic of her kidnapping, and his origins entirely. She was glad they did. It allowed her to pretend they were just a normal couple out for brunch . . . well, a very late brunch, she supposed since it was after one in the afternoon.</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk about anything immortal related until they were walking back out to the SUV and then it was Valerie who brought up the subject, asking, \u201cSo, I take it that whole business about crosses and sunlight hurting vampires is bogus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrosses have no effect at all and we can go into churches,\u201d he assured her. \u201cBut sunlight is something we generally try to avoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked with a frown, her gaze sliding up to the sunny sky they were walking under and then to his bare arms. \u201cDoes it hurt when the sunlight touches your skin or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If it did I wouldn\u2019t be walking in it right now. \u201cBut sunlight does damage to the human body, both mine and yours. The difference is that the nanos will repair the damage my skin takes, which means they need more blood. We quickly learned to avoid anything that does damage to reduce the amount of blood we need,\u201d Anders explained, walking her around to her side of the SUV. He saw her in, kissed her on the nose, closed the door and walked around to get in on his side, before adding, \u201cThe more blood needed, the more often one needs to feed, and the more risk of discovery. So we\u2019ve habitually avoided the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you use blood bank blood now so can go out in it again,\u201d she guessed as he started the engine.</p><p>\u201cTrue we can,\u201d Anders agreed as he pulled out of their parking space. \u201cBut we try to avoid putting too much unnecessary demand on the blood bank. Most of us don\u2019t spend much time in the sun. Walking to and from a car is one thing, but you won\u2019t catch an immortal sunbathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Leigh, and even you, were swimming in the pool in bright sunlight,\u201d Valerie recalled with a frown.</p><p>\u201cLucian had a special awning installed over it so that he and Leigh could swim during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat barely there awning?\u201d Valerie asked with a snort as she recalled the tinted glass awning over the pool.</p><p>\u201cIt may not look like much, but while it lets the light in, it blocks the damaging rays,\u201d Anders assured her.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked with interest.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMost immortals have their windows treated with a similar coating as well. In fact, the windows of this SUV are treated with it.\u201d Anders smiled at her. \u201cWe no longer need to live in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Valerie found herself examining the windows now. They looked like normal windows with a coating of that anti-glare stuff. Nice to know she was avoiding UVs though, she thought and then asked, \u201cSo do you all sleep during the day from habit then? I mean, I noticed that Leigh and Lucian tend to sleep late, and I\u2019m guessing you would too if you didn\u2019t have to be up with me.\u201d</p><p>Anders hesitated and then said, \u201cSome immortals keep bankers\u2019 hours. Those who have jobs where they need to deal with mortals have to work mortal hours. But they still avoid sunlight as much as possible with treated windows and underground parking and whatnot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the others?\u201d she asked. \u201cLike you. If you hunt bad vampires, you aren\u2019t dealing much with mortals.\u201d</p><p>Anders narrowed his eyes and tilted his head from side to side briefly. \u201cThat\u2019s not completely true. We do deal with mortals, yourself and the other women for instance. But we also have to question mortals when hunting a rogue. To try to find your kidnapper, we have Hunters out questioning people in the pet shops all over the Greater Toronto Area, asking about purchases of three or more large dog cages.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and said, \u201cSo you have to have workers who work during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there are more Enforcers on the night shift than the day shift,\u201d Anders said. \u201cMost rogues revert to the Stoker version of vampires, feeding off the hoof, stalking the night . . . Some even turn a large number of mortals to make themselves a small army of adoring underlings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d Valerie said dryly, and then asked, \u201cBut you prefer to work nights?\u201d</p><p>Anders shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much difference to me. I work when I\u2019m needed and I\u2019ve been needed a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019ve been short-handed,\u201d she murmured, recalling Bricker saying new recruits had arrived because their hunters had been dropping like flies. The memory made her nibble her lip worriedly. \u201cI suppose hunting these rogues is dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be,\u201d he said with a shrug as he turned off the engine. Then he smiled at her and undid his seat belt. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced out the window to see that they\u2019d arrived at a grocery store. \u201cDid Leigh send you a list of what she wanted besides bread and milk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot to check,\u201d Anders admitted and pulled out his phone. It was an iPhone, she saw, as he began to run his fingers over the face and punch icons. \u201cGeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Valerie asked, leaning toward him to try to see what had brought on the dismayed sound. Anders turned the phone toward her and she stared blankly at it, slow to realize she was looking at a text from Leigh. A text of a grocery list. A long grocery list, she realized, reaching out to run one finger over the screen so that she could find the bottom of it. Cripes, the woman had about fifty entries on it. She supposed Leigh\u2019s shopping had been a bit restricted what with Lucian acting so protective. He\u2019d probably refused to let her shop and merely picked up a few things himself here and there on his way home. Valerie had noticed that the cupboards and refrigerator didn\u2019t hold all that much.</p><p>Giving a soft laugh, she reached for the door. \u201cGuess we\u2019d better get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, I thought we\u2019d never get out of there,\u201d Anders muttered, opening the back of the SUV to begin transferring the grocery bags from their shopping cart.</p><p>Valerie grinned at his exasperation. \u201cIt was pretty bad, but I\u2019ve seen worse. You should see the stores at Christmastime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that wasn\u2019t the worst?\u201d he asked with disbelief, pulling bags from the cart and tossing them in the back of the SUV. \u201cThere seemed to be half a dozen shoppers in every aisle we went down, and each one seemed to delight in blocking the aisle with their carts. Does no one have the good sense to leave room for people to maneuver around them? And what the hell is Leigh going to do with all this food?\u201d</p><p>Valerie burst out laughing at his griping as she helped transfer the bags. Her amusement was mostly because she could sympathize. They had hit the late-afternoon crowd, which seemed to be made up of people who had nothing better to do than stand about chatting. It hadn\u2019t helped that neither of them had been familiar with this particular grocery store\u2019s setup and that Leigh hadn\u2019t listed her grocery items in order so that they\u2019d had to backtrack and crisscross the store several times to get all the items.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Anders muttered, looking chagrined. \u201cI\u2019m bitching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize on my account,\u201d she said with amusement. \u201cI wanted to smack that old lady with the blue hair and orange top. I think she deliberately blocked us every time we came across her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich was at least five times. I swear if we\u2019d had to go back to the dairy aisle one more time . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the thought, and Valerie grinned. They\u2019d had to visit the dairy aisle for milk, butter, cheese, liquid creamer, and eggs, and each item had been separated by meat, baked goods, canned goods, and veggies stuck between them. Leigh had listed the groceries by meals as she\u2019d come up with them. The list went eggs, bread, bacon, potatoes, butter, steak, tomatoes, and so on. Most inconvenient, especially since only five items showed on the small screen at a time and they had to go down the list item by item to be sure they didn\u2019t miss anything.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least it\u2019s done,\u201d Valerie pointed out with a smile. \u201cAnd we got to contribute so I don\u2019t have to feel bad about Leigh and Lucian putting us up.\u201d They\u2019d split the bill, each paying half. Valerie had wanted to pay for them herself, but Anders had been equally intent on paying, so in the end they\u2019d compromised and split the bill. She liked that he had compromised rather than be bullheaded and macho about footing the bill.</p><p>\u201cYou know, now that you know about us, there\u2019s really no reason that we have to stay at Leigh and Lucian\u2019s,\u201d Anders said quietly as he set the last bags in the truck. Turning to her, he added, \u201cLucian originally suggested that so that you could get to know me. My being your bodyguard and your not being able to go home were just his attempt to allow you that chance. But now that you know about us, we could stay at my place. You\u2019d get to know me better there without others around to distract us.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie didn\u2019t respond at first. She was kind of feeling a bit alarmed. He was suggesting she move in with him. Cripes, they hadn\u2019t even been on a date yet. Oh wait, maybe brunch would be considered a date. Still, it was only one.</p><p>On the other hand, staying at his place would have some benefits. For instance, they wouldn\u2019t have to be worried about being overwhelmed by that shared pleasure business and doing something as stupid as having sex and passing out on the living room couch where anyone might have come across them. Not that they\u2019d made love that time, she acknowledged. Though, they may as well have, and no doubt would in the future, which could lead to embarrassing situations.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide right now,\u201d Anders said, closing the SUV\u2019s door. \u201cJust think about it.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Valerie took the grocery cart in hand and started to steer it away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that back inside,\u201d Anders said moving up beside her. \u201cYou go ahead and get in the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go inside,\u201d Valerie said. \u201cIt just goes over here. You go ahead and get the engine started and the air conditioner going. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He glanced to the cart corral she\u2019d gestured to and frowned. She knew he wanted to protest, but hurried off without giving him the chance. Valerie could feel him watching her though and suspected he wouldn\u2019t get in the SUV until she returned. Smiling faintly at his courtly behavior, she reached the corral just as a tall platinum blond did with his own cart. Valerie slowed to allow him to put his cart away first. However, he stopped too and waved her toward the lined-up carts.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said with a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Valerie smiled back as she pushed forward again and nosed her cart into the end one. Turning back, she nodded at the man, offering another smile as she passed. She suspected they\u2019d passed him about a dozen times in the grocery store during their back and forth. He looked vaguely familiar, and his smile was almost flirty, which was something Anders had apparently noticed, if she were to judge by the scowl presently on his face. Goodness, Anders looked almost jealous, Valerie thought, her smile unintentionally widening as she passed the man, which made his smile widen appreciatively.</p><p>The whole thing made her feel pretty darned good and she walked straight back to Anders, grinned, and went up on her toes to kiss him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cSmile. Life is good,\u201d she said lightly before moving to the passenger door.</p> <p>\u201cCheeky,\u201d Anders muttered, opening it for her before she could.</p><p>Grinning, Valerie stepped up into her seat. She reached for her seat belt, and then gave a start when Anders leaned in, his face suddenly in front of hers.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a kiss,\u201d he informed her when she stared at him wide-eyed. \u201cThis is.\u201d</p><p>His mouth covered hers, his tongue moving out aggressively to urge her lips open. Valerie moaned as he stirred the passion that seemed to rest just below the surface in her now. All this man had to do was look at her and her body seemed to awaken and unfurl like a flower opening under the sun. Touching or kissing her, however, brought a tidal wave of heat and need and she instinctively reached for him, one hand raising to caress the back of his neck, the other moving to cup him between the legs.</p><p>Anders growled into her mouth, his excitement and need shooting through her body to mingle with her own. But then he tore his mouth from hers and stepped abruptly back, breaking all contact.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he said, his voice a husky rasp.</p><p>Valerie stared at him uncomprehending for a second, then glanced around and recalled that they were in a busy parking lot. Letting her breath out on a sigh, she sagged in her seat as he closed the door and then just sat there taking deep breaths and trying to regain some semblance of calm as he walked around and got in the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>Neither of them spoke on the ride home. Valerie was too busy trying to get control of herself. Her entire body was screaming with need, every nerve ending sensitized, and her mind clamoring, all for one thing . . . Anders.</p> <p>Dear God, she really was like a drug addict when it came to him, Valerie acknowledged with concern. She just couldn\u2019t get enough and it didn\u2019t matter where they were. While they\u2019d been in the brightly lit and thoroughly unromantic grocery store she\u2019d watched him, wishing he\u2019d kiss or touch her. His every glance, every brush of his hand or body against hers, even if unintentional, had stirred hunger in her. It was like a beast inside of her, barely asleep and rousing at the least provocation, but it had become fully awake and ravenous the moment he kissed her. She\u2019d wanted to pull him on top of her and ride the pleasure that had awoken until they were both blissfully unconscious again. And she hadn\u2019t cared in the least that they were in a public parking lot.</p><p>Actually, perhaps it was more correct to say that she\u2019d forgotten where they were. The moment his mouth had covered hers, all that had existed was the two of them in her mind. There hadn\u2019t been room for anything else in her brain with all that passion filling it.</p><p>How on earth were they going to manage at Leigh and Lucian\u2019s like this? Valerie wanted to believe that she could control herself with others around, but she wasn\u2019t at all sure that was true.</p><p>\u201cLucian\u2019s still home.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced around at that comment and saw that they were cruising up the driveway to Leigh and Lucian\u2019s house. Her gaze slid over the van parked in front of the house and then to the door as it opened and the tall, blond Lucian stepped out with Leigh just behind him.</p><p>\u201cThey just look like a normal young married couple,\u201d she whispered, watching Leigh waddle around to her husband\u2019s side. Lucian glanced down, apparently surprised that she\u2019d followed, and then scowled and gestured to the house as he said something which Leigh ignored. Ordering her back inside, no doubt, Valerie thought with amusement.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing normal about Lucian Argeneau,\u201d Anders said wryly as he pulled to a halt in front of the couple, and then he added seriously, \u201cBut they are the same people who opened their home to us and who you\u2019ve spent the last two days with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Valerie said and knew it was true. They hadn\u2019t crawled out of coffins and donned capes. Lucian wore his usually stern expression, along with jeans and a T-shirt that stretched over his muscular chest, and Leigh was . . . well, Leigh. She wore a pretty black summer dress with big red flowers on it that did little to hide her overlarge pregnancy bump. She also wore a wide welcoming smile that was hard to resist. Valerie found herself smiling in return as she got out of the SUV. Her smile turned into a grin of amusement, however, when Leigh called out a cheery \u201chello\u201d and waddled quickly to the back of the truck.</p><p>\u201cGo inside and rest, Leigh,\u201d Lucian growled, trying to usher her away from the vehicle as Valerie followed them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant, not disabled. I can help,\u201d Leigh protested, shaking off his hold as Anders opened the SUV\u2019s back doors. Eyeing the bags of groceries, she smiled widely and rubbed her hands together like a child faced with a truckload of gifts. Before the men could start unloading, she grabbed the nearest bag, tugged it out and opened the handles to peer eagerly inside. \u201cOoh, look, Lucian. Lemon coffee cake. That wasn\u2019t on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Anders thought it looked good,\u201d Valerie said with amusement.</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Leigh agreed, closing the handles to hold the bag in one hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take it inside and start coffee while we get the rest of this,\u201d Lucian suggested hopefully. \u201cWe can have a slice of cake and coffee while we decide what to have for supper once we get everything unpacked and put away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed cheerfully and Lucian started to relax, but then scowled when she grabbed two more bags to take with her.</p><p>\u201cStubborn woman,\u201d Lucian muttered as he watched his wife walk away.</p><p>Valerie smiled to herself as she stepped up to the truck to grab a couple bags, but glanced around with surprise when Lucian suddenly said, \u201cSo you told her about us.\u201d</p><p>He was speaking to Anders and added, \u201cShe appears to have handled it better than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked, eyes narrowing. When he simply arched one eyebrow, Valerie recalled that Anders had said immortals could read mortals, and muttered, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Lucian nodded, and then stepped up to the truck to grab several bags himself, adding, \u201cBut you\u2019re not staying at Anders\u2019s, so get the thought out of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou decided to stay at my place?\u201d Anders asked Valerie with a crooked smile, obviously pleased. That crooked smile faded though, as he turned to Lucian and announced in hard tones, \u201cShe\u2019ll stay in my home if she likes, Lucian. There\u2019s no reason she shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathy\u2019s gone missing,\u201d Lucian said calmly as he turned away from the truck loaded up with bags. \u201cI think you\u2019ll agree Valerie shouldn\u2019t go anywhere until we know where her cage mate has got to.\u201d</p><p>He walked away then, carrying the groceries he\u2019d collected into the house. Valerie stared after him with a frown. Kathy had gone missing? She turned to Anders. He was frowning too.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, taking the rest of the bags out of the back of the truck and elbowing the door closed. \u201cWe\u2019d better go find out what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded and followed him inside, but didn\u2019t find out what was going on at first. Roxy was waiting for her just inside the door, all excited at her return. By the time Valerie finished greeting her and led the German shepherd into the kitchen, Leigh was happily pulling groceries out of the bags, oohing and aahing over each item as she and Anders put them away. Lucian was nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cLucian\u2019s in the office taking a call,\u201d Anders said when she glanced his way.</p><p>Valerie nodded in understanding and helped put away the rest of the groceries, knowing they\u2019d have to wait for the man\u2019s return before finding out what he\u2019d meant about Kathy going missing. After putting away the last item, she and Anders gathered plates, forks, and coffees for everyone and joined Leigh at the island, where she was already slicing up the coffee cake.</p><p>Lucian returned as Leigh set the last slice of cake on a plate for him and announced abruptly, \u201cKathy went missing at some point during the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was watching her?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cNicholas and Jo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas is Lucian\u2019s nephew and Jo is his life mate,\u201d Leigh said quietly to Valerie as Lucian took a break to eat several bites of cake in a row. \u201cNicholas was an Enforcer, then was considered rogue for fifty years. Everyone thought he\u2019d killed a mortal woman, but that was all cleared up a little while ago and he\u2019s back in the fold again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this Joe, he\u2019s Nicholas\u2019s life mate?\u201d Valerie asked with interest. Gay vampires. Who would have thought?</p><p>\u201cJo is a girl,\u201d Leigh said with amusement. \u201cHer name is Josephine. Although there are same-sex life mates,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Valerie murmured and then turned her attention back to the men as Anders asked, \u201cHow was she taken if they were watching her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were just supposed to keep an eye on her and make sure there were no problems with her returning to her life. They could control and influence anyone with questions, that sort of thing. We weren\u2019t expecting any problems other than that, so there was no need to stay too close when she was home alone,\u201d Lucian said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anders nodded with understanding.</p><p>\u201cKathy rents a house on her own.

So they settled in and watched the front of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one was watching the back,\u201d Anders said solemnly.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucian agreed. He pushed his plate away and stood to get himself another coffee as he continued, \u201cBricker took over from Nicholas and Jo this morning. When Kathy didn\u2019t come out by noon, he thought she was just sleeping in on a Saturday morning. But by mid-afternoon he started to worry, and went in. The house was empty, but her bedroom window was wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bedroom was at the back of the house?\u201d Anders guessed. Gathering his and Lucian\u2019s plates, as well as his own coffee cup, he stood up. He rinsed the plates and set them in the dishwasher as Lucian answered.</p><p>\u201cThe bed apparently looks slept in, so she was taken sometime after retiring, but probably before getting up.\u201d</p><p>Anders finished at the sink and moved to join him at the coffeepot with his own empty cup. Frowning, he asked, \u201cHe\u2019s sure she was taken? She didn\u2019t just go out using her back door or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer purse, keys, and cell phone were all still there, and the back door was locked. She went out the window. I\u2019m guessing not willingly,\u201d Lucian added dryly as he led Anders back to the table.</p> <p>Valerie noted that Anders didn\u2019t look happy at this news, but then neither was she. She also wasn\u2019t hungry anymore, and pushed her unfinished cake away.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not all,\u201d Lucian added.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Valerie muttered under her breath as the men reclaimed their seats.</p><p>\u201cI got that news just before you returned,\u201d Lucian said, and then added, \u201cMy stop in the office after you got back was to call the other watchers to check on the status of the women each were watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone was accounted for but one,\u201d Lucian said, sounding weary. \u201cDecker was on Laura Kennedy and said she hadn\u2019t left the house yet and he was about to go check on her when I called. I told him to call after he checked. I\u2019m waiting to hear back from him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we might have two missing women,\u201d Anders said slowly and blew out a long breath. Shoulders sagging, he shook his head and stared into his coffee, saying, \u201cI thought for sure he\u2019d leave them alone and move on to somewhere else. Only an idiot would stay in this area now that we know he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr someone who wants to be caught and put down,\u201d Lucian said grimly.</p><p>\u201cCaught and put down?\u201d Valerie asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cMost rogues are pretty suicidal,\u201d Anders said quietly, and then glanced to Lucian and said, \u201cBut this guy wasn\u2019t acting like a typical rogue. He was careful. He chose women who wouldn\u2019t be missed, picked a country house out in the middle of nowhere, with owners who were old with no kids or friends to check on them.\u201d Anders shook his head. \u201cThe suicidal ones aren\u2019t careful to avoid drawing notice like that. They do things that attract attention to themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Valerie asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cLike buying coffins by the dozen and filling them with new turns,\u201d Leigh said dryly. \u201cThat\u2019s how they got on to the rogue who took me. His purchasing coffins in bulk.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyes widened incredulously. \u201cCoffins? You guys don\u2019t really sleep in coffins, do you?\u201d she asked with dismay. After Anders\u2019s explanation of a scientific basis for their vampirism, she had been sure that whole coffins, capes, and garlic image was wrong.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leigh assured her, even as Anders and Lucian said, \u201cNot anymore,\u201d in unison.</p> <p>She stared at the three of them, one after another. \u201cNot anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well . . .\u201d Leigh grimaced and waved one hand. \u201cI guess in the old days when houses weren\u2019t as well built as now, some of them slept in coffins to ensure no sunlight got in at them through cracks in the walls, or roof, or via poor window coverings.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMost of them just use black-out curtains and such now, but rogues tend to sink into living the horror-movie version of vampires for the benefit of their followers. I know Morgan\u2014the rogue who turned me,\u201d she explained, \u201cHe did it to keep his turns in line. They all thought he was their sire and lord and all that nonsense and were as obsequious as Dracula\u2019s Renfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost rogues do it for precisely that reason,\u201d Lucian said dryly. \u201cIt engenders fear and obedience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy rogue didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Valerie said. \u201cI never saw a coffin and he didn\u2019t turn Janey or Bethany, he just let them die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Your rogue was careful to avoid drawing attention to himself,\u201d Anders agreed. \u201cWhich is why we thought he was just old-school. Preferring to feed off the\u2014er . . . from the source,\u201d he corrected himself with a grimace. Then he sighed and ran a hand around the back of his neck, adding, \u201cWe were wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not be,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cPerhaps Kathy\u2019s disappearance has nothing to do with the rogue. Maybe a mortal took her. Or maybe she noticed Nicholas and Jo out front in the van, got nervous, thought they were watching her for some nefarious purpose, and snuck out her window to go somewhere safe or something,\u201d Leigh suggested. Unfortunately, neither her words nor her tone of voice were very convincing. She obviously didn\u2019t for a minute believe what she was saying might really be true.</p><p>Judging by the expressions on Anders\u2019s and Lucian\u2019s faces, they didn\u2019t believe it either, but before either man could comment, muffled music began to play.</p><p>Valerie glanced to Lucian when he reached for his pocket and pulled out a cell phone. The music immediately grew louder and she tilted her head slightly and said, \u201cThat sounds like \u2018Ridin\u2019 Dirty\u2019 by Chamillionaire.\u201d</p><p>Lucian growled under his breath, and then barked, \u201cSpeak!\u201d as he pressed the phone to his ear. But Leigh smiled brightly and exclaimed, \u201cYou know the song!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Valerie smiled faintly. \u201cI loved playing it in the car on the way to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI listened to it in the car too,\u201d Leigh said with a nod. \u201cBut it\u2019s just called \u2018Ridin\u2019,\u2019 not \u2018Ridin\u2019 Dirty,\u2019 and that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>Valerie blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is. It sounds like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does sound like \u2018Ridin\u2019,\u2019 \u201d Leigh acknowledged. \u201cBut it\u2019s Weird Al Yankovic\u2019s \u2018White and Nerdy.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018White and Nerdy\u2019?\u201d Valerie echoed, eyes wide. Lucian just didn\u2019t seem the sort to be able to laugh at himself . . . or anything else really. The man was mostly stern and grim-faced. But he had to have a good sense of humor to make that his ring tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lucian has a wonderful sense of humor,\u201d Leigh assured her cheerfully. \u201cBut I\u2019m the one who put it on his phone. I did it last week when I was annoyed with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie said uncertainly and then glanced to Anders to see that his lips were tightly compressed. She suspected he was trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change it eventually,\u201d Leigh added serenely. \u201cBut probably not until I have the baby and he stops acting like an overprotective dictating ass.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyes went wide and round, but Anders released a bark of laughter he quickly tried to cover with a cough.</p><p>\u201cCall and update the others. Tell them I want \u2018eyes on\u2019 from here on out,\u201d Lucian suddenly barked into the phone.</p><p>Valerie stilled, her head turning slowly to the man. This was obviously the call he\u2019d been waiting for, and she guessed that by \u201ceyes on\u201d he meant there would be no more just watching the homes of the other women and following at a distance. They were to keep the women in sight at all times. Laura must be gone then, she thought. He\u2019d hardly make that order otherwise. Would he?</p><p>Lucian\u2019s next words confirmed that fear for Valerie as he said, \u201cAnd double the watchers. I want two teams on each of the remaining women around the clock. We aren\u2019t losing another one.\u201d</p><p>Valerie sagged back in her seat. Laura was gone too. That left Cindy, Billie, and herself.</p><p>\u201cHas Beth already headed to Port Henry?\u201d Lucian asked.</p><p>\u201cBeth is an Enforcer from Europe,\u201d Leigh explained to Valerie, her expression solemn now. \u201cShe and Lucian\u2019s niece, Drina, were partners there. But Drina came to Canada to help out with a situation and found her life mate, Harper. She stayed here. So when Lucian sent out the call that our Enforcers\u2019 numbers were getting too low and we needed help, Beth volunteered. She and another new recruit, Paolo, arrived the day you woke up.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded and asked curiously, \u201cWas she headed to Port Henry on another Enforcer job?\u201d</p><p>Leigh shook her head. \u201cBeth wanted to visit Drina before she started to work. She was going down to Port Henry to stay with Drina and Harper for the weekend and then starting here in Toronto Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie murmured, thinking it would be a shame if the woman\u2019s visit was halted before it began.</p><p>\u201cNiagara Falls? Why the hell were they taking her there?\u201d Lucian squawked, and then muttered, \u201csightseeing,\u201d under his breath with disgust. \u201cWell, why the hell didn\u2019t they take their cell phones at least?\u201d</p><p>Probably so they couldn\u2019t be contacted and dragged from their vacation to be pressed into work, Valerie thought.</p><p>\u201cCall the hotels around Niagara Falls and find them,\u201d Lucian growled.</p><p>Valerie bit her lip. Lucian obviously didn\u2019t realize how many hotels there were in Niagara Falls. If they were in a hotel . . . they might have rented a cottage, or could even have checked into a bed and breakfast. And it was possible that they weren\u2019t even on the Canadian side, but had gone over to the American side of Niagara Falls. Finding them could turn out to be harder than finding the rogue, she thought, but then paid attention as Lucian spoke again.</p><p>\u201cJust do your best,\u201d he barked. \u201cIn the meantime, Christian and his band are at Marguerite\u2019s right now. Every one of them have spent some time as Enforcers at one point or another over the centuries. I\u2019ll call there and see if a couple of them would be willing to help until we can get Beth and Drina here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian is Marguerite\u2019s son, and Lucian\u2019s nephew,\u201d Leigh explained and then frowned. \u201cWell, technically, I guess he isn\u2019t his nephew. At least not by blood, but Marguerite is Lucian\u2019s sister-in-law, so he\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, and then glanced back to Lucian as he said, \u201cNo, you needn\u2019t arrange anything for her. Anders and I have that covered. You just concentrate on the other two.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to think hard to know he was talking about her when Lucian said he and Anders had that covered. She was definitely in protective custody now. But then Valerie had thought she was from the start.</p><p>Lucian hung up then, but immediately stood and walked to the phone at the end of the counter. Picking it up, he began punching in numbers, and then held the phone between his ear and shoulder while he plugged his cell phone into the wall socket charger. He\u2019d barely managed to get the task done before dropping the cell phone on the counter and grabbing the other phone to bark, \u201cMarguerite?\u201d</p><p>Valerie was distracted from the latest conversation when Roxy nudged her arm with a wet nose.</p><p>Glancing down, she petted the dog\u2019s head. \u201cDo you have to go outside?\u201d</p><p>Roxy whined, then turned and headed for the nearest set of French doors.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a yes,\u201d Leigh said with amusement.</p><p>Smiling wryly, Valerie nodded and stood to cross to the doors. Roxy waited for her to step out first and then followed and rushed ahead to find a patch of grass. Valerie started to close the door behind her, but paused and glanced around when it wouldn\u2019t close. Anders was following her out of the house.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you company,\u201d Anders said as he stopped Valerie from closing the door on him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, and turned to walk to the edge of the porch to watch Roxy.</p><p>Anders closed the door and followed. He too looked out over the yard, but he wasn\u2019t watching Roxy. He was taking in the forest backing onto the house and the trees on either side of it. Hell, he realized, there were even trees ten or twenty feet deep along the front of the house. The whole place was surrounded by woods that would make for a great hiding place for anyone who wanted to sneak up on the house. What the hell had Lucian been thinking when he\u2019d bought this home in the middle of the bloody woods? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI suppose this means our rogue is suicidal,\u201d Valerie commented suddenly.</p><p>Anders frowned. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s looking that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that make him more, or less, dangerous?\u201d she asked unhappily.</p> <p>\u201cMore,\u201d he admitted reluctantly.</p><p>Valerie nodded as if that had been exactly what she\u2019d expected him to say. Then she turned to face him. Arms crossed over her chest, she asked quietly, \u201cJust how dangerous is your job, Anders? I mean I know being a mortal cop is dangerous, but how much worse is being an immortal cop in comparison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be dangerous at times, but we\u2019re very careful,\u201d Anders said. He had hoped to reassure her, but she didn\u2019t look much reassured, so he added, \u201cWhen all is said and done, it\u2019s probably safer for us than a mortal law-enforcement officer, if only because we\u2019re harder to kill.\u201d</p><p>Valerie still didn\u2019t look reassured, he noted. In fact, she looked pissed.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said grimly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lie to me after you said you wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d he said with affront.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she asked dubiously. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because I\u2019m pretty sure I remember Justin saying something the other day about you guys dropping like flies. And Leigh said not ten minutes ago that a Beth and Paolo had come to help fill the ranks because your numbers were getting so low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Anders smiled and clasped her upper arms, rubbing them as he said, \u201cYou misunderstood, Valerie. Drina, Beth, and Paolo are here because so many of my co-workers have found their life mates,\u201d he explained gently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped with disbelief. \u201cWhy would they need to replace people who found their life mates?\u201d Frowning, she added, \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t like praying mantises, are you? You don\u2019t have a mate-and-die kind of deal going on, do you?\u201d</p><p>The suggestion was so ridiculous it startled a laugh out of Anders, but he sobered quickly under her scowl and assured her, \u201cNo, of course not. It\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? What is it?\u201d Valerie asked, sounding a bit belligerent now.</p> <p>Anders found her attitude kind of sexy. Mind you, he suspected Valerie could blow her nose and he\u2019d find it sexy at this point in their relationship. Grimacing at that bit of self-awareness, he decided to show rather than tell and simply pulled her into his arms for a kiss.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the most brilliant idea, Anders acknowledged some time later. He wasn\u2019t sure how many minutes had passed when Lucian\u2019s voice pierced the heated fog cloaking his brain. It brought Anders around enough to realize what he was doing. And what he was doing was dry humping Valerie up against the porch rail while simultaneously trying to examine her tonsils with his tongue, touch and squeeze her breasts and behind, and undo his jeans all at the same time.</p><p>Groaning, Anders disentangled himself from Valerie\u2019s clinging arms and took a step back. He paused to take several breaths, attempting to give his brain a chance to recover before turning toward Lucian. Once he faced the man, he simply asked, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d rather my wife not look out our French doors and see your bare ass if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Lucian said succinctly.</p><p>Anders glanced down at himself, relieved to see that, as he\u2019d thought, he hadn\u2019t yet achieved undoing and dropping his drawers. Trying for dignity he straightened his shoulders and said, \u201cI assure you my self-control would have kicked in before things went that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right,\u201d Lucian snorted. \u201cOne more minute and you would have been bare-assed and giving Valerie a good seeing to right there on the porch rail.\u201d Grimacing, he added, \u201cFor future reference, I don\u2019t recommend it. Leigh got some nasty slivers off that rail some months ago. It\u2019s too rough for such endeavors.\u201d</p><p>Anders glanced over his shoulder to Valerie with concern at this news. The shorts she was wearing weren\u2019t especially long and he had no doubt her upper legs at least had been ground into the wood as he\u2019d dry humped her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Blushing brightly, she nodded. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll check later.\u201d Anders had meant that to be reassuring, but Valerie\u2019s blush went from a becoming rosy color to the red of a tomato and her wide eyes shot to Lucian with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is precisely why we need help at the moment,\u201d Lucian said dryly to Valerie, obviously having read enough of their minds to know that was what Anders had been trying to show her. He clarified, however, by adding, \u201cI\u2019ve lost most of my best Enforcers to life mate brain . . . which means more often than not, they\u2019re as brainless as cats in heat. Even I suffer from it on occasion. We\u2019ll need help for the next year or so until the worst of it passes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie breathed.</p><p>Apparently satisfied that she understood, Lucian turned back to Anders. \u201cChristian and his cousins from the band are all going to help out for the next day or two and perhaps even longer. They\u2019ve agreed to meet us at the Enforcer house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the Enforcer house?\u201d Anders asked. \u201cWhy not just have them come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to discuss a plan of action for hunting down this rogue and doing so quickly. I want those women back safe. I\u2019ve called Greg to get his insights and I want Mortimer and Justin there as well, but they can\u2019t leave the house unmanned. Someone has to be there to ensure things run smoothly. So the boys are meeting us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the women?\u201d Anders asked with a frown. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Valerie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming with us,\u201d Lucian interrupted, and then turned to head back into the house, adding, \u201cLeigh wants to take some food to cook up over there for everyone. She\u2019s getting it together now, and then we\u2019re leaving. You have about ten minutes at most.\u201d</p><p>Anders turned back to Valerie just as she asked, \u201cWho is Greg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It took a minute for his mind to backtrack, but then he explained, \u201cGreg Hewitt. He\u2019s married to Lucian\u2019s niece, Lissianna. He\u2019s a psychologist. He\u2019s helped a time or two in the past when cases weren\u2019t following a normal pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this one,\u201d Valerie suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes. Like this one,\u201d he agreed grimly. Really, this rogue wasn\u2019t making any sense at all. Anders had been sure that he was just an older immortal who refused to give up feeding off the hoof. There were many old ones who still thought of mortals as nothing but walking feedbags to be used and used up as desired. Most of them just stayed in Europe, however, where feeding off the hoof was still tolerated. Although, feeding from the source to the point of death wasn\u2019t tolerated anywhere anymore, so the man would have been rogue there as well.</p><p>Still, Anders hadn\u2019t thought this particular immortal was suicidal so much as selfish and lacking a conscience. But staying in the area, and even re-kidnapping his previous victims when he must know they were being watched . . . well, that was suicidal.</p><p>\u201cI better take Roxy up to my room,\u201d Valerie said quietly. \u201cShe can stay there while we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s comment drew Anders\u2019s attention from his thoughts and he glanced down as the German shepherd crossed the patio to stand between them. Reaching down to pet the dog, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll check with Lucian, but I\u2019m sure it will be fine to bring her along if you like. Actually, Mortimer has been thinking of getting some guard dogs at the Enforcer house to help with security and free up some manpower, so I know he won\u2019t mind her being there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have her travel cage,\u201d Valerie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty well-behaved dog. She should be okay without a cage. She rode here from Cambridge on the floor in the front seat without a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019d rather not just show up with her,\u201d Valerie said with a frown. \u201cAnd as long as we aren\u2019t gone too, too long she should be fine here.\u201d</p><p>Anders hesitated, but then shrugged and nodded. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be too long. A couple hours at most,\u201d he guessed, giving Roxy a last pat. Taking Valerie\u2019s arm, he then urged her toward the door, saying, \u201cWe should head in then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it looks like Leigh is almost done,\u201d Valerie pointed out, and Anders glanced inside as he reached to open the door. It did indeed look like Leigh was almost done. At least he hoped so. It looked like she\u2019d nearly repacked everything they\u2019d just bought and unpacked. How many people did she think she was feeding?</p><p>\u201cMy count is nineteen,\u201d Justin announced, entering the kitchen at the Enforcer house. \u201cTwenty-four if you plan to feed the guys at the gate and on guard duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Valerie said, glancing at Justin Bricker as he opened the refrigerator, and then just staring with amazement when he pulled out a bag of blood, and popped it to his teeth.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four then,\u201d Leigh said with a nod, setting down the ladle she\u2019d been using to stir the big pot of chili and bending slightly to open the oven door and check on the lasagna. \u201cValerie, how\u2019s the garlic bread coming? Almost ready to go in the oven? Valerie?\u201d</p><p>Blinking, Valerie tried to tear her eyes away from watching Justin, but just couldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t even sure what Leigh had said to her, so just muttered, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie, I\u2014 Jesus, Justin, what are you doing?\u201d Leigh gasped with amazement, apparently noting where her attention was.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the man cried, tearing the bag from his mouth, and then rushing to the sink with it as the punctured bag began to squirt blood everywhere. Dropping the bag in the sink, Justin glanced from Leigh to Valerie as he began to pull streams of paper towel from the roll. \u201cI thought she knew about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, she does. But she just found out today. She\u2019s never seen us feed or anything,\u201d Leigh said with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry,\u201d he muttered, quickly wiping up the mess on his shirtfront and then turning his attention to the floor. There was a blood trail on the white tile from the fridge to the sink.</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d Leigh asked gently, moving to her side. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She tore her eyes away from the quickly disappearing blood trail, and nodded weakly. \u201cYes. Sure. I was just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little startled by seeing Justin pop a bag of blood to his teeth,\u201d she finished for her on a sigh. Leigh patted her arm. \u201cIt takes some getting used to, I know. Here I can see you\u2019re done with the garlic bread. I\u2019ll pop it in ten minutes before we eat, but maybe you can start on a salad for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Valerie murmured and moved to the refrigerator to get the necessary ingredients. But when she opened the door, she found herself staring at the neatly stacked bags of blood on the bottom shelf, just above the fruit and vegetable crisper. And while she bent to reach for lettuce, she straightened holding a bag of blood.</p><p>Valerie turned with it in hand just as Justin straightened beside her from cleaning up the mess he\u2019d made.</p><p>He glanced from her face to the bag and back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d she said, surprising even herself with the request.</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d he asked with amusement. \u201cFeeding or making a mess when Leigh yells at me again?\u201d</p><p>His words made Valerie glance to Leigh to see that she was watching her worriedly. Turning back, she held the bag out to Justin. \u201cPut it on your mouth again.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, his gaze shifting to Leigh, but when she nodded, he took the bag, and then, eyeing Valerie warily, opened his mouth, let his fangs slide out and simply popped the full bag onto them.</p><p>Valerie watched with fascination for a moment, and then moved to the side of him to try to see what was happening. \u201cAre you swallowing the blood or is it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Justin tightened his lips, pulling them back to reveal his teeth. She could see that there was no liquid gathering in his mouth. The fangs were sunk into the bag and appeared to be draining the liquid from the bag themselves as if they had little pumps drawing in the blood.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d she murmured, moving closer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the usual rogue, though,\u201d Anders said, his eyes drifting toward the doorway as he wondered what Valerie was doing. She had headed off with Leigh, Lissianna, and Dani to help cook while Jo, Carolyn, and the men had come to the living room to come up with a plan of action for this rogue. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t agree on one because they couldn\u2019t sort out what kind of rogue they were dealing with.</p><p>\u201cYou may be right,\u201d Greg said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem suicidal. Or he didn\u2019t,\u201d he added thoughtfully. \u201cHe was careful not to be caught in the beginning. If Valerie hadn\u2019t managed to knock out Igor and call 911, he may never have come to your attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I never would have met her. She would have died alone in the dark in a cold, dirty cage, Anders thought, mouth tightening.</p><p>\u201cKnocked him out?\u201d Christian asked. \u201cSo you don\u2019t think she killed Igor when she staked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis boss arrived right afterward, he probably removed the stake, and if a stake is removed quickly enough the immortal lives. We figure he\u2019s alive,\u201d Anders said. They\u2019d had to explain the whole story from beginning to end for Christian, his life mate, Carolyn, and his band mates. They could hardly send them into a situation where they didn\u2019t know what was going on and what they were up against.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Christian said with a frown. \u201cSo we\u2019re really on the lookout for two rogues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a picture of the one they called Igor,\u201d Lucian announced and Mortimer immediately handed out copies of the sketch artist\u2019s rendition of Igor.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other guy?\u201d Christian asked.</p><p>\u201cNone of them saw him when not under the influence of drugs,\u201d Anders said.</p><p>\u201cI thought they weren\u2019t given drugged food the night they were taken upstairs?\u201d Carolyn said with a frown. \u201cSurely it should have been wearing off by the time they saw him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t and it should have,\u201d Lucian agreed. \u201cBut we think Igor was administering a drug during, or after, the bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA different drug than the one in their food,\u201d Greg clarified. \u201cOne that didn\u2019t make them docile, but screwed up their perceptions. Valerie and the other women all recall fighting him on their nights out and his enjoying it. But for each, their memories of their surroundings as well as what he looked like were just too distorted to have been the result of coming down off drugs administered the night before in their meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them mentioned being drugged on their night out,\u201d Anders said with a frown. He wasn\u2019t sure who the \u201cwe\u201d were Lucian was talking about. He hadn\u2019t been in on this conversation.</p><p>\u201cIgor could have controlled them to prevent their remembering,\u201d Lucian said with a shrug. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem as sadistic as his boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if we have no idea what the head guy looks like, that\u2019s not why he\u2019s risking taking the same women again,\u201d Greg muttered, and then asked, \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t find any stores with large purchases of cages?\u201d</p><p>Anders shook his head. \u201cNo. We didn\u2019t even find a store where anyone bought more than one large cage at a time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he was suicidal and looking to be caught, subconsciously, he\u2019d be leaving a bread crumb. But he hasn\u2019t left any trail at all,\u201d Greg said with a frown. \u201cI really don\u2019t think he\u2019s suicidal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why risk grabbing his prior victims again?\u201d Anders asked with frustration. \u201cHe had to know we\u2019d be watching them to be sure there were no problems placing them back in their lives, and it wouldn\u2019t have taken more than a glance at the street to spot our SUVs. Those are well known as Enforcer vehicles by immortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first two women weren\u2019t that risky,\u201d Mortimer commented. \u201cHis taking them wasn\u2019t expected. We weren\u2019t watching for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBillie was risky, though,\u201d Anders pointed out, his mouth tight. Mortimer had got the call just before they\u2019d arrived. Billie had been snatched from work. They were waiting for their man to get to the house to explain, but it sounded like she\u2019d gone into the \u201cemployees only\u201d section to change and had never come out. Why their Enforcer hadn\u2019t followed her in, Anders couldn\u2019t say. Lucian had ordered \u201ceyes on.\u201d Eyes on did not mean letting her leave your sight to change. Privacy took a backseat to safety, or should have.</p><p>\u201cYes, Billie should have been more risky,\u201d Lucian said, voice cold. Anders didn\u2019t envy whichever one of the men had been on Billie. The guy was in some serious shit.</p><p>\u201cSo, why take the risk?\u201d Carolyn asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Greg admitted wearily. \u201cUnless he\u2019s afraid they may have seen something in that house that could give away who he is.\u201d</p><p>Mortimer shook his head. \u201cWe checked all of them. In each case their memories were distorted. Their recollections of his face are like images through the bottom of an old glass pop bottle or in a funhouse mirror. There is absolutely nothing of use in their memories.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt may not be his face he\u2019s worried about,\u201d Greg pointed out. \u201cThere could have been a piece of mail on the bedside table with his name on it, or his wallet may have fallen out, open to show his driver\u2019s license during one of their struggles, maybe even when they were kidnapped. Or during their kidnapping they might have caught a glimpse of his face in the reflection of a window or something. It could be anything.\u201d</p><p>Anders cursed. He wasn\u2019t the only one, both Lucian and Mortimer echoed the sound as they realized that they might have missed something important.</p><p>\u201cValerie\u2019s in the kitchen, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Greg asked.</p><p>Anders nodded and headed for the door. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll get her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Greg\u2019s words brought him to an abrupt halt. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to her. It will be more natural. She\u2019ll be relaxed, more likely to remember things than if we drag her in here and make her feel like she\u2019s being grilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to know what you\u2019re doing and tense up the minute you ask her to return to her memories anyway,\u201d Jo said sensibly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Greg agreed. \u201cBut I want to ask her some other questions first and see if we can\u2019t sort out what the women may have had in common. How he came across each of them. That might tell us something about him that would lead us to where he would go now.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room began to move as Anders turned away. It made him shake his head. They weren\u2019t all going to fit in the kitchen. Aside from himself, there was Christian, his life mate, Carolyn, and his four bandmates, and then Greg, Lucian, Mortimer, Nicholas, Jo, and Decker. Lissianna, Dani, and Sam had opted to help Leigh and Valerie with the cooking. There was simply no way they were all going to fit into the kitchen.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Okay, so maybe they would all fit in the kitchen, Anders thought as he stepped into the large bright room. It was a lot bigger in reality than in his memory, but then he wasn\u2019t often in here.</p><p>Anders thoughts died as he came to a halt just inside the kitchen. It was the sight of Valerie over by the refrigerator, examining Justin like he was a horse up for sale that made him stop. The young Enforcer stood completely still, a quickly dwindling blood bag in his mouth, and eyes wide as Valerie stood beside him, pulling his upper lip back and poking at his teeth.</p><p>\u201cThere must be a direct path into the bloodstream via the fangs,\u201d she was saying thoughtfully. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see how. Or how they can draw in the blood without some sort of pump system or something . . . unless the nanos do the actual work of drawing in the blood. Hmmm.\u201d</p><p>The blood bag was empty now, and Justin removed it with relief, muttering, \u201cYeah. Well, I don\u2019t know how it works. I just enjoy the benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see your fangs again?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cEr . . .\u201d Justin said, then spotted Anders and smiled with relief. \u201cAnders, buddy. Show your woman your fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShy, Bricker? You?\u201d Anders asked dryly, moving forward again as Valerie glanced around to smile at him.</p><p>\u201cNah. I just don\u2019t want to show you up by letting her see how much bigger my fangs are than yours,\u201d Justin responded.</p><p>\u201cActually, I saw Anders\u2019s fangs at his house this afternoon and they\u2019re bigger than yours,\u201d Valerie said at once, and then as Anders reached her side, she glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhy? Is it like big fangs, big feet, big\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Anders put an end to her question by kissing her naughty mouth. God, he loved this woman. Justin had tried to embarrass him and she had slapped him back with so little effort that\u2014</p><p>His thoughts died as Anders\u2019s brain caught and held on to one particular sentence that had run through his mind. God, he loved this woman? Breaking their kiss, he lifted his head and stared down into her sweet face. She was like a ray of sunshine. Golden hair, porcelain skin, bright green eyes, luscious red lips. She was as beautiful as the sun to him, and he\u2019d always thought the sun the most beautiful thing in the world. Perhaps because he could never really enjoy it, and he\u2019d only allowed himself brief glimpses of it, or enjoyed it secondhand from the memories of mortals he fed off. It was only the last decade or so that he\u2019d been able to enjoy it properly with the help of the window coating that blocked UV rays.</p><p>Valerie rivaled the sun in his eyes. And won. If given the choice of seeing her every day but never seeing the sun again, or never seeing her again and getting to enjoy the sun, Valerie would win hands down, he acknowledged.</p><p>Anders had always understood that the nanos got it right when they chose a life mate for an immortal. He just hadn\u2019t realized how right it could be. When he was with Valerie, he felt at peace. He enjoyed her smile, her laughter, her chatter, her sense of humor, her everything. He enjoyed just being with her, even if they were saying nothing. And he definitely enjoyed their passion.</p><p>\u201cAnders?\u201d Greg\u2019s deep voice interrupted his musings.</p><p>Straightening, he turned and stared at Greg for one blank moment, and then nodded. \u201cValerie, this is Greg Hewitt. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissianna\u2019s husband,\u201d Valerie said with a smile, holding her hand out to Greg. \u201cNice to meet you. Lissianna is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you as well,\u201d Greg said with a smile, then raised an eyebrow and glanced around. \u201cSpeaking of my wife, where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside,\u201d Valerie answered. \u201cShe was in here helping us, but Luciana got fussy, so she took her out to let her run around the yard while she checked with Sam and Dani to see if they were good at the barbecue or needed anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam and Dani are manning the barbecue?\u201d Decker asked with a frown. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they call one of us to handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you all were busy,\u201d Valerie said with a shrug. \u201cBesides, there was no need. As Sam said, she\u2019s a lawyer and Dani\u2019s a doctor, between the two of them they should be able to get the barbecue going without blowing up the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Mortimer muttered and hurried out of the room with Decker on his heels.</p><p>Anders tightened the arm he still had around Valerie, giving her a little squeeze. He\u2019d caught the twinkle in her eye, even if the other two men hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful daughter,\u201d Valerie said now to Greg. \u201cShe\u2019s a little wingless cherub with her golden curls, chubby little rosy cheeks and those gorgeous big, silver-blue eyes. Speaking of which,\u201d she added, turning back to Anders. \u201cYou guys all have kind of metallic eyes. They\u2019re either silver-blue, silver-green, or black and gold like yours. Is that because of the nanos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Anders answered.</p><p>Before she could ask why the nanos had that effect on the eyes, which Anders suspected would be the next question, Greg asked one of his own, \u201cI hear you\u2019re a vet here to take some upgrade courses at the Veterinary College at the University of Guelph?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cAnd I hear you\u2019re a psychologist? That must make for an interesting job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times,\u201d he agreed wryly, and then said, \u201cI gather one of the other women taken by your kidnapper worked at the university? Billie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2014\u201d Valerie stopped abruptly, her eyebrows drawing together. \u201cWait. Did you say worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I meant works. She works there,\u201d Greg corrected himself quickly.</p><p>Valerie stared at him for a minute and then turned to Anders. \u201cIs Billie all right?\u201d</p><p>Anders could feel all eyes on him. He knew everyone wanted him to lie and say Billie was fine so they could get on with questioning Valerie, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. He wouldn\u2019t lie to Valerie. But before he could tell her Billie had been taken, Lucian spoke up, drawing Valerie\u2019s attention his way.</p><p>\u201cShe still works at the university coffee shop and will be fine,\u201d Lucian said.</p><p>Anders was just relaxing when Valerie turned back to him and asked, \u201cIs Billie fine right now?\u201d</p><p>Grimacing, he shook his head. \u201cShe was taken from her workplace just before we got here.\u201d Her eyes widened with horror and she opened her mouth to say something, but he rushed on, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t know the details yet, Valerie. As soon as I know, you\u2019ll know. In the meantime, Greg has some questions for you. They\u2019ll help us help her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie was silent for a moment, and then nodded and turned to Greg. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Greg glanced from Anders to Valerie and then said, \u201cYou and Billie have a connection to the Guelph University. Did any of the others? Could the college or university be where he found all of you?\u201d</p><p>Valerie considered the possibility, but shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Laura was a realtor and Cindy was a teacher. Kathy was unemployed. Billie was the only one who mentioned a connection to the university or college.\u201d</p> <p>Greg looked disappointed, but then said, \u201cAll right, you saw Cindy at the vet\u2019s. Perhaps he is connected to the vet clinic and that\u2019s how he got onto you all.\u201d</p><p>Valerie shook her head at once. \u201cThe day I saw Cindy at the clinic was the first time I ever went there. I only did that because I needed flea pills for Roxy and didn\u2019t want to waste Anders\u2019s time driving to Cambridge. It just happened to be the closest clinic. I had no connection to it before that.\u201d</p><p>Greg was silent for a moment, but then sighed and said, \u201cTell us about the house.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced from him to Anders uncertainly. \u201cTell you what about the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you can remember,\u201d Greg said. \u201cI understand most of your time was spent in a cage in the dark in the basement?\u201d</p> <p>Valerie nodded and moved closer to Anders. He suspected it was a subconscious action. She was seeking comfort. He tightened the arm he had around her and rubbed his hand soothingly up and down her upper arm.</p><p>\u201cBut you were taken upstairs twice,\u201d Greg continued. \u201cI\u2019d like you to close your eyes and go back there in your memory for us and tell us everything you see. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated, obviously not eager to do so, but then she grimaced, nodded, and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Greg said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last night you were in your cage. Igor has let you out of your cage and is leading you upstairs. The first room at the top of the stairs is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kitchen,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cCan you describe everything you see in that kitchen?\u201d Greg asked.</p> <p>Valerie was silent for a moment, but Anders could see her eyelids twitching as if she were looking around. He suspected she was seeing the kitchen again.</p><p>\u201cI was looking for a weapon,\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cI had my head down and was using my hair for cover. The floor was black and white checker tile, the kitchen table an old aluminum job with that speckled top, circa \u2018really old.\u2019 The cupboards were plain rectangles, that bright blue they used fifty years ago, and the countertops were completely bare. It was like it was an empty house they\u2019d taken over or something.\u201d</p><p>Anders continued to rub her arm. It hadn\u2019t been an empty house. Igor and his boss must have emptied out the rooms they wouldn\u2019t be using. But they hadn\u2019t told Valerie that the old couple who owned the place had been killed and left to rot in the room behind the room where her cage had been. There was no need to give her worse nightmares.</p><p>\u201cNothing at all on the countertops?\u201d Greg questioned with a frown. \u201cWhat about on the fridge? Were there any magnets with notes, or mail, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There was nothing,\u201d Valerie assured him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Greg said. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving the kitchen. Now what do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hall as empty as the kitchen, and then we\u2019re heading up the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have passed rooms on the way to the stairs. Did you see anything in the rooms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing near the doorways and that\u2019s all I saw,\u201d she said and reminded him, \u201cMy head was down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re mounting the stairs. What do you see at the top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI raised my head as we mounted the stairs, and then we were in another hallway. There\u2019s a blue shag carpet\u2014God I hate shag,\u201d she added in a disgusted mutter. \u201cIt gets all gross and matted.\u201d</p><p>Greg smiled faintly. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaneled walls, a cheap, fake Renaissance portrait, and he turns me to the left and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Renaissance portrait?\u201d Greg interrupted sharply.</p><p>Valerie opened her eyes curiously. \u201cYeah. But it was a bad knockoff, ugly and dirty-looking.\u201d</p><p>Greg\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMarguerite has portraits of herself and her children down through the ages. She has them taken care of, has them cleaned and touched up regularly and so forth when the paint begins to darken or crack, but if your rogue didn\u2019t, the painting might look dirty and cheap.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. \u201cYou think the portrait might be of him?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer, Greg glanced to Lucian in question. \u201cDo most immortals keep portraits of themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cThere were no cameras back then and portraits were the only way to capture memories. But it could just as easily be a cheap knockoff, as Valerie thought. Something the previous owners had put up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took everything out of the kitchen that belonged to the previous owners. What makes you think they left anything in the rest of the house?\u201d Greg asked.</p><p>Lucian raised his eyebrows. \u201cGood point. I suppose it could be of him. That would explain why he\u2019d want the women back. They might have been able to describe his portrait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut none of the others mentioned it, did they?\u201d Anders asked. No one had mentioned the portrait to him prior to this.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucian acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cBut the others were drugged, probably unsteady on their feet and watching their step because of it. Valerie wasn\u2019t drugged and was looking for a weapon to facilitate her escape,\u201d Greg pointed out. \u201cHowever, he couldn\u2019t be sure that one of them might not have glanced up. At least not without searching their memories. To do that, he needed to recapture them.\u201d</p><p>Anders frowned. That didn\u2019t bode well for the women that had been recaptured. If he\u2019d only taken them to search their memories and ensure they didn\u2019t tell anyone about the portrait, then he had no reason to keep them alive. His plan might actually be to capture and kill each of the women and then move on to new, safer pastures.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Greg said.</p><p>Anders glanced up to see that the psychologist was speaking to him. He\u2019d read his mind, he realized with irritation.</p><p>\u201cBut that means there\u2019s good news,\u201d Greg continued. \u201cIf he\u2019s worried about that portrait, it\u2019s because someone might recognize him from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but no one has recognized Igor yet,\u201d Anders pointed out.</p><p>Greg shrugged. \u201cHe may be new. A newer turn that the rogue took on to tend to the women and do the more unpleasant or heavy work he doesn\u2019t want to do.\u201d He paused to let that sink in and then added, \u201cBut he himself may be more recognizable . . . especially if he\u2019s been around a while and had enough wealth and power to be able to afford a portrait. I suspect those didn\u2019t come cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t,\u201d Lucian agreed and glanced to Valerie. \u201cDescribe the portrait. You said Renaissance. Are you sure, or was that just a guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was wearing one of those fluffy collar things around his neck like Queen Elizabeth wore,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRuffs,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cThey were around near the end of the Renaissance. Sixteenth century. What else?\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated, and then bit her lip and closed her eyes. \u201cA fur collar, dark clothes, maybe a robe or something, but it\u2019s only from the shoulders up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe face, Valerie,\u201d Anders said gently.</p><p>She sighed with resignation and then her face screwed up. He couldn\u2019t tell if she was in pain or thinking really hard. \u201cA beard and mustache, big ears, a miserable expression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone looked miserable back then,\u201d Anders said with amusement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t remember facial hair on Count Rip-Out-Your-Throat,\u201d she said raising a hand self-consciously to her neck as she opened her eyes.</p><p>Anders reached for her hand and drew it away from her neck to kiss her knuckles. She was struggling with this and he wished she didn\u2019t have to go through it, but she wouldn\u2019t be safe until they found this man.</p><p>\u201cHe may have removed the facial hair since then,\u201d Greg said soothingly. \u201cJust try to remember his eyes and nose and what color his hair was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she muttered, and closed her eyes. \u201cEyes and nose and hair color. Well, the painting was dirty, but it looked like his hair was terribly fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlond?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cFairer than blond. Almost white, but his face wasn\u2019t old-looking. He had a straight nose and his eyes were kind of like\u2014 Oh,\u201d she interrupted herself with surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Anders asked and could feel the way everyone in the room had suddenly stilled and were leaning forward with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI just realized why he looked so familiar,\u201d she said with wonder. \u201cHe looked like the man in the portrait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did?\u201d Anders asked with alarm. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the man from the portrait since leaving the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She opened her eyes and turned to him. \u201cIn the grocery store parking lot. The man at the cart corral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Anders growled, recalling exactly who she meant. The greasy bastard he\u2019d thought was giving her the eye when she took the cart back. \u201cI knew there was something wrong with that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw him too?\u201d Lucian asked sharply.</p><p>Anders nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize him though. But then I didn\u2019t see much of his face. He kept his back and side to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he is after Valerie too,\u201d Greg said with a nod and when Anders turned on him, he said, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t think his being in the parking lot was a coincidence, do you? He must have been following you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Anders asked with a frown. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t know Valerie was at Lucian\u2019s so couldn\u2019t have followed us from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he was after Billie earlier in the day and spotted Valerie when she was talking to her. Or he might have been following Cindy and just awaiting his chance but followed the two of you instead because Valerie isn\u2019t at her home anymore,\u201d he suggested. Pursing his lips, he added, \u201cI suspect if you hadn\u2019t watched Valerie so closely the whole way, and had got into the SUV to start it as she\u2019d suggested, he\u2019d probably have her even now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know\u2014?\u201d Valerie began and then muttered, \u201cOh right. Mind reading.\u201d She scowled, and added, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of rude of you to read my mind, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d all stop that. If you don\u2019t, I might just put some nasty thoughts in there for you to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty thoughts?\u201d Justin asked with amusement.</p><p>\u201cThings you won\u2019t enjoy finding,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cOh, now you just have me curious,\u201d he said, focusing on her forehead.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyes narrowed on the young immortal, and then she tightened her lips and closed her eyes. A heartbeat later, Justin gasped and stepped back, his expression horrified.</p><p>\u201cEww, that\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he exclaimed, giving his head a shake as if trying to get an image out of it.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you want a refresher, give my brain a go,\u201d Valerie said sweetly, and then added grimly, \u201cI\u2019m a vet. There\u2019s plenty more where that came from.\u201d</p><p>Anders had been about to ask what she\u2019d thought of, but her words were explanation enough. He had a farm. He could imagine an unpleasant thing or two himself. He\u2019d just never thought to bombard the others with it for reading his mind. But Valerie had, the clever little minx. Damn, he did love her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Leigh said suddenly, clapping her hands. \u201cDinner will be ready in ten minutes. Lucian, that gives you just enough time to call Bastien and have him send back that nice sketch artist who did the picture of Igor. That way we can get Count Rip-Your-Throat-Out\u2019s picture without traipsing through images of puppy guts and Doberman diarrhea in Valerie\u2019s mind,\u201d she added with a grin for her. \u201cEveryone else go wash up so you can help fetch plates, condiments, and whatnot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can eat after what Valerie showed me,\u201d Justin muttered with disgust.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Leigh said, not sounding terribly concerned as she bent to peer in at something she had in the oven. \u201cWe have lasagna, chili, garlic bread, salad, potato salad, and then hamburgers and hot dogs on the barbecue. I was hoping everyone would find something they like in that collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lasagna? Homemade?\u201d Justin asked, his interest and appetite apparently returning. But then it was only to be expected. Justin was always hungry, Anders thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo wash up,\u201d Leigh said with a laugh, one hand rubbing her belly and the other her back as she straightened.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Leigh?\u201d Valerie asked, giving Anders\u2019s waist a squeeze before slipping free of his arm and moving toward the other woman.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine,\u201d she said sounding tired. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just been on my feet too long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Valerie said at once, taking the woman\u2019s arm and ushering her to one of the stools around the island in the center of the long room. \u201cI\u2019ll take over from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake over?\u201d Leigh asked with amusement. \u201cYou did most of it to begin with.\u201d</p><p>Valerie shrugged and grabbed a ladle to give the chili a stir, saying lightly, \u201cYou can return the favor when I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Anders stared at Valerie, her words reverberating in his head. When she was pregnant? He immediately started to imagine just that, Valerie glowing and beautiful, her belly rounded with his child.</p><p>\u201cHas she agreed to be your life mate?\u201d</p> <p>Anders glanced to Greg at that soft question and then turned back to look at Valerie as he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, whether she realizes it or not, she\u2019s accepted what we are and isn\u2019t afraid of us. I think you can thank Leigh for that,\u201d Greg added.</p><p>\u201cLeigh?\u201d he asked with surprise. He\u2019d been rather hoping it was him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Anders, but that\u2019s not how a woman\u2019s mind works. You\u2019re a dark, mysterious, and sexy vampire to her, and none of those words are equated with trust and feeling safe,\u201d he pointed out dryly, and then added, \u201cBut Leigh . . .\u201d Greg glanced to the woman and smiled crookedly. \u201cShe\u2019s the most non-threatening vampire on the planet right now. Valerie can see herself in Leigh. It will help you that they are becoming good friends. I think she\u2019ll choose you in the end.\u201d</p><p>Anders grunted. He hoped Greg was right. He\u2019d been alone a long time and never really minded until she\u2019d come into his life. Now he didn\u2019t even want to contemplate a future without her in it.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grimaced at Anders\u2019s comment as she approached the couch where he sat. He was alone in the living room of the Enforcer house, which looked like a normal house to her. Well, a normal, huge, expensive house with loads of bedrooms upstairs, high-tech security, and guards at the entry gate as well as walking the perimeter, not to mention a big outbuilding that was half prison cells and half garage, although she hadn\u2019t yet seen that.</p><p>She gathered Mortimer, who was in charge of the Enforcers under Lucian, lived here with his life mate, Sam, a lawyer who now worked at his side as well as helped out with legal matters that came up. However, she\u2019d been told that the spare bedrooms were often used by either Enforcers from other areas, or mortals and immortals who needed a safehouse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little tired,\u201d she admitted as she settled on the couch beside him. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeigh?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s lying down upstairs. She says she can\u2019t get comfortable enough to sleep through the day, so ends up taking several naps.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s all right though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she is,\u201d Valerie said with a frown.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>Valerie hesitated, but then sighed and shrugged. \u201cWhat do I know? I\u2019m just a vet. If she says she\u2019s fine, she probably is.\u201d</p><p>Anders was silent for a minute, and then reached out and took her hand in his. \u201cAnd how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she asked with surprise. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t been avoiding me for the last hour since we finished cleaning the kitchen?\u201d he asked solemnly.</p><p>\u201cHas it been an hour?\u201d Valerie asked with surprise. Everyone had stayed to help after eating, but then Lucian had taken Christian, his life mate, and his band members with him and left. He was taking the band members to replace the two teams presently watching Cindy and getting them settled, then taking Christian and Carolyn home before bringing back the men the band members were replacing. The band members didn\u2019t have vehicles here to use, so Lucian and Mortimer had come up with just swapping out the teams.</p><p>After Lucian had left with them, everyone else had cleared out pretty quickly, the couples all heading home. No one was expecting any activity until tomorrow. They didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to get the sketch artist back till then. Once they had pictures of the rogue, they would be out showing it around . . . if one of them didn\u2019t recognize the man.</p><p>Once the last of them had left, Leigh had announced that she needed to lie down. Sam had shown her to a room and Valerie had followed to be sure the woman was all right. She couldn\u2019t explain why, but she was just getting the sense that Leigh wasn\u2019t feeling well. But Leigh had assured her she was fine and then had started talking to distract her and it appeared Valerie had been up there for an hour chatting with the woman.</p><p>\u201cLeigh and I talked for a bit,\u201d Valerie admitted. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think it was an hour. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize. Leigh\u2019s a good person, well worth talking to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is nice,\u201d Valerie said with a smile. \u201cNothing like I would have imagined a vampire would be like . . . if I\u2019d have even imagined vampires existed,\u201d she added wryly. \u201cBut then you\u2019re all nice. Well, all of you that I\u2019ve met since escaping Count Rip-Your-Throat-Out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just people, Valerie. We have good ones and bad ones and some in between,\u201d Anders said quietly.</p><p>She shook her head, a crooked smile on her face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re delusional if you think that, Anders.\u201d</p><p>When alarm crossed his face, she patted his hand soothingly. \u201cI believe you want to believe that. But you aren\u2019t \u2018just people.\u2019 \u2018Just people\u2019 don\u2019t live centuries or even millennia. They can\u2019t see in the dark, or lift a small car with little effort, or read the minds of, and control others. And \u2018just people\u2019 don\u2019t need to feed on other \u2018just people\u2019 to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You were born this way, so you don\u2019t have a clue that you\u2019re like a fricking superhero. You probably don\u2019t even realize how differently you see things. That your perception of time is so much different than non-immortals because it has so little hold on you,\u201d Leigh had mentioned that to her. That one of the things she\u2019d noticed about immortals since becoming one herself was that the old ones had a different concept of time. That what she considered a long time, was a mere twinkling of time to them. Valerie supposed if you lived thousands of years, a day was a blink in time and a week wasn\u2019t much more.</p><p>Grimacing, she added, \u201cYou probably don\u2019t realize that you have so many fewer fears and worries than mortals because cancer, and heart disease, and all those other nasty little life stealers can\u2019t claim you. And you\u2019ve surely never been afraid of a mortal doing you harm.\u201d</p><p>Valerie paused and glanced down at their entwined hands. \u201cLeigh said that to be your life mate I\u2019d have to be turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was husky. Clearing it, he added, \u201cThough not necessarily right away. Sam didn\u2019t turn right away after agreeing to be Mortimer\u2019s life mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeigh told me that too, but said that Mortimer was a mess, constantly worried that Sam would be killed in an accident or something before she agreed to the turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t,\u201d Anders said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be willing to go through that if you needed me to.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled faintly and shook her head. She didn\u2019t really want to make him suffer, but she was having trouble with this situation. She hadn\u2019t considered that she would have to become a vampire to be with one. Stupid, she supposed. He had told her that Leigh used to be mortal. He\u2019d also told her that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. The rest of his life could be a hell of a long time. Certainly, it was longer than the fifty or so years she had left in her. But she hadn\u2019t considered that his wanting her to be his life mate included turning her into an immortal until her talk with Leigh. Now the decision to be his life mate was that much bigger.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like just saying, \u201cAh heck, let\u2019s give it a go,\u201d and then moving in with him, knowing she could always move out. It wasn\u2019t even like taking a risk and marrying him. That could be reversed through divorce if it was a mistake. But this was not reversible. She would have to become one of them. And from her talk with Leigh, Valerie knew that wasn\u2019t reversible. She had a decision to make that would affect the rest of her life.</p><p>Did she want to become a vampire and spend forever with this man?</p><p>Cripes, marriages nowadays were lucky to last ten or fifteen years. There were exceptions, of course. The newspaper and the news occasionally ran articles or items on couples who had been together for fifty years or more. But that was the exception, not the rule, and he was asking her to spend a heck of a lot more than fifty years. Try adding a zero or two to that number. Surely even that incredible life mate sex cooled after a millennia or two?</p><p>\u201cLeigh said that being turned was the most terrible experience of her life, but turned out to be the best thing that had ever happened to her,\u201d Valerie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Lucian\u2019s life mate. They were meant to be together. You\u2019ve seen how perfect they are together and how much they love each other,\u201d he said encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ve only been together less than a handful of years. They\u2019re still newlyweds, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Anders sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. They haven\u2019t been together long,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut I could take you to meet life mates who have been together millennia if it would help you make your decision.\u201d</p><p>She glanced to him with surprise. \u201cYou know life mates who have been together that long?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre they still happy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he assured her, and then frowned and said, \u201cI am not saying they have never argued or fought. But\u2014\u201d He paused when Valerie put one hand up.</p><p>Smiling, she tilted her head and simply said, \u201c \u2018White and Nerdy\u2019?\u201d She then assured him, \u201cI understand that a healthy relationship includes disagreements.\u201d</p><p>Anders smiled, and then squeezed her hand and said, \u201cI know this is a big decision, and I won\u2019t put pressure on you to make it quickly. There is no need. I have waited centuries, and I can wait a little longer. However, you can never tell anyone about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike anyone would believe me,\u201d she said with a snort, and then assured him, \u201cYour people and their secrets are safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Anders said, and leaned forward.</p><p>Valerie was sure he was about to kiss her, but at the last moment, he paused, and turned toward the door. She followed his gaze curiously, just in time to see Mortimer appear in the hall outside the door. Leigh had mentioned that immortals had incredible hearing. Obviously that was true. She hadn\u2019t heard Mortimer approaching. Heck, she couldn\u2019t hear him walking now as he entered and crossed the room, toward them.</p><p>\u201cAnders, I need you to go to the airport,\u201d the man announced as he paused before them. \u201cI just got word that Bastien put the sketch artist on a United flight and it lands in forty-five minutes, but Sam is out getting groceries and Nicholas and Jo\u2019s SUV needed maintenance so I had Justin drive them home. I don\u2019t have anyone else to send at the moment but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sketch artist is on his way already?\u201d Anders asked with surprise. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect him until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he was available immediately,\u201d Mortimer said with a shrug. \u201cBut all the company planes were busy, so Bastien sent him on a commercial flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat lands in forty-five minutes,\u201d Anders said dryly, standing up. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t give us any more of a heads-up than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he put the man on the plane himself so he could tend to any mortals who might cause a problem about such a last-minute flight addition. He\u2019s been calling Lucian for the last forty-five minutes since successfully getting him on the flight, but Lucian hasn\u2019t been answering so he finally called the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian was here an hour ago,\u201d Anders said with a frown. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear his phone ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis phone is on the kitchen counter at the house, charging,\u201d Valerie said, recalling watching him plug in the item as he\u2019d called Marguerite on the house phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell that explains why Bastien couldn\u2019t reach him,\u201d Mortimer said with annoyance, and then waved away the irritation. \u201cWhatever. At least I got the message in enough time to get someone there to meet him. At this hour and with Toronto traffic, it will be close, but you should be able to get there just before the flight lands . . . If you leave right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Anders murmured, but turned to look worriedly at Valerie.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe here,\u201d Mortimer said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cOf course she is.\u201d Anders nodded, and then bent and kissed her quickly. Releasing her, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, and watched him follow Mortimer out of the room as the other man listed the flight number and gate Anders should go to at the airport. She continued to stand even when they moved out of sight, and didn\u2019t sit until she heard the front door close behind them. Sighing, Valerie dropped to sit on the couch then, her thoughts immediately going to the decision she had to make. Spend a lifetime\u2014well, several hundred lifetimes\u2014with the man who had just left, or give him up and go back to her boring, lonely life?</p><p>That last part made her frown. She had never thought of her life as boring before this. And she shouldn\u2019t now. Normally, she was hip deep in animals, working to heal and cure them. Animals were rarely boring. Or hadn\u2019t seemed boring before. But then she supposed it was hard for life as a local vet to compare with the idea of several lifetimes with a vampire. Never aging, never needing to worry about getting sick, never having to watch her diet . . . That last part made her grin.</p><p>Leigh was the one who had pointed that out during their hour-long conversation upstairs and it had fascinated Valerie. She had a pretty okay figure, not supermodel skinny or anything. She had a few jiggles and some cellulite, but all in all she didn\u2019t hate her body. But she also worked to keep it that way. She wasn\u2019t constantly on a diet, but she did diet every couple of months and generally watched what she ate, and refused herself a lot to keep the figure she had. Her eating habits since waking up in Leigh\u2019s house had been the worst she\u2019d ever behaved, food-wise. So, the idea of never having to diet again was not an unpleasant one. However, that was not a good excuse to become Anders\u2019s life mate.</p><p>And, with the opposing factor that her diet would then have to include daily doses of blood . . . Well, that thought wasn\u2019t very appealing. It was kind of gross actually, despite Leigh\u2019s assurances that she didn\u2019t even have to taste it. Just plunk the bag on her teeth like she\u2019d seen Justin do and let the fangs do the work.</p> <p>Fangs. Valerie grimaced, and then reached up to run a finger across her teeth. How would she look with fangs?</p><p>Valerie let her hand drop to her lap at the sound of the front door opening and closing, and watched the hall until Mortimer reappeared.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way. He should be back in an hour, or hour and a half,\u201d Mortimer announced with a smile.</p><p>She nodded, and when Mortimer hesitated, glancing up the hall toward where she knew his office was, she smiled faintly and said, \u201cIf you have things you need to do, I can entertain myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Mortimer said apologetically. \u201cBut there\u2019s a television in that cupboard there at the far end of the room. The remote is in the end table drawer. If you\u2019d rather read, there\u2019s a library just up the hall with a load of books, and you\u2019re welcome to whatever is in the kitchen if you get hungry or thirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Valerie said lightly. When he still hesitated, she smiled and said gently, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Go on and get back to work. You don\u2019t have to babysit me.\u201d</p> <p>Mortimer let his breath out on a long exhalation and nodded. \u201cThanks. Shout if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she assured him, and he finally turned and headed out.</p><p>The moment he was gone, Valerie sagged back on the couch and closed her eyes. Silence immediately crowded in on her and she blinked her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like living with Larry,\u201d she muttered, staring at the ceiling and then grimaced at the thought.</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t normally mind being alone. After a rushed and busy day in the crush at the clinic, she generally looked forward to getting home to some peace and quiet, but it hadn\u2019t always been like that. While she and Larry had lived together . . .</p><p>She frowned at the ceiling and sat up. Valerie was uncomfortable because she was in someone else\u2019s home. Despite its use as a safe house and headquarters, it was also Mortimer and Sam\u2019s home, and one where she didn\u2019t even have a room temporarily her own to retreat to. Valerie felt like an inconvenient guest, there due to circumstance. It was how she\u2019d felt with Larry too, she realized now. She\u2019d had this same discomfort the entire time she\u2019d lived with him.</p><p>In truth, Valerie suspected that if her parents hadn\u2019t died, she and Larry would have split up before they\u2019d finished getting their degrees. But Larry was a nice guy, and his family had welcomed her into their bosom when her parents died, inviting her to Winnipeg for the holidays and so on. She\u2019d become family, and he hadn\u2019t had any real reason or motivation to break up with her.</p><p>Valerie supposed the life insurance and her inheritance being there to help them start a clinic when they graduated hadn\u2019t hurt either. Not that she thought Larry was a gold digger and had consciously stayed with her for that, but, like it or not, it had no doubt been a factor, if only subconsciously.</p> <p>As for herself, Valerie had clung to Larry like he was a life raft in a storm after losing her parents. She hadn\u2019t been madly in love with him, or even infatuated, but she\u2019d liked him well enough and had adored his family . . . and wanted them for her own. It had been enough for the relationship to limp along while they were busy getting their degrees and then starting a clinic. It hadn\u2019t been enough once the clinic was up and running.</p><p>Valerie supposed she\u2019d known that would be the case all along. She\u2019d known it would end and she\u2019d eventually be on her own in this big scary world. That was probably why she\u2019d always felt uncomfortable. She\u2019d known she was on borrowed time in a way.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel like that around Anders. She felt wanted and truly liked by him. She enjoyed his company whether they were just shopping, or chatting over a meal. She felt\u2014</p><p>\u201cDamn, trying to get out of that bed made me feel like a beached whale.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced around with surprise at that comment, to see Leigh waddling into the room, holding her stomach as if to keep it from swaying from side to side as she moved. Smiling sympathetically, Valerie stood as she approached. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you sleep?\u201d</p><p>Leigh grimaced and reached for Valerie\u2019s hand when she offered it, clutching it as a counterweight as she lowered herself to sit on the couch. \u201cI\u2019m bloated, gassy, my ankles are crazy swollen, and I\u2019m beyond exhausted, but I can\u2019t sleep in a strange bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually like that too,\u201d Valerie admitted. \u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t seemed to have that problem at your house.\u201d</p><p>Leigh smiled faintly. \u201cThank you. But you\u2019re healing from an injury. You could probably sleep in a doghouse right now.\u201d</p><p>Valerie chuckled at the words and then eyed Leigh with concern when she shifted on the couch, trying to find a more comfortable position.</p><p>\u201cIs there something I can get you?\u201d she offered. \u201cSomething to drink, or\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own bed and Roxy to warm my feet,\u201d Leigh interrupted, and when Valerie\u2019s eyes widened in shock, she said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, is she not allowed on the bed? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind, and my feet were cold and she seemed to know it and plopped right on top of them on the blanket. Honestly, she\u2019s the best foot warmer ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014 She\u2019s not normally allowed on the bed, but that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just\u2014 I forgot all about her,\u201d Valerie admitted with dismay. \u201cThe poor thing has been stuck in my room for hours without any food or water or a chance to go outside,\u201d she explained guiltily. \u201cHow could I forget about her like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were busy,\u201d Leigh said soothingly, beginning to rock where she sat. \u201cWe can fix that right now . . . and get me to my bed so I can rest,\u201d she added, rocking forward again.</p><p>Valerie stared at her blankly, wondering what on earth she was doing, and then she suddenly realized the woman was trying to get up, but finding it difficult with her stomach in the way.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, taking her arm to help her to her feet. Once she had her upright, Valerie frowned and shook her head. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t go home. Lucian isn\u2019t back from dropping everyone off, and Anders just left for the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin can take us,\u201d Leigh said, starting across the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on an errand for Mortimer. That\u2019s why Anders went to the airport. There was no one else to go,\u201d Valerie told her, following her to the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d Leigh muttered, pausing in the doorway. She pursed her lips with displeasure, and then suggested, \u201cWe could always call a taxi.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grinned at the suggestion, but shook her head. \u201cI somehow don\u2019t think the men would like that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leigh agreed on a sigh. \u201cAnd there\u2019s still the rogue to worry about. Having Justin drive us home and hang out until the men get back would be one thing, but I\u2019m in no shape to keep you safe right now and a mortal taxi driver would be less than useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to try to lie down again?\u201d Valerie suggested. \u201cI could make you a cup of cocoa or hot milk. It might help you fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d Leigh paused and glanced toward the door as it opened. A wide smile claimed her lips when she saw Justin entering. \u201cJust the man I wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>Justin paused with the door half open, his expression going wary. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortimer has another errand for you,\u201d Leigh announced, waddling toward the young immortal at speed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Justin asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cTaking Valerie and me home,\u201d Leigh announced, catching his arm and turning him in the doorway. Using his arm as a crutch, she shuffled down the steps, dragging him with her as she added, \u201cValerie needs to feed and let Roxy out, and I need to lie down, but the men are both busy, so you\u2019re to take us home and stay until they can get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Justin said, trying to disentangle his arm from her hold. \u201cJust let me talk to Mortimer first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can call him once we\u2019re on the road,\u201d Leigh announced, hanging on to him tightly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d he protested dragging his feet.</p><p>\u201cJustin, I\u2019m overdue, exhausted, and have to pee. Get me home,\u201d Leigh demanded, sounding incredibly cranky.</p><p>\u201cWell, for heaven\u2019s sake. Let\u2019s go back inside so you can pee,\u201d he said at once. \u201cI can talk to Mortimer while you\u2019re in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leigh said at once.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked with exasperation.</p><p>Leigh sighed, but then admitted, \u201cI had a devil of a time getting up from the toilet here earlier. I thought I\u2019d have to ask for help. I managed it, but just barely, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be so lucky next time. At home the counter is right beside the toilet to hold on to and help me get up. I want to go home and pee in comfort without the fear of not being able to get up,\u201d she admitted, looking miserable.</p><p>Valerie bit her lip, now understanding why Leigh seemed so uncomfortable and unhappy. She\u2019d been following them up until then, but now moved up beside her and said gently, \u201cLeigh, I can help you go to the bathroom if you want to go before we head out.\u201d</p><p>Leigh grimaced. \u201cThank you, but it\u2019s humiliating enough that I\u2019m having trouble getting up and down. I\u2019d really rather not have to resort to having help getting on and off the toilet when we can just go home.\u201d Turning to Justin then, she threatened, \u201cAnd I swear if you don\u2019t get me there in ten minutes, I\u2019ll either pee on the seat of your SUV, or make you come into the washroom of whatever gas station or coffee shop is closest and help me on and off the toilet . . . and then I\u2019ll tell Lucian you did.\u201d</p><p>Justin actually turned green at the threat. He also started moving again. Rushing Leigh forward, he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll call Mortimer on the way.\u201d</p><p>Valerie bit her lip to keep from laughing and simply followed the pair to a van parked in front of the house.</p><p>\u201cMy SUV is being serviced along with a couple others, so we\u2019re stuck with the van,\u201d Justin said apologetically as he helped Leigh into the front seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s fine,\u201d Valerie said when Leigh didn\u2019t comment. She slid the side door open and climbed in, pulling it closed behind her. Valerie then settled on the backseat on the driver\u2019s side. It would allow her to see and talk to Leigh, she thought as she did up her seat belt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Leigh muttered as Justin closed her door and rushed around the front of the vehicle. \u201cI know I\u2019m being cranky and difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo apology necessary,\u201d Valerie assured her. \u201cI\u2019d be cranky too if I was bloated, gassy, exhausted, and had to pee.\u201d</p><p>Leigh smiled faintly, and then sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve also got terrible heartburn and I\u2019ve been having Braxton Hicks contractions all afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie peered at her with concern and asked, \u201cBraxton Hicks are the false alarm labor pains, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Leigh said.</p><p>Valerie nodded slowly, but then asked, \u201cYou\u2019re sure they\u2019re Braxton Hicks and not the real thing? I mean you are overdue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Leigh said, and then frowned. \u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure they are. They don\u2019t hurt much and have been going on for hours, but haven\u2019t gotten any worse than when they started on our way to the Enforcer house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been having them all evening?\u201d Valerie asked with amazement. It had been three thirty when they\u2019d set out for the Enforcer house. It was now after seven. Leaning forward in her seat, she asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p> <p>Leigh clucked impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen how overprotective and mother-hen-like Lucian is acting. I didn\u2019t want him freaking out and making a big deal about it. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re just Braxton Hicks. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are Braxton Hicks?\u201d Justin asked, catching the tail end of the conversation as he got into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cJust get us home. I really have to go.\u201d</p><p>Justin nodded and started the van to send it cruising down the driveway toward the gate. He then reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cGive me that. I\u2019ll call,\u201d Leigh said at once. \u201cYou concentrate on driving.\u201d</p><p>Justin handed over the phone and Leigh quickly placed the call.</p> <p>\u201cThe answering machine picked up,\u201d she said as they waited for the gates to open.</p><p>\u201cMortimer must be on another call,\u201d Justin muttered.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019ll leave a message,\u201d Leigh said as Justin steered them through the gates and onto the road and immediately laid on the gas. The man was definitely eager to get them back to the house and out of the vehicle, Valerie thought with amusement as he sped up the road.</p><p>\u201cHi Mortimer,\u201d Leigh sang out cheerfully. \u201cJust letting you know Justin got back from his errand and is taking us home. I wanted to lie down and Valerie needed to tend to Roxy, so we told him you wanted him to take us. Send Lucian and Anders home when they get back. \u2019Kay? Later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did want me to take you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Justin asked suspiciously as Leigh pulled the phone away from her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2014oh crap!\u201d she muttered as she went to hit the button to end the call and dropped the phone. Valerie saw it bounce off the woman\u2019s knee and then disappear somewhere on the floor in front of her.</p><p>\u201cJust leave it,\u201d she suggested when Leigh began trying to bend forward to grab it. There was no way she was going to reach it in her condition.</p><p>\u201cOh crap!\u201d Leigh gasped suddenly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Justin asked, glancing sideways at her with alarm. \u201cIs my phone broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my water is,\u201d Leigh muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he and Valerie said together.</p><p>\u201cI guess they weren\u2019t Braxton Hicks after all,\u201d she muttered. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you\u2014are you sure your water broke?\u201d Justin got out finally, his voice high with alarm and his eyes repeatedly moving from the road to her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I still have to pee, so I\u2019m guessing the puddle I\u2019m sitting in is amniotic fluid,\u201d Leigh said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWatch the road, Justin,\u201d Valerie said, undoing her seat belt and shifting out of her seat to kneel between the front seats.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning around. We\u2019re going back to the house,\u201d Justin warned, slowing.</p><p>\u201cWell, why the heck would you do that?\u201d Leigh asked with irritation. \u201cI need Rachel or Dani. Neither of them are at the house. So who\u2019s going to deliver this baby? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Justin muttered, hitting the gas again. \u201cRachel and Etienne\u2019s house is closer. I can have you there in twenty minutes. No, fifteen. Just hang on and don\u2019t push or anything.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grabbed for Leigh\u2019s seat, to keep from toppling over as the SUV jerked forward, and then glanced at Leigh with surprise when she began shifting about in her seat, trying to get her legs to the side rather than the front.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked with alarm.</p><p>\u201cI want to move to the backseat,\u201d Leigh explained. \u201cI can spread out more. And the seat won\u2019t be wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here, let me help,\u201d Valerie said, shifting at once to get out of the way and taking her arm to help her. Much to her relief, they managed the move to the backseat without being tossed about unduly or thrown through the front windshield by Justin stopping abruptly. She then helped Leigh with her seat belt before doing up her own. After that, all she could do was hold Leigh\u2019s hand and try not to whimper as her fingers were crushed with each contraction. She was alarmingly aware that the crushing seemed to be coming at rather regular and quickly decreasing intervals as they traveled. But she didn\u2019t hit panic mode until Leigh began to groan and cry out along with the crushing.</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t think she\u2019d heard words more beautiful than, \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d when Justin uttered them. She glanced out the window at the house he stopped in front of, and then glanced quickly to Leigh as the woman gasped and crushed her fingers again.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d Leigh cried out with pain, and then snapped bitterly, \u201cWhy do we women have to have the babies? Men should have them. What did we ever do to deserve this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve ate the apple,\u201d Justin responded, braking and shifting the van into park.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Justin, or I swear I\u2019ll shove an apple up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw, ow, ow,\u201d Valerie cried out as Leigh nearly pulverized the bones in her fingers.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Leigh muttered, releasing her fingers. \u201cI was trying not to squeeze too tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Valerie said weakly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get Etienne and Rachel,\u201d Justin announced, opening the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to get Leigh in the house without help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m a beached whale,\u201d Leigh moaned, suddenly sounding teary.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey,\u201d Valerie said quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s just worried about you having a contraction while we\u2019re walking you in. It\u2019s better if we have someone to help us carry you in.\u201d</p><p>Leigh snorted with disbelief, all sign of tears gone and irritation in their place again. \u201cJustin could carry me with one hand. He\u2019s just scared I\u2019ll bite him or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, he\u2014\u201d Valerie didn\u2019t bother finishing. Leigh had gasped in pain again and was now hunched forward, head bowed as she clutched desperately at her stomach. Undoing her seat belt, she shifted to kneel in front of her, ready to help when the men got back.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d she said, rubbing Leigh\u2019s upper arm and shoulder, but she frowned when the front door opened again. Continuing to rub Leigh\u2019s shoulder, she said, \u201cI thought you were getting Etienne?\u201d</p><p>When the engine started, Valerie joined Leigh in groaning. Etienne and Rachel must not be home, she thought with dismay and said, \u201cMaybe we should just go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go to the hospital. Nanos,\u201d Leigh gasped between pants.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Valerie muttered. Turning, on her knees so she could look at Justin, she said, \u201cHow far is Dani and Decker\u2019s from here? Dani\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice died as she stared at the driver. It wasn\u2019t Justin.</p><p>\u201cOh crap,\u201d Valerie breathed.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Anders stared at Mortimer, his brain completely blank as he tried to accept the news he\u2019d just been given.</p><p>\u201cValerie and Leigh told Justin that he was supposed to take them home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I caught that,\u201d Anders interrupted tersely, his brain kicking back into gear. \u201cSkip forward to the part where some white-haired guy drives away with my life mate and Leigh. Who the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think it\u2019s the rogue.\u201d Mortimer steered the SUV through the gates and onto the road.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he muttered, and then asked grimly, \u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin called me from Etienne\u2019s phone the minute it happened. That was at almost twenty minutes after seven. I checked the clock,\u201d he added dryly, and then muttered, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>Anders shook his head at how quickly life could change. All had been right with his world just moments ago when he\u2019d arrived back at the house with the sketch artist. He\u2019d thought Valerie was safe, and that things were going well there. He\u2019d had great hope that the sketch would be done, they\u2019d identify and collect the rogue, and that with a little time Valerie would agree to be his life mate. But as he\u2019d got out of the SUV, Mortimer had strode out, headed for another SUV waiting in front of the house. The head of the Enforcers hadn\u2019t even slowed. He\u2019d barked at Sam to take care of the sketch artist, and then ordered Anders into the truck and had headed out the moment his butt had hit the seat. Anders hadn\u2019t even had his door closed yet. He\u2019d known then that there was trouble, but certainly hadn\u2019t expected this. He\u2019d left Valerie safe and secure at the Enforcer house. She should still be there. She wasn\u2019t. He was still trying to wrap his mind around that.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the van, and all our vehicles have GPS,\u201d Mortimer pointed out, eyes on the road they were racing down. \u201cThere\u2019s a tracking program in the computer on the floor between us. They were headed south when I left the house. Check it and see where they are now, then call Justin and Lucian and tell them where to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucian knows?\u201d Anders asked, reaching for the open computer on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d just left Marguerite\u2019s when I called there. He didn\u2019t have his cell phone,\u201d Mortimer reminded him. \u201cChristian and Carolyn chased him down and are riding with him. It\u2019s Christian\u2019s number you\u2019ll have to call. Use my phone. It\u2019s programmed in there,\u201d he added, pulling his phone from his pocket and passing it over.</p><p>Anders took the phone, but his attention was on the computer on his lap. It had gone into standby mode. As he waited impatiently for it to start up again, he muttered, \u201cI should have told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold who what?\u201d Mortimer asked, distractedly.</p><p>\u201cValerie, I should have told her I love her. But I figured she\u2019d think it was too soon and\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t bother finishing. The computer was back on line. He stared at the moving dots on the screen. \u201cWhich one is the van?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe green one,\u201d Mortimer answered.</p><p>\u201cStill heading south. He\u2019s on the 401,\u201d Anders announced, and then started punching numbers on the phone to let the others know.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Both of you back in your seats now.\u201d</p><p>Valerie ignored that order from the man who had hijacked the van, and continued to help Leigh around the bench seat to the open area in the back. \u201cShe\u2019s in labor. She needs to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back in your seats or I\u2019ll take control of you and make you get back in your seats,\u201d came the steely response.</p><p>\u201cOh, stuff it,\u201d Leigh snapped. \u201cI have a beach ball trying to squeeze its way out of me. I\u2019m lying down and there isn\u2019t a damned thing you can do about it. You can\u2019t control her and drive too, and you can\u2019t control me at all . . . I hope,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>The rogue didn\u2019t respond, but Valerie hardly noticed. She was glancing at Leigh worriedly as they moved to the back in a crouch. She whispered, \u201cCan immortals control each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think really old ones can control younger ones sometimes,\u201d Leigh admitted reluctantly in a whisper of her own. \u201cAt least, Marguerite\u2019s first husband controlled her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie murmured unhappily and glanced around for something to lay on the floor of the van. Spotting a blanket and first aid kit strapped under the backseat, she grabbed both and quickly opened and spread out the blanket.</p><p>\u201cHere, Leigh, let me help you,\u201d Valerie said, moving to take her arm to help her lower herself onto the blanket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lucian and the boys will come for us,\u201d Leigh reassured her as Valerie then knelt beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t come in time?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d she said firmly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, just in case they don\u2019t, I think we should come up with a plan of our own,\u201d Valerie suggested, crouching next to her and glancing around for a possible weapon.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Leigh agreed through gritted teeth. \u201cJust don\u2019t think about it much in case he reads your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Valerie muttered and began to recite song lyrics in her head. The first song to come to mind was \u201cRidin\u2019.\u201d Only instead of Ridin\u2019 dirty, the chorus kept turning into White and nerdy in her head. It was kind of annoying.</p><p>\u201cI wish Dani or Rachel were here,\u201d Leigh said on a sigh as her contraction ended.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Valerie murmured, and then to distract her, she asked, \u201cWho is Rachel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s Etienne\u2019s life mate. He\u2019s Lucian\u2019s nephew. She works in the morgue, but she\u2019s a doctor too,\u201d Leigh explained.</p><p>Valerie nodded, but commented, \u201cLucian seems to have loads of nieces and nephews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2014ahhhhh!\u201d Leigh shrieked and grabbed Valerie\u2019s shoulder, fingers digging in so hard, it made her cry out in pain too and fear they would punch right through her skin. Dear God, she was strong.</p><p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Valerie said in a strained voice once the worst of the contraction ended and the fingers in her shoulder eased.</p><p>\u201cI am breathing,\u201d Leigh gasped.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Valerie said soothingly, her eyes shifting around the van again. She didn\u2019t see anything they could use as a weapon, but she had an idea she was trying hard not to think about. If she could just find an excuse to go back to the front of the van\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWe should . . . time the . . . contractions,\u201d Leigh panted.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Valerie agreed absently. If nothing else it would keep Leigh busy. And then glancing to her sharply, she asked, \u201cDo you have a watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d She tried not to sound too happy about that as she peered over her shoulder to the front of the van. Their kidnapper probably had one.</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She turned back and leaned closer when Leigh tugged on her hand.</p><p>\u201cScream,\u201d she whispered, staring her in the eye. Leigh then let out a long, agonized shriek again. She didn\u2019t, however, grab for Valerie\u2019s shoulder or hand again, but simply met her gaze calmly and began to beetle her eyebrows up and down until Valerie caught on and began to shriek along with her.</p><p>\u201cShut up back there,\u201d their hijacker growled.</p> <p>Leigh let her shriek die off slowly, and when Valerie too fell silent, snapped out a suggestion to their hijacker that was really physically impossible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in labor,\u201d she barked. \u201cIt hurts. I\u2019m going to scream my head off. If you don\u2019t like it, let us go.\u201d</p><p>She then let out another howl of pain. This one was real though. Valerie could tell by the fact that Leigh had latched on to and was crushing her wrist. Damn, she was going to be lucky to get out of this without broken bones, and not from their kidnapper, Valerie thought, shrieking along with the woman.</p><p>The van immediately filled with loud music. Classical, and cranked all the way up, to try to drown out the racket they were making, Valerie supposed. And that had been exactly what Leigh had been hoping for, she realized when Leigh\u2019s shriek ended a moment later on a grunt of satisfaction and she pulled Valerie closer to hiss, \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. She was pretty sure the rogue hadn\u2019t kidnapped them to return her to her cage and feed off her slowly again. He was probably worried about her having seen the portrait. So worried that he\u2019d risked taking Leigh. He couldn\u2019t let either of them go now.</p><p>\u201cHe must plan on killing both of us,\u201d Leigh added. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Valerie agreed, not at all sure Leigh could hear her over the music. She was hardly able to hear Leigh and was mostly reading her lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd the baby,\u201d Leigh added, glancing down and rubbing her stomach. \u201cWe can\u2019t let him kill the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she said soothingly.</p><p>Valerie was just thinking how amazing it was that mothers bonded with their child even before birth, when Leigh added grimly, \u201cNot after I\u2019ve gone through all this crap to carry it to term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Valerie murmured and wondered if it was the hormones talking right now, or Leigh was possessed. Honestly, this was not the woman who had been her host since she\u2019d woken up from her fever. But whether it was hormones or possession, Valerie couldn\u2019t say. She didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with pregnant mothers, at least not of the two-legged variety. Dogs, cats, horses, and cows just didn\u2019t act like this.</p><p>\u201cThe SUVs all have weapons and blood cases,\u201d Leigh hissed. \u201cMaybe the van does too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything,\u201d Valerie muttered, glancing around again.</p><p>\u201cCheck the floor and side panels. They hide them in case the vehicles are stolen by mortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart,\u201d Valerie commented and began to crawl around the floor, tapping here and there and then feeling along the wall. She was about to give up, when she noted a seam in the side panel on the side of the van where she was feeling around. Valerie peered at it briefly, and then pressed along the edges. When that had no effect, she instinctively pressed her fingers in and dragged them to the left. A little puff of relief slid through her when the panel moved, opening a couple of inches.</p><p>Valerie glanced nervously toward the front of the van, but the bench seat was offering her cover, so she slid the panel further open and bit her lip as she stared at what she\u2019d revealed. Under the thin panel was a toolboard, a panel with rows of small holes in it where tools were clipped into place: screwdrivers, wrenches, hacksaws, hammers, mallets, tape . . .</p><p>\u201cTake the saw,\u201d Leigh advised, crawling up beside her. \u201cYou can hack off his head.\u201d</p><p>Valerie cast her a look of disbelief, and then took down a mallet and the duct tape instead. Setting them both on the floor, she slid the panel shut and turned back to Leigh. \u201cWe need to find a way to brace you in case we swerve or something.\u201d</p><p>Both of them considered the space, and then Valerie suggested, \u201cTurn sideways and brace yourself between the wheel wells.\u201d</p><p>Leigh shifted to do as suggested, bracing her feet against one wheel well, but it wasn\u2019t wide enough for her to lie flat. It was only about four feet and four or five inches by Valerie\u2019s guess. The other wheel well came up an inch or two below the base of Leigh\u2019s neck.</p><p>Valerie leaned over her and suggested, \u201cBend your legs and lay your back and head flat.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been sure Leigh would hear her over the music, but apparently she could. That or she was reading lips too, because Leigh did as instructed.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can brace yourself like that?\u201d Valerie asked uncertainly.</p><p>Leigh hesitated, and then raised her hands, placing them against the van wall on either side of her head. She followed that up by pressing her feet against the metal above the wheel wells on the opposite wall. She tensed briefly, pushing into both surfaces and then relaxed and nodded at Valerie.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Valerie managed an encouraging smile and then glanced toward the front of the van, but turned back when Leigh suddenly grabbed her arm just below the elbow. She understood why when Leigh began to shriek and squeeze.</p><p>Valerie groaned and waited for the latest contraction to end, then quickly stuffed the duct tape and mallet down the front of her jeans and said, \u201cWe really need to time these. I\u2019ll see if Count Rip-Your-Throat-Out has a watch.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to sound like she was up to something, she said it in a normal speaking voice, hoping their hijacker\u2019s immortal hearing would pick it up despite the loud music. Then she exchanged a glance with Leigh and shifted to a crouch, bending forward to hide the lumps in the front of her pants as she started back up toward the front of the van again. The whole way she just kept thinking, \u201cI need a watch, I need a watch, we have to time these contractions, I need a watch,\u201d over and over in the hopes that there wouldn\u2019t be any vestiges of her plan in her surface thoughts.</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t know if he caught a glimpse of her in the rearview mirror, or just sensed her approach, but she was just moving around the bench seat when the rogue shouted something at her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear him over the loud music, but suspected he was telling her to get back in the back. Ironic, since just moments ago he\u2019d wanted them to stay in their seats, she thought, but simply yelled, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you. We need a watch.\u201d</p><p>He shouted again and turned to glare at her as she continued forward, but she shook her head, pointed at her ear, and yelled, \u201cCan\u2019t hear you! We need a watch! I have to time her contractions!\u201d</p><p>Jerking impatiently forward, he snapped off the music and began to yell again, just as Leigh began to shriek.</p><p>Pausing, Valerie turned and leaned over the backseat, resting one knee on it as she peered back at Leigh. Relief coursed through her when she saw her expression and realized she was faking it. A moment later though, that relief died when Leigh\u2019s eyes suddenly widened and the shriek grew louder as a real contraction hit her.</p><p>Damn, I am never having babies, Valerie thought with dismay as Leigh clutched at her stomach and began to almost writhe on the floor in agony.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong,\u201d Leigh gasped as soon as she could speak.</p><p>Valerie hesitated, torn between hurrying back to the woman and continuing forward. But forward was the only answer. He\u2019d kill them all while she was busy trying to deliver the baby if she went back now. When Leigh relaxed again with a moan as the contraction ended, and then immediately braced herself again, Valerie felt every muscle in her own body tighten. It was a go.</p><p>\u201cGet in the back!\u201d</p><p>Valerie grabbed the center seat belt with her left hand and weaved it around to wrap the belt twice around her wrist as she slid the mallet out of the top of her pants. She then pushed herself off the bench seat and swung back toward the driver\u2019s seat, keeping the mallet down, and, she hoped, out of his sight.</p><p>\u201cI need to borrow your watch to time the contractions,\u201d she said grimly as her gaze slid over the road ahead. They were on the highway, but he was slowing and steering onto an off-ramp, she saw. Her eyes shifted to the speedometer as it dropped from one hundred kilometers an hour to ninety . . . eighty . . . seventy . . .</p><p>They were in the curve, still going too fast, but the speed was still dropping when he suddenly turned his head toward her. For some reason, that seemed ominous to Valerie. Afraid that he was going to read her, or\u2014even worse\u2014take control of her, she tightened her hold on the seat belt and swung the mallet at his head.</p><p>You\u2019d have thought she\u2019d hit the steering wheel and spun it herself with the mallet rather than slamming it into his temple. His head whipped to the left, but so did the steering wheel. Valerie cried out and dropped the mallet, grabbing for the front passenger seat instead to keep from flying around as the van shot off the road, and toward a line of trees ten feet to the side of it.</p><p>Despite the burning pain in her wrist and along her left arm as the seat belt jerked at her hold, Valerie was glad she\u2019d had the forethought to entangle her wrist in it. Otherwise, she surely would have flown out the front window. As it was, she bounced around between the seats, slamming into one padded surface and then another as they careened over the grassy veldt, and then they slammed into a tree.</p><p>Valerie screamed as she was thrown forward on impact, sure her arm had been dislocated. She then nearly bit off her tongue as she fell backward onto the bench seat. She didn\u2019t stay there long once they came to a halt. She knew she couldn\u2019t afford to and pushed herself forward off the seat, crashing to her knees on the floor as she reached for the dropped mallet.</p><p>She wanted to check on Leigh. Valerie thought she\u2019d heard the other woman scream during the accident, but had been screaming herself so couldn\u2019t be sure. However, there was no time to check on her just then. Count Rip-Your-Throat-Out appeared a little dazed from her blow, but the airbag had prevented his gaining any more injuries, and he was stirring.</p><p>Grabbing the mallet, Valerie straightened and hit him with it again, this time on top of his head. Much to her relief, he moaned and collapsed against the deflated airbag and steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cLeigh?\u201d she shouted, pulling out the duct tape. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>A groan sounded from the back and Valerie frowned, but quickly began duct taping the driver to his seat, drawing the tape across his chest, around the back of the seat, and then across his chest over and over again in quick succession as she shouted, \u201cHang on. I\u2019ll be right there . . . Okay?\u201d she added worriedly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another groan sounded, and Valerie bit her lip, but ran the tape around a dozen more times before deciding it was good. Leaving the tape hanging down the back of the seat, she then braced herself on both the driver\u2019s seat and the backseat for leverage as she staggered half upright.</p><p>Much to her surprise, Valerie\u2019s legs nearly gave out beneath her. Gritting her teeth, she forced them straight and began to move around the bench seat in a crouch.</p><p>Leigh was lying on the floor clutching her stomach, but it looked like she hadn\u2019t been banged around too terribly badly. At least Valerie didn\u2019t see any lacerations or bumps or bruises.</p> <p>\u201cThe rogue?\u201d Leigh gasped with concern as Valerie knelt beside her.</p><p>\u201cI duct taped him to his seat,\u201d she assured her. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Leigh\u2019s eyes went wide with alarm. \u201cThat won\u2019t hold him. He\u2019s immortal.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned and glanced toward the front of the van, but couldn\u2019t see him past the bench seat from that angle. Biting her lip, she rose up on her knees to get a better view, relieved to see that he wasn\u2019t moving. Turning back, she said, \u201cI knocked him out first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t stay unconscious long and the tape won\u2019t hold him when he wakes up,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cGo check that he isn\u2019t awake already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look to be,\u201d Valerie assured her turning away for another look anyway.</p><p>\u201cHe could be faking it. If he wakes up, he\u2019ll kill us all,\u201d the last was said in almost a scream as she clutched at her stomach.</p><p>Another contraction, Valerie realized with concern.</p><p>Grinding her teeth a moment later as the contraction apparently began to ease, Leigh growled, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the baby. I need you here, but not if he isn\u2019t out of commission. Go cut his head off or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Valerie asked with disbelief. \u201cWho do you think I am? The Queen of Hearts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, if you were you\u2019d already have cut his head off,\u201d Leigh snapped and then groaned in agony.</p> <p>Valerie hesitated, her gaze shooting from Leigh to the driver, and then she sighed and shifted to her feet, muttering, \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>Mallet in hand, she moved quickly back around the bench seat to peer worriedly at the rogue. He appeared to be just as she\u2019d left him, but then Valerie thought she saw one eyelid twitch. Afraid he was faking still being unconscious as Leigh had said, she slammed the mallet into his head again. She was satisfied that she\u2019d been right when a little sigh slipped from his lips and his head sagged further forward. He had been faking it. Crap. What was she supposed to do here? She couldn\u2019t cut off his head. That was just\u2014</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Valerie muttered, and then glanced sharply toward the back of the van when Leigh cried out again. This was ridiculous. She couldn\u2019t watch the rogue and Leigh too with the seat in the way. And she couldn\u2019t cut off an unconscious man\u2019s head, rogue or not.</p><p>Cursing, she peered at the bench seat, noting the latching legs. Valerie then peered to the sliding side door. They\u2019d crashed head-on into the tree, hitting it with the front driver\u2019s side. There was nothing blocking the door. Moving to it, she grabbed the handle and opened it, sliding it back until it locked into place, then she moved back in front of the bench seat.</p><p>Valerie started to kneel, but then turned to the rogue and smashed the mallet into his skull again just to be safe. Satisfied that she had a couple minutes at least, she then knelt and quickly pulled up the handles to free the seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Leigh gasped out as the contractions ended.</p><p>\u201cThe best I can,\u201d Valerie said simply as she began to maneuver the seat toward the door. She managed to get it to the mouth of the door with some effort, and then just shoved it out to somersault across the grass.</p><p>Leaving the door open, Valerie then turned back to hammer the rogue in the head again. She didn\u2019t feel bad for doing it. He was immortal. They healed. Besides, it was better than trying to cut his head off with a hacksaw. The very thought made her shudder as she turned to head back to Leigh in a crouch.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to pull you up behind the seats,\u201d she announced, bending to grab the corners of the blanket Leigh lay on. As she dragged her up the van, she added, \u201cThat way I can keep hitting him while trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, her words made Leigh laugh. Mind you, the sound was a bit hysterical, Valerie noted.</p><p>Once she had Leigh directly behind the front seats, Valerie released the blanket, and then turned, and smacked the rogue over the head again, which just made Leigh laugh harder. Shaking her head, Valerie quickly leaned over the front passenger seat to look for the phone Leigh had dropped earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d Leigh asked through her laughter.</p><p>\u201cLooking for Justin\u2019s phone to call for help. It should be here somewhere. You\u2014 Ah ha!\u201d she exclaimed as she spotted it.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d Anders cursed into the phone as he spotted the crashed van in the trees beside the curve. Mortimer had driven like the wind to catch up to the other vehicle. Anders had been on the phone with Lucian when he\u2019d seen the van\u2019s blinker come on, and had immediately told him the exit number for the off-ramp they were taking. He\u2019d then hung up to call Justin on Etienne\u2019s phone and give him the same information.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Justin asked with concern on the other end of the line.</p><p>Anders didn\u2019t explain. \u201cGet Rachel here as quickly as you can,\u201d he barked, and ended the call.</p><p>\u201cIs that the bench seat?\u201d Mortimer asked, a frown in his voice. \u201cWhy the hell is he throwing it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? Hurry up, dammit. They need us.\u201d Anders snapped, dumping the computer on the floor and climbing out of his seat. He grunted and dropped to his knees on the backseat when Mortimer steered the SUV off the road and began to bump quickly across the uneven grass. Leaning over the seat then, he reached down to open the weapons locker. Anders had just retrieved two guns when his phone began to ring. Shifting the guns to one hand, he pulled his phone out and frowned when he saw Justin\u2019s name on the caller I.D.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he barked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cSemmy?\u201d</p><p>No one had ever called him that but Valerie. If he hadn\u2019t recognized her voice, that would have told him who it was, but he did recognize her voice, as well as the stress in it. He heard a muffled, \u201cWho\u2019s Semmy?\u201d in a voice he suspected was Leigh\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cValerie, honey?\u201d he said, before she could answer. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Turning on the seat, he peered toward the van as Mortimer came to a halt behind it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Valerie said, and then blurted, \u201cWe were carjacked by the rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey,\u201d Anders said, wishing he could somehow pull her through the phone to safety. No doubt the rogue had spotted their approach and made her call to tell them to back off. Mortimer must suspect as much as well. He\u2019d put the SUV in park, but then had turned in the seat to listen to his side of the conversation, waiting to hear what the situation was.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she sounded surprised. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie!\u201d Leigh cried in the background.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Valerie cursed, and then there was a clatter as the phone was dropped and sounds in the background, including a loud thwack that made Anders peer desperately at the van, trying to see what was happening through the small, blackened back windows.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Valerie muttered a moment later.</p><p>\u201cI swear I saw his eyelid twitch,\u201d Leigh\u2019s voice came faintly, and Anders frowned. He didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about, but it was more the sound of her voice that bothered him. It was like she was talking through gritted teeth, and then either she or Valerie began to shriek and there was another clatter as the phone was dropped again.</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d Anders shouted.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s screaming?\u201d Mortimer asked, able to hear it from where he sat.</p><p>Cursing, Anders handed Mortimer one of the guns, shoved the other into the top of his jeans and then turned and pulled the door beside him open. He still had the phone pressed to his ear and was shouting Valerie\u2019s name as he climbed out of the SUV. Anders pulled his gun as he ran toward the van, vaguely aware that Mortimer had jumped out of the SUV and was following.</p><p>Anders saw that the sliding side door was still open as he neared it and ran right up to it; phone still to his ear, terror in his heart, and gun in his hand . . . and then he just stood there, staring. Inside, Leigh was hunched on the van floor, clutching Valerie\u2019s hand and shrieking. Valerie was on her knees, howling along with the woman, but even as he looked in, she turned and thumped the driver\u2019s seat with what appeared to be a mallet.</p><p>Not the driver\u2019s seat, he realized as she lowered the mallet and sank to sit on her heels. It was the rogue she\u2019d thumped.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d Mortimer muttered beside him. \u201cLooks like the girls saved themselves.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cI need my phone.\u201d</p><p>Anders barely heard the words over the screams coming from the van, but turned blankly to glance at Mortimer, who was holding out his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stuck to your ear,\u201d Mortimer said helpfully. \u201cI want to call Lucian and let him know we\u2019ve caught up to the women and they\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Anders lowered the phone and handed it over. He then watched Mortimer walk around the van toward the driver\u2019s side, punching in numbers.</p><p>Sighing with relief as the shrieks from the women began to slow and grow less vociferous, Anders shoved the gun down the back of his pants and stepped up to the open side door of the van. But he waited for it to end altogether before asking, \u201cAre you both all right?\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s head jerked his way, her eyes wide and mouth open. Obviously she hadn\u2019t realized they were right behind the van when she\u2019d called him. But then the back windows of the van were high and she wouldn\u2019t have been able to see through them, kneeling as she was.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here so fast?\u201d she asked, retrieving her hand from Leigh\u2019s now loose grip and wincing as she rubbed it. Spotting the impressions in her hand from Leigh\u2019s squeezing, Anders began to understand why she\u2019d been shrieking. He had wondered. Leigh\u2019s screaming he\u2019d understood, but he hadn\u2019t been sure if Valerie was just screaming in sympathy with her or what.</p><p>\u201cWe were right behind you when you called,\u201d Anders explained, his gaze shooting to the driver\u2019s side window when Mortimer appeared there. Apparently, he\u2019d finished his call. Now, the man reached through the window to grab the rogue\u2019s head and turn it his way so he could examine him. In the next moment, he jerked his arm back out the window with a shouted, \u201cWhoa!\u201d as Valerie suddenly grabbed up the mallet and turned to whack the rogue again, nearly pulverizing Mortimer\u2019s hand in the process.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie said, sounding surprised. \u201cSorry, I heard movement and thought he was stirring again.\u201d</p><p>Anders bit his lip and leaned into the van. \u201cMaybe you should give me that.\u201d</p><p>Valerie handed over the mallet with apparent relief, and then said, \u201cWe have to get Leigh to either Rachel or Dani. She\u2019s in labor and it\u2019s not going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtienne and Justin are bringing Rachel right now. They should be here soon,\u201d he assured her, his gaze finally moving to Leigh. The woman lay shaking on the van floor, her face pale and sweaty. He\u2019d smelled blood since moving up to the open door and had at first assumed it was from the rogue\u2019s head wound, but he was beginning to think perhaps it was coming from Leigh as well. The smell was strong when he leaned in to peer at her.</p><p>\u201cLeigh? Are you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Leigh moaned and shook her head weakly where she lay. \u201cI think something\u2019s wrong. It hurts too much.\u201d</p><p>Anders frowned, but kept his concern out of his voice as he said, \u201cHang on. Rachel will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he shifted where he stood, feeling useless. It was Valerie who bent over the woman and asked, \u201cIs there any way we can make you more comfortable until she gets here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get that bastard out of the front seat and cut his head off,\u201d Leigh said weakly.</p><p>Valerie grimaced and glanced to Anders, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s delirious. She keeps thinking I\u2019m Jeffrey Dahmer or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s the Queen of Hearts, remember?\u201d Leigh said on a weak laugh, and then added wearily, \u201cJust get him out of here and make sure he doesn\u2019t escape or rise up and kill us all while you three are distracted watching me try to squeeze out Lucian\u2019s humongous progeny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Mortimer announced, opening the driver\u2019s side door when Anders glanced his way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d Anders asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014 Jesus, you wrapped him up in duct tape,\u201d Mortimer said with disgust, and began ripping at the silver tape, muttering the whole time about the job being worse than Justin\u2019s gift wrapping.</p><p>Shaking his head, Anders turned his attention back to the women as Valerie urged Leigh to the opposite side of the van so she could lean up against the side panel. His gaze dropped to the spot where she\u2019d been lying and he frowned and leaned in, feeling the darker patch in the middle of the blanket. It was huge, and glistening, and his hand came away red with blood.</p> <p>\u201cMortimer!\u201d he barked, straightening.</p><p>The Enforcer paused with the rogue half out of his seat and raised an eyebrow. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>Anders turned his hand for him to see. \u201cIs there blood in the SUV?\u201d</p><p>Mortimer\u2019s mouth tightened and he shook his head. \u201cThis was all unexpected. The only thing I grabbed was the computer on the way out.\u201d He dumped the rogue back in his seat, and pulled his phone back out of his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll call Lucian and see if he has blood. If he doesn\u2019t, maybe Rachel will have thought to grab some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. You can ask Lucian in person,\u201d Anders said as the sound of a slowing engine drew his gaze toward the road in time to see an SUV steer onto the grass, heading their way. Lucian was at the wheel.</p> <p>Grunting, Mortimer put his phone away and dragged the rogue out to heft him over his shoulder. He then carried his burden out of view as he headed for the arriving vehicle. Anders watched until Mortimer appeared at the back of the van, and then turned his attention to the interior of the van as Valerie left Leigh and crawled across the van to him.</p><p>\u201cHow long until Rachel gets here?\u201d she asked worriedly. \u201cThere\u2019s something really wrong and Leigh\u2019s losing strength fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you help her?\u201d Anders asked with a frown. He knew Justin, Etienne, and Rachel were a good ten minutes behind Lucian. Rachel had insisted on taking the time to get a medical kit of everything she might need together before leaving the house. Justin had mentioned that in one of the calls.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I might be able to help her,\u201d Valerie said cautiously. \u201cAnd I was going to offer, but she keeps saying she wishes Rachel or Dani were here and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d be comfortable with my examining her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel and Dani aren\u2019t here,\u201d Anders said quietly. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Lucian suddenly loomed beside them, worry knitting his brow.</p> <p>\u201cInside,\u201d Anders said, and caught Valerie by the waist to lift her out of the van and out of the way. He\u2019d barely set her feet on the ground when Leigh screamed out again and began to writhe in the van.</p><p>Lucian was inside and at her side in the blink of an eye, his face almost as bloodless as Leigh\u2019s as he scooped her into his lap and held her through the pain.</p><p>\u201cValerie,\u201d Lucian barked the minute Leigh\u2019s shrieks ended and she sank into an exhausted heap in his arms.</p><p>Anders lifted Valerie back into the van, and followed to kneel on one side of Lucian as Valerie knelt on the other.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d Lucian growled. \u201cLeigh\u2019s in too much pain.\u201d</p><p>Despite the concerns she\u2019d mentioned to Anders, Valerie tried to soothe the man, saying, \u201cLeigh is in labor, Lucian. It\u2019s painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this painful,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lost a lot of blood, Valerie,\u201d Anders said quietly. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be this much blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlood?\u201d Valerie glanced to him with surprise and he realized that she hadn\u2019t noticed the blood. He should have realized, of course. Her senses weren\u2019t as acute as his and the blanket was dark, as was the black and red maternity dress Leigh wore.</p><p>Anders gestured to the large slightly darker spot on the blanket and she stared at it blankly, and then turned back to Lucian. \u201cWhere is Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo far away to help right now,\u201d Lucian said grimly. \u201cHelp her.\u201d</p><p>Valerie glanced to Leigh uncertainly and asked, \u201cIs it all right if I examine you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make it stop,\u201d Leigh begged.</p><p>That was enough for Valerie. Shoulders straightening, she glanced to Anders and said, \u201cCheck the first-aid kit and see if you can find hand sanitzers, or wound cleaners or something.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded and moved to do as she asked, but his attention was on her as she then turned to Lucian and said, \u201cRemove her panties and turn her to sit between your legs. You can support her back and comfort her while I examine her.\u201d</p><p>Lucian did as instructed, quickly tugging down Leigh\u2019s panties and then settling her on the blanket on the van floor between his legs. He then wrapped his arms around her gently, resting them over her stomach as he pressed a kiss to the side of her temple and murmured encouragingly to her.</p><p>\u201cAnders, have you found anything I can use to clean my hands?\u201d Valerie asked, as she knelt at Leigh\u2019s feet and arranged her legs, setting her feet outside of Lucian\u2019s legs so that her knees were bent and his legs acted like stirrups of a sort, keeping her from closing her legs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about cleaning your hands,\u201d Lucian growled.</p><p>\u201cBut she could get an infection and\u2014\u201d Valerie paused and shook her head. \u201cRight. Immortal. The nanos will take care of any infection,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Anders turned his attention back to the first-aid kit as Valerie began her examination. He rifled through the contents in search of anything that might be useful, but didn\u2019t expect to find anything. Mostly, he wanted to give Leigh some semblance of privacy.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is sideways,\u201d Valerie announced suddenly, her voice grim. \u201cChrist, she\u2019s bleeding badly. Where the hell is Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the baby out,\u201d Lucian barked and Valerie jerked her head up to peer at him.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a cesarean section, Lucian. I don\u2019t have the equipment to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you turn the baby yourself?\u201d Anders asked.</p><p>Valerie frowned. \u201cMaybe if her water hadn\u2019t broken, and I had the right drugs to make her uterus relax . . . and an epidural to ease her discomfort. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already in agony, Valerie. You can\u2019t hurt her any more than she\u2019s already suffering,\u201d Lucian said grimly. \u201cAnd you have to get the baby out now if it is to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Valerie stared at him in shock. \u201cBut he\u2019s an immortal baby. I thought that meant survival would be a sure thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt usually is,\u201d Anders said quietly, dragging the first-aid kit with him as he moved over to join them. \u201cFetuses with any genetic anomalies are aborted by the nanos during the first trimester, but after that, so long as the mother takes in enough blood, the baby is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then\u2014\u201d Valerie began.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s losing too much blood,\u201d Lucian interrupted. \u201cAnd if the nanos see the baby as a threat to Leigh\u2019s well-being, they will attack and try to kill the baby. The baby\u2019s nanos will fight back. If enough damage is done and the nanos kill each other off we could lose one or even both of them.\u201d</p><p>When Valerie stared at Lucian with incomprehension, Anders said, \u201cThink of it like a nuclear war inside the body. So long as no one launches, everything is peachy. But if the nukes are launched, or in this case, the nanos start attacking each other, no one gets out alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Valerie breathed, going pale.</p><p>\u201cCan you get the baby out?\u201d Anders asked quietly.</p><p>Valerie hesitated. \u201cWe could try a cesarean section, but I\u2019d need a knife and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would increase the blood loss and raise the risk of the nanos attacking before you can get the baby out,\u201d Lucian interrupted. \u201cWe need to turn the baby and get it out now.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stared at him silently, but then said, \u201cShe\u2019s fully dilated. I can try to turn the baby manually, but it\u2019s risky and you\u2019ll need to hold her still.\u201d</p><p>Lucian nodded once.</p><p>Sighing, Valerie hesitated and then turned and crawled out of the van. Standing in the open door, she patted the floor of the van. \u201cBring her forward.\u201d</p><p>When Lucian moved both himself and Leigh to the edge of the van, Valerie nodded and knelt in the grass, but before she could do anything, another contraction hit Leigh and she arched in Lucian\u2019s arms, shrieking her head off.</p><p>\u201cHelp her!\u201d Lucian shouted.</p><p>\u201cI have to wait for the contraction to end,\u201d Valerie said helplessly and they all waited. It seemed to Anders to go on forever, but finally, Leigh\u2019s screaming ended on a moan and she passed out in Lucian\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cSpread her legs more and keep them open,\u201d Valerie said at once and then set to work the moment Lucian complied.</p><p>Anders held his breath as he waited behind the couple. He knew exactly what Valerie was doing, she was using a technique he\u2019d seen used ages ago on a mare in trouble. She was physically easing her hand in to try to turn the baby\u2019s head down so it could be born. He also knew that if another contraction hit Leigh while Valerie\u2019s hand was inside her . . . well, immortal muscles crushing down around a mortal\u2019s bones was never a good thing, Anders thought grimly and then glanced past her when Mortimer appeared.</p><p>\u201cJustin\u2019s just pulling\u2014 Whoa!\u201d Mortimer interrupted himself and turned abruptly away as he realized what he\u2019d walked up on.</p><p>\u201cSee if they have blood,\u201d Lucian barked and then turned his attention to Valerie when she frowned and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something pressing down on . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPressing down on what?\u201d Anders asked, when she paused a semi-perplexed look on her face. In the next moment, her eyes suddenly widened and she exclaimed, \u201cThere\u2019s a second baby pressing down on the first. It\u2019s why the baby couldn\u2019t turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins!\u201d Mortimer exclaimed, forgetting himself and turning back, only to turn green and swing abruptly away. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the blood if they have any.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s face was scrunched up with concentration. \u201cI think I can\u2014that should do it,\u201d she muttered and leaned back slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do and did it work?\u201d Anders asked. Valerie didn\u2019t bother to answer, Leigh\u2019s sudden shriek would have drowned it out anyway. In the next moment, Lucian and Leigh\u2019s first child was lying silent and still in Valerie\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d Lucian asked anxiously, cradling Leigh and rocking her gently from side to side as she sank back against him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d Valerie said, holding her to her chest and rubbing her back until the baby coughed and began to breathe normally, her little arms beginning to wave now.</p><p>Anders saw the relief on Valerie\u2019s face and knew the baby\u2019s stillness had worried her.</p><p>\u201cI need something to cut the cord,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can help with that,\u201d Rachel announced, appearing behind her and frowning as she peered at Leigh.</p><p>\u201cValerie, this is Rachel,\u201d Anders announced, reaching past Lucian\u2019s shoulder to take the blood bags she was holding out. He passed the first one to Lucian, and held the second one while Lucian popped the first bag to Leigh\u2019s teeth. She didn\u2019t even appear to be conscious, he noted.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Rachel. If you have something to cut the cord, we should do it quickly,\u201d Valerie said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the second baby is going to wait long to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins?\u201d Rachel asked, a smile claiming her lips. But she didn\u2019t react at once to Valerie\u2019s suggestion. Instead, she watched Lucian tear the now empty bag from Leigh\u2019s teeth and replace it with a fresh one. Anders didn\u2019t know what she was looking for, but after a moment, she relaxed and turned to gesture to someone Anders couldn\u2019t see. Etienne, he realized when the man appeared in the opening, a large duffel bag in hand that he opened for Rachel to dig through. After a moment, she turned back with surgical scissors and clamps.</p><p>Valerie held the baby as Rachel made quick work of the umbilical cord, and then offered, \u201cI can take the baby if you want to take over here.\u201d</p><p>Rachel grinned, but shook her head. \u201cAre you kidding? You\u2019ve done all the hard work. This is the fun stuff. I wouldn\u2019t take that away from you,\u201d she said, taking the baby and using a wet nap to clean her up as much as possible before wrapping her in a blanket.</p><p>Valerie watched silently, but turned back to Leigh when she groaned around the blood bag in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBear down, Leigh,\u201d Valerie ordered. \u201cPush.\u201d</p><p>Within moments, the second baby emerged to join the world. This one began to squawl and wriggle about at once, arms and legs flailing as Valerie sat back on her heels with it in her hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA boy,\u201d she announced and met his gaze with a smile.</p><p>When canine whining roused Valerie from a deep sleep, she eased one eyelid open and scowled at the furry face in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d she muttered with disgust. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t let me sleep in this one time? Just this once? I mean it was only four A.M. when I finally crawled into bed last night. But you can\u2019t let me sleep?\u201d</p> <p>Roxy whined again, shifting on the spot, and Valerie sighed.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, pushing herself wearily to her hands and knees to get up. She then froze as she took note of the man in bed beside her. Anders. Damn. He wasn\u2019t there when she\u2019d crawled into bed last night. He hadn\u2019t even been at the house. Once the second baby was born and Leigh had been fed three or four bags of blood, they\u2019d deemed it time to move and everyone had come back to the house. Well, everyone but Mortimer, who had taken the rogue back to the Enforcer house to be locked up. He\u2019d returned later with Sam, though, so she could see the babies.</p><p>It seemed like half of Toronto had arrived at the house last night to see the babies. Valerie had been introduced to at least two dozen new people, all related in some way or another to Lucian and Leigh. And those people had stayed hours, trying to help as Leigh and Lucian had debated on the babies\u2019 names.</p><p>It seemed Leigh had refused to pick names before the baby was born. She\u2019d miscarried a previous child and had gained some superstitions from the loss. One of those superstitions was a fear that if she picked names before the baby was born, it wouldn\u2019t be born. Or they wouldn\u2019t, since the baby had turned out to be two.</p><p>No decisions had been made, though there had been a couple of suggestions Leigh and Lucian were considering. The party had finally broken up at four A.M., when Lucian and Anders had decided it was time to go question their rogue.</p> <p>Before joining everyone at casa bambino, Mortimer had tried to get answers out of the man as to where Laura, Billie, and Kathy were, or if they were even still alive, but the rogue hadn\u2019t been very forthcoming, refusing even to give his name. So after relaxing for a bit, and enjoying his new family, Lucian had decided it was time to get those answers. Anders, Mortimer, Sam, and Justin, as well as a couple of the other men, had gone with him.</p><p>Much to Valerie\u2019s relief, everyone else but Rachel and Etienne had left then. But the doctor and her game-creator husband were going to stay for a day or two to help Leigh with the babies, so Valerie had felt it was all right to finally find her bed. It had been an extremely long day and she\u2019d been exhausted, so after letting Roxy out to take care of business, she\u2019d tripped upstairs, stripped off her clothes and fallen into bed. Alone.</p><p>Valerie stared at Anders now, taking in the fact that he was fully clothed and on top of the blankets. But when Roxy whined again, she shushed her, and eased carefully out of bed.</p><p>Rather than hunt around in her drawers in the dark room or risk turning on a light and waking Anders, Valerie felt around for her clothes from the day before and then tugged them on one at a time. She was so tired, she didn\u2019t even care if they were on inside out. She also didn\u2019t bother brushing her hair or teeth and simply led Roxy out of the room. Valerie had every intention of climbing back into bed the minute Roxy had eaten and done her business. Two hours of sleep just was not enough for her system to function with any kind of clarity. Besides, she deserved a sleep in. She\u2019d bested a bad guy and delivered two babies the day before.</p><p>The thought made her smile. The babies were adorable little bundles, and Lucian had been strutting about like the prize bull at the fair as everyone had fawned over them last night. As for Leigh, once she\u2019d been given a couple more bags of blood at the house, all signs of the \u201coff with his head\u201d woman had vanished. She was back to her sweet laughing self. Valerie had been rather relieved by that.</p><p>Speak of the devil, Valerie thought as she entered the kitchen/living room and spotted Leigh by the island with one of her little bundles of joy. Baby girl, she realized, noting the pink baby blanket.</p> <p>\u201cFeeding time?\u201d Valerie asked as she approached.</p><p>\u201cBurping time,\u201d Leigh corrected wryly. \u201cFeeding time ended fifteen minutes ago, but she hasn\u2019t burped and won\u2019t settle.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, but frowned. \u201cShould you be up and about already? Do you want me to take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Leigh assured her with a laugh, and then added wryly, \u201cImmortal, remember? Half a dozen bags of blood and the nanos fixed me right up. I\u2019m good as new.\u201d</p><p>Valerie raised her eyebrows. \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Leigh smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut you must be tired,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>Leigh shook her head. \u201cWe can do without sleep if we pump up the blood consumption.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Valerie asked with amazement and not a little envy.</p><p>Leigh nodded. \u201cOf course we try not to do that much. It means more blood, and it\u2019s always best to be conservative on blood use. But sometimes, like now, it\u2019s hard to avoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Well, that will make motherhood a lot less painful. The lack of sleep is the thing most new mothers and fathers complain about,\u201d Valerie commented and then glanced down to Roxy when she nudged her hand with a wet nose.</p><p>\u201cYou can let her out,\u201d Leigh said, smiling at Roxy. \u201cI turned off the alarm when I heard you moving around upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Valerie moved to the French doors and opened one to let Roxy out, then closed and leaned against it as she asked Leigh, \u201cDecided on names yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leigh admitted with a sigh and cuddled her little girl close briefly. Easing her hold, she admitted, \u201cI really didn\u2019t think it would be this hard. Shouldn\u2019t you just look at them and know what their name should be?\u201d</p><p>Valerie chuckled at the suggestion. \u201cSure. That\u2019s how the seven dwarfs became Sneezy, Bashful, Grumpy, Happy, Dopey, Sleepy, and Doc, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Leigh grinned, but then wrinkled her nose. \u201cIn that case, this little girl should be called Smelly . . . or Poopy. I think it\u2019s diaper-change time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Speaking of . . . I guess I\u2019d better find the waste pick-up bags and go tend to my little girl,\u201d Valerie said, pushing herself away from the door to move into the kitchen and fetch the bags.</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Leigh said, heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Valerie called out with a laugh as she grabbed the bags from the drawer and headed outside.</p><p>Roxy hurried eagerly to her side as Valerie stepped out onto the covered porch. Giving the German shepherd a pet, she promised, \u201cI\u2019ll feed you in a minute. Just let me collect all your little gifts from last night and this morning first.\u201d</p><p>Roxy barked and pressed against her side, eliciting a smile and another pet from Valerie. She didn\u2019t think the dog understood what she\u2019d said. Well, except perhaps for feed. She was pretty sure Roxy understood that word. But her not understanding had never stopped Valerie talking to her before. She\u2019d had whole conversations with the German shepherd, pouring out her troubles and cares to the dog. Roxy always watched her, bright-eyed, and tongue lolling, giving the occasional bark. She appeared just happy to have her attention. It was part of her charm.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Valerie said, starting across the yard in search of Roxy treasures. \u201cWhat do you think of Anders? Should I agree to be his life mate or not?\u201d</p><p>Roxy barked and raced a little ahead before stopping to peer back at her.</p><p>Eyebrows rising, Valerie followed and paused when she saw that the dog had stopped beside one of her treasures.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes I should, or no I shouldn\u2019t?\u201d she asked as she collected the doggy deposit, and Roxy barked and moved away, sniffing the ground as she went and then she paused again and looked back at her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cGood of you to be so helpful,\u201d Valerie said dryly as she reached her and bent to scoop up the deposit in front of the dog. She spent the next couple of minutes following Roxy around, cleaning up after her. She was pretty sure they were on the last one, when Roxy suddenly paused, head up, ears pricked, and then she charged forward and around the house.</p><p>\u201cSquirrel,\u201d Valerie muttered and shook her head. That was usually the only thing that made the dog react like that. Tying the top of the bag, she whistled for her, and then started around the house. She turned the corner just in time to see Roxy jogging around the front of the house in hot pursuit of whatever furry little critter had caught her attention.</p><p>\u201cDumb dog,\u201d Valerie said with exasperation, hurrying after her. She was exhausted and eager to get back to bed, so of course that\u2019s the day that Roxy decides she\u2019s a hunting dog.</p><p>Roxy had nosed the garage door open and was slipping inside by the time Valerie came around the front of the house. Cursing, Valerie rushed to the door and pulled it open.</p><p>\u201cRoxy?\u201d she called, frowning into the dark garage. Tossing the bag of dog waste in the garbage pail just inside the door, Valerie felt around for a light switch on the walls on either side of the door. If one of the big, automatic garage doors for the cars had been open it would have offered more light, this door merely cast shadows everywhere.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Roxy where are you?\u201d Valerie said testily giving up on a light switch. She couldn\u2019t even hear the German shepherd moving around and the dark and silence was starting to spook her. If she knew where the panel was to open the big doors, she\u2019d be opening them both at that moment.</p><p>Sighing into the silence, Valerie eased back a step, considering closing the garage door and then opening it and calling Roxy again. Perhaps the fear that she might be left here would lure the dog out, Valerie thought and was about to step outside when there was a tinny clang in the back corner of the garage. Roxy had knocked over a can of something. Valerie took a couple steps forward, calling her again.</p><p>Impatient to get back inside and go to bed, Valerie walked further into the garage, moving carefully between Lucian\u2019s van on her right and the shelves lined with tools, pool cleaner, paint, and various other miscellaneous items on her left. She was halfway along the van when the garage door suddenly closed behind her.</p><p>Freezing, Valerie turned slowly toward the van in the darkness, ears straining.</p><p>\u201cIt was the wind,\u201d she assured herself in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The voice came from her right and very close. It startled a gasp out of Valerie and sent her heart pounding. It also made her whirl and run blindly in the opposite direction. Valerie had only taken half a dozen steps when she was caught by the hair and jerked back against a very wide, very hard chest. She immediately caught a whiff of a musky scent she\u2019d forgotten but immediately recalled.</p><p>\u201cIgor,\u201d she breathed, horror washing over her. He was alive.</p><p>\u201cIgor?\u201d he asked, sounding nonplussed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Roxy?\u201d Valerie asked grimly.</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d he barked, and countered, \u201cWhere is Ambrose?\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t answer, she couldn\u2019t have if she\u2019d wanted to. His announcement sent a shaft of pain shooting through her chest that had left her gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Ambrose?\u201d he repeated, shaking her furiously by his hold on her hair to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who Ambrose is!\u201d Valerie cried out, grabbing at the hair on the sides of her head to try to ease the pain. His shaking her certainly regained her attention. He\u2019d pulled her out of her haze of grief, but rage replaced it as Valerie thought of her poor Roxy, lying dead somewhere there in the dark garage. She reacted without stopping to think about it, raising her foot and shooting it back at his legs with force. Score! Valerie thought grimly as he bellowed in pain and stumbled back, dragging her with him.</p><p>Growling as he regained his footing, Igor turned and slammed her into the van, his weight crashing into her from behind to add to the assault. Valerie groaned as the wind was knocked out of her and shock waves of pain vibrated from her breasts down to her knees.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think I mean?\u201d he asked furiously by her ear.</p><p>\u201cYour boss,\u201d she gasped almost soundlessly. She simply didn\u2019t have the breath in her to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Igor demanded, easing his weight from hers enough to allow her some air. As he did, Valerie heard a very faint bark. It sounded far away, or muffled as if coming from outside, but it was definitely a bark. Roxy wasn\u2019t dead. She\u2019d barely had the thought when Igor cursed and dragged her away from the van by her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he growled, pulling her several feet, presumably, toward the garage door.</p><p>Valerie hesitated, but when he stopped and caught her by the throat, she quickly answered, \u201cAt the Enforcer house.\u201d</p><p>There was no reason not to tell him. It wasn\u2019t like Igor could break him out. Although, if he tried, it would give them a chance to catch him. Savoring that thought, she asked, \u201cWhat did you do with Billie, Laura, and Kathy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWhere is the Enforcer house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the address,\u201d Valerie said. When he started to lift her off the ground by her hair, she added quickly, \u201cI don\u2019t. They took me there, they didn\u2019t tell me the address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess you\u2019ll have to show me,\u201d he said grimly, releasing her throat and continuing the way he\u2019d been dragging her before stopping.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d really rather not,\u201d Valerie said honestly and then frowned and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you just reading my mind and controlling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cBecause then you wouldn\u2019t have to drag me around by my hair and hurt me,\u201d she pointed out in an arid tone of her own.</p><p>\u201cBut I like hurting you. It eases the pain you caused me when you staked me.\u201d</p><p>Valerie bit her lip. He sounded testy, even resentful. Imagine! Like he hadn\u2019t deserved it and she was the bad guy or something. Mouth tightening, she said, \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re a new turn and haven\u2019t learned to control or read us mere mortals yet.\u201d</p> <p>Her talk with Leigh at the Enforcer house was what had given her that idea. Leigh had mentioned that she was still learning both skills, but was getting pretty good at them and Valerie had wondered if Igor was a relatively new turn and hadn\u2019t yet learned those skills. Otherwise, why hadn\u2019t he just taken control of her in the bathroom when she\u2019d squirted the shampoo at him? Or after, when he\u2019d come out of the bathroom to get her?</p><p>She suspected she\u2019d hit the nail on the head when Igor\u2019s step faltered and he snapped, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d Valerie muttered, blinking rapidly when he suddenly pushed the door open and dragged her out into bright sunlight. Half-blinded by the sudden light, Valerie was taken by surprise and stumbled to her knees when she was suddenly free. She was so startled that she almost missed the grunt Igor let loose as he released her, but she definitely heard the sounds of the short fight that followed. Turning her head, she watched with amazement as Anders thrust a wooden sunflower stake from the garden into Igor\u2019s chest. The man fell like a ton of bricks, crashing onto his back beside her on the concrete driveway.</p><p>\u201cWell, that felt good,\u201d Anders said grimly and when she glanced to him with surprise, he shrugged and admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to actually save you for a change, rather than just showing up after you\u2019ve already saved yourself.\u201d</p><p>Valerie released a startled laugh that ended in a gasp when he caught her by the arms and raised her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she sighed, sliding her arms around his waist and resting her head on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re my hero.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Anders said dubiously, and then eased her back so he could kiss her nose. Smiling crookedly, he then commented, \u201cYou seem to have a tendency to find trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me this time. I was just following Roxy. She\u2014 Roxy!\u201d Valerie stiffened, her eyes wide and worried. \u201cHe said he killed her but I thought I heard her bark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Anders assured her quickly. \u201cShe\u2019s in the house. She came up to the bedroom and woke me up. It\u2019s how I knew you were in trouble. You weren\u2019t with her. So I came looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie sagged against him, but shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she got in the house. I saw her go into the garage, but when I got there she wasn\u2019t there and he grabbed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a door between the garage and the laundry room. He must have opened it and lured her into the garage and then the house somehow, and then closed it behind her to wait for you to catch up,\u201d Anders said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Valerie sighed, and then followed Anders\u2019s gaze when he suddenly stiffened and glanced toward the house. The front door was opening, she saw, and then Roxy rushed out. Lucian and Leigh followed more slowly as Roxy hurried toward them, tale wagging happily. Valerie slid free of Anders and crouched to greet the dog as she ran up.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d she said, massaging her cheeks and the sides of her neck. \u201cGood girl for getting Anders. Yes,\u201d she praised, and then straightened as the other couple reached them.</p><p>\u201cIgor?\u201d Lucian asked on a yawn, rubbing his hand across his very wide, bare chest. The man had obviously just rolled out of bed. He wore only a pair of green plaid pajama bottoms, and his hair was standing on end.</p> <p>Anders nodded.</p><p>Lucian peered at the large man with the wooden sunflower sticking out of his chest, and commented, \u201cWell this makes a change from the old pushing up daisies.\u201d</p><p>Leigh tsked at the comment and slipped past Lucian to get a better look at the man. Shaking her head, she said, \u201cDid you have to use the sunflower? I loved that tomato stake and it\u2019s the only one I have. You should have used one of the frog stakes. I have three of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that for next time,\u201d Anders said with amusement.</p><p>Lucian slid his arm around Leigh and hugged her briefly. \u201cI\u2019ll call the boys to come collect him. They can take out your sunflower before they take him away . . . I\u2019ll have them clean off the blood for you too,\u201d he added, when Leigh screwed up her face with disgust.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should take it out now,\u201d Anders suggested. \u201cIf we leave it in too long he might not come back and we still need information. We haven\u2019t even been able to get a name out of his boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmbrose,\u201d Valerie announced.</p><p>Anders glanced at her with surprise and shook his head. \u201cDamn, woman, you were only in the garage with him for a matter of minutes. How did you get that out of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy natural charm?\u201d she suggested with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to find out what they did with the women too, did you?\u201d Lucian asked.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s grin faded and she shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019d better take it out now then,\u201d Lucian suggested, not sounding pleased that they had to.</p><p>Anders didn\u2019t look any happier about having to do it as he bent to grab the wooden sunflower and pull it from the man\u2019s chest. When Leigh grimaced at the bloody tip, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll rinse it off with the garden hose. It will be good as new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking,\u201d Lucian said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch Igor while you do that.\u201d</p><p>Anders raised his eyebrows. Apparently, he\u2019d meant later, but he nodded and headed around the garage saying, \u201cI\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Leigh turned to lean up and kiss Lucian\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll call Mortimer for you. I have to go check on the twins anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, love,\u201d Lucian said, watching her go. Once she disappeared into the house, he turned back and eyed Valerie. \u201cSo? When do you want to be turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to turn,\u201d Valerie squawked with amazement.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t, but you will,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d she asked warily.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to have to wipe your memories and have you returned to your life and neither of us wants that,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cAnders said I could have time to decide,\u201d Valerie protested, and then frowned and added, \u201cAnd what do you mean, neither of us wants that? Why would you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved my wife and children, Valerie. And Leigh adores you. You\u2019re family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She stared at him nonplussed, wondering if he meant that.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cLeigh has decided it\u2019s so, so it\u2019s so. She\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t become one of us and I won\u2019t have her disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Valerie scowled slightly. The last part sounded like a threat.</p><p>\u201cAs for Anders saying you could have time to decide,\u201d Lucian continued. \u201cWhat do you need time for? The nanos have paired you, you\u2019re meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so simple,\u201d she said wearily.</p><p>\u201cIt is simple. Don\u2019t make it hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, the nanos paired us. But what about love?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Lucian shifted impatiently. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cRespect him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cTrust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said without hesitation.</p><p>Lucian nodded and said dryly, \u201cI don\u2019t need to ask if you want him sexually.\u201d</p><p>Valerie flushed and raised her chin.</p><p>\u201cAll those things combined make up love,\u201d Lucian assured her. \u201cWhether you realize it or not, you already do love him.\u201d</p><p>Valerie swallowed, knowing in her heart he was right. She bit her lip, and then blurted, \u201cBut does he love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Lucian nodded. \u201cSo that\u2019s the holdup, is it? He hasn\u2019t said it yet.\u201d</p><p>Valerie sighed and looked away, muttering, \u201cWhen he asked me to be his life mate he went on about finding peace and being able to relax and be at peace. It was all peace, peace, peace,\u201d she added with frustration and glanced to Lucian, eyes narrowing when she caught his lips twitching. If he laughed at her, she would\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel at peace with him?\u201d he asked, and then added, \u201cWhen you\u2019re not hot and bothered, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to hear that he loves you,\u201d Lucian said and shrugged. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to ask him then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him if he loves me?\u201d she asked with dismay.</p><p>Lucian sighed with exasperation. \u201cYou took on Igor and staked him, saving yourself and six other women in the process\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d she corrected unhappily. \u201cTwo died, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d he continued heavily, ignoring her interruption. \u201cYou took on Ambrose and saved my wife and unborn twins by crashing the van you were all in and repeatedly bashing the man over the head until help got there. You are not a coward, Valerie, so stop acting like one. Ask him. And when he says yes he loves you, I will personally oversee the turning and pay for the wedding.\u201d On that note, he turned and strode toward the house.</p><p>Valerie stared after him with amazement, then turned and glanced at Igor, and back. \u201cHey! What about\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnders will watch him,\u201d Lucian responded, not slowing.</p><p>Valerie glanced around just in time to see Anders coming around the garage. Lucian had heard him approaching, she realized.</p><p>\u201cMost of it came out,\u201d Anders said as he approached her. \u201cI\u2019ll take it home with me tonight and give it a quick sanding and repaint for Leigh. It should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to your place tonight?\u201d she asked with surprise.</p><p>Anders lowered his hand to his side, the stake dangling from his fingers. Expression solemn, he said, \u201cI am. But I think you should stay here. I think that\u2019s probably best until you make your decision.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Anders grimaced and glanced away, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking that life mate sex is pretty mind-blowing and addictive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d she admitted wryly, bending slightly to pat Roxy, who had been lying down beside her, but now stood and pressed against her leg.</p><p>\u201cThat being the case,\u201d he continued gently, \u201cI thought perhaps it might be best if we abstain until you\u2019ve made your decision.\u201d</p><p>Valerie straightened slowly to stare at him. \u201cAbstain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said solemnly, and then added, \u201cYou need to have a clear head to make a decision as big as this and constantly being bombarded with pleasure, your body and mind crying out with it . . . well, it will just muddy your thinking and delay your decision.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d he added solemnly.</p><p>Valerie narrowed her eyes. \u201cHow long are we supposed to abstain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, until you\u2019ve made your decision,\u201d Anders answered.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it takes a while?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll wait a while. Years if we have to,\u201d he assured her. \u201cHoney, I want you happy and you\u2019re worth waiting for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m happy when we\u2014\u201d Flushing, she cut herself off and said instead, \u201cAnd if I decide I\u2019m willing to be your life mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll rip your clothes off and make love to you until you can\u2019t stand,\u201d he said as if they were discussing the weather.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I decide I\u2019m not willing to risk being your life mate?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frustration filled his expression. \u201cValerie, there is no risk here. The nanos don\u2019t make mistakes. This is a sure bet. The only game where you can\u2019t lose. All you have to do is be willing to accept the gift they\u2019re offering us.\u201d</p><p>Valerie stared at him silently. Like Lucian, he made it sound so simple. The nanos had decided. It was a fait accompli. Blah blah blah. Men were such twits sometimes. She needed more than\u2014</p><p>A moan from Igor caught her attention and she glanced down, then gasped in surprise when Anders plunged the stake into him again.</p> <p>\u201cAnders, we need him alive,\u201d she protested, reaching for the swaying sunflower sticking out of the man\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it out in a minute,\u201d he said, brushing her hand away. \u201cIf he\u2019s moaning, he\u2019s recovering. I just want to slow him down a little. At least until the men get here.\u201d</p><p>As if his words had conjured them up, the sound of a vehicle drew Valerie\u2019s gaze to a dark SUV coming up the driveway. Mortimer and Bricker had arrived to collect Igor, she guessed as they parked the vehicle beside Anders\u2019s and got out.</p><p>\u201cWe finally got our rogue\u2019s name out of him,\u201d Mortimer announced with a smile as he led Bricker toward them.</p><p>\u201cAmbrose,\u201d Anders said at once.</p> <p>Mortimer\u2019s smile faded, his mouth making an \u201co\u201d of surprise. \u201cHow the hell do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie got the name from Igor,\u201d Anders said with amusement.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Mortimer glanced toward the man lying in the driveway, then glanced back, his gaze meeting Valerie\u2019s, \u201cSo . . . did you find out about the girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Valerie admitted with a frown. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d Mortimer\u2019s smile was back. \u201cThey\u2019re alive and well in a house about ten minutes from here. Nicholas, Jo, and Decker are on their way there now. They\u2019ll take them back to the Enforcer house to be checked over, wiped, and sent back to their lives. This time for good.\u201d</p><p>Valerie let her breath out on a sigh, only realizing then that she\u2019d been holding it. She\u2019d been so worried that Ambrose may already have killed them.</p> <p>\u201cNo. He only planned to kill you,\u201d Mortimer said, obviously reading her mind. \u201cYou were the difficult one who had seen the portrait. None of the others remembered anything that could have given him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he take them at all?\u201d Valerie asked with a frown. \u201cFrom what I understand, he didn\u2019t need to take them to read them, he just had to get close. Why take the risk and kidnap them again when he knew they didn\u2019t know anything that could point a finger his way?\u201d</p><p>Bricker grimaced. \u201cHe has a strange way of thinking. He kind of saw you ladies as his property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean his cattle,\u201d Valerie said grimly.</p><p>\u201cBasically,\u201d Bricker acknowledged apologetically and then shrugged. \u201cHe wanted you all back where he felt you belonged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that he could continue to bleed us dry of blood until we died?\u201d Valerie suggested, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Bricker nodded. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>Valerie muttered under her breath with disgust.</p> <p>\u201cDid you find out how he got onto the women?\u201d Anders asked. \u201cHow he knew they had no family and chose them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes,\u201d Mortimer nodded. \u201cValerie, I gather you were going to work at the Teaching Hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching Hospital?\u201d Anders asked, glancing to her.</p><p>\u201cThe college has a teaching hospital for animals, basically a veterinary clinic for students to hone their skills. The students perform the procedures, but they\u2019re overseen by the teaching staff who can step in if a situation arises. I was going to work there a couple days a week to keep my skills sharp and to practice a couple of new techniques I hoped to learn in my courses this year,\u201d she explained. \u201cIn fact, I was at the Teaching Hospital the afternoon I was kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>Mortimer nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s where he found his victims. He\u2019s on staff there. Cindy, Laura, and Kathy had taken their pets into the clinic hospital for one reason or another and he took the opportunity to ask questions and learn if they were likely victims for him or not. He met Billie in the bookstore coffee shop one afternoon when he was in the bookstore. He struck up a conversation with her, learned she was on her own with no one to care if she went missing and . . .\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>Anders frowned and turned to Valerie to say, \u201cBut you saw Cindy in that other clinic we went to. Why would she go to both places?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably took her cat to the teaching hospital for an operation, spaying or neutering, or something,\u201d Valerie said grimly. \u201cThe biggest benefit of the clinic is that they don\u2019t charge as much for procedures like that. That\u2019s how they encourage people to bring their animals in. But for long-term care; yearly shots, flea pills, et cetera, she would need a regular vet.\u201d Valerie paused briefly, then glanced to Mortimer and shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him at the teaching hospital. I was speaking to a woman, not Ambrose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe listened in. Caught part of it and got the rest of the info he was seeking from your interviewer. Apparently you told her that you have a clinic in Winnipeg and were just here temporarily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded and then grimaced. \u201cI did tell her I have no family or friends here so I could work extra hours if they wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . his name is Ambrose what?\u201d Anders asked. \u201cAnd just who the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Ambrose,\u201d Mortimer said with a shrug. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t remember any more than that from his life as a mortal. And it may be his last name. He says it was on a name tag on his uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUniform?\u201d Anders asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cHe was a soldier in World War I,\u201d Bricker explained. \u201cHe says his first memory is waking up in the middle of a battlefield; bombs going off everywhere, dead bodies all around him and some German fellow half blown up and lying across him, bleeding all over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell,\u201d Anders muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>Rather than answer her, Anders arched an eyebrow at Mortimer. \u201cAn accidental turn?\u201d</p><p>Mortimer nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking. He says he remembers pushing the German soldier off him and staggering to his feet. His head hurt, he felt it and it was soft and mushy, either half caved in or blown away. He felt dizzy and pain was gnawing at his head and gut. He passed out and when he woke up he was sucking on another soldier\u2019s open wound and feeling much better. The more blood he had, the better he felt and then the wound seemed to heal itself. He realized he was a vampire and has been living as one ever since, using whatever he could find on the subject as his guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would be ridiculous fantasies like Dracula and such,\u201d Bricker pointed out with distaste.</p><p>Anders\u2019s mouth twisted, but he asked, \u201cAnd he never got his memory back of his life before waking up on the battlefield?\u201d</p><p>Mortimer shook his head. \u201cHe says not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d Valerie asked. \u201cI thought the nanos repaired things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do, and they obviously repaired the physical damage done, but if the head wound was bad enough . . .\u201d He pursed his lips. \u201cThe nanos may not have been able to recover the memories from the destroyed brain matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s possible,\u201d Anders said thoughtfully, and then sighed and shrugged the matter away.</p><p>\u201cWait . . .\u201d Valerie said with a frown. \u201cI get that the nanos repaired him, but I\u2019m not sure I understand how you think the nanos got there in the first place.\u201d She glanced from one man to the other and asked uncertainly, \u201cAre you thinking that the soldier who was bleeding on him was an immortal and that the nanos were passed to him that way? That they got into his wounds and just . . . took hold like a virus or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInto his wounds, maybe his mouth. But yes, that\u2019s probably what happened,\u201d Mortimer said.</p><p>\u201cDoes this happen a lot?\u201d she asked with amazement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only heard of one other incident like it,\u201d Bricker said and raised his eyebrows as he glanced to the others.</p><p>\u201cElvi\u2019s the only one I know of too,\u201d Mortimer said at once.</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Anders agreed. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t more out there like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Elvi?\u201d Valerie asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Victor\u2019s life mate,\u201d Anders said, and then added, \u201cVictor is Lucian\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was accidentally turned?\u201d Valerie asked, fascinated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d Anders said quietly.</p><p>When Valerie nodded, he glanced to the men and said, \u201cSo he woke up in the middle of a war zone, a vampire with no memory of his past, and managed to survive unnoticed for almost a hundred years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so,\u201d Mortimer agreed and shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s one lucky son of a bitch to have escaped our notice all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Bricker muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd Igor?\u201d Anders asked, glancing down at the man still lying on the ground. Spotting the sunflower sticking out of his chest, Anders scowled, but didn\u2019t pull it out.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Mickey Green,\u201d Mortimer said. \u201cAmbrose met him in a bar six or seven months ago; liked him, decided he\u2019d make a good flunky, and turned him.\u201d He eyed the sunflower stake sticking out of Igor\u2014or Mickey Green\u2019s\u2014chest and asked, \u201cHow long has he been staked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was staked earlier, but recovering. I put it back in just before you pulled into the driveway,\u201d Anders admitted, reaching for the sunflower stake now.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it out once we have him chained up in the SUV,\u201d Mortimer said, stopping him. \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. It\u2019s safer that way.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded, but said, \u201cI told Leigh I\u2019d clean it for her. Most of the blood washes off, but the wood on the tip is a little stained and needs a bit of sanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it back at the house,\u201d Mortimer assured him, and then added, \u201cSpeaking of which, I suppose we should get him in the SUV and take him there. We have a nice cell waiting for him next to Ambrose. The two can be neighbors until the council decides what to do with them.\u201d</p><p>Anders nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll walk Valerie inside and tell Lucian you\u2019re here. He may want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Mortimer\u2019s response to that, but caught Valerie\u2019s arm and urged her toward the front door. Roxy had lain down in a bit of shade nearby to watch them, but now got up and followed.</p><p>Valerie allowed Anders to lead her toward the house, but her mind was racing. He planned to walk her in, tell Lucian about the men being there and then leave her and head back to his own home . . . and she didn\u2019t want that. She wanted\u2014actually, Valerie wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted. She knew what she didn\u2019t want though, and that was to be left here alone without him. But she didn\u2019t know what to do about it. He was determined to give her time to think and make her decision, and\u2014the front door opening distracted her, and Valerie glanced toward it as Lucian stepped out.</p><p>\u201cMortimer and Bricker got some information out of Ambrose,\u201d Anders announced, slowing as the man pulled the door closed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll let them tell you about it. They\u2019d be disappointed if I stole their thunder.\u201d</p><p>Lucian nodded as he approached, but his eyes slid from Anders to her as he neared. Slowing as he came abreast of them, he scowled at Valerie. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t asked?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for a response, but simply shook his head and continued on toward the driveway.</p><p>\u201cAsked me what?\u201d Anders asked, glancing to her curiously.</p><p>Valerie hesitated and then simply spat it out. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>Anders stilled, his breath leaving him in a long exhale. Then he just stood there staring at her until Valerie began to worry that the answer was no and he didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, just say\u2014\u201d she began anxiously, but never finished because his mouth was suddenly on hers and he was kissing her.</p><p>Valerie quickly forgot about Igor, or whether Anders loved her and just about everything else. When he broke the kiss and lifted his head a moment later, she moaned in protest, and then blinked her eyes open when he said, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she asked with wonder, a smile curving her lips.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I do. You\u2019re perfect. How could I not love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not perfect,\u201d she said at once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect for me,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, sexy, smart, brave . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re all I could have wanted and more, Valerie. I\u2019m happy when I\u2019m with you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed and rested her head on his chest, admitting, \u201cLucian thinks I love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Anders said dryly. \u201cBut what do you think?\u201d</p> <p>Pulling back, she met his gaze and said solemnly, \u201cI think he\u2019s right. I love you too, Anders.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, as if savoring the words, then opened them again and asked cautiously, \u201cSo you\u2019ll agree to be my life mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I already am your life mate,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cBut if you mean will I agree to be turned, and marry you, and spend the rest of our very long lives together, than yes. I agree.\u201d</p><p>She caught a glimpse of the grin that claimed his face, but then gasped when he scooped her up and started to walk, saying, \u201cCome on, Roxy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! What are you doing?\u201d Valerie cried, clutching at his shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to my\u2014our house,\u201d he corrected himself and then reminded her, \u201cI promised that if you said yes, I\u2019d rip your clothes off and make love to you until you couldn\u2019t stand and I intend to keep my promise. But not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not here,\u201d Valerie agreed, flushing. She wasn\u2019t exactly quiet when he made love to her. Besides, she liked the idea of having him all to herself.</p><p>When Anders paused beside his SUV, Valerie grabbed the door handle and opened it for him.</p><p>\u201cSee, you\u2019re perfect,\u201d Anders said with a grin as he set her on the passenger seat. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have to ask. We\u2019re a good team.\u201d</p><p>Valerie just shook her head and laughed.</p><p>Smiling, Anders stepped back, and glanced down, saying, \u201cIn, Roxy.\u201d</p> <p>The dog jumped up at once, settling on the floor between Valerie\u2019s legs as she had when they\u2019d brought her back from Cambridge. She was smiling at the dog when Anders\u2019s face suddenly appeared before her as he leaned in. His lips brushed hers, then he whispered, \u201cSeat belt,\u201d before closing the door.</p><p>Valerie did up her seat belt and watched him walk around to get in beside her to do up his own seat belt and start the SUV.</p><p>Anders reached for the gearshift, but paused when he saw that she was simply sitting there smiling at him. Tilting his head he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this is madness, right?\u201d Valerie asked cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other a handful of days.\u201d</p><p>Anders pulled his door closed, and eyed her uncertainly. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cSecond thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, definitely not,\u201d she assured him with a laugh.</p> <p>Relaxing, he leaned across the open space between them to give her a quick peck, but when he started to straighten again, she caught his face in her hands and whispered, \u201cI do love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he assured her, and then kissed her again, this time a slow, soft, sweet kiss that left them both hungry for more. Raising an eyebrow, he asked, \u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Anders shifted the SUV into gear and Valerie turned to peer out the front window and toward their future . . . together.</p><p>Keep reading for a peek into the Argeneau world . . .</p><p>from the very beginning!</p><p>All available from Avon Books</p><p>A Quick Bite</p><p>That hot guy tied to Lissianna Argeneau\u2019s bed? He\u2019s Gregory Hewitt, the doctor her mother hopes will help cure her phobia of blood . . . because that\u2019s an especially annoying quirk for a vampire. But is Greg the answer to her troubles, or will he be just a good meal?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this off you,\u201d she suggested as she worked at the bow around his neck.</p><p>He sighed as it was removed, relaxing on the bed a bit, and Lissianna decided to discard his tie as well.</p><p>\u201cThere, isn\u2019t that better?\u201d she asked, sliding the silk cloth from around his neck.</p><p>The man started to nod, then caught himself and scowled instead as she undid the top three buttons of his shirt. \u201cIt would be better still if you untied me.\u201d</p><p>Lissianna smiled with amusement at the way he was struggling with himself, then tried to distract him by running her fingers lightly over the bit of chest she\u2019d revealed. Much to her satisfaction, a shiver went through him as her long nails grazed gently across his naked skin. This education business was turning out to be easier than she\u2019d feared.</p><p>\u201cUntie me.\u201d He was trying to be firm, but it was obvious his heart was no longer wholly behind the desire to be free.</p><p>Smiling knowingly, Lissianna scraped her fingers lightly down to run along the cloth just above his belt. The provocative action sent his stomach muscles galloping and his breath came out on a little hiss of air.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he breathed. \u201cThere are worse things than being a sex slave.\u201d</p><p>Love Bites</p><p>Etienne Argeneau\u2019s three hundred years of bachelorhood comes to an end when, to save the woman who saved him, he turns her into an immortal.

At least the look in his bright silver eyes said they\u2019d be spending a lot of time together.</p><p>\u201cWhy you won\u2019t come to me?\u201d</p><p>Rachel glanced back at the corpse. He wasn\u2019t making much sense, but then who said hallucinations had to? She tried to reason with him. \u201cWhy would I come to you? You aren\u2019t real.

It was a nice grin. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause dead men don\u2019t sit up and talk,\u201d she explained patiently. \u201cPlease lie back down now.
