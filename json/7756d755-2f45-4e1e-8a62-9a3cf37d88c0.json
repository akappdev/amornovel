His fingers slowly stroked my outer thigh while his other hand rested on my abdomen, one finger circling my belly button. I turned to look up at him over my shoulder. He was staring out across the moonlit field, observing the horses in the distance.</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d He leaned into me further and kissed the side of my neck.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep. It must have been your sexy, raspy voice.\u201d I cuddled closer, and his arm tightened. \u201cDid you finish the song?\u201d His guitar lay in its case next to us.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Mouse. It\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, excited for him. He\u2019d told me last week that he hadn\u2019t written anything for the band in a year. I had yet to see them play, and I was excited to hear them, but nervous too. I mean, Sculpt was six foot three and all muscle. He has what I call sexy bedroom hair, always a little messy with the odd lazy curl that falls over his face. And he had ink running down his left arm to his elbow, which made the hot a scary, badass hot. Then put in that fact that he was in a band and did some illegal underground fighting ... Well girls were no doubt all over him, and I wasn\u2019t ready to face the reality of what dating Sculpt entailed.</p><p>We\u2019d been hanging out ever since I asked him to help me learn how to fight a couple months ago. I was assaulted a week before I sought out Sculpt, coming home from my friend Georgie\u2019s coffee shop where I work. I\u2019d been so shocked and terrified that when my assaulter pushed me to the ground I just froze.</p><p>When I pulled my head out of deep freeze, I managed to bite his hand and scream my head off, which scared the guy away. After that I was on a mission to learn how to fight back. Sculpt, being an underground fighter was the perfect choice. I\u2019d also heard he needed money to go on tour with his band, and I was willing to pay.</p><p>He never let me.</p> <p>I reached up and ran my finger over the slight indent in his chin. \u201cCan I hear it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and despite his lack of smile, because he rarely did smile, I saw the flicker of amusement in his eyes. \u201cNo, Eme. You\u2019ll hear it with the band on stage and me singing to you.\u201d The amusement left his eyes, and I felt him stiffen. \u201cDid you think about what I asked?\u201d</p><p>I knew exactly what he was referring to. I had a perpetual war in my head for the last three days\u2014I wasn\u2019t ready to have my heart blasted with porcupine quills when Sculpt left me to go on tour, but I also wasn\u2019t ready to go on the road with a group of guys I hadn\u2019t even met yet and have Sculpt responsible for me. I planned on starting college in a month. I had a life here with my best friend Kat and her brother Matt who were also my roommates and my only family.</p><p>Ever since grade school when Kat and I had started hanging out, Matt had been there for the both of us. He was eighteen and Kat ten when their parents died in a drinking and driving accident. He\u2019d instantly become Kat\u2019s guardian. Since I no longer had a dad, Matt sort of became the male figure in my life. I looked up to him.</p><p>I\u2019d snuck in Kat\u2019s bedroom window numerous times after running away from my mom\u2019s when she brought a new boyfriend home. Matt never kicked me out, never told me to go home, nor did he call my mom. Instead, he bought me a cell phone, programmed his number in it, and told me if I ever needed to get out of my house that I was to call him, and he\u2019d come get me.</p><p>The three of us were close and even though I didn\u2019t want Sculpt to leave, I couldn\u2019t see myself leaving either.</p> <p>\u201cEme.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cTell me.\u201d He shifted, easily picking me up under the arms and bringing me around so I sat facing him, my legs bent on either side of him. It was intimate, and Christ, it was hard to resist him and not just say screw it and tell him how I feel and go with him. \u201cEme, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>He watched me carefully, eyes unwavering. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m asking, but this once I\u2019ll indulge you. Tell me you don\u2019t want more.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He knew I was crazy about him. I\u2019d been trying to keep my feelings ... well hidden, somewhat. It obviously wasn\u2019t working. I licked my lips and tried to look away, but he was ready for that and held my head between his hands.</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d</p><p>I was so not good at this. The last person I expressed my feelings to was my dad while he lay in the hospital dying of lung cancer.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d He leaned in, and my hands went to his upper thighs feeling the flex of his muscles beneath my palms. \u201cLook at me.\u201d I did. \u201cI want you with me. I\u2019ll look after you.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cI\u2019m not happy leaving you here, baby.\u201d</p><p>And that was the problem; I didn\u2019t want to be \u201clooked after.\u201d I\u2019d looked after myself all my life. My mom ... I sometimes wondered if she even remembered she had a daughter.</p> <p>\u201cEmily. I don\u2019t play games. I told you what I want, and I know you want me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether to be pissed or laugh at his arrogance. What I did know was that I was turned on\u2014big time. How could he do that? I mean, he was just looking at me, and yet ... his eyes abducted me. \u201cSculpt ... I ...\u201d</p><p>Sculpt tightened his legs around me. \u201cEme.\u201d He gripped my chin and held me steady. He waited several seconds, and I finally inhaled a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019ll never hurt you. I know you\u2019re worried about the women.\u201d I opened my mouth to speak, but his eyes narrowed, and I shut it again. \u201cI\u2019m a fighter. I\u2019m in a band. The women will always be there, but I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>And that was the issue. Why was he with me? I wasn\u2019t pretty, had big hips, mousey, brown hair, and my thighs were my best feature. Most guys wouldn\u2019t say so, because I was only five foot three, and they liked the tall, skinny fawn-like legs. I liked my thighs, because I rode horses, and they were the most muscular, lean part of my body.</p><p>He stiffened, and I recognized the russet in his eyes reflect in the moonlight. I laid my hands flat on his chest feeling his beating heart beneath my touch. \u201cJesus, Emily, you have to bury that shit your mother tells you. I swear if she wasn\u2019t a woman, I\u2019d kick her ass.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. How did he know about my mother?</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mouse, I know it\u2019s swimming around in your head like a shark eating all your confidence. Do you think I don\u2019t pay attention? I\u2019ve asked you about your mother, and I see what it does to you. You spent most of your childhood at Matt and Kat\u2019s. A girl doesn\u2019t do that if her mother is something special. I\u2019m certain yours is not. She\u2019s put toxic shit in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt ... I ... my ...\u201d Yeah. I had no words. He was right. My mom was toxic, and that was why I never saw her, not that she\u2019d remember if I did.</p><p>He tucked my hair behind my ear. It seemed so natural; I wondered if he even realized he was doing it. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring this, Eme. I want you on tour with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need more time, Sculpt. I can\u2019t suddenly decide to change my life and go with you. I have school starting and Matt and Kat ...\u201d My voice trailed off.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou want to train horses. Why are you wasting your time going to college taking accounting?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d been through this. \u201cSculpt, it\u2019s a silly dream. I need to focus on what\u2019s real, and that is finding a career and making money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Eme. You should be chasing your dream.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Next week.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched, and my heart felt like it had been pierced with quills, and he hadn\u2019t even left yet. \u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have changed. We\u2019re leaving sooner than we planned.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t go. God, I wanted to, but he needed to live his dream, and I had to make my own way. I never wanted him to regret being with me. Anything I wanted in life I had to reach for myself. I didn\u2019t want someone else supporting me. One good thing I\u2019d learned from my mother was that if I wanted anything, I had to get it myself, because she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to give it to me.</p><p>\u201cSculpt. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d He lay back in the grass scowling. \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sculpt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, Emily. I can\u2019t handle any buts. I\u2019m pissed right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sat up again, brows lowered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll like my but.\u201d I leaned toward him and nipped his chin. That got him to ease up, and his muscles relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI already like your butt.\u201d His hand slid down the small of my back to my ass and squeezed. It was playful, but I could still see the darkness in his eyes, and his face was hard.</p><p>\u201cSculpt. My but is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Eme, it is.\u201d I slapped him on the shoulder, and I was glad when he laughed. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s your but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say, but ...\u201d His brows rose. \u201cBefore you go, I want you to make love to me.\u201d I paused, seeing his brows rise with surprise, then I pushed on quickly before I lost my nerve. \u201cLike now, Sculpt. Right now. Here in this spot where we always hang out together. Our place. You with your guitar, and me with the horses.\u201d</p><p>His hands that were slowly roaming, stopped squeezing my upper thighs, and he stared at me with such intensity that I was getting hot just watching him watch me. \u201cThat\u2019s your but?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI knew I liked your butt.\u201d He put his hands on either side of my face and met my eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re in my bed ... you\u2019re not in anyone else\u2019s. You got that, Mouse? Even if I can\u2019t convince you in the next week to come with me\u2014no one else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Same goes for you.\u201d Surrounded by women night after night would be a lot harder for him than for me.</p><p>Sculpt stroked the side of my face. \u201cEmily. You erase the bad in my life.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine Sculpt having any bad. He was hot, had an incredible voice, had a body that was no doubt in the dictionary under the definition of muscle, and he had sexy bedroom hair with intense, dark eyes.</p><p>He may not laugh often, but when he did it was magical and made up for all the other times he didn\u2019t. I sensed the hardness in him, the untouchable part that he refused to let me discover, but we\u2019d only known one another for a couple months.</p><p>His thumb caressed my lips, and the ache between my legs intensified. My stomach wasn\u2019t just pretty little butterflies; it was a flock of Egrets taking flight.</p><p>He picked me up and set me on the grass beside him then got on his knees in front of me. He tilted forward, and I leaned back until I was resting in the grass, and he was hovering above.</p><p>My nerves were sparking off in every direction while the twinge between my legs became a spasm of aching need. I was breathing so fast that it was like I\u2019d run a marathon.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been touched, Emily?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head too breathless to respond verbally.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not ready ... tell me now. Be damn sure about this, Eme.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was dead serious, and it sent a strange thrill through me. I didn\u2019t want to wait. I wanted him here and now with the wind against my skin, being in my favorite place in the world with Sculpt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>His hand swept into my hair and weaved through the strands. His fingers tightened, and he pulled back, and my breath hitched. \u201cI\u2019m tasting your pussy. Then Emily, I\u2019m going to fuck you until you scream. Does that make you nervous? Because you\u2019re trembling all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, nervous? Or yeah you\u2019re going to scream when I sink inside of you for the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, to all of it.\u201d I\u2019d wanted Sculpt since the night I met him. Needed him. It was like I had been living with anticipation for this moment my entire life. It scared the hell out me. What if I sucked at it? What if we were incompatible? What if it was awkward?</p><p>\u201cI want you screaming and quivering. And baby, you should be nervous ... because I plan on changing your mind and having you begging me to take you on tour.\u201d The corners of his lips twitched, and my insides lit up like a goddamn firecracker. I couldn\u2019t help but think about what he could do to me, how I\u2019d say goodbye when it was time for him to leave. \u201cYou\u2019re Lego building, Emily. Rethinking your decision?\u201d</p><p>I jerked and met his eyes. There it was\u2014his eyes dancing with laughter and desire, a sexy combination that had me tightening my grip on his biceps.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for my reply. \u201cToo late, Mouse. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head like he always did before he kissed me, and claimed my lips. And he did claim, devour, and feed the hunger we both felt between us. Heat flowed over my skin as if the afternoon sun was beaming down on it. Little sparks tap-danced shivers through my body. There was no hesitation in what he was taking, what he wanted, and I fell into his kiss like melted butter.</p><p>His hands stroked up my sides then down again. \u201cGod, these curves.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, and the vibration sent my heart rate spiking. My hands found their way into his hair, pulling him closer, harder. God, I needed him. It was like I was breathing for this man. It wasn\u2019t normal. Was this normal? Did it matter?</p><p>\u201cSculpt.\u201d</p><p>He took my hands and placed them above my head, locking them down with his own. \u201cLogan. Call me Logan, Eme.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. His name. He told me his real name. No one knew his real name. \u201cLogan,\u201d I said and heard him groan.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>His lips trailed succulent kisses down my throat, his teeth nipping, then his tongue licking to take away the bite. \u201cI want you to call me that whenever we\u2019re alone, Emily. Call me Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It was a whispered moan mixed with a sigh. Eyes closed, head thrown back, I edged my legs out from under him on either side and wrapped them around his hips. He grunted as I clenched, hoping to ease the ache, but all I did was make it more intense. More aware.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Logan, please. I need you.\u201d We could savor and taste and discover one another the rest of the week, but right now I wanted Logan inside me. I wanted to feel him naked against me. It was like waiting at the top of a toboggan hill and being rocked back and forth before being pushed over the edge.</p><p>\u201cI know, Mouse.\u201d He nipped at my ear lobe then suckled, and I fought against his hands that kept me pinned to the grass.</p><p>I had to touch him, feel his skin, get rid of the clothes that separated us. \u201cLogan, please. Clothes.\u201d</p><p>His head came up from him kissing my collar bone. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this slow. My way. I\u2019ve waited too long to have you right where you are now, under me, pussy aching, hot and sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never been called sexy in my life, and it sent a shudder straight through me hearing it from Logan.</p> <p>\u201cI like to play, Emily. It\u2019s who I am. And it\u2019s in you too. I know you get turned on when I take control.\u201d Did I? I wasn\u2019t experienced enough to really know what he was talking about. \u201cBut if you\u2019re scared of anything, I need you to say no. That\u2019s all it takes, and we stop. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I got what he was saying. I mean, I wasn\u2019t oblivious to sex. I knew \u201cplay\u201d could mean a few things, and it made me nervous and excited at the same time.</p><p>He let go of my wrists, and I put my hands on his abdomen and lifted his shirt inch by inch. Logan hovered over me, watching my eyes. I saw him suck in air and close his eyes for a second when my hands crept up his chest then slowly caressed his nipples.</p><p>I kept my eyes on him, loving his reaction. Loving how my touch was driving him crazy. My fingertips traced every muscle on his chest then down to his abdomen. Every contour was a new mountain for me to explore. I was panting, and Logan had his eyes closed and was breathing harder than I was.</p><p>\u201cShirt, Logan.\u201d I lifted it upward, and he succumbed to my bribe and threw off his shirt. My hands went to the button on his jeans, and he grabbed my hands and stilled them.</p><p>\u201cNo. I let you play so you could relax. Now it\u2019s me.\u201d Within seconds he had my shirt up, over my head, and his fingers were working at my bra. The snaps gave, and my breasts fell from their confines into his hands. \u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He lowered his body, and then his tongue circled my nipple while his hands caressed my side, down to my hip then back up again to tease my breasts. My body was exploding with sensations, pain as he bit my nipple, then pleasure as he suckled sweetly and licked the sensitive skin with heated moisture.</p><p>I gripped his hair, eyes closed and body arching into him as he sent me into a furnace of heat. Getting myself off to him over the last couple months couldn\u2019t even begin to compete with the real thing.</p><p>He moved lower, soft kisses trailing down my chest to my stomach. \u201cThis. And this.\u201d He slid his hand to my hip. \u201cI love everything about your body.\u201d His kisses went further, and my body was already anticipating him. Ache was no longer a word associated with what he was doing to me; it was much, much more than that.</p><p>My hands curled in the grass, and I moaned as his fingers undid my jeans.</p><p>The button popped.</p><p>The slow descend of my zipper drove me crazy.</p><p>The sound was agonizing, because I wanted him to rip them off and plunge deep inside of me, hard and fast. But Logan wanted to do this slowly. Relish every moment, and yet, I was dying for him.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d My whispered moan was met with a muffled, \u201cChrist\u201d as I felt his fingers reach in my jeans and go lower. And lower until\u2014</p><p>I stiffened, sucking in air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>Well, yeah, I\u2019d been wet for two-and-half months. Logan turned me on just by looking at me. I ran my hands through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ve been wet since the day I met you, Logan.\u201d</p><p>His head came up, and his eyes widened. God, he had to have known how much I wanted him.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Emily.\u201d He was kissing me again, hands curled into my hair, and his mouth hard against mine. There was no breathing, no thinking, just pure hunger.</p><p>He raised his head, both of us breathing hard, his sexy bedroom hair falling in front of his right eye while he looked at me with haunted openness. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>I cupped his cheek with my shaking hand, my thumb stroking across his stubble. \u201cDon\u2019t ever hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He sat up then moved down me as he grabbed the edges of my jeans and pulled. I lifted my butt, and my panties came with the denim.</p><p>He stopped at mid-thigh. \u201cBeautiful. And shaved. That is a ... surprise.\u201d</p><p>I did have a small, what they call, landing strip, but the rest was waxed clean\u2014Brazilian. I\u2019d never liked hair down there, and Logan liking it\u2014it made me giddy inside.</p><p>His fingertip ran down the small patch of hair, and I gasped as he spread the folds then slipped into the wetness.</p><p>\u201cLogan, oh God,\u201d I arched my back, trying to bend my knees but unable to because of my jeans trapping my legs. \u201cJeans, Logan. Jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He continued to enjoy caressing my clit until I screamed and panted, then when he felt me close to the edge, he backed off and went further down to circle my opening.</p><p>I wanted him inside me so bad that I was arching up to meet him until he put his hand on my stomach and forced me to stay down.</p><p>He put two fingers on either side of my folds, slid through the wetness then hesitated at my opening.</p><p>\u201cLogan. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Logan. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>He plunged two fingers partly inside, and I inhaled sharply at the sudden assault. It grabbed me. Held me. It didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>He pulled out, and I cried out with disappointment only to be met with a quick kiss on the top of my clit. Then he tore my jeans off the rest of the way and lay between my legs.</p><p>\u201cBend your knees.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>\u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>I did that too. I trusted him implicitly and him taking control felt like it was fulfilling a need in me to surrender to him. I was able to forget everything and bask in whatever pleasure he gave me.</p><p>He gently pushed them a little wider still, and I closed my eyes and bit my lip as I felt the first suckle on my clit. Oh God. The sensations inside me were so heightened that I knew I wasn\u2019t going to last more than a few minutes with Logan\u2019s mouth on me. Never had I imagined it being like this. I moaned, arching my back as Logan\u2019s tongue slipped inside me.</p><p>Gripping the grass on either side of my head, I groaned as he worked magic with his tongue through the folds, tasting the wetness then suckling my clit again. The pressure in my abdomen ached, built, and was cresting. I tensed. So, so close to the edge, nearly pushed off the hill.</p><p>He stopped. \u201cNot yet, baby.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, how could I do that? \u201cLogan, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t hold\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d His voice was rough and demanding, and it made me even hotter. His fingers pushed inside me, but never all the way. \u201cSo tight.\u201d</p><p>He pumped in and out of me several times then licked me again. \u201cYour pussy is perfect. I knew you\u2019d taste this way. You\u2019re made for me, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d I panted, every muscle tightening. \u201cPlease. I need you inside me now.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his fingers from me, and then I watched as he licked them off one by one. I nearly came just watching him. The way his eyes glued to mine as if he could see right into me. How the curve of his mouth partially crept up to a smile as he tasted me.</p><p>It was him. Everything he did, I adored. How he walked with confidence, not a swagger, but when he came into a room it was with presence. How he was chasing his dream with his band, willing to take all the money he had to try and make it in a business that was saturated with great bands. He took risks because he had faith in himself. How he didn\u2019t take shit from anyone. How he put all of himself into whatever he was doing. But most of all, I loved how he looked at me and saw everything I am and could be.</p><p>\u201cAre you on something?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThe pill. To control my ovulation pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clean. I was checked two weeks after I met you and have been with no one since.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been with no one. He went and got checked? Was it because he thought ... was he thinking about us?</p><p>\u201cYeah, Emily. I wanted to make sure I was good before I ever touched you, condom or not.\u201d</p><p>Wow. \u201cI want you inside me, Logan. I want to feel all of you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned to the side and yanked off his jeans. I glanced down before he moved on top of me and glimpsed his erection\u2014pulsating, huge\u2014and wondered how the hell that was fitting inside me. Before I could start Lego building and scaring myself, I reached between us and touched him.</p> <p>\u201cEme,\u201d he murmured as my fingers curled around him then stroked every inch of him.</p><p>His penis was throbbing and hot, and as I caressed, his eyes closed, and his head tilted back as he groaned.</p><p>\u201cStop. Fuck. I\u2019m going to come before I\u2019m even inside you.\u201d He grabbed his cock and rubbed it between my legs, the wetness clinging to him. \u201cI\u2019ll go slow, Mouse.\u201d</p><p>My hand reached up to lock my fingers in his hair. \u201cNo, go fast. Just get that part over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was hard and firm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to remember this and not with pain.\u201d His mouth descended as he sunk lower, his cock nudging my opening.</p> <p>Wrapping my legs around his waist and my arms around his back, I pressed upward with my hips, and the tip pressed against my barrier. I couldn\u2019t get him in any further, and my body was aching so bad I was going to scream.</p><p>He tore his mouth away from mine and grabbed my chin. \u201cLook at me, Emily. I want to see you when I take you. I want to watch you while you scream my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his hips forward and moved in me a little further. I could feel him stretching my hymen, and I was sure he could too. He gripped my chin to make certain I didn\u2019t move then rotated his hips and withdrew, and I moaned.</p><p>\u201cSlow, Eme.\u201d</p><p>He moved inside me again, and this time he kept going until I felt a sudden sharp pain as if he\u2019d stabbed me.</p> <p>Fuck. Shit. It hurt.</p><p>And yet ... him erect and full inside me was ... it was so connecting and surreal. As if we\u2019d become one.</p><p>He leaned in and kissed me while he was sunk deep inside. A slow languished kiss that had me forgetting about the pain and instead filling me with a new urgency. I wanted him to move.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d God, I needed him to move. I pushed upward, and he sunk even deeper. Yes, God yes.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>The tenderness was overridden by the aching need. I nodded, and he began to move. I clenched my legs around him, ankles crossed on his back, both of us panting, our eyes locked on one another.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Emily.\u201d He moved harder, faster, and I tried to close my eyes, but he grabbed my chin. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Each push brought us closer; I was on edge, ready, the ache heightened to a place it could go no further. He pressed his hips in an upward motion so he rubbed against my clit, and a jolt went through me, then another and another. The intense building inside was too much.</p> <p>He pressed harder.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Logan. Logan.\u201d I let go, my eyes squeezing shut. \u201cLogan!\u201d I screamed as everything in my body exploded into tiny bursts.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d He pumped harder, the smack of flesh on flesh loud. He thrust deeper. Then he took my mouth with an insane hunger as his body stopped pumping, and his muscles tightened while his body shook.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d He fell to the side and brought me with him so I was snug to his chest, my legs tangled within his. \u201cEmily. You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 trophy. My trophy.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, head resting on his chest next to my hand.</p><p>He leaned upward and kissed my head while his hand stroked up and down my arm. His other hand linked with my fingers on his chest.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, someone is watching us.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked up, and we both started laughing as the appaloosa stared down at us.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>2 days later</p><p>Day 1</p><p>I woke up lying on a damp cement floor.</p><p>I sat up and immediately wished I hadn\u2019t when my head ignited into throbbing, pressurized chaos. The room spun, and my vision blurred for the first few minutes as I tried to piece together what happened.</p><p>Then everything came flooding back like a tsunami. The bar. Logan getting ready to sing with his band. Kat telling me how gorgeous I looked. Going to the washroom and hurrying, because I didn\u2019t want to miss Logan on stage for a single second.</p><p>Then an arm hooked around my waist just as I placed my palm on the bathroom door. A sweet-smelling rag was shoved over my nose and mouth.</p><p>Then nothing.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Fear catapulted into me. It was like being zipped up tight in a sleeping bag with no escape. I was suffocating, couldn\u2019t breathe. I felt pins and needles in my limbs as the fear became the stepping stone to a full-out panic attack. Shivers racked my body, and I started hyperventilating. Tears streamed down my cheeks then dripped onto my collar bone and slid into the material of my dress.</p><p>My dress. The one I picked out for Logan, agonized about for hours at the store with Kat. I wanted to look beautiful for him, and me looking beautiful was a hard task considering I never felt beautiful. It was something I lived with and accepted after years of hearing my mother tell me I was ugly.</p><p>But with Logan ... Even if I wasn\u2019t pretty, he made me feel that way. He made me feel protected and cared for, and it was because I trusted him. He knew what I needed even if I didn\u2019t. There was this natural desire to give up my control to him, not so he could use it against me. No, it was so he could give me what I needed. And what I needed right now was Logan.</p><p>Rolling over I crawled to my knees, and my stomach objected to the movement. I slapped my hand over my mouth and made it to the corner of the room where I vomited the two beers I\u2019d had at the bar then dry-heaved several times until my sides cramped.</p><p>When I finally stopped, I breathed in the smell of stale urine, and my stomach reeled again, and I gagged. I put my head down, taking several deep breaths through my mouth while I leaned my hands against the wall for support.</p><p>I knew I was in a basement, and it was dark outside. I could see a single beam of moonlight streaming in from a small window high up on the far wall. The damp cellar was small and completely empty except for a wooden staircase that had a railing that looked like it would crumble the moment you put your hand on it. The walls were greenish tinged on the bottom half as if the basement had at one time been flooded.</p><p>Something crawled across the back of my hand, and I stumbled backward shrieking. My spine hit the opposite wall, and I squelched, turning, wrapping my arms around myself as I backed into the middle of the room.</p><p>What was happening? Why was I here? Where was Kat? Was she somewhere here too?</p><p>I ran up the stairs and started yanking on the door. When it wouldn\u2019t budge, I pounded on it and screamed then threw my body against it until every part of me was bruised.</p><p>My white chiffon dress I\u2019d bought especially for watching Logan perform was covered in brown smudges. Two snags ripped the lace right off the front, leaving the silk material beneath exposed. My arms were sore and tender, and my legs had several bruises on them, and I was bleeding from a small cut just above my right knee.</p><p>I had no idea who had taken me or why, but everything inside me was screaming to get out.</p><p>I staggered back down the stairs, and then, on my hands and knees, began searching the floor for anything to help me escape. I prayed that my purse had been thrown down here with me. Even though I knew whoever was doing this to me wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to leave my purse with my cell phone in it. But panic surpassed sensibility, and I searched every inch of the floor, my hands sweeping the damp cement, occasionally hearing something scurry away from my movements.</p><p>I tried to keep my sanity, but the terror was like a red flag on the beach warning you to not go swimming because of the strong undertow. I was in the undertow, and I couldn\u2019t get out, and it kept pulling me further out to sea.</p><p>I was crying full-out now, my chest heaving with each ragged breath. No. Please no. Logan. He\u2019d find me, wouldn\u2019t he? He was looking for me right now. The police ... Did they call the police? Would they look for me? How long had I been gone? God, I didn\u2019t even know what day it was or how long I\u2019d been passed out.</p><p>Finding nothing on the floor, I bolted up the stairs and started pounding on the door again.</p><p>\u201cHelp! Let me out. Help! Oh God. Please! Please let me go.\u201d</p><p>I punched the door over and over again until my throat was raw from screaming. When my fists were too sore to hit the wood any longer, I slapped the door with the palms of my hands.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I sobbed. \u201cPlease let me out of here.\u201d</p><p>I fell to my knees, uncontrollable cries racking my body, my hands up against the door, my cheek pressed to it. Fear coursed through my insides, tearing apart my sanity with each breath.</p><p>I had no idea how long I stayed curled in a ball on the landing, but it must have been hours as the sun\u2019s rays finally peeked through the window. My throat was so dry that it was as if I\u2019d been sucking on sandpaper all night. My lips stuck together, and when I separated them it tore a thin layer of skin off my bottom lip.</p><p>All I wanted was Logan. I needed him to hold me, tell me everything was going to be alright. But hour after hour passed, and he never came. No one did.</p><p>I ended up having to pee in the corner of the room, and I never felt so dirty in my life. I felt like an animal, and I sobbed as I did it. It was humiliating, and it made me go crazy again, and I screamed and yanked, pulled, and kicked the door.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Was I going to starve to death? Die forgotten, never to be found?</p><p>My fingernails scrapped at the wooden door until splinters stuck in my nail beds. But nothing compared to the torture of the thirst. My mouth tasted like dried vomit, and even trying to swallow was painful.</p><p>After hours of scraping at the door I curled into a ball, my fingertips pushed under the thin space beneath the door. The word terrified took on a whole new meaning as I lay there in a whimpering mess. My mind was poisoned with the possibilities of what was going to happen to me. I\u2019d watched Criminal Minds; I knew what people were capable of. But I think what was worse than anything was the fear of the unknown. My kidnapper\u2019s silence was eating away at my sanity as I lay quivering at the top of the stairs.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long it was before the doorknob turned. Maybe a day, could\u2019ve been two. All I saw was the sun rise and fall, but when I fell asleep I was never sure how long I\u2019d been unconscious.</p><p>The door opened, and a large shadow cast over me.</p><p>I managed to beg one word from my parched lips, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The man leaned forward, grabbed me by the arm, and hauled me up.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t scream. I merely hung like ragdoll, my limbs feeling numb and weak.</p><p>He slapped me on the cheek, and I jerked as pain exploded in my head. I tried to speak, but nothing emerged from my mouth except a croak.</p><p>He picked me up and threw me over his shoulder like a sack of grain then carried me down a hallway. The light blinded me, and for several minutes I was unable to see anything except a bright yellow blurriness. It burned my eyes, and I had to close them until the pain eased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHang her up there.\u201d</p><p>I winced as I opened my eyes again, looking up toward where the voice had come from, but it was dark on the other side of the room, and all I saw was the outline of a man standing near the wall. I was placed on my feet, and instantly they gave out, and I crumpled to the cold tiled floor.</p><p>I managed a moan while looking up at the man. \u201cPlease. Water.\u201d</p><p>His broad face was like the front of a Mac truck, flattened nose, wide cheeks and forehead, and beady green eyes. He stared at me for a second, and then a cruel grin appeared just before he raised his foot and kicked me in the ribs.</p> <p>I screamed, trying to crawl away, the pain plunging into my chest over and over again as he continued his assault until I rolled up into a ball and tried to protect my chest and stomach from his foot.</p><p>\u201cEnough. We don\u2019t need her face accidently bruised.\u201d</p><p>The kicking stopped. Flat-faced guy picked me up by the hair, and I scrambled to get to my feet as he yanked hard, my scalp burning.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want? God, please just let me go.\u201d</p><p>My mind was rolling with fear pouring down over my sanity. Were they going to rape me? Beat me to death? Torture me?</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t let this happen. I wouldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to die like this.</p><p>My survival instinct was still strong, and despite knowing that escape may not be possible, I had to fight. Adrenaline pumped through my veins as Logan\u2019s words during self-defense blasted through me, and I reacted.</p><p>I swung my elbow backward hard and fast. Jarring pain went through my arm as it made contact with his nose, and I heard the distinct crunch.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d He staggered back holding his bleeding nose. I heard a man shouting in another language as I continued my pursuit and went for flat-faced's eyes. My fingers jammed into them; he shoved me back with one arm. I was so weak and off-balance that I fell to my side, and it took me a second to gain my feet again.</p><p>I turned to run past him and banged straight into a hard, unmovable body. The man spun me around so my back was to his chest then locked his arm around my throat and squeezed. I moved my hip back behind his pelvis like Logan had taught me and was about to unlock his hold when the cold metal pressed to my head.</p><p>I froze.</p> <p>\u201cA pity I don\u2019t have time to sample you myself. I enjoy a good fight.\u201d His accented voice sent cold shivers down to my toes. \u201cAlfonzo. Tie her up.\u201d His arm loosened, and I tried to get a glimpse of him, but he shoved me forward into flat-face\u2014who I could only assume was Alfonzo\u2014and walked away.</p><p>Alfonzo had blood dripping from his nose, and his eyes were bloodshot. He grabbed my wrists, and I felt the heavy, thick manacles clasp around them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that, bitch,\u201d Alfonzo said beneath his breath as he pulled me in close.</p><p>I jerked my knee upward, but he was ready for it and jumped back. I felt the burning pain in my cheek as he slapped me.</p><p>\u201cNot the face,\u201d the accented man shouted. \u201cDios.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo crudely pulled my arms above my head, and I felt pressure on my wrists and heard chains clank. I looked up\u2014the manacles on my wrists were hooked onto a chain dangling from the ceiling.</p><p>Oh God. No. Don\u2019t do this. The sobbing began again as I kicked, and my body swayed back and forth, the chains jangling.</p><p>\u201cPlease. No!\u201d I cried. Tears I thought had dried up now streamed steadily down my cheeks. The man chuckled then strode away, and I heard him talking with the other guy, but I couldn\u2019t understand them.</p> <p>I was facing a brick fireplace with my feet barely able to touch the floor. Completely helpless.</p><p>Fear crept across my skin. What were they doing? Why were they doing this? Who were they?</p><p>\u201cGive her water.\u201d</p><p>My head jerked up at the word water, and I tried to swing around, but the man grabbed my hair and jerked my head back then started pouring warm water down my throat. I didn\u2019t care if it was the filthiest water in the world, just the sweetness of something gliding down my throat was heaven.</p><p>It drizzled out the corners of my mouth, and I choked a few times as he continuously poured. I swallowed as fast as I could, afraid I wouldn\u2019t get any more.</p><p>I heard a door creak open then slam shut. Alfonzo shoved my head away from him so hard I swung back and forth on the chains.</p><p>Then\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you screwing up our deal already, Raul? She is mine. That was non-negotiable. I believe I made myself perfectly clear.\u201d</p><p>I broke. Logan\u2019s voice swam into my trembling body and wrapped me in its warmth. I started sobbing, my head falling forward making my arms and shoulders scream in pain as I shook. Logan had come for me. He\u2019s here to take me away. To stop the pain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yours when I tell you she is. And lose the attitude or our deal is finished.\u201d</p><p>Silence. I could hear the wind whistling through the cracks in the window frames.</p><p>\u201cOur deal is solid.\u201d</p><p>Logan? What were they talking about? What deal? A deal to get me out of here? I tried to turn around to see him, but I couldn\u2019t get enough of a foothold to swing myself around.</p><p>Laughter. Cold. Violent. Sinister. It was like the crackle of fireworks mixed with the screech of tires on wet pavement. \u201cShe likes to fight.\u201d His accented tone deepened, and all amusement left it. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m allowing this. She\u2019d make a hefty amount on the market. Would you prefer I test that theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d I called. \u201cLogan. Please.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t he helping me?</p><p>\u201cNo. You have what you want, and I have what I want\u2014her. The rest is left alone.\u201d</p><p>His voice. It was different. Colder. Logan always exuded coolness, but this change was more than that. Like an anger simmering beneath the surface. Why wasn\u2019t he running to me? Holding me in his arms? How did he find me? Why was he talking to the guy like he knew him? Did he not see me? Maybe he didn\u2019t recognize me?</p><p>\u201cLogan! Please.\u201d I fought the manacles again, my wrists raw from the metal cutting into my skin.</p><p>\u201cNever call him that!\u201d the man shouted. \u201cHe is Master to you now.\u201d</p><p>A lash of burning ripped into my back, and I screamed. Intense, throbbing aftershocks tightened my flesh as my body tried to contain the pain.</p><p>Oh God. No. Please. No. \u201cLogan!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cDo exactly as you\u2019re told, Emily.\u201d Logan\u2019s words were stiff and controlled. I wasn\u2019t even sure it was Logan. Was my mind playing tricks on me? I couldn\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t coming to help me.</p><p>I heard the slither of leather sliding across the floor and then the whoosh in the air.</p><p>I tensed. Neck tight, eyes closed.</p><p>The whip came down hard again and I jerked, arching my back as it struck. My arms took the weight of my body as I hung limp from the chains ... sobbing, chest heaving, tears running down my cheeks.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I heaved in and out, my back raw and feeling like a blow torch had been brushed across it.</p><p>\u201cYou speak only when you\u2019re told to or you\u2019ll feel the cut of the whip. Understand?\u201d</p><p>The whip came down hard on my back again, and I gasped, throwing my head back as my body swayed back and forth. \u201cYes. Yes, I understand.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the guy laughing made my stomach churn, and the water threatened to come back up. I started breathing heavily through my mouth, desperate to keep the precious water in my stomach.</p><p>I heard the glide of leather on the tiles. \u201cPlease, no more.\u201d</p><p>My plea was ignored as the whip crackled and slashed into the back of my legs. I shrieked and tried to get away, yanking on the chains and moving my body back and forth.</p><p>Again it came.</p><p>Then again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>I lost count of how many times he whipped me over and over again, my skin searing and throbbing from my shoulders down to my ankles. I swung back and forth on the chains limp and unable to fight anymore. My mind kept crying, but I was silent, afraid to scream, to cry, to do anything that might make them continue hitting me.</p><p>Then it stopped.</p><p>\u201cWe leave in two days. Take her to the transporter\u2019s location. He will crate her and meet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Logan said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Inside I was begging him to hold me, take me in his arms and tell me everything was going to be okay. That he was going to take me away from here.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I trust you?\u201d I heard the scrape of something heavy sliding over the floor.</p><p>\u201cShe dies in transport then you have nothing. And I have nothing. The girl stays with me.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cVery well, but Dave and Jacob will accompany you. Logan ... no mistakes. Compendia?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I felt a body behind me, and I panicked as I smelled the gym-bag scent of Alfonzo. A hand slowly slid down my back over top the welts and then stopped on my stinging ass. He squeezed, and I winced as his fingers cut into the welts. I could feel his body against mine, his hard cock pressed into me.</p><p>I moaned and shook violently causing my body to sway on the chains. He laughed in my ear, his breath wafting across my cheek. His hand slid further down, hesitated, then cupped me hard between my legs.</p><p>I cried louder, pulling my bonds, blood dripping from my wrists. \u201cPlease don\u2019t touch me. Help me ...\u201d I stopped myself from saying Logan\u2019s name, afraid they\u2019d whip me again.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t help you anymore. No one will,\u201d Alfonzo whispered in my ear. He pushed aside my panties and slipped a finger inside me. A part of me died that moment. It was like all the crying, the thirst, the pain was nothing compared to the violation of my body while Logan stood behind me and did nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo. Please no. Why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>How could Logan do this? How could he watch another man hurt me? I sobbed quietly while his thick finger pressed in and out, his heavy breathing next to my ear. I heard his clothing rustling as if ... I couldn\u2019t think. My mind was in a haze with disbelief smothering out any hope that Logan was going to stop this.</p><p>I heard sharp angered voices behind me. I couldn\u2019t make out what was being said, and really, I no longer cared. I was so hurt and humiliated, and all I wanted to do was curl up and die.</p><p>I felt cold. Alone. And unable to stop the predator from violating my body.</p><p>Alfonzo made a low groan, stiffened, and then his finger withdrew. He nipped the top of my ear so hard I cried out. \u201cGoing to be sweet fucking you for real while you beg for mercy.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the cry in my throat and bit my tongue so hard I could taste iron in my mouth.</p><p>He reached up and undid the manacles, and I fell hard to my knees.</p><p>It took me a few seconds before I could move past the pain and raise my head. Slowly I turned and looked over my shoulder for Logan.</p><p>When I saw him my heart stopped for a few seconds then started beating erratically. It was him, but nothing in his eyes was the man I knew. He was cold and expressionless as he stared down at me. Not a glimmer of sympathy in his eyes. I recognized nothing of the man I had fallen in love with.</p><p>Hope died as the realization hit me. He was part of this. He did this to me. I vomited all the water before everything went black.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Day 3</p><p>Devastation overpowered all my other emotions.</p><p>Hopelessness.</p><p>Agony of being torn from everything I thought was real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raw pain made me numb to everything.</p><p>I lay on the cement floor of the basement where they threw me and two bottles of water after facing Logan. He\u2019d betrayed me. He\u2019d looked at me as if I was nothing. Like a piece of mold as I lay degraded and beaten on the floor.</p><p>My mind fought what I\u2019d witnessed, trying to make sense of something that didn\u2019t make sense. How did I miss it? How did I not see that coldness I saw in him now? Was it possible I was so taken by him that I\u2019d blocked out what I didn\u2019t want to see?</p><p>No. Kat said she\u2019d seen it. He was in love with me. But the man I saw here wasn\u2019t a man in love. That was a monster. He\u2019d looked right through me, his eyes void of emotion. He ignored my pleading while another man stuck his finger up inside me. He watched as I was whipped over and over again. That wasn\u2019t human.</p> <p>But Logan had a band. Georgie and Deck knew him. He sang in Matt\u2019s bar. It didn\u2019t make sense, and yet ... he stood and watched me being abused. He talked to those men like he knew who they were.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I cried for. I was bleeding and alone, so hurt and desolate that when the numbness from shock came over me I let it. But it didn\u2019t last.</p><p>Anger came, with the hatred for Logan. The shaking stopped, and I sat for hours staring at the small window, most of the time thinking of nothing except the burning hate for Logan\u2014no, Sculpt. Logan no longer existed.</p><p>What seemed like days later, but may have only been several hours, the door opened and footsteps stopped at the top of the stairs. I got up and walked up the steps toward Alfonzo, each step agony matched with despair bleeding through my veins. I had nothing to fight with any longer. Logan betrayed me. Matt nor the police were coming for me\u2014no one was.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p> <p>I did.</p><p>\u201cPut this on.\u201d He passed me a clean T-shirt and jeans then threw a pair of flip-flops at my feet.</p><p>I knew asking for privacy was pointless, and it really didn\u2019t matter. My body no longer belonged to me. It had been starved, beaten, and blinded with darkness. The welts on my back and legs still throbbed, and I could feel dried blood where they\u2019d whipped me so hard it ripped open my skin.</p><p>I\u2019d never experienced such excruciating pain before; the worst was getting kicked in the ribs by a horse. But this pain wasn\u2019t just physical; it was emotional. Being locked away for hours, waiting for the unknown and praying for someone to save me, while Logan\u2019s cold voice, haunted every waking moment.</p><p>I unzipped what was left of my dress and stepped out of it. I could feel his eyes roaming over my naked skin. It was disgusting, and I felt dirty, and I quickly pulled on the jeans then put the T-shirt over my head at the same time as slipping on the sandals that were a few sizes too big. I briefly wondered about the girl who had worn them last.</p><p>I was waiting for him to touch me. To throw me down on the floor and kick me or use me, and the slightest movement had me jumping and recoiling.</p> <p>Without a word he nodded toward a door at the end of a narrow hallway.</p><p>When we reached it, he threw it open and shoved me outside, and I stumbled down two steps onto a walkway. As soon as the scent of fresh air wafted into me I stopped and breathed it in. After days of smelling urine, I felt like crying just being given this chance to breathe fresh air.</p><p>When I looked around I saw nothing except fields. No one to help. No one to hear my screams. Movement to my left caught my attention, and I saw them ... horses off in the distance. The thrill of freedom beckoned to me, and I knew nothing could stop me.</p><p>I ran.</p><p>I heard his scuffle of feet as he dove for me then cursed when I slipped through his grasp. He shouted behind me as I kicked off the flip-flops and ran as fast as I could. My legs wobbled, and I stumbled as I raced across the gravel driveway toward the cedar fence. My mind roared with panic, adrenaline keeping me from falling flat on my face.</p><p>He was right behind me, swearing and cursing. I could hear his footsteps and knew if he caught me it wouldn\u2019t be good. He was mean ... cruel. It was in his eyes; I knew he would hurt me if he got hold of me again, and that thought pushed me to run faster.</p><p>If I could make it to the horses and get on one, ride it to wherever the stable was ... Someone had to be there to help me. Anyone. No way could he catch me on a horse. I could make it. I knew I could.</p><p>I felt his heavy breathing on the back of my neck as I dove for the fence. My hand touched the cedar rail, and then I had the wind knocked out of me.</p> <p>His body trapped me against the fence, hand wrapped in my hair and yanking backward. I screamed out in pain then shot my elbow back, but this time he was ready and ducked to the side.</p><p>He retaliated with hooking his arm around my throat so tight I couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cNot this time, bitch.\u201d</p><p>He started walking, dragging me toward the van. I fought, kicking and writhing against his hold, but his locked arm around my throat squeezed harder until I was struggling for each breath. I was about to pass out or die when suddenly he let me go, and I fell to the ground sucking in air.</p><p>He slid the side door open on its metal tracks and kicked me hard in the stomach. \u201cInside.\u201d</p><p>I wheezed as I crawled to my feet, struggling to move, but knowing if I didn\u2019t he\u2019d kick me again. He shoved me hard in the small of my back, and I fell forward, abdomen pushing into the metal edge of the van.</p><p>As soon as I was all the way inside he slammed the door shut.</p><p>There were no windows in the van, and the back door was chained with a heavy padlock. I heard a key turn in the lock of the side door and then the handle being tested. I felt like an animal being shipped for transport. A sharp, gruff laugh emerged from my throat\u2014I was an animal. Actually less than that. A carcass, a piece of dead meat being hung up, cut, tasted, and thrown about.</p><p>I bounced around in the back of the van for what I guessed was an hour until I heard the tires slow, and crunch along a gravel road. The van stopped, and the door slid open.</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>I was huddled in the back corner of the van. Too scared to get out and yet wanting to, but knowing whatever awaited me couldn\u2019t be good either.</p><p>\u201cIf have to come get you, bitch, you won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>I knew he meant it. It was like he enjoyed seeing me in pain. I slowly crawled to the door, and Alfonzo grabbed my arm and yanked. I didn\u2019t have time to gain my feet, and I landed hard on my knees on loose gravel.</p><p>I looked up, flinging my hair out of my eyes and came face to face with ... Oh God, Logan. It took me a second to register his face as he stood looking down at me. Steady. Composed. Almost as if five days ago he hadn\u2019t made love to me. As if he didn\u2019t even know me.</p><p>All the contained anger shot from my feet up to my skull and exploded.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bastard,\u201d I screamed and went flying for him. My fist managed to connect with his face before I was caught from behind and dragged back by the hair. I thrashed against Alfonzo\u2019s hold, losing my footing and falling on my ass all the while Logan merely stood and watched.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d he asked when I stopped fighting and lay on the ground heaving in air while Alfonzo kept hold of my hair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one feisty bitch. I\u2019m going to fuck her raw when you\u2019re done with her.\u201d</p><p>Logan moved fast, knocking his hand off my hair and grabbing him by the shirt and slamming him against the van. \u201cShe\u2019s mine. You get that. You don\u2019t get to touch her\u2014ever.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s face went beet red, and his lips pursed together as he spit out, \u201cShe\u2019s not yours. Raul owns her, and I train all his girls before he sells them.\u201d</p><p>The aluminum crinkled as Logan slammed him into the van again. \u201cShe\u2019ll be sold when I\u2019m ready to sell her. You touch her again like you did at the farmhouse ... I\u2019ll cut off your cock and shove it down your throat.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo\u2019s eyes glared at me lying on the ground, but finally he put his hands up, and Logan let him go.</p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d Logan stood in front of me, his feet inches from my hands that pressed into the gravel. He stiffened, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I said and threw a handful of gravel at his face.</p><p>He was on me before my next breath, taking my arm and without hesitation dragging me toward another car. I pushed backward with my feet, trying to gain my balance, but he was walking too fast, and I couldn\u2019t do anything except feel the stones digging into my hips as he pulled me across the driveway.</p><p>\u201cTransport her with the rest of them,\u201d Alfonzo yelled. \u201cBitch needs a fucking lesson. She arrives after that, she won\u2019t be putting up much of a fight.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Logan let me go, I leapt to my feet and was about to run when his hand trapped me by the throat. \u201cDon\u2019t do it, Emily. You run and I have to chase you, it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d</p><p>I was wheezing past the pressure he had on my neck, my hands on top of his trying to peel back his fingers.</p><p>A wave of memory\u2014Logan\u2019s hand on the back of my neck\u2014came plowing into me, and my breath hitched. No, don\u2019t let me remember. Don\u2019t. Please. I swear I heard him whisper my name, but it had to be my imagination. My mind was trying to find some sort of hope to grasp onto when there was nothing, and I wondered if maybe I was going crazy.</p><p>\u201cTell Raul I\u2019ll contact him once we cross the border.\u201d Logan opened the passenger door to the Lexus and put his hand on my head like the police do when they\u2019re putting criminals in the back of a cruiser.</p><p>I got in and noticed two guys sitting in the back seat. I recognized them, but I didn\u2019t know from where until it suddenly hit me as Logan walked around the front of the car. The fight\u2014the bodyguards. The night Kat and I went to Sculpt\u2019s fight and I asked him to teach me self-defense. These men had been in the back of the warehouse watching Logan.</p><p>But that was months ago.</p><p>Oh God. Had they been watching me for weeks? Had every day with Logan been a lie? Was he, what, testing me for this? I started hyperventilating as I thought of all the times I\u2019d been with Logan. How he cradled me in his arms as we sat watching the horses. How he was so protective of me. Why would he have protected me if he was going to let me be beaten?</p><p>Confusion weaved so much anxiety over me that I was having trouble breathing. Logan knew these guys. He\u2019d known them months ago. The truth was ... Logan did this to me.</p><p>The door slammed as Logan got in. He started the car and sped off. I noticed him glance briefly in the rearview mirror at the two men and frown like he was pissed off. At them? I thought he frowned at least, but I was thirsty and delirious and couldn\u2019t be sure if what I was seeing was real or what I wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cThey were at your fight.\u201d</p><p>Logan stiffened, looked in the rearview mirror again, and his hands tightened on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you even bother being nice to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily. Quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just take me weeks ago? What was the point being nice to me at all? Why did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His sharp tone was enough to stop me. \u201cWe\u2019ll go through this once. Once, Emily.\u201d He stared straight ahead, his voice calm and laced with cold, like an ice pick banging out each word. \u201cNever speak unless asked a question. Do exactly as you\u2019re told without hesitation. The outburst you had ... That is reason enough to have you killed, and that\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky. Worse is giving you for the night to a group of workers. Then you\u2019ll wish you were dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was finding it difficult to swallow, my mind sick with memories of letting this guy kiss me, hold me. Oh God, he made love to me. I couldn\u2019t believe this was the Logan who loved ice cream, who tenderly kissed me, held me in his arms, sang to me. Lies. Acid-dunked lies.</p><p>His monotone voice sounded like this was a casual conversation. I opened my mouth to ask about his other victims when I saw his jaw tighten and remembered what he\u2019d said. I gritted my teeth together instead and let the betrayal fester.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll eat, drink, and even piss when I tell you.\u201d His words ground out as if he was having trouble speaking, and his face was hard, eyes watching the road. \u201cOne mistake, Emily\u2014one. And the guy at the farmhouse\u2014Raul\u2014he will break you and sell you to the highest bidder. If you want to remain with me ...\u201d He accentuated the word want, \u201cyou do exactly as I say. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. How many women have you fucked over? Let me guess, since you took your sweet ass time making me fall for you first, I\u2019m guessing four girls a year. Do your bandmates know what you do in your spare time? What about your mother? Does she approve of your extracurricular activities?\u201d My head was yanked back and the edge of a blade held to my throat.</p> <p>Logan took in a long drawn in breath. \u201cYou see Jacob back there? The one who can easily slit your throat? Well, he doesn\u2019t listen to me. He is Raul\u2019s right-hand man and does exactly as Raul wants. And if Raul has told him to keep an eye on you and kill you for being a bitch then that\u2019s what he\u2019ll do, and I can\u2019t stop him.\u201d He paused then said, \u201cOr, rather, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I felt the coldness of the blade slice into my skin. A trickle of blood dripped down my neck then slid onto my T-shirt and absorbed into a big red blotch. The creak of leather sounded as Jacob released me and sat back.</p><p>I wanted to fight, scream and rake my nails down Logan\u2019s face until he bled like I was. I even considered jumping out of the car and taking my chances with my injuries, but instead I sat quietly and stared at the highway ahead. After ten minutes of silence Logan shoved a water bottle into my hand and two pills. \u201cSwallow them.\u201d</p><p>I considered throwing them back at him for about one second, and I think he knew it, because his frown deepened. Then I thought of hiding them under my tongue, but whatever the pills were they weren\u2019t going to kill me; they could\u2019ve easily done that by now.</p><p>I tossed the pills in my mouth then chugged every last drop of water. I was so damn thirsty that my skin felt like it was shriveling up like a dead animal left in the desert sun.</p> <p>\u201cCheck her.\u201d</p><p>Before I knew what was happening Jacob grabbed my chin and pressed\u2014hard. I had no choice but to open my mouth. His finger slid inside, and I gagged and coughed as he crudely searched my mouth to make sure I\u2019d swallowed the pills. I tasted cigarettes and wished I kept some water to wash out my mouth after he finished.</p><p>\u201cClean.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re crossing the border.\u201d He pulled out a passport from his back jean pocket, and I gasped when he flipped it open and I saw my picture. Then I saw with it the round circular plastic case\u2014my birth control. He tossed it on my lap. God, he\u2019d thought of everything. I did wonder why he cared if I was taking my pills or not. \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel sleepy. If we\u2019re lucky they won\u2019t question us, but if they decide they want to talk to you and your wakened\u2014 We\u2019re going to a wedding in Ohio. We\u2019re all friends, and the bride is your friend, Kat. We have clothes in the trunk to prove all of this, so don\u2019t even think of fuckin\u2019 with it.\u201d</p><p>Kat. Oh God, Kat. I closed my eyes and thought of the last time I\u2019d seen her. We\u2019d both been laughing. Happy. Another sob escaped my throat.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d his voice was gruff and cut into me. \u201cThe story? Do you have it?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWords, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will always answer me with words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Humiliation swam over me, it was like he was talking to a child, and I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that I\u2019d had sex with this man. I\u2019d been held in his arms, slept in them. I couldn\u2019t grasp the idea that Logan was acting like this. He was going to be a rock star. He had a band. He had friends. Why would he give up everything to kidnap me? Had all that been a lie too?</p><p>I lay my head back on the seat and closed my eyes as tears threatened to fall. No, I wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction. He deserved my hate, not my tears.</p><p>Whatever he drugged me with began to take effect, and I couldn\u2019t remain awake any longer. At one point I heard voices, and I opened my eyes briefly, but I was too tired, and I curled up against the window and went back to sleep.</p><p>I was kept drugged for three days. The car stopped briefly for food, gasoline, and bathroom breaks. Most of the time I slept, too groggy to fight Logan, and too weak to do anything but eat when given food and go to the bathroom with Jacob who stood outside the stall door. Logan had offered to take me the first time, but that was nixed when Jacob grabbed me. Ever since then Logan stayed with the car. Anywhere I went Jacob went. The other guy Dave, who looked Hispanic and spoke very little, kept to himself and never once touched me even when I stumbled getting out the car once and he was closest to assisting me.</p> <p>The days were a foggy haze of terror. I felt like I was living in the bottom of a well, cold and alone, barely breathing, and when I did breathe it was stale air.</p><p>I heard Logan\u2019s window slide down and then his sterile voice. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Open the gate.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Day 6</p><p>Wherever we were it was completely surrounded by tall brick walls with guards standing at the gates and several walking the perimeter with German shepherds. The property was massive with several buildings and one main building that looked like a mansion. Logan drove up the long, narrow driveway then stopped at the house and shut off the car.</p><p>I looked at Logan, my body beginning to shake as I realized wherever we were was not a place I wanted to be. His hands gripped the steering wheel so tight that his knuckles turned white, and I could hear the leather crack beneath the pressure. It scared me. No, it terrified me.</p><p>He got out of the car as did the two men in the back, and I sat with my knees to my chest watching as he spoke to them and nod toward the house. Both men disappeared inside, and Logan stared at me through the windshield. It was like he was unable to move, his body stiff and looking every bit the fierce fighter, not the gentle rock star who wrote me a song I never had the chance to hear.</p><p>He strode toward me, and I wanted to disappear into the leather seat. I couldn\u2019t control the trembling, and it made me angry that Logan would see it. I wanted to be tough, to have him feel nothing but anger from me, but the panic treading across my body was too overpowering.</p><p>The door flung open. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>It took me several tries to unclip my seatbelt, because my hands were shaking so badly. When I finally did, he snagged my forearm and pulled me out. \u201cDo exactly as I say.\u201d His voice was low as he spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t look at anyone. Eyes down at all times, and do not speak unless asked a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we? Logan? Please why are you doing this to me?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it. The words tumbled from my mouth in quick succession. What little connection I felt he tried to make shattered the moment Logan grabbed me by both shoulders and shook me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it yet, Emily? Raul owns you. He\u2019s ruthless, and he\u2019ll break you down, torture you, and when you beg him for mercy he\u2019ll torture you some more.\u201d His bruising fingers tightened, and I winced. \u201cDo not fuck this up.\u201d</p><p>I broke. I couldn\u2019t help it, and I hated myself for falling so low as to let him or anyone else see me do it, but for that one second I let the fear take hold of me as I said, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared at me with eyes that were cold, dark, and without a spark of ... anything. \u201cYou should be.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched, and it was at that moment I knew I had to face my fear head-on and conquer it or I was going to die. Logan wasn\u2019t going to save me; only I could do that.</p><p>Walking into what looked like a huge dining hall, I kept my head down like Logan told me to, but my eyes drifted upward. It was an uncontrollable reaction. Survival maybe, I didn\u2019t know why, but I was facing the unknown, and I had to look at what the unknown was.</p><p>The room was filled with over a dozen men, most sitting at a long wooden table laden with food. I could smell the aroma of cheeses, wines, and the sweetness of an array of fruits. The sound of laughter echoed off the walls, along with the clinking of glasses and men talking and shouting.</p><p>But it was the subtle sounds of groaning and sobbing that caught my attention. My heart started pounding harder and faster. The noises were wrong. They reminded me of trapped animals in cages and their sobs of despair. I raised my head, eyes searching the room as the sounds pulled at me.</p><p>Lying shivering on the floor was a naked girl.</p><p>Then another tied to a chair.</p><p>Beneath the table.</p><p>Over in the corner of the room, a girl kneeling.</p><p>My eyes widened, and my breath caught in my throat as I stared horrified at the women ... They were young, some maybe younger than me.</p><p>My stomach rolled and lurched, and I staggered backward, fighting against Logan\u2019s grip as I heaved with revulsion at the scene before me.</p><p>I shook my head back and forth over and over. \u201cNo. No ...\u201d I repeated, my hand over my mouth.</p><p>One girl knelt at a man\u2019s feet while he fed her pieces of meat like a dog. She had a metal collar on that had a chain attached to the man\u2019s belt. She was naked, and I could see red welts running the length of her spine.</p><p>Beneath the table, another girl was between an overweight man\u2019s legs. She was ... her mouth was on his cock as he groaned and pushed her face back and forth into him.</p><p>But it was the girl kneeling on all fours nearest me that was the one sobbing quietly. Her cheek was pressed into the floor with her butt in the air as a young man pumped into her from behind. He was also naked and wearing a collar, and he had scars running the length of his back.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo was standing beside the girl laughing and drinking his wine as he watched with a sickening gleam in his eyes. Another man, tall and lean, who looked in his thirties stood beside Alfonzo watching as well, but he wasn\u2019t smiling. The girl. Oh God, the girl\u2019s eyes stared at ... nothing. Blank and empty, yet filled with tears. Her body rocked back and forth, her hair swinging with the motion. It was when Alfonzo raised a crop and hit the guy on the back and said, \u201cHarder\u201d that I lost it.</p><p>I was hyperventilating, and I couldn\u2019t hold it together any longer as I turned my head away and bent over coughing and choking. I couldn\u2019t look as a girl screamed, and I knew ... I knew it was that girl with the dead eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d My mind was like a tornado filled with the sounds and images of what Logan had walked me into. Nightmares couldn\u2019t compare to this. What I thought couldn\u2019t exist in this world ... The realization that people could be so cruel. That this ... slaves ... girls ... It was hidden from the eyes of the world, but it was alive and real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan hauled me up beside him. His voice low as his steal tone whispered in my ear. \u201cPull it together. I told you not to look. You have to learn to trust me.\u201d</p><p>He was a lie. I didn\u2019t trust a single word from his mouth, but I nodded anyway, because I couldn\u2019t think of what else to do as the horror kicked me in the gut. I heaved in breath after breath, my chest wheezing, limbs shaking as I stared at the stone tiles beneath my feet and tried to get the images out of my head. They wouldn\u2019t leave me. The sounds of girls whimpering and screaming, the look of the girl with her cheek pressed to the floor.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut, trying desperately to block out what I\u2019d seen, but it wouldn\u2019t go away. How could Logan be standing there so immune to the horror? Was he even human? No, none of them were.</p><p>I heard slow, casual footsteps approach, and Logan\u2019s grip tightened on my arm, and my body went rigid.</p> <p>\u201cAfter days in your care, I thought she\u2019d be better prepared for what awaited her.\u201d The voice was the same one as in the house where I was whipped. The scent of sweat and garlic wafted off him.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Oh God. I didn\u2019t want to, yet I was terrified of what would happen if I didn\u2019t. When I raised my head, I instantly recognized him. The man from Sculpt\u2019s fight with the two bodyguards Jacob and Dave. I could remember him intently watching Logan after he\u2019d won the fight. That night seemed so long ago.</p><p>The man\u2019s finger came under my chin, and I balked at his touch.</p><p>His fist punched me in the stomach so fast and hard that I stumbled backward and would have fallen if Logan hadn\u2019t been holding my arm. I tried desperately to suck in the air that he\u2019d knocked out of me.</p> <p>\u201cThat was unnecessary, Raul,\u201d Logan said in a calm, contained voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taught her nothing,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s voice remained controlled as he answered, \u201cShe was drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave her to you in good faith, but if she doesn\u2019t conform then I will take her myself, and she\u2019ll be sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s expected of her? Don\u2019t think for one second I\u2019ve forgotten, Raul. She\u2019ll behave.\u201d Logan pulled me tighter into his side, and I could feel every muscle flexed and rigid. \u201cWhen is my first fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d I heard Raul shift his feet until he was standing directly in front of me. \u201cYou remember what I told you, Sculpt?\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t dare look up, but I felt Logan\u2019s hand on my arm tense. \u201cI\u2019m here to fight, Raul. I won\u2019t lose, so don\u2019t ever question me on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t like your attitude. I taught you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou taught me nothing except to fight. I\u2019m here, and I\u2019ll fight, but I get what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen train her and keep her on a short leash, or Alfonzo will take her and she goes on auction.\u201d</p><p>I was humiliated and devastated when I saw Logan shrug. \u201cShe\u2019s mine, because I want to fuck her. Once I\u2019m tired of her, you can do whatever you want with her.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. No. No.</p><p>I was so angry and terrified and grasping at everything that didn\u2019t make sense that I just couldn\u2019t hold onto my sanity any longer. Hearing those words flow easily from the man I\u2019d fallen in love with was like an anchor sitting in my stomach with oil being poured all over the once beautiful rabble of butterflies, darkening the love I once felt for this man.</p><p>I hated him. I hated him so much at that moment that I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I reeled back and slapped him hard across the face. Then I spit at him ... turned and spit at Raul. \u201cBastards. Disgusting, fucking parasites.\u201d My yelling got the attention of the entire room, and even though I knew what I\u2019d done couldn\u2019t be good for me\u2014it felt unbelievably amazing.</p> <p>Then I was down on the floor with a knee shoved into my back and a hand pressing my face into the stone floor. I cried out as my arms were wrenched behind my back and something rough and stiff was wrapped around my wrists. Then I was hauled to my feet by Jacob.</p><p>I glared at Logan. \u201cI hate you. I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d I was hit hard on the side of my head, and I felt blood dripping down my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re a monster.\u201d Logan\u2019s face remained unaffected by my words as his cold stare went right through me.</p><p>\u201cYou know what to do,\u201d Raul said, his breath seeping into my nostrils.</p><p>Jacob nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Logan said, his voice a deep, dark rumble. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe insulted us and a room full of men. She\u2019ll be treated as any other. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t strip her naked and let every man in here do as he pleases for the insult.\u201d</p><p>I struggled against Jacob, but he was big, and to him I was like a pesky little Chihuahua.</p><p>\u201cEmily, stop.\u201d Logan\u2019s order plowed through my panic and anger, and I stood still. I didn\u2019t know how I knew this, maybe instinct, or it was the way Logan\u2019s eyes stared at me unflinching, but I knew I had to stop fighting. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight here, Emily. Ever.\u201d He chin-lifted to Jacob, and suddenly I was being hauled away.</p><p>It was almost like being separated from my safety net\u2014Logan. He wasn\u2019t much of one, and it had holes all through it, but I still had some sort of connection to him, and even if I no longer trusted him, I didn\u2019t want to be taken from him.</p><p>I looked back over my shoulder. Logan stood in the same place staring at me. He never moved, never looked away. Somewhere inside of me I was hoping he\u2019d stop Jacob. That he\u2019d run after me, shout, do something, but he just watched me.</p><p>I pleaded and hoped that he\u2019d change back to the man who swept me into his heart. Then I screamed silently for him to fight for me as I disappeared from his view.</p><p>I was so terrified, that I sunk so low as to beg. \u201cPlease. I promise to be good. Take me back to Logan.\u201d</p><p>Jacob ignored me like he\u2019d done for the past three days. Not one word did he direct toward me. Instead, if he wanted me to do something he spoke to Logan who then told me.</p><p>He pulled me down a long, wide hallway with oil paintings of naked figures on the peachy brown stucco walls. Some were of a woman, others two women, or a man and a woman. They were beautiful paintings, and I suspected they were worth a fortune. Wherever we were, the place reeked money.</p><p>Jacob slid a key into a lock then opened a door. The heavy wood creaked, and when I saw it led down a staircase and into darkness, I started shaking. \u201cPlease.\u201d I pulled back on his grip and shook my head back and forth. I\u2019d do anything not to be left alone in the dark again. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d I hated the words I was willing to say, but I couldn\u2019t stop them. I began hyperventilating as Jacob pulled me forward.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. Please.\u201d</p><p>Jacob ignored my begging as he shuffled me in through the door and then down the stairs. I started to cry as the familiar mustiness sunk into me. I couldn\u2019t be locked up again. The terror gripped me, and I thrashed against Jacob\u2019s hold. My body moved like a trapped piece of paper flinging in the wind. My insides were ripping apart, tearing, burning with fear.</p><p>Jacob calmly continued down the stairs then walked along a hallway, me writhing against his hold the entire time, sobbing, begging. He remained unaffected as he kicked open a door and shoved me inside.</p><p>I jerked as it slammed behind me and Jacob then turned a key in the lock.</p><p>I slowly backed away from him. He brushed past me, and I staggered to the side, but he never grabbed me. Instead, he walked over to a tap in the wall and grabbed a bucket; then water started pouring out into the pail.</p><p>I turned and staggered to the door and started yanking on it. It wouldn\u2019t budge. Then I pounded on it and yelled for help. I knew it was pointless, but I couldn\u2019t help doing it. I guess I had a smidgen of hope that Logan would hear my panic and he\u2019d come.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>Logan never came.</p><p>Jacob forced me over to a dirty mattress on a rusted metal bedframe and pushed me down. I instantly thought he was going to force himself on me, but he didn\u2019t take off my clothes. He pinned me down with the weight of his knee on my stomach then calmly tied my wrists and ankles to the bedframe.</p><p>I yanked and pulled, trying to get free, yet knowing it was pointless. I watched Jacob as he dragged a collapsible plastic chair behind the front of the bed near my head then brought the bucket.</p><p>My eyes widened with terror, uncertainty. Jacob sat, reached in the bucket, and pulled out a soaking wet towel.</p><p>That\u2019s when I knew.</p><p>I knew exactly what he was going to do. I\u2019d seen it in the movies. Heard that it was used to get people to talk. Torture. Unimaginable torture.</p><p>A wet towel thrown over the victim and water poured over their face.</p><p>Drowning over and over again.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I went crazy. Struggling against the ropes as Jacob placed the towel over my face. \u201cNo. No. No. No.\u201d</p><p>He held my head back then the water came and my words were drowned with garbled screams.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Day 7</p><p>The door creaked open on its heavy hinges, and then slow footsteps. Panic and fear reared, and I tried to fade back into the mattress, cowering.</p><p>Jacob had blindfolded me after the waterboarding. The agony ... Panic setting off every nerve in my body as I struggled to breath but sucked in water instead. I tried to scream, to beg, to break free from the bonds that latched me to the bed, but there was no escape.</p><p>I was fighting for survival, yet losing with every water-drawn breath.</p><p>Jacob had done it time and again, pouring water over the towel on my face. I begged him to stop when he let me cough up water and breath for a few minutes. I sobbed, and I promised to do anything he wanted.</p><p>He ignored my pleas and did it again and I gagged, choked and struggled. Then when he was done, he took off the towel and replaced it with a blindfold.</p><p>The footsteps drew closer.</p><p>Was Jacob back? Was he going to torture me again? I wanted to fight, but I knew that it only made the torture worse. So I stayed quiet and still as the footsteps drew closer. Then I breathed in the familiar scent of what reminded me of a fresh cut grass\u2014Logan.</p><p>Relief. Yes, I felt it. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have, but I did.</p><p>But my tears were gone, I\u2019m not sure where. He\u2019d stolen them away. Him or Jacob? I wasn\u2019t really sure anymore, because Jacob had broken me, and Logan had wrecked me. Tainted thoughts of Logan filled me. A hate I had to keep hidden and controlled, because if he left me here any longer I was going to lose whatever grasp on reality I had left. Already I\u2019ll never be the same girl again; I\u2019d at least like to be sane.</p><p>I felt the soft brush of his fingers on my arm and recoiled. His touch stopped, and I heard him shift as if he was hesitating. Then he walked away. I bit my lip to stop myself from begging him to come back, to release me, to take me out of here.</p><p>He strode back, and this time he untied the ropes that locked my wrists and ankles to the bed, and gently helped me sit up.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His fingers traced down the side of my face then to the curve of my neck. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight here.\u201d</p><p>His familiar touch awakened my oil-drowned butterflies, and I felt sick that my body reacted to his touch that way. I bit down hard on the inside of my cheek until I tasted blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you understand why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I had no choice. Hours I sat, blindfolded, shivering, wet, cold and alone while I contemplated my life. Fighting them would only make it harder on me. They wouldn\u2019t kill me. No, instead they\u2019d make me suffer each and every day until I gave them what they wanted. I saw the proof of that with those girls. There was no running and hiding from what Logan had brought me into. There was no fighting. All I had left was survival and hope.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He put his hand under my elbow, helped me stand then guided me out of the room. He didn\u2019t remove my blindfold, and I didn\u2019t ask him to.</p><p>We walked for a while, going through doors and turns until I felt the brilliant sun beat down on my bare skin. I inhaled the scent of meat cooking and smoke as if I was at a barbecue. It mixed with the smell of flowers and ... Logan.</p> <p>I had the urge to tear the blindfold from my eyes. Without my sight for hours on end, all other senses was heightened. Anxiety crept up on me with every step. I had no idea where we were going, if I was going to be tortured again. God, he could be leading me to a pit of lions and I wouldn\u2019t know it. The fear escalated with each unknown step, and I started shaking so badly that I stumbled.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His voice was steady and calm, and for some reason it settled me enough to keep walking.</p><p>I jerked as I heard a door shut behind us. Logan put his hands on either side of my head, and I wondered if he was going to snap my neck, but when his fingers fiddled with the knot in the bandanna I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He stopped, then he hands fell away. \u201cEmily ...You\u2019re safer if you cannot see.\u201d</p><p>I was trembling so bad that my teeth started chattering. I wasn\u2019t certain whether it was from the weakness in my limbs or the fear of what he was going to do to me.</p> <p>I heard him walk across the room, stop, and come back toward me. His tone was ... deadly. I\u2019d never heard anyone\u2019s voice vibrating with such controlled fury before.</p><p>I jumped when his hand touched my cheek. \u201cYou need to fear me, not hate me.\u201d</p><p>I did. I feared him. But I think I hated him more. No, I knew I hated him more. For what he\u2019d done. For what he was doing. For the betrayal. Most of all, for tarnishing something so beautiful and making it ugly. I trusted him. I gave myself to him, and he took me, peeled back layers of my soul until he saw it all. Then he took me.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what must happen here?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I did. I understood what Logan wanted of me. He wanted what that girl with the dead eyes had become. The girl being rocked back and forth as some guy pounded into her from behind. He wanted the girl beneath the table. He wanted complete and utter submission.</p><p>He wanted me to be his slave.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>I jerked at his abrupt tone. \u201cYes. Yes, I understand.\u201d</p><p>His finger caressed my lower lip. \u201cOpen.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to. God, my mind fought it, and yet I swallowed my pride and opened my mouth. His finger slipped inside, and I wanted to bite down hard, but I didn\u2019t. \u201cSuck.\u201d I did that too. \u201cGood girl,\u201d he soothed. His other hand came around my waist and brought me up against him.</p><p>I remained calm, using my breathing to release the panic that tip-toed across my body. Being blinded kept the fear alive inside me. This is what he wanted\u2014fear.</p><p>\u201cLeave us.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, not realizing we weren\u2019t alone. I heard footsteps walk past us, then the door opened and closed.</p><p>\u201cRaul is testing you.\u201d He ran a finger across my collarbone and then lower to the top of my breast. \u201cAnd me.\u201d A feathered touch swept across my nipple causing it to become erect as if I wanted his touch. Oh God, how was my body reacting to him like this? Why? How could I like what he was doing? Why was there a familiar twinge between my legs?</p><p>No. Stop.</p> <p>I stiffened and tried to tune out his movements. Block him. Keep him out of me. \u201cPlease Sculpt, let me go.\u201d It was natural calling him Sculpt as if using his real name would somehow weaken me to his power even more.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>The anger simmered at the edge of my sanity. \u201cSo, what do you get for bringing me here? Besides the satisfaction of seeing a woman beaten, tortured, and humiliated?\u201d I braved asking the question, knowing he may not answer, but hoping he\u2019d give me something.</p><p>His hand stilled on my neck. I thought for a second he was going to choke me, but he remained completely still and quiet. I was waiting to be hit or dragged back to the basement, and I was now worried that I\u2019d spoken when I shouldn\u2019t have. I wanted to run and hide\u2014cower. I was a mouse quivering and scared of every squeak I made or movement. I was so uncertain of everything that I sought the only reassurance I could get, and that assurance was from Logan.</p><p>\u201cI get you.\u201d</p><p>I felt the twitch of his finger on my skin. Logan was steady as a rock; he didn\u2019t twitch. Never did he falter. There was something more to his answer. Raul may be giving me to Logan, but there was something else he wasn\u2019t telling me.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why are you doing this? Was everything we had ...\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. I shouldn\u2019t have asked, and yet, I was losing control. I wanted answers. To know why he lured me into his trap.</p><p>Logan pulled me further into the room then turned me to face him, hands on both my arms. \u201cDo you fear me, Emily? Because if you don\u2019t Raul will know. He excels at knowing fear. You give him something else, he\u2019ll know. Then we\u2019re dealing with more than you ever imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I shouted the words, and his grip tightened.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d his voice was steady and composed as if he was unaffected by my words. \u201cBut fear must override your hate. Remember what I taught you? You can\u2019t have that here.\u201d</p><p>What he taught me? The self-defence? What did ...?And then it hit me\u2014he\u2019d wanted my anger when he\u2019d been teaching me to fight. After Logan reluctantly agreed to be my teacher, he took my fear and turned it into a controlled anger. He gave me confidence to fight back, and now ... now he wanted the fear back?</p><p>\u201cYou will fear me, Emily. And if you don\u2019t ... I will make you.\u201d His words were abrupt and unruffled. It sent shivers down my spine.</p><p>Did I fear him? Yes. I was scared of who he\u2019d become, of what he was, and of that cold, emotionless face I thought I once knew. I was scared of how my body still reacted to him. How it betrayed me. And yes, I was scared that he\u2019d give me to Raul. Because Raul I feared the most, and I was uncertain if I could survive him.</p><p>\u201cThis is his business. Raul kidnaps girls, women. They are trained then auctioned off. They bring him lots of money. You would bring him lots of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat and Matt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty, old enough to disappear. Raul made you disappear. One more girl missing won\u2019t bring the law down to Mexico looking for you, especially with a mother who doesn\u2019t give a shit about her daughter.\u201d</p><p>That hurt, but was unfortunately true. My heart rate picked up, and I licked my dry, cracked lips. Kat and Matt wouldn\u2019t give up on me. They\u2019d come for me; they had to.</p><p>He took my wrists and tied what felt like rope around them. I start to hyperventilate, afraid of what he\u2019d do, scared of being so vulnerable. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do what, Emily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do fear you.\u201d</p><p>Silence as he continued to tighten the ropes. All I could hear was the coarse nylon as it moved back and forth from whatever he was doing to it after he tied it to my wrists. Suddenly, he let me go, and I heard his footsteps stride away like he was angry. Then a door slammed in the opposite direction of where we entered the room.</p><p>I fell to my knees, my wrists tied together, and my skin cold and clammy and ... dirty. I felt so dirty inside and out. I\u2019d been in the same clothes for days, no shower, little food.</p><p>The door opened again.</p><p>Footsteps. He stopped in front of me. \u201cThere are rules you have to follow. Kneel when someone enters the room. Never speak unless spoken to. Keep your head down, and if you want to live then you will submit to me.\u201d He grabbed my wrists, pulled me to my feet, and raised my arms above my head. I felt something snag on the rope.</p><p>He let me go.</p><p>I yanked and realized he\u2019d tied me to something above me. I tugged harder, but I couldn\u2019t get free. Panic crawled over my skin.</p><p>His knuckles brushed over my neck, and then I felt the tug on the neckline of my shirt. With one yank he tore my shirt from my body.</p><p>I begged Logan in my mind. Begged and screamed to let me go, but I never emitted a sound. I took several deep breaths, knowing to fight would only prolong whatever he was going to do to me.</p><p>His hands undid my jeans, and he dragged them off as well; then my panties followed. I hung naked, quivering, and blinded. The degradation was so powerful that I wanted to curl up in a tomb and die.</p><p>He cupped my chin. It was soft and kind as if he was trying to give me some kind of reassurance. \u201cIt\u2019s in you. I saw the strength,\u201d Logan whispered. He ran his finger down my cheek then across my lips. \u201cYou need to be the lion here, Eme.\u201d</p><p>I choked back the sob in my throat at the sound of his voice, the one I had known and loved. The coldness had dissipated, and my mind was screaming for him.</p><p>I heard the door creak open. \u201cHe is ready for you.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s hand stiffened on me. \u201cNo screaming.\u201d</p><p>I jumped at the tone of his cold voice.</p><p>He let me go, and I heard him stride across the room then abruptly turn and come back again. \u201cFollow the rules. If you don\u2019t ... you will be lost to this world, and I can\u2019t stop it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I want to be lost.</p><p>Yes. No. God, I just wanted to go back. My mind was so screwed up that I couldn\u2019t think straight. I was clinging to a man that no longer existed ... No, that was wrong. The man I knew had been a lie.</p><p>His breath drifted across my face, and then his hand was in my hair, pulling my head back. \u201cEmily,\u201d he breathed, saying my name like it meant something to him. \u201cDon\u2019t fail me.\u201d His words were barely a whisper. If I could have seen him I\u2019d have imagined those eyes, the ones that pulled me in day after day as he taught me how to fight, when he sang to me in the horse field, when he wiped ice cream off my chin. His sweet whispered words were in the voice I grew to love, the one that promised to protect me no matter what.</p><p>He promised never to hurt me. He promised.</p><p>\u201cWhen I come back ... remember the rules.\u201d</p><p>I heard his steps fade away, then the door closed, and the lock turned.</p><p>Oh God, help me. Don\u2019t leave me like this. Come back.</p><p>Three hours later</p><p>The blindfold was wet from my silent tears. I lost all the feeling in my hands from the ropes tied tight around my wrists. I prayed. For salvation. For death. For Logan to come back. I had nothing left inside. Nothing. The emptiness was like a vacant shell, hollow, alone without a single thought except the instinct to survive.</p><p>My lips were so dry now that they\u2019d split open in several places like tiny paper cuts. I was cold despite the warmth in the room as I stood naked for hours. I listened for doors opening and footsteps constantly. It became so surreal that every few seconds, I swore I heard footsteps, yet it was nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My imagination ran away with me, and I couldn\u2019t get it back under control. Images of being left here for days on end. Starving and alone. I never thought being alone would be so hard to endure, but the silence was like a knife being dragged across my skin. The fear of not knowing. The waiting. Unsure for how long I\u2019d be left here.</p><p>I stood hanging by my arms, my tiptoes barely holding me up. Agony ate its way through my muscles as I shook uncontrollably.</p><p>Then, finally ... footsteps.</p><p>Voices.</p> <p>The door opened, and I gasped, choking back the sobs. My chest heaved with relief and yet ... uncertainty. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to cry, and if I did he may leave me here longer.</p><p>Voices closed in on me.</p><p>Logan\u2019s and someone else\u2019s. The footsteps drew closer, and I tensed, waiting for the pain or a caress. I didn\u2019t know which. I couldn\u2019t. My body was so distressed with the frantic worry that I was sweating. I took deep breaths like Logan had taught me in self-defence to control my fear.</p><p>But that was what he wanted\u2014fear. Well, he had it. I was living in an ocean of it.</p><p>The familiar scent of Raul drifted into me, and my nerves sparked.</p> <p>Please. No. Don\u2019t let him take me.</p><p>I\u2019d do anything, absolutely anything so that Raul didn\u2019t take me.</p><p>\u201cI will not tolerate her behavior in my house, Sculpt. Some of the men asked me why I hadn\u2019t killed her for the disrespect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how you operate, Raul,\u201d Logan replied.</p><p>Raul\u2019s hand traced up over my breast, rough calloused hands far different than Logan\u2019s. I bit my lower lip until I tasted blood in my mouth. \u201cTrust is earned, Sculpt. You must earn that. As must she.\u201d His fingers gripped my chin. \u201cShe is very beautiful. When you tire of her, she\u2019ll make a good amount on auction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect she will. But for now, she is mine. Aren\u2019t you, Emily?\u201d</p> <p>Never. Never again. \u201cYes.\u201d I knew my voice was trembling. Logan, God, don\u2019t do this to me. Even though I couldn\u2019t see, I felt Logan tense. It was like the air stopped for a brief second as the room went silent.</p><p>\u201cIf you lose the fight, she\u2019ll be sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>Raul\u2019s finger slipped across my dry lips, and I knew what I was supposed to do. I didn\u2019t want to do it, and my stomach churned violently at the thought of what I had to do. But I did. I couldn\u2019t face that room downstairs again. Not now. I didn\u2019t know if I ever could again. I slipped my tongue out and licked it then drew it into my mouth.</p><p>Raul chuckled. \u201cBetter.\u201d He let me suckle on it for a few seconds then withdrew.</p><p>My heart was pounding so hard, I swore they could hear it. The tears sat in the rims of my eyes, teetering like a ball on a ledge. I clenched my fingers into fists, nails digging into my palm, trying desperately to focus on anything but what was happening.</p><p>I was glad I was blindfolded. It may have kept the fear alive of the unknown, but it also saved me from seeing Raul. Of looking into his narrowed eyes as I sucked his finger. I\u2019d have never been able to force myself to do it if I\u2019d been able to see his face. Had Logan known that? Was there a reason to him keeping me blindfolded? No. I had to stop fantasizing Logan was in any way helping me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like me, Sculpt,\u201d Raul said. \u201cDetermined. Resilient. And I see that merciless confidence when you fight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing like you, Raul,\u201d Logan replied. \u201cI have what you don\u2019t, and that is patience.\u201d</p><p>Raul laughed. \u201cAhh, you know me well. Yes, that is true. I\u2019m not a patient man.\u201d Footsteps shifted, and the hardwood floor creaked. \u201cShe makes one mistake, and she leaves. I won\u2019t have disobedience in my home\u2014ever. You should know that, Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and closed then I heard a key turn in the lock. Silence. They\u2019d both left. The sobs choked me as I broke into a thousand fragments. Why did he hate me so much to do this to me? What had I done wrong? Why me?</p><p>The blindfold was soaked by my tears. The pain had gone ... No, it was there; my mind had faded it out in order to survive. What remained was weakness. That was how I felt. Too tired to fight. Afraid to fight.</p><p>And God yes ... I wanted to be loved by him again. For him to hold me in his arms and take this nightmare away.</p><p>Did I really think that? How could my mind even contemplate loving him after what he\u2019s put me through? But I did. I couldn\u2019t control it. He\u2019d swept me up and taken possession of my heart, even though he was now ripping it to shreds.</p><p>But I wanted Logan to save me.</p><p>I wanted the man I fell in love with to carry me away from this place.</p><p>And I wanted him to carry me away ... and then ... then I wanted to kill him.</p><p>The door opened a while later. I was half-aware of Logan\u2019s hands on my wrists as he undid the ropes and the blindfold. I was too weak and tired to do anything except fall into his arms.</p><p>He picked me up and carried me to a bed and then pulled a white silk nightgown over my head. I thought I heard him whisper something to me as he laid me down, but the pain in my body overrode his useless words as my body screamed with agony.</p><p>He walked away then came back, and the mattress sagged as he sat beside me. He took my right hand first, gently washed it with warm water then applied cream to my burned-raw skin. He slowly massaged my cold, numb fingers then repeated the process with my other wrist and hand. I closed my eyes and let him do whatever he wanted. It felt good, and yet I wanted the pain as a reminder of what he\u2019d done to me.</p><p>He placed the cream on the nightstand, and grabbed a bottle of water beside it and held it to my lips. I didn\u2019t hesitate as I greedily drank. When I\u2019d drained half of it, he pulled it away, and put it back. I watched as he stood, peeled off his clothes until he stood naked. Was he going to sleep with me? Have sex with me? Was he going to make me? Did he think it was okay because I\u2019d willingly had sex with him once?</p><p>He stared down at me. I stared back. Neither of us moved for what seemed like minutes but was probably only seconds.</p><p>He looked beautiful, and it pissed me off that he could look so beautiful when he was so ugly. He pulled back the sheet and then slipped in beside me. I turned around and tried to scoot away, but he expected it and was ready, arms locking around my middle and dragging back against him, so my back was tight to his chest. I tensed as the pain from the welts intensified. He didn\u2019t lighten his hold as he then hooked his leg over mine like an anchor, the weight pinning me in place.</p><p>It was weird, the touch of his warm skin and his arms around me ... it was comforting. As if I\u2019d been starved that feeling of kindness, and that I\u2019d take it from the man who had stolen it from me in the first place.</p><p>God, was I that weak to take any gentleness that was offered?</p><p>His lips pressed to my ear, and my breath caught in my throat. Why? Why was he doing this? I was so confused at who he was. Cold and unattached one moment and now ... now he was holding me in his arms as if he cared.</p><p>Logan\u2019s fingers splayed over my stomach just below my belly button. I wanted to cry. Not for the pain that he was putting me through but for this moment that made me love him again.</p><p>I needed him to be cruel. It was easier to be disgusted by him.</p><p>But this ...</p><p>I tried to push his arm off and move away, but he tightened his hold. \u201cStay still, Emily.\u201d</p><p>I stopped.</p><p>He won. He\u2019d told me that once. He always won.</p><p>As I lay in bed staring at the wall, my wrists sore, muscles aching from shivering for so long. I felt myself slipping. Not my mind, but myself. It was as if my body was separated from my thoughts and emotions.</p><p>I realized it felt safer this way. My body was just an apparatus, something to be used. It had no real value any longer. I could let it go and drift away to safer pastures with my mind. Some place where no one could reach me.</p><p>Even Logan.</p><p>But I missed him. It was crazy, I knew, but somewhere a part of me still loved the man that I\u2019d fallen for. The man who kissed me and made love to me as if he thought I was the most precious woman in the world.</p><p>But that tiny memory of the Logan I knew was slipping past my reach. He was fading, and I wanted to latch onto him before he slipped away from me forever. In the darkness, in the familiar arms of a man I once loved, I pretended. I pretended that he was the Logan I fell in love with and he was here to protect me from the daylight and the reality that came with morning.</p><p>I closed my eyes; the heat of his naked body up against mine and then ... then just as I was falling asleep I felt his fingers interlink with mine and his lips kiss the back of my shoulder.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Day 8</p><p>I woke to find Logan still curled around me, his head nestled in my shoulder, lips on my skin. His heated breath was slow and even to match his heartbeat against my back. His arm lay heavy over my side, and our fingers weaved together like lovers after a night of passion.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut imagining nothing in the last week had been real and that I lay in Logan\u2019s arms after he made love to me. He\u2019d wake up and kiss me, and I\u2019d be lost within his touch.</p><p>I felt the ache between my legs as I let my imagination roam. His thigh resting over mine, hard and warm. Him on top, the feel of his weight making my desire flood every nerve in my body.</p><p>His hands caressing my skin, soft then possessive as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of me. I moaned as I imagined his fingers playing with my hair while his other hand squeezed our interlocked fingers. Then his lips kissed my shoulder, and I nearly leapt out of my skin when the desire shot right through me, and I realized it was no longer my imagination.</p><p>I scrambled out of his arms so fast that I fell off the bed. When I came to my feet Logan was lying on his back an arm casually laid over his abdomen. He turned slightly to look at me, and I felt the coldness in his gaze trickle over me.</p><p>\u201cGo shower, Emily.\u201d He nodded to the right where I saw a door.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think twice about following his orders as I ran to the refuge of the bathroom, but before I could shut the door he said, \u201cLeave it open.\u201d</p><p>My hand dropped from the door handle even though all I wanted to do was slam it shut and lock it; of course there was no lock to keep him out. Regardless, a deadbolt wouldn\u2019t keep Logan out. I suspected nothing would.</p><p>In a way, that was partly why I fell for him. He was determined and focused. Unfathomable. He was confident with no fear. A steady resolve as if nothing could break him. It was a scary hot, and it made me feel protected. Now ... it scared me. Because now I didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>I started to undo the buttons of my white nightgown he\u2019d given me to wear, and when I looked in the mirror I gasped. He could see me. From the bed he watched me in the mirror undressing. His hands were locked behind his head, and his face was unreadable as he stared.</p><p>My fingers fumbled on the buttons, and it took me several tries to get the last one undone. I closed my eyes as I slid the silk material off my shoulders and let it drop to the floor. I wasn\u2019t going to look at him, I tried to stop myself, but I opened my eyes and froze.</p><p>Heat. Blazing desire in the dark depths of his eyes. He looked me up and down slowly, casually as if he had all the time in the world ... And he did. He controlled everything about me now. If he became bored or annoyed with me he could sell me without a moment\u2019s hesitation. That alone made me do anything he wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lowered my head so I couldn\u2019t see his expression, and then opened the frosted glass door to the shower and stepped inside.</p><p>Was he going to come in after me? Would he touch me? Hold me? Make love to me? What was I thinking? There would never be making love again, it would be fucking. The question was whether it would be willing or not.</p><p>I turned on the tap to straight cold wincing as the freezing water hit my skin. It jolted any desire I was foolishly feeling over Logan right down the drain.</p><p>I quickly washed my hair then picked up the washcloth to scrub the stench off my skin. I rubbed so hard that my skin turned bright red. I lightened the pressure on the back of my legs and avoided my back, where my skin was still raw. I needed to get the feeling of Alfonzo and Jacob and Raul off me. Logan? Why hadn\u2019t I even thought of Logan? Why wasn\u2019t I sick to my stomach at the thought of him holding me all night?</p> <p>\u201cCome out here.\u201d</p><p>The washcloth dropped from my hands as I looked and saw the outline of Logan leaning up against the counter, arms crossed.</p><p>I turned off the taps and came out. He looked me up and down and frowned then reached over and grabbed the towel hanging on the hook. He came toward me, then began drying my skin. There was nothing methodical about it either. It was slow and sensual; he held the towel in his palm, so his thumb could brush over my skin with each stroke. His hand slid over my abdomen then lower until his hand rested on my mound. He stopped and looked at me. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. Then inched my legs apart closing my eyes. I had mixed emotions, because I felt embarrassed, and yet there was a flicker of desire. There was a fine line he was drawing here, and I just wasn\u2019t sure which way it would go.</p><p>He stepped closer. His thumb skimmed between my legs with the towel trailing. I held my breath. He never took his eyes off me as he discovered the smooth silky moisture of my craving. I stopped breathing, hating that he knew I was turned on.</p> <p>His eyes narrowed, and his jaw clenched.</p><p>Then like it never happened, he quickly dried my inner thighs then threw the towel on the floor. \u201cLeave off the nightgown. Go kneel by the bed.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to ... What, tell him off? Tell him no? Refuse to do what he asked and risk being beaten or thrown in the basement with Jacob? Or worse sold?</p><p>I walked out of the bathroom and heard the water turn back on just as I knelt on the floor. I knew what this was about; I wasn\u2019t stupid. I figured it out the second I saw the girls in the dining room. He was training me.</p><p>I was Logan\u2019s sex slave, although sex had yet to come into play, but I had no doubt it would. He\u2019d brought my birth control pills for Christ\u2019s sake. I was to do what he wanted without question\u2014never disobey, never speak unless asked to, and submit to all men. I belonged to him, and it was not by free will.</p><p>Logan came out of the bathroom naked. \u201cEyes down.\u201d</p> <p>I could hear him getting dressed, the cupboard door opening, rustling clothes, and then a click as the cupboard shut again. His footsteps drew close then stopped in front of me.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I did, and he put a slice of apple in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cToday you will come with me to my training. You must learn what to do when in public, Emily.\u201d His fingers held another slice of apple, and I opened my mouth, and he slid it inside. \u201cBehave like this, and we won\u2019t have any issues.\u201d</p><p>My stomach churned at the thought of witnessing the last scene in the dining area. I was afraid I\u2019d panic and run or fight. Logan tried to feed me another piece of apple, but I turned my head away.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cOpen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t. Please. I feel sick to my stomach. Logan plea\u2014\u201d I stopped suddenly knowing instantly that I\u2019d used his real name when I was told not to. I still had the red marks on my skin from the whip and never wanted to feel the cruel slice of it again. I lowered my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>I started trembling.</p><p>When his hand came down on my shoulder I lost it and started crying. Was going to whip me? Or take me to Jacob? It was a mistake. I didn\u2019t mean to call him by name.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d I kept sobbing, my head in my hands rocking. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I did. I had to or suffer something worse than what I anticipated.</p><p>He cupped my chin and rubbed his thumb over top of the crevice just below my lower lip. \u201cYou cannot use my name here. Ever. I think you know that.\u201d I nodded. \u201cIf you need to call me something, it must be Master.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>The word was trapped in my clogged throat; I was filled with denial of what I had to do. For some reason the idea of calling any man Master was ... It was humiliating, degrading. God, it made me feel like an object with no self-worth.</p><p>His hand tightened on my chin. \u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>It was just a word. It was just a word. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He didn\u2019t smile; actually he frowned, and then he got up abruptly and went into the bathroom and slammed the door.</p><p>I waited on my knees until he finally came back out a cold mask of determination on his face. I didn\u2019t like that face, it wasn\u2019t mad or calm or smiling; it was unreadable, and that was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cA girl will bring you clothes. Wear them. I\u2019ll be back to get you in a half hour.\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother looking at me as he walked past, unlocked the door, and left.</p><p>When he came back I was dressed in a black dress that dipped so low in the front that it barely covered my nipples. It fit tight to my body, over my hips to my upper thigh. It wasn\u2019t sexy; it was trashy, and I felt that way. I would have rather worn the white nightgown than this dress.</p><p>Logan told me to stand then looked me up and down, and then, as if satisfied, nodded and reached out his hand. I walked toward him and took it.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to keep you hidden from this, but that isn\u2019t going to happen. You need to learn to tune out what is happening around you. Just like I taught you to overcome your fear with anger, you need to overcome your emotions and bury them. Numb, Emily. That is what it will take to survive.\u201d</p><p>Why was he telling me this? So, I didn\u2019t freak out again? What did he care if I was tortured? He watched another man shove his fat finger up inside me, did nothing as I was whipped over and over again. Why does he care about me at all?</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d He pulled me after him, and we made our way through the massive house, girls passing us, heads lowered, never making eye contact. Several guards wandered the premises, and I noticed some of the doors had a guard standing outside of them.</p><p>Logan ignored everyone and walked with long strides through the complex down a path to another building that had two guards standing on the outside. When they saw Logan they opened the double doors and nodded to him.</p><p>I kept my head down, but I tried to see as much as I could as we passed what looked like a set of weights then several red punching bags where two men were currently working out.</p><p>Logan stopped. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>I waited, hearing the constant sounds of smacks and grunts as men trained. In front of me was a platform where two guys were sparing. I couldn\u2019t get a good glimpse without raising my head, and in a room full of men I didn\u2019t want to take the chance of anyone seeing me. I was learning fast about what was expected of me, and the pain and humiliation was far less if I kept my mouth shut and my eyes down.</p><p>Was that weak? No, it was survival. There\u2019s a time and place where I\u2019d fight, and I would. I didn\u2019t know if it was in me to ever give up. I\u2019d never given up on my dream to ride horses. My mom was an alcoholic who insisted I was useless, ugly, and fat, so I did what I had to ... I worked after school since I was sixteen and saved every cent. Then at eighteen I moved in with Kat and her brother Matt. It was Matt who let me borrow his car so that every weekend I could go to the stable.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice slammed into me, and I looked up at him. He frowned, and I quickly lowered my head again. He chin-lifted to a spot over to the right of the ring. \u201cKneel over there. I\u2019ll come get you when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>He wanted me to kneel on the cement floor? To stay there and wait for him like a dog? Why didn\u2019t he stick a prong collar on me while he was at it? My thoughts must have been vivid in my expression, because he grabbed my arm and walked me over to where he wanted me to kneel and pushed me down.</p><p>I opened my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His abrupt, cold warning was enough to have me looking at my hands in my lap. He nodded to the left, and my eyes looked in the direction, but I was careful to keep my head down. My chest tightened when I saw Jacob, Alfonzo, and Raul. They were near the door talking to a guy hitting a speed bag.</p><p>I stiffened when they began their approach, and my entire body was already running and hiding in one of the cupboards on the other side of the room. A foolish and completely useless thought, but when men you feared were coming toward you, well your mind came up with the most ridiculous ideas.</p><p>\u201cSculpt,\u201d Raul said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Raul\u2019s eyes shifted to me, and I quickly lowered my head even further. \u201cI have a shipment coming in that needs to be checked out. After training, you and Alfonzo will go look after the contents.\u201d</p><p>I knew how angry Logan was by the slight twitch of his index finger on his left hand. He wasn\u2019t happy about Raul\u2019s request or, rather, his order. \u201cSend someone else.\u201d</p><p>Raul slapped Logan on the back and chuckled. \u201cIf I wanted someone else to go, I\u2019d have asked them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fight. I\u2019m not one of your men.\u201d</p><p>Raul shrugged then reached down and grabbed me by the hair and pulled me to my feet and shoved me at Alfonzo. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re not one of my men, and my fighters don\u2019t get slaves as they are a distraction.\u201d Raul nodded to Alfonzo. \u201cGet her out of here. Put her up on auction. Forty thousand.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened with panic as Alfonzo leered down at me. His beady eyes laughed at the fear trembling through my body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Logan\u2019s tone was cold and calm, but loud enough for Raul to take notice and hold up his hand to Alfonzo. \u201cLet her go.\u201d Logan glared at Alfonzo, and I thought he might smash his fist into his face. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Alfonzo.\u201d Raul\u2019s thin lips pressed together as he stared at me, and I had the impression that he wasn\u2019t pleased with the fact that Logan had spoken up for me.</p><p>Alfonzo shoved me forward, and I fell on my knees in front of Logan. I kept my head down, my tears of relief hidden behind my veil of hair.</p><p>The door opened with a loud bang; then running feet came toward us. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. Let\u2019s do this, Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t wait to be excused by Raul. I saw his feet turn, and heard him walk away, leaving me with Raul and the others.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think he\u2019ll protect you all the time.\u201d Raul leaned over as he spoke in his squeaky, accented voice. He reached out, and it took everything inside me to remain as still as possible. I clenched my teeth together so hard that my head vibrated. His fingers slid through my hair then to my shoulder and across the front of my neck then down ... His hand cupped my breast as he ran his thumb back and forth over my nipple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I kept my eyes closed and repeated over and over in my head that nothing could touch me, nothing could touch me.</p><p>\u201cIf he loses his fight you\u2019re mine.\u201d Raul squeezed my nipple hard, and I winced. \u201cYou\u2019re like all the rest. Do not think you\u2019re anything special.\u201d</p><p>With that he stood and strode away with Jacob and Alfonzo. I collapsed forward, my hands covering my face as I sobbed, letting my hair fall forward so no one could see. Raul was terrifying. Calculated and cruel. He enjoyed watching others suffer. He had no morals or values and did what he wanted without thought to the ramifications for others. It was dangerous. He was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cEmily. Look at me.\u201d Logan was standing in the ring, sweating and his chest heaving. Our eyes met, and I saw the fury burning within the depths of his dark eyes. I didn\u2019t know whether he was angry at me, because I\u2019d been crying or was it from something else? He stared at me for a few moments and finally I settled down enough to stop trembling. Then Logan nodded, turned away, and began fighting Dave again.</p> <p>I had no idea what Logan\u2019s stare was about, but I did feel more together ... Well, as together as I could be kneeling in a gym surrounded by men who could and would abuse me if given the chance.</p><p>I guessed it was about an hour when Logan finished his practice. I watched him speak quietly to Dave away from the other men in the gym, and he didn\u2019t look happy. I saw Dave glance over at me, then his mouth moved quickly and angrily as if he was just as pissed off as Logan.</p><p>When Logan turned toward me, I quickly lowered my head and kept my eyes down. I stayed that way until I saw the tips of his toes next to my knees.</p><p>\u201cDave will take you back.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched, and I wanted to protest, but I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t. The fear of the consequences was too great to ignore. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you, Emily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes ... Master.\u201d I wanted to die. Oh God, I wanted to curl up in a ball and die of mortification. Calling him Master was degrading, and it made me feel like less of a person, like my mother used to do. A useless object that took up space and ate her food.</p><p>Logan stroked his hand over my head once then turned and walked away.</p><p>I stood when Dave told me to, then walked a few feet behind him back to my room. I never looked at anyone, not even out of the corner of my eye. I had no idea what Dave would do to me, and that was scarier than knowing. I\u2019d been too drugged to remember much of what he was like in the car on the way here, but what I did notice was that he failed to have the lust lingering in his eyes when he looked at me. Instead, I saw sympathy and pity. I hated the pity, but I\u2019d take it over Alfonzo\u2019s lust-filled threats.</p><p>Dave stopped outside my room. \u201cHe\u2019ll protect you when he can. But he\u2019s faltering. Do exactly as you\u2019re told, and you will survive this, Emily.\u201d I was taken aback by his words. He opened the door, and I walked inside. He shut it behind me, and I heard the key turn and then his footsteps walk away.</p><p>I was asleep in bed when I heard the door open later that evening. I sat up, pulling the sheet with me, and about to go kneel on the floor when his voice stopped me.</p><p>\u201cStay in bed.\u201d His tone was tired and gentle, quiet.</p> <p>He walked straight into the bathroom, shut the door, and I heard the taps turn then the water blast. I lay back down and tucked the sheet around me. It wasn\u2019t long before he came out, the light in the bathroom illuminating his naked body.</p><p>The tweak between my legs shattered any resolve I had to not be attracted to this man. My belly dropped as I watched him stride over to the side of the bed and then drag the covers back with the sheet tucked under me.</p><p>He slipped in bed then laid back, his elbow crooked above his head and his other arm resting on his abdomen. He looked ... God, he looked like Logan. The Logan I knew. The Logan I fell in love with. There was nothing cold about him tonight; actually he appeared vulnerable, and his eyes ... his eyes held a hint of sadness. Could this man even feel sadness? Could I be reading him wrong? I\u2019d read him wrong before, and yet ... I wanted to hold him. I just wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>Was it because I felt alone and scared, and I wanted someone? Anyone? Even if it was the man who brought me here? Or was it to solidify my place with him? To show him affection so he wouldn\u2019t be inclined to sell me.</p><p>I slowly moved closer to him, my heart beating erratically with fear of rejection, and yes ... yes, anticipation of touching him. Not because I had to touch him, but because I wanted to. I glanced up at his face, and his eyes were closed, his breathing even.</p><p>I pictured us lying beside one another in the park after he\u2019d played me his guitar and sang to me. That wasn\u2019t a lie was it? How could it have been? It felt real and sincere.</p><p>I held my breath as I slipped my hand on top of his lying on his stomach. His breathing remained the same, and his eyes remained closed. I moved closer, my body inches from his, soaking in his heat, then I lay my head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cMouse,\u201d he whispered, and then his arm wrapped around me and tucked me into his side.</p> <p>I sighed, and a few minutes later I was asleep.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Day 9</p><p>It was still dark when I woke. My head was nestled on Logan\u2019s chest, and his arm was around me, fingers slowly caressing up and down my back. I knew he was awake; I could hear his breathing, and it wasn\u2019t slow, long breaths, but ... awake breaths. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was allowed to speak, but there was something in Logan that changed when we lay together like this. So I took the chance, and I shifted my head up, my cheek sliding over the smooth, hard muscles of his chest.</p><p>He was watching me, and when I met his eyes my breath seized. I was caught in the trap of his desire that was swimming in the dark depths. Controlling my reaction was ... well, it was impossible. He still could turn me on with one look, and all the sweet flooded back to me like being hit by a tidal wave.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d I stiffened after I said it.</p><p>He sighed and then closed his eyes. When he opened them again, I saw what looked like haunted turmoil.</p><p>I wanted to kiss him, touch him, feel him. Crush him to me and take away all the fear and just ... I just wanted to feel protected and loved by him again.</p><p>My lips were close to his chest, and I couldn\u2019t stop myself as I kissed him. It felt as if it was a goodbye to everything we\u2019d lost and sadness filled me. Especially when I realized that he hadn\u2019t lost anything, he\u2019d gained. A single tear escaped to land on his skin.</p><p>I started to pull away and he groaned then his arm tightened around me. When I looked at him again, there was no anger, no aloofness, just Logan. The Logan I knew and ... yes, loved.</p><p>\u201cEme,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The scorching flame between my legs was lit with hope, desire, and need. I craved this man; I loved him, and I wanted him back, but I was scared too. I was afraid of what these feelings would do to me when he turned around and became the man I feared.</p><p>I fought the desire, and I failed. He hadn\u2019t moved toward me, and I was uncertain why, considering Logan was always the dominant one. I knew he\u2019d never love me or care about me like I\u2019d once thought he had, but I wanted comfort. I craved it, and if he gave it to me physically than I\u2019d take it.</p><p>I trailed kisses up his chest to his neck, and his fingers curled in my hair. He closed his eyes and groaned. Slow and hesitant, I moved up and onto his body, instantly feeling the heat of his skin sink into me. I\u2019d only done this once and had hoped he\u2019d take the lead.</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d He tone was gentle, and a heated rush of goose bumps sprinkled across my skin. \u201cJesus, what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>My mind was all fucked up as it fought against the comfort I needed. I\u2019d been beaten, threatened and starved, witnessed horrific abuse and I lived each moment in terror. I yearned for some kind of comfort\u2014even if it was from the monster who had lied to me about everything. I had tried so hard to stop feeling anything for this man who shattered my heart and now ... now I wanted him to make love to me. It was sick. I was sick.</p><p>I lowered my lips to his, and at first he didn\u2019t reciprocate as I kissed him, slipping my tongue inside his mouth, and then ... then he broke, and his hands grabbed me on either side of my head, and he kissed me back.</p><p>Logan. He was my Logan.</p><p>I moaned as he rolled me over without our lips disconnecting. I wrapped my legs around his waist, and he was on his knees between mine.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I whispered breathlessly.</p><p>He pulled back, and I grabbed for him, but he\u2019d become the one in control again, and he kissed his way down my body until he was hovering over my pussy. I pulsated. I panted. I needed him, and yet he stopped. He wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me. What else?\u201d</p><p>His mouth was inches away from me, and if I arched upward I could ...</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Why was he making me do this? I was so frustrated that I threw my arms back and gripped the headboard. \u201cMy pussy. I want you to taste me, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate any longer, and within minutes I was writhing and screaming with uncontainable desire. He did that to me. Everything in him right now was the man I knew and loved. There was no fighting that fact.</p><p>Logan drove me to begging, and then I crested and came hard, screaming his name. He slid up my body and kissed me again with fierce possession.</p><p>We lay silent, him spooning me, and his fingers drawing slow circles over my abdomen. It was sweet, and I loved the feel of his hardened fingertips which I suspected came from playing the guitar. I never thought for a second that I\u2019d fall into this man\u2019s arms again, and I knew when the sun\u2019s rays shone in the morning I\u2019d hate myself, but for right now I was going to take what he\u2019d given me\u2014comfort.</p><p>After a while, when I couldn\u2019t fall back asleep, I asked, \u201cWhat about your band? You ... I thought you were going on tour.\u201d It was a long shot that he\u2019d tell me anything, but I hoped we could talk like we used to. Maybe I could learn why he was doing this. What had changed so drastically?</p><p>He kept drawing on me while he spoke. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you leave here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Emily.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so that meant he didn\u2019t plan on staying forever. Or keeping me? Oh God, would he leave me here? Was he going to sell me? My throat tightened as I said, \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201d</p><p>I had to talk to try to stop the panic from taking control. I had to pretend, at least in the dark, that we were somewhere else. That if he left, he\u2019d take me with him. \u201cHow did the band get together?\u201d</p><p>Logan chuckled, and the sound made me jump then stiffen, uncertain why he\u2019d laugh. My panicked mind thought maybe I\u2019d pushed him with the questions and he was laughing because now he was going to punish me. God, that sounded ridiculous. Logan wouldn\u2019t laugh if he was going to hurt me, he\u2019d be angry.</p><p>I was losing it. I was fighting the fear of him leaving me here or selling me and everything he did I was second guessing, trying to decipher what it meant. But I couldn\u2019t, could I? Because I didn\u2019t know who Logan was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom the moment I met you, you wouldn\u2019t give up. Why was I expecting any different even here?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath when his voice was calm and playful. We\u2019d met the night of his fight, when I\u2019d asked him to teach me self-defense, he\u2019d laughed; then after making fun of me he told me a direct no. But I wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer, and Logan found that out pretty quick.</p><p>\u201cI met Kite when I was sixteen.\u201d My muscles relaxed as he started talking. \u201cMy mother and I had just moved to Toronto, and Kite and I went to the same school. We became instant friends.\u201d I felt him shrug. \u201cThink it was his calm, take-no-shit attitude. First time I saw him was in the lunch room where a couple of guys purposely bumped him then pushed his tray out of his hands, spilling his food onto the floor. Kite picked up his tray, threw his ruined lunch in the garbage then strolled over to the guys who were now sitting at the table laughing.</p><p>Kite never said a word as he grabbed one guy and had him on the ground crying within seconds. The other guy took off running. There wasn\u2019t a flicker of fear or unease in Kite.</p> <p>We started hanging out after that. He\u2019d just left a band he was playing with. I found out the two guys were his old bandmates. Kite played drums, and we soon discovered I could hold a tune.\u201d Logan kissed my neck just below my ear, and I shivered. \u201cWe hung out at the local coffee shop where I started writing my own music. Georgie bought the place a couple years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you knew her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe introduced me to Crisis and Ream. They were friends with her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother? She never told me she had a brother.\u201d</p><p>His finger stopped tracing for a second and then started again. \u201cYeah. Georgie\u2019s brother was in the JTF2\u2014Joint Task Force 2\u2014with Deck. A counter terrorism unit. Deck came back from their last mission, Georgie\u2019s brother didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. God.\u201d I hadn\u2019t known. Was that why Deck was so protective of Georgie?</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep, Eme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can we leave?\u201d I held my breath. Afraid to ask the question, yet needing to know if he was taking me with him when he left. I hoped. No, I prayed he\u2019d tell me not to worry. That he\u2019d never leave me. That he\u2019d never sell me. But the truth was\u2014I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I felt his muscles stiffen, and he drew in a deep breath. Our moment was over. It changed within seconds, and I wanted to cry and hit him then yell and scream. Instead I watched him as he threw back the covers, got out of bed\u2014still with a raging hard on\u2014then strode into the bathroom closing the door.</p> <p>The tears slid down my cheeks and I buried my face in the pillow as the sobs took hold. Logan was going to sell me.</p><p>The day was lonely after Logan left. He\u2019d showered, dressed, then walked out without a single word to me. I waited all day for him to come back, uncertainty playing with my mind as I paced the length of the room. I ignored the food the girl brought and saw her frown when she came back to get the tray and the food remained untouched. In the afternoon the same thing happened except this time the girl kept her eyes lowered.</p><p>By the end of the day, I was exhausted from worrying if whether or not Logan was trying to find a buyer for me today. I\u2019d upset him, pushed him with my questions.</p><p>When the door finally opened it was dark outside. I knelt in the corner of the room and held my breath until I peeked up and saw that it was Logan and not Alfonzo coming to drag me away. I wanted to throw myself into his arms with relief. I wanted to cry and I wanted to kiss him and thank him.</p><p>God, I was crazy. There was something wrong with me. I was so screwed up with my feeling toward Logan. One moment afraid of him, the next wanting him, then terrified he was going to sell me then having hope he\u2019d get me out of here.</p><p>What did comfort me was that, if given the chance, I\u2019d leave. I\u2019d leave Logan, and I\u2019d get out. I\u2019d never look back. I may want him sexually or want the comfort of someone I\u2019d once loved, but that would end the second I escaped.</p><p>I even wondered if I would kill Logan to do it. These thoughts are what happen when left alone for ten hours with nothing to do. My mind went on an imagination highway contemplating scenarios that may never be true.</p><p>But when I saw Logan walk in tonight the pain in his expression was worse than yesterday, and I began to wonder if the fight Raul had talked about was beginning to weigh heavily on him. Did he think he might lose? I hadn\u2019t considered Logan losing. I\u2019d been so worried about everything else that I assumed he\u2019d win, but he might not. What would Raul do if he lost? I\u2019d be sold, but what would he do to Logan? I suspected Raul didn\u2019t take failure too well from anyone. Was Logan concerned about what would happen to him? But if Logan was worried about losing that meant he wanted to keep me right?</p> <p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I got up and walked toward him.</p><p>He raised my head with the tip of his finger under my chin. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>A crackle of fear went through me. I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. I\u2019d been good.</p><p>His thumb stroked my lower lip back and forth, and I didn\u2019t even think he realized he was doing it because ... because he used to do that all the time to me. \u201cLast night was wrong.\u201d His hand dropped, and he strode to the other side of the room and stared out the window. His hands gripped the iron bars as he stood silent and still.</p><p>I knew what I had to do and there was a struggle within me whether I was doing it because I was trying to help myself or because I wanted to comfort him. I quietly approached him, stopping a few inches behind, and took a deep breath then reached out and placed my hands on his waist. \u201cPlease.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what I was saying please for; maybe to get him to talk to me, to turn and look at me, to hold me, God, to tell me that we were leaving.</p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>I was going to. I stiffened and was about to, but he\u2019d said those exact words to me the night I\u2019d met him, and I didn\u2019t listen then. Yeah, stupid maybe, because this Logan wasn\u2019t the same one. But maybe he was? He had friends, a band, there was a chance that the Logan I knew existed. Maybe I just had to find him and bring him back to me.</p><p>I stepped in closer, kissed his shoulder then trailed kisses down his spine.</p><p>\u201cEmily. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But he let me. My hands started at his shoulders then ran down his arms until they rested on top of his hands that were gripping the bars so tight that his knuckles were white. I peeled each finger away from the bars, until he let go, his arms falling to his sides, my hands holding his.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared of me?\u201d</p><p>I was thrown off for a second by his question; it seemed odd to ask me that now. I answered him honestly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His head dropped forward with a half-nod.</p><p>\u201cI want to ...\u201d God, I wanted him so much it hurt. It was ripping me apart having him next to me night after night. No matter how wrong it may be, I still wanted him. Or maybe it was I wanted to believe so badly that he was still the man I loved that I would do anything. Was that weak? Was I falling prey to what he wanted? Right now I didn\u2019t care. Tonight I wasn\u2019t going to care about anything except Logan and me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He turned. And any reservations I may have had lingering were swept aside the moment I looked in his eyes and recognized the warmth within them.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I need you.\u201d</p><p>His hand swept into my hair, fingers curling around the nape of my neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve never needed me, Eme.\u201d He was wrong, but I didn\u2019t argue because right now I wanted him to kiss me, so I stood on my tip toes and kissed him first.</p><p>The moment the heat of our lips pressed together I heard him moan. He swooped me up in his arms and carried me to the bed then placed me on the rumpled sheets. He leaned over me, both arms on either side of my head.</p><p>\u201cYou want this?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this. I want you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for several seconds, and I didn\u2019t realize I was holding my breath until he finally spoke again. \u201cThen tonight, show me. Show me exactly what you want and take it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, although I was feeling uncertain and nervous. My experience was, well, zilch, but Kat and I had watched pornos numerous times, laughing at the ridiculous positions and moaning, but still we\u2019d learned a lot.</p><p>Logan slid off his jeans and his T-shirt, but left on his boxers then climbed into bed and lay on his back beside me.</p><p>He really was going to make me be the one to pursue this? \u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want this then it has to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I like it when ...\u201d How did I say that I was totally turned on when he was the aggressor?</p><p>Logan stroked the back of my head, and I looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that. But not tonight.\u201d</p><p>I felt the heat in my cheeks as I thought of what I was going to do to him, the sweet ache in my belly as I anticipated tasting him and watching his face while I did it.</p><p>I slipped over top of his thigh so that I lay between his legs; then I put my fingers on the material that kept his cock hidden from me. I watched his eyes as I slowly slid his boxers down. He lifted his butt a little, and then my eyes moved down his abdomen to his cock as it sprang free from its confines.</p><p>I hesitated, and my hand reached out to touch the tip, feeling the moisture. He sucked in air and I got braver as I slid his boxers off the rest of the way and then wrapped my hand around the base of his cock.</p><p>Instantly, it jerked, and Logan groaned.</p><p>God, I felt powerful. It was incredible that I could make him feel like that with just holding him.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His hand caressed my cheek, and when I looked at him I saw his features ease. I smiled. It had been over a week since I\u2019d smiled, and it felt as if I\u2019d been set free for that single moment. This was always how I imagined it would be like between us always.</p><p>I lowered my eyes to his cock again, and then my mouth followed.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I licked the tip and tasted a sweet saltiness that lingered on my tongue. Slowly, I took him in further and further until I couldn\u2019t anymore. My hand caressed his balls the same time as I sucked, soft then harder and harder, moving up and down, his cock pulsating in my mouth with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Eme.\u201d His fingers curled in my hair, and he urged me faster.</p><p>He was arching off the bed to meet me, and a few times he pushed too far, and I gagged, and he immediately pulled back.</p><p>I teased him with my tongue, my lips, and then I gripped the base of him tight until he was swearing and groaning. Suddenly I was being pulled up on top of him, my face inches away from his.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fuck me now? Because I\u2019m not lasting much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put me inside you.\u201d</p><p>I felt his cock between my legs throbbing, and I lifted up, took hold of it then slid it up and down my entrance, my wetness clinging to the tip of it.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I let his cock go, and his breath hitched as his eyes widened with surprise. Then he frowned, and he got that scary look. For a second I let the fear in, and then I licked my lips, sat up straight, and put my head back, closing my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlay with your nipples.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flew open and a tweak hit my belly at his words. I slowly slid my hands up my body to my breasts. When I started playing with my nipples the desire in his eyes intensified.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck.\u201d His entire body stiffened beneath me, and I didn\u2019t have to look at him to know what I was doing to him. And damn, it felt good. I still liked when he took control, but being where we were, and after giving all my control over to him, and knowing what this place stood for ... Well, having him succumb to me made me feel strong again.</p><p>I pinched my nipples hard and then reached down, grabbing his hands and putting them over top of my breasts. \u201cTouch me, Logan. I need you to touch me.\u201d</p> <p>And he did. There were no more games as both of us lost ourselves to the desire. Panting with the need for possession. He sat up, taking me with him, then his head lowered and he suckled my nipples, rolling his tongue over the tender surface.</p><p>\u201cNow, Emily.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell him to wait, but the truth was I couldn\u2019t. I put my hand between us, took his cock, and guided it inside me. I threw back my head, and he groaned as I pushed him deep, and he fell back against the mattress.</p><p>I started moving, and he reached between my legs and circled my clit sending my body into a whirlwind of aching yearning that was climbing higher and higher with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d I placed my hands on his chest and pushed harder and faster, my limbs shaking and stiffening.</p> <p>\u201cFuck. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I demanded, and his fingers lost rhythm on my clit for a second at my words.</p><p>He made a low growling sound in the back of his throat, and then his hips were pushing up, matching mine as he drove inside of me.</p><p>I yelled, \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Logan threw me over onto my back in one motion and then thrust into me several more times\u2014hard. Relentless.</p><p>I came hard. Long. And I screamed as I did it.</p> <p>He was completely still, the veins in his neck throbbing, his cock jerking inside me as he finished coming.</p><p>When our eyes met we both knew that tonight was something more than either of us had expected. It was cathartic and powerful. Logan had given me control in a place where I had none. He\u2019d given me the option to say no. He\u2019d given me my dignity back.</p><p>He leaned down, and then he was kissing me soft and gentle; it was beautiful, and it was a kiss that had me sighing as he roamed over my mouth lazily.</p><p>Logan slipped out of me then went to the washroom where I heard the tap running. When he came back to bed, he instantly pulled me into his side then kissed the top of my head.</p><p>He never said anything, and neither did I. We\u2019d always been good with quiet moments, as if we both knew words would only ruin the beauty in the silence.</p><p>It was only when I was drifting off when I thought I heard him say, \u201cDream sweet, Emily.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Day 10</p> <p>\u201cYou interrupted me.\u201d His voice was steady and clear. \u201cYou spoke without being asked.\u201d His voice rose. \u201cAnd you fuckin\u2019 called me Logan.\u201d He was pacing back and forth across the room. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been kneeling beside the table in the main dining room. Dave had been there as had Raul. They chatted about the upcoming fight while I knelt for an hour on cold stone tiles beside Logan\u2019s chair and was fed from his fingers.</p><p>I had to go pee, and I\u2019d made the mistake of calling him Logan. I\u2019d never seen him so angry. His entire body went from relaxed and casual to rigid and dangerous within seconds.</p><p>Raul and Dave were silent as Logan turned to look down at me like I was some dog that just bit his ankle. His eyes ... God, they\u2019d been intense, and yes, I was scared because of what I\u2019d done. But it was a mistake, Logan had to have seen that.</p><p>He\u2019d shoved back his chair so violently that it fell over backward, then he grabbed me by the arm, and before I could even gain my footing he was dragging me out of the dining room.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop until we were back at his room, where we were now.</p><p>Before last night I\u2019d been a dying flower. Pieces of me falling to the ground, shriveling up and disintegrating day after day. I was surviving, but barely. I\u2019d been losing the part of myself that thrived in the sun, the lightness that came with living. But then last night, Logan awoke the woman I used to be and gave me what I had starving for.</p><p>I thought things may have changed between us.</p><p>I was wrong ... The coldness had descended over him locking out everything we\u2019d shared.</p><p>It was devastating.</p><p>And it was cruel.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>I jumped at his sharp tone. \u201cYes. Master.\u201d I avoided his eyes, lowering my head. There wasn\u2019t a fight left in me. He\u2019d taken away that trickle of hope with how he reacted in the dining hall. Did he do this to me on purpose? Maybe that was why he held me in his arms, brought my body alive at night ... So he could break me down in the morning, destroy me over and over again. So I could hate myself more than him.</p><p>His footsteps approached, and I stiffened, uncertain what he\u2019d do, yet hoping he\u2019d never physically hurt me. He\u2019d awaken my body to his touch, but never once had he harmed me. But he let others hurt me, hadn\u2019t he? He watched them. Did he get off on that? Had he enjoyed watching Alfonzo whip me?</p><p>It was his quiet sigh that caused me to swallow my fear. His finger touched beneath my chin, and he raised my head. He was inches away from me, and I tried to stop feeling. I tried so hard, but I failed.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>My heart crashed, because the way he said my name made the fear heighten.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again.\u201d He watched me for several seconds, then turned and walked out, slamming the door behind him. I collapsed onto the bed and cried.</p><p>It was dark by the time he returned, and I was brushing my hair after my shower while I looked out the window seeing nothing but imagining everything. As the door shut and locked behind him I turned and knelt on the floor, the brush laying forgotten beside me.</p><p>The floorboards creaked as he walked toward me then stopped.</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>He reached down and drew me up in front of him then lowered his head. My heart skipped a beat, the pit of my stomach dropped, and my breath seized all at the same time.</p><p>His lips descended, soft and tender, as he slid his tongue inside my mouth. His arms encased me in his embrace, the hold on my body fierce and unrelenting, unlike his kiss that was sweet, gentle.</p><p>I tilted my head back, and he deepened the kiss groaning.</p><p>He nipped my lower lip then picked me up in his arms with one swoop and carried me to the bed. Without letting me go, he lowered me onto it then followed, his weight lying on top of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. You\u2019ll always be mine.\u201d</p><p>I was in a way. I belonged to him. I had sex with him. And at night I loved him, but with the rise of the morning sun came the hate for the man who was doing this to me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want this?\u201d</p><p>Was I weak because I craved his affection? Wanted to be stroked and caressed and loved by this man so badly that I felt dead inside without him? Did it make me pathetic?</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and whispered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He gently dragged my nightgown up and over my head; then his eyes roamed down my body, and it felt as if the tips of his fingers were trailing across my skin. I\u2019d never thought myself pretty or attractive, merely plain and average. My mother called me \u201ca waste of space.\u201d But when Logan looked at me, it made me feel beautiful, and I never wanted it to end.</p><p>\u201cHands above your head.\u201d</p><p>I listened, wrapping my hands around the edge of the headboard.</p><p>I knew this is what he liked\u2014complete submission\u2014and it was maddening, because it turned me on. I liked it. I didn\u2019t even try to understand it.</p><p>I heard the sound of his zipper and then the rustling of fabric as he took off his clothes.</p><p>\u201cLegs,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I opened my legs.</p><p>He pulled them further apart and settled between them. He groaned as his fingers caressed my breasts then my nipples, hard, and yet, Logan had this sweetness in him. It existed; I knew it did. It couldn\u2019t just be my imagination.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. Not any night. Never call me Logan again.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t stupid. I knew I\u2019d made a mistake. I had hoped that maybe Logan was protecting me against Raul. He\u2019d blindfolded me when Raul had come to the room that one time. Could Logan have suspected I\u2019d crack and fight if I\u2019d been able to see Raul\u2019s face? Maybe that was why he dragged me out of the dining hall so fast. Or maybe I was just being absurd wanting Logan to care about me.</p><p>Then he kissed me, and the Lego blocks in my mind crumbled.</p><p>Logan\u2019s kiss grew stronger as I submitted to him. I didn\u2019t fight. No, I wanted to feel alive again even if it was wrong. Was it strength to submit to him because I wanted to? I was fighting for salvation, and if Logan gave me that then I won.</p><p>His fingers entered me, and I moaned. \u201cEmily. You\u2019re my everything.\u201d</p><p>He drove his fingers in and out, his teeth grazing across my neck then to my nipples. He suckled and played with them then bit down, and I cried out with pain, and my hands let go of the headboard.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d His voice was demanding, and I knew not to disobey, but I also heard a hint of sweet in his voice.</p><p>I put my hands back.</p><p>Logan bit me again, and this time I let the feelings flow across my body without moving. It was pain, and then pleasure came right after. It fed me. It gave me what I needed, and I awakened to him.</p><p>He gripped my chin. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me inside you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what he wanted. My permission. My complete submission. And I gave it to him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me Lo\u2014\u201d I stopped abruptly.</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me ... Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWider, baby.\u201d I cringed when he called me that. It tore me apart. It was how he said it, his tone tender, as if he cared about me. \u201cI want you to look at me when I put my cock inside your tight pussy.\u201d</p><p>I parted my legs wider as I stared up at him; then he entered me, and I moaned as his cock filled me completely. It was like the world became a safe place the moment he was inside me. As if he was mine and I was his and nothing around us existed anymore.</p><p>I hooked my legs around his waist and arched my back wanting him deeper, closer, needing him encased into me as he pumped madly. Our bodies slapped together as if he was spanking me, the sound vibrating through the room. I kept my arms above my head, but it was hard not to run my hands the length of him.</p><p>Suddenly he grabbed me around the waist and flipped me over. \u201cCheek to the pillow. One hand on the headboard.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cAss in the air. I\u2019m going to fuck you from behind, Emily.\u201d</p><p>I raised my ass and felt his hands grab hold of my hips. Oh God, it felt sweet and hot, and I wanted him back inside me. I knew I was going to come fast with him taking me like this.</p><p>He didn\u2019t enter me right away, instead his finger slid down my ass crevice then, slowly, further down into my pussy then back up again as he dragged the wetness up to my ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tensed as he circled the tight opening.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d His voice was soft and sweet. \u201cYou need to relax and push out.\u201d</p><p>It was embarrassing, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted his finger in that forbidden place. But it was also making me hotter.</p><p>His finger pushed, and I tensed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Eme. Don\u2019t fight it. I promise it\u2019ll feel good, but it can\u2019t be if you won\u2019t relax.\u201d</p><p>I took several deep breaths, then moaned, as he pushed his finger inside my tight ass at the same time.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d It felt full and weird and ... fuck, it felt illicit and amazing too. Then when he started pushing his finger in and out like he was fucking my ass while he continued to play with my clit, I nearly exploded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck your ass one day. So tight and sweet, and you\u2019ll love having me balls-deep inside you.\u201d God, why was I so turned on by that? \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to fuck your pussy, and you\u2019re going to scream.\u201d</p><p>He placed himself at my entrance then pushed hard and deep. His hand was on the small of my back pressing me down while his other grabbed my hip, fingers digging into my flesh. His balls slapped against me as he thrust over and over again.</p><p>I was panting and arching my back while I pushed back against him.</p><p>\u201cCome, Eme. Touch yourself.\u201d</p><p>I did, and I within seconds I was coming and crying out as he continued to slam into me. Both hands were now holding my hips as he yanked me back into him with a fierceness that sent my orgasm into a long, drawn-out high.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He suddenly stopped moving, the tips of his fingers digging into my skin as I felt his cock jerk inside me. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>When he slipped out of me, the syrupy warmth of Logan came with him and ran down the insides of my thighs. I was about to lie down, spent, and fully sated when he stroked my head then down my back to my ass where he caressed my ass cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>The mattress dipped as he lay down beside me and stared at me with my ass in the air, arched and body heated. After several minutes, he hooked his arm around my waist and pulled me down beside him then kissed my temple. \u201cYour pussy is made for my cock.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it was. The problem was despite what we shared sexually, I knew I\u2019d leave him without a second of hesitation if given the opportunity to escape. Maybe I had this secret hope that we\u2019d leave together, but it was small, a fleck of dust in a tornado.</p><p>I was falling asleep, wrapped in his embrace when I definitely heard the words, \u201cDream sweet, Emily.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Day 11</p><p>It was morning, and Logan left me alone like he usually did when he went to train. I lay in bed, lost in my thoughts of last night when the door suddenly opened. I scrambled off the mattress and knelt on the floor my heat thumping erratically at his unexpected early appearance.</p><p>Logan shut the door.</p><p>The lock turned.</p> <p>Then he came toward me. I stared at the floor, hands resting on my thighs, although resting was not a word I should associate to how I was feeling\u2014more like reeling with uncertainty. Had I done something wrong? Why was he back earlier? My mind went over in reverse everything that happened last night. Had I called him Logan? Did I not do everything he asked?</p><p>\u201cUp.\u201d</p><p>I stood.</p><p>\u201cShower. Now.\u201d</p><p>I walked to the washroom, and he snagged my hand before I had the chance to pull off the nightgown. It was flimsy and see-through, but it was the only clothing I was allowed, so I wore it.</p><p>\u201cUndress me.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, and I saw the darkness mixed with lust swirling in his eyes. Hesitantly, I put my hands on the edge of his T-shirt then pulled it up over his head.</p><p>\u201cDrop it.\u201d</p><p>I let the shirt slip from my fingers.</p><p>He waited. I was staring at his muscles that were tight and flexed. Logan didn\u2019t have a six pack; he had an eight pack and each one was glistening.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His low, warning tone had me reaching for his shorts. My fingers gripped the material at his hips. \u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>I moved downward, taking his shorts with me, his cock springing free and my mouth inches away from it. I licked my lips. He watched.</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched, my eyes meeting his. There was no more anger just pure unadulterated lust, and his lust was for me which turned me on more. I figured I knew what he wanted and took his cock in my hand.</p><p>I heard him inhale sharply, and he twitched in my grasp.</p><p>I went to take him in my mouth when he clutched my shoulders and shook his head. \u201cNot now. In the shower.\u201d He pulled me to my feet then turned on the taps and brought me in close. \u201cWear the nightgown.\u201d</p><p>I stepped under the spray, the white material sticking to my skin the moment it got wet. It felt odd, like I should be taking it off, but the moment I saw Logan\u2019s eyes, I knew it turned him on big time.</p><p>He stepped in the shower then pushed me up against the tiles, his hands grabbing my wrists and locking them in his one hand above my head. It was heated and rough and a hint of fear shot through me as I realized that he could do anything he wanted to me right now.</p><p>His mouth took mine with such force and possession that it felt like I was breathing under water. There was something more in his kiss today, as if he was starving for me. Crazed with his need and possession.</p><p>It left me weak and trembling.</p><p>His mouth broke away, and he bent down suckling my nipples through the material then biting\u2014hard. I moaned, arching against the wall, my muscles stiffening from the pain and then relaxing into the sweetness afterward.</p><p>His body slammed into me; his hand in my soaking wet hair then roaming down the front of me as he continued to kiss me. \u201cNo other.\u201d</p><p>He let me go then pressed on my shoulders, and I went down until I was kneeling in front of him, the spray pounding into the back of my head, dripping down my face like rain on a window pane.</p><p>He gripped his cock in his hand. \u201cSuck me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I placed the tip into my mouth, his hands gripped my hair, and he groaned.</p><p>I slowly teased him with my mouth, suckling the tip, sliding down then back up again. I slipped my hand around the base and tightened at the same time as I took him to the back of my throat and sucked hard.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Fuck.\u201d His hips began to move, and I relaxed the back of my throat as I took him deeper.</p><p>I pulled firmly on him with my mouth, and he shoved his hips forward as he groaned. I gagged, but didn\u2019t stop. Neither did he as he pumped into my mouth until I felt him stiffen and stop\u2014his cock at the back of my throat, a loud growl escaping him as he said my name.</p><p>Hot, thick liquid squirted down the back of my throat, and I swallowed as it kept coming and coming. His cum slipped from the sides of my mouth, and the water washed it away.</p><p>His cock twitched for several seconds then went still. I went to pull back, but Logan held me in place, my mouth wrapped around him, sunk deep.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>My jaw was sore, but I did what he wanted, my tongue slowly stroking the hot, wet surface of his cock.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth around me ... never been so sweet.\u201d His hands smoothed back my hair as he looked down at me, my mouth still around him as his cock slowly subsided. \u201cGet me hard again, Eme, then I\u2019ll fuck your pussy against the wall.\u201d</p><p>I was so turned on; it would only take him entering me to get me off. Knowing Logan, he\u2019d make it last until I was begging him for release.</p><p>I started suckling his cock, the softness soon becoming hard and swelling deep in my throat. He picked me up, placed me against the wall, and then ordered me to wrap my legs around his waist. I did.</p><p>He hesitated and my body was begging for him to enter me. I saw his expression harden and when he spoke it was without warmth. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think you\u2019re safe with me. I fuck you because I need release, that\u2019s all you can be to me.\u201d</p><p>Then he pushed inside me.</p><p>Day 15</p><p>Logan\u2019s routine was the same each day. He left me in the morning and returned at night, and we had sex. Passionate sex that made me forget, at least for a while, where we were and who he\u2019d become. But, since those words in the shower, it had changed. Now, I kept my hope guarded. We had sex because it was what he desired and what I needed to make certain I wasn\u2019t sold.</p><p>I never called him Logan, and he always had the control, but in a way I felt like I had it too. I saw how much he wanted me, and it gave me power. Or at least I imagined it did.</p><p>Despite that, I still felt fear rush through me every time the lock in the door turned. I was never certain if it was the girl bringing my meal or Alfonzo or Raul coming to take me away. The threat of being sold was a constant terror, and I was always on edge on whether Logan was tired of me or had changed his mind about keeping me.</p><p>Today Logan didn\u2019t go work-out, and instead had breakfast with me then took me in the shower and washed every inch of me. I noticed the bruises on his skin and each day he looked to be getting more of them. Was his training not going well? Was there the possibility that the fighters here were better than Logan? Or maybe ... maybe the bruises were from something else? Was it possible that Logan wanted to leave here?</p><p>We came out of the shower and he picked me up, sat me on the counter and fucked me long and slow. He kissed me everywhere as if memorizing each curve and angle. It was sweet, and that smidgeon of hope rose again. I tried to smother it, afraid he\u2019d say something to hurt me again, but it was hard to keep my emotions from reacting to his sweetness.</p><p>I knew it was dangerous thinking Logan would get us both out of here, but when he was like this, I couldn\u2019t help it. The constant fear was exhausting and hope was all I had left. I think my mind gave me hope on purpose to keep me sane. If I lost hope then I\u2019d lose myself.</p><p>He left me for several hours and returned at dusk with an outfit in hand. I knew what it was for. Tonight was his fight. He\u2019d told me he was fighting against a guy who\u2019d never been defeated. He also told me there was a big dinner party planned afterward. One that would be like the first time I\u2019d entered Raul\u2019s compound.</p><p>He laid the outfit, or lack of, on the bed then held out his hand, a piece of jewellery hanging from his fingers. It was just like what I\u2019d seen the other girls wear\u2014a collar. \u201cCome here, Emily.\u201d</p><p>I rose and walked toward him, my heart pounding as I stared at the silver necklace.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d I did. \u201cThis will protect you from the other men. You belong to me. They will know that.\u201d He pushed my hair aside then reached around, and I felt the coldness of the collar as it settled on my skin. \u201cThere\u2019s things you won\u2019t want to see tonight.\u201d I put my hand up and touched the intricate silver links that weaved around my neck. It was beautiful and yet ... this place and the meaning the collar represented made it ugly. He turned me around and placed his hand under my chin. \u201cYou must submit completely to me. If you do anything ...\u201d His hand dropped, and he strode away and began pacing back and forth across the room, his hands shoved inside his front pockets. It was rare Logan looked uneasy and perturbed. He was always steady and certain of himself.</p><p>He looked different tonight\u2014nervous. Could he be worried that he\u2019d be defeated? \u201cYou must do exactly as I tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d Behaving was imperative as Logan had told me some of Raul\u2019s top buyers were going to be present. What I didn\u2019t know was who they were buying, and I was terrified it would be me.</p><p>He stopped pacing then stalked toward me and grabbed my arm. \u201cDo you? Emily, you have no idea the fuckin\u2019 shit that goes on here.\u201d He let me go, and I staggered backward until the backs of my knees hit the bed. I sat. \u201cI will do nothing\u2014nothing, if you make a mistake. I will let you go.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran through me at his words. \u201cI know.\u201d And I did. What I didn\u2019t know was why he was telling me this. The emotionless cold had been wiped from his face. A part of the man I once knew and loved stood in front of me again. It made my insides coil and spring toward him then spring back as if afraid to feel that assurance.</p><p>Logan gave an abrupt nod. \u201cOne slip and you\u2019ll disappear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you ... are you selling me tonight?\u201d Fear escalated through my body when he remained silent. God, what if he was getting rid of me?</p><p>He sat beside me and laid his hand on the edge of the bed over top of mine. I inhaled sharply and stiffened while looking at him.</p><p>\u201cIf I lose the fight ...\u201d I knew what that meant, and my body started shaking. \u201cI plan to win. But tonight will push your limits. Don\u2019t think for one second it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The image of the girl flashed before my eyes, her being fucked from behind, Alfonzo laughing and watching. Would he make me do that? Would I be subjected to being fucked in front of a room full of strangers?</p><p>\u201cWill you ... will you give me to others to ... fuck?\u201d</p> <p>Oh God, I couldn\u2019t do it. What if another man wanted to touch me? Was that allowed? Would Logan give me to him?</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. Suddenly the images became a movie reel, and my mind started thinking up the worst possible scenarios ... I couldn\u2019t do this. I was going to be auctioned off and never be found again. The collar around my neck started to tighten, choking me, strangling every breath.</p><p>Logan placed his hands on either side of my head, the pressure harsh as he forced me to acknowledge him. \u201cPull yourself together. You have to do this. You have no choice.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head back and forth. I couldn\u2019t be sold. I could handle Logan; I could be here with him, but the fear of the auction sat like a churning rusted chain in my stomach. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. Don\u2019t make me go. Don\u2019t make me.\u201d All his warnings, his rules went through the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t make me. Please.\u201d Tears streamed down my face, and with the pads of his thumbs he wiped them away.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019ll stay here. Leave me here. I\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll kneel. I\u2019ll do whatever you want. Tie me up, blindfold me. Just don\u2019t make me go.\u201d</p><p>His voice was controlled and firm as he said, \u201cI can\u2019t. Raul wants you there, so if I lose ...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish the sentence. I cried for who I\u2019d become, this weak woman. I detested myself for loving a man that was saving me from Raul by keeping me, and I detested myself for hating that same man who was destroying my dignity.</p><p>His fingers weaved into my hair. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why me? I loved you.\u201d My voice rose, \u201cI loved you.\u201d I sobbed the words, my breaking point crushing the calm, protective wall I\u2019d carefully built around myself.</p><p>Logan stormed to his feet, walked to the other side of the room, and punched his fist into the wall. Blood dripped down the back of his hand as he turned back. Then he came straight for me. Terror pushed me to react against what I knew could get me punished and I ran for the door.</p><p>My hands curled around the doorknob just as Logan grabbed me by the shoulders and spun me around. He pulled me in hard so I was crushed against his chest. His mouth slammed onto mine, a rumbled groan escaping him as he curled me into him. His kiss was possessive and unbreakable; he was taking what had become his and yet giving me back the part of him I\u2019d once known.</p><p>His lips softened as I leaned into him.</p> <p>Our ragged breathing was the only sound in the room as we stared at one another for minutes.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d Logan said then spun and strode from the room.</p><p>I stiffened. Then I brought in the coldness he\u2019d shown me and became who he needed me to be, because I knew he was the only one who could save me from tonight.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>3 hours later</p><p>I\u2019d watched Logan\u2019s fight sitting between Jacob and Dave, Raul a few seats away from me. This wasn\u2019t the typical underground dirty warehouse location. No, Raul had an actual ring and seating. He obviously had been organizing these fights for a while.</p><p>Logan defeated his opponent, but it\u2019d been brutal and tough, and I\u2019d been in perpetual anxiety the entire time. I knew if he lost I\u2019d be sold, but it was more than that. A small part of me worried about him. Maybe it was human nature. Maybe love couldn\u2019t be stopped, or maybe I was just thinking irrationally.</p><p>I wore his collar, and noticed Raul\u2019s nod of approval when he saw me with Logan. Or was it my state of dress he approved? Or rather lack of dress. I tried not to think about it, but it was hard considering there was nothing beneath it. It dipped so low in the front that my nipples were exposed. When I first put it on, I tore it off again then threw it across the room.</p><p>I even went and put on the nightgown and waited beside the bed for Logan to come back and see me not wearing what he put out for me. Then panic set in as I realized that he\u2019d be back any second and I wasn\u2019t dressed.</p><p>Tonight wasn\u2019t an option. I had to do this. So, I put on the dress, and my breasts spilled out of the tight material, and I waited for Logan while kneeling on the floor.</p><p>When he saw me, it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d expected. He was angry as his eyes took me in, and then that cold, expressionless face pulled down over him. He never spoke a word to me as he got changed then took me to his fight where I tried to ignore the stares of the men as they panted over my body like animals.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d Logan had changed from his fighting shorts into a pair of black slacks and a white button-down top. He looked different, contained, formal, and I didn\u2019t like it. He grabbed my hand then chin-lifted to Dave who\u2019d stayed with me until Logan came back. \u201cThree days.\u201d</p><p>Dave nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat last shipment ... two were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Dave said. I didn\u2019t even want to imagine what they were referring to, but I remembered when Logan told Alfonzo not to crate and ship me.</p><p>\u201cSomething goes wrong ...\u201d Logan began.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man. I know.\u201d</p><p>Logan gave an abrupt nod then we left Dave as we made our way back to the main house where Raul was holding the celebration. Not once did he look at me, almost as if he couldn\u2019t\u2014like he was disgusted. I was disgusted in myself, humiliated being emotionally degraded in front of the other men. I was an object to them. That had become my reality.</p><p>I wanted to scream and hit and freak out, but stupidity had no place in my life. I had to be harder than them, unaffected and colder. Like Logan.</p><p>All my self-control vanished the second the sounds hit me. The moans of pain, the groans of pleasure, the grunting, the crack of the whip, the laughter, and then the sobbing.</p><p>I hesitated at the doorway, and Logan\u2019s hand tightened on my arm. \u201cBlock it out,\u201d he whispered in a harsh growl. \u201cKeep your eyes closed if you have to.\u201d</p><p>He yanked me forward, and I stumbled further into the room. My chest heaved in and out as I tried to control the panic. There was no escaping this, but I did squeeze my eyes closed until I heard Raul\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThere he is.\u201d A chair scraped over the stone tiles. \u201cSculpt. My prized fighter.\u201d There was a loud applause. Logan stopped, and despite having my eyes closed I knew Raul was near me from the scent of garlic and cigarettes. \u201cI made a lot of money tonight. That is reason enough for a celebration. You fight better than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won because my opponent can\u2019t control his temper, and I was fighting for something I wanted\u2014a slave who is a damn good fuck. I now realize why they are in such high demand.\u201d His voice was strained, and I could feel the tension in his body.</p><p>\u201cAhh, yes. She is your first slave. You\u2019ve done well with her. I wasn\u2019t certain you had it in you, Sculpt.\u201d I opened my eyes just as Raul put his finger under my chin and forced me to look at him. I swallowed. \u201cShe is very beautiful. When you tire of her, I will find a buyer for her who appreciates a woman with\u2014spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be for a while.\u201d</p><p>Raul laughed as he stared at my breasts. \u201cNo, I suspect not.\u201d He slapped Logan on the back. \u201cEnjoy your evening. I look forward to many more of them as should you.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and then led me away to a table in the far corner of the room where four men were sitting. I cringed when I saw there were two girls kneeling beside their owners; both wore collars and were naked. The other man had a male slave standing behind his chair wearing a black leather collar with studs and then a leather bra type thing that had criss-crossed straps and metal rings. When we approached the male slave looked directly at me and smiled. There was nothing in his handsome young face that said he didn\u2019t want to be exactly where he was.</p><p>I tried not to look at anyone else, but it\u2019s like when people slow down as they pass an accident on the highway. They have to look, it\u2019s an irresistible reaction, and when I glanced at the girl Logan made me kneel next to, I knew exactly who she was. Well, not her name or anything, but it was the girl who made my dreams into nightmares.</p><p>She never moved an inch as I knelt beside her; Logan\u2019s hand was on top of my head as if he was making certain that I didn\u2019t get up and run for my life. Which did cross my mind for two seconds. But Logan was right; fear of the consequences was what would keep me alive here.</p><p>\u201cSculpt. Good fight.\u201d The deep voice was controlled and sent shivers down my spine, and they weren\u2019t good shivers. \u201cKai.\u201d I didn\u2019t look up, but I assumed they were shaking hands. \u201cI have no interest in the fighting circuit, but I was rather impressed by your ability. And I lost a lot of money tonight.\u201d</p><p>Logan began stroking my hair. \u201cRaul mentioned your name in passing. I\u2019m curious, why is it that you\u2019ve travelled all this way for a fight you\u2019re not interested in?\u201d</p><p>I tensed when I saw the man\u2019s hand reach down to the girl beside me and grab her by the chin and raise her head. \u201cHer. I was curious when Raul sent me the invitation to the fight. I declined, however. Raul must have known I would, and he is intelligent. He also knew if I refused to come many other of my acquaintances wouldn\u2019t either, so he offered me her. Alfonzo\u2019s latest.\u201d</p><p>I quickly put my head down and covered my mouth with my hand to stop from crying out. I couldn\u2019t even imagine what Alfonzo\u2019s training meant. I didn\u2019t want to, and I was horrified with what the girl must have been through. Without moving my head, I glanced at her dead eyes. Alfonzo must have dug his filthy paws into her soul and ripped it out leaving this girl with nothing but a shell willing to do anything asked of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan\u2019s leg nudged me, and I lowered my hand from my mouth. \u201cHe is giving her to you? Raul doesn\u2019t like to give anything away.\u201d</p><p>Kai chuckled. \u201cNo, but I required a new girl, and Raul knew that. When I saw her picture I had to have her.\u201d I slid closer to Logan as Kai grabbed her by the collar and jerked upward. The girl never made a sound, but I did catch a glistening tear in her eye as Kai pulled her up on his lap and started fondling her. \u201cHe knows my type and this one ...\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but glance up at Kai, \u201cis special.\u201d</p><p>Logan saw me looking and quickly changed the subject to the fight. It was a couple hours later, after he\u2019d fed me like a dog and I listened to the sounds swarming me like insects crawling over my skin, that Kai took interest in me.</p><p>\u201cShe is stunning.\u201d</p> <p>Logan had his hand on the nape of my neck, and I felt it stiffen. \u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner appears to be over, and my understanding is Raul likes to play afterward. Care to indulge?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. No. No, Logan. Please.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why bother having her? My suggestion is tame, nothing to frighten your little slave. She does look like she wants to be swallowed up by the floor.\u201d Kai reached over and stroked the side of my face with his finger. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p> <p>I did. My eyes meeting his flashing green intensity. He was handsome and dignified, like I\u2019d imagine a business man with lots of wealth would look like. I guessed he was in his early thirties, and he had strong, defined features and really dark brows and tanned skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share,\u201d Logan said in what sounded like a growl.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Kai said, and his hand dropped from me to stroke his girl\u2019s inner thigh. \u201cBut watching the women together. Two beauties ... now that I would enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice was stern.</p><p>\u201cNo, what gentleman?\u201d Raul was standing behind Logan\u2019s chair, and I quickly lowered my head, my hair falling in front of my face.</p><p>Kai spoke, \u201cI suggested a little play between the women. Sculpt has declined.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched. Logan please don\u2019t make me.</p><p>\u201cI had something else in mind for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kai shoved the girl off his lap, and she fell to the floor then quickly righted herself and knelt beside Kai. I reached out my hand to hers. It was instinctive and reactive, something I shouldn\u2019t have done, but seeing her treated so cruelly had sparked a fire in me. Dangerous.</p><p>The girl looked at me horrified, her face paling at the gesture. Then just as quick, she was holding onto Kai\u2019s leg softly stroking it like a dog licking its master.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be interested in hearing this,\u201d Raul said. \u201cKai, Sculpt has been hiding this gem away for over a week now. I was beginning to think that she\u2019d escaped him.\u201d Kai laughed. \u201cShe was rather ... disobedient when she arrived. I was anticipating Alfonzo having to train her as he did your new slave. But,\u201d Raul gestured to me. \u201cShe has been reigned in. After being away from us for so long, I was thinking Sculpt had become soft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you have in mind for this part of the evening, Sculpt?\u201d Kai asked.</p><p>Logan was silent, and I could feel his finger twitching. I held my breath, knowing that whatever he decided I wouldn\u2019t like.</p> <p>I dug my nails into my thighs and tried to block out my whirling imagination. \u201cPerhaps Kai can fuck her while she sucks you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Logan said. \u201cMore of a show.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t control the sob that emerged from my throat, and Logan quickly reacted. He shoved the dishes off the table with one swoop of his arm, and then grabbed me by the arm threw me face down on the table, placing his hand on the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cYou want her fucked. And I want to fuck her.\u201d Logan yanked up my dress, and I could feel the warm air on my bare ass. My cheek pressed against the wood of the table, and when I opened my eyes I saw Kai watching me. Our eyes locked, and I saw the cool, unaffected expression to my terror.</p><p>My breath came in short, heaving gasps. I heard voices all around me and squeezed my eyes shut as the sounds grew louder and closer. They were going to watch Logan fuck me right here on the table.</p><p>\u201cLegs,\u201d Logan growled.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut and did as he said. He nudged my legs further apart and then stepped between them, and I felt his cock and the material of his slacks against me. I started to struggle, and he pulled back and then spanked me on the ass so hard that I cried out.</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>He spanked me again then he massaged my ass. He repeated it several times, spanking then massaging, and by then I was sobbing. It wasn\u2019t from being spanked, but from the humiliation. I felt the weight of him over me, and his mouth next to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWe have to do this, Eme. Don\u2019t think about anyone else. Focus on me. Nothing else.\u201d He kissed down my neck and then across my shoulder blades while his hand went underneath my dress, between my legs, and he began circling my clit.</p><p>At first I felt nothing, my body refusing to get turned on by this, by anything that was happening, but Logan was calm and gentle, and soon I felt the tingling, and Logan\u2019s hand pressing in my back eased.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you bothering to give her pleasure?\u201d I heard Raul say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no fun fucking a dry slave,\u201d Logan replied. His clothes rubbed my back as he came over me again and whispered in my ear, \u201cI\u2019ll be fast. Don\u2019t fight me, Eme. Okay? You get why we have to do this?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>I knew he was trying to protect me from something much worse than him publically fucking me. I wasn\u2019t wet, but mildly damp from his stimulation and when he pushed his cock inside me it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>My hips pushed into the edge of the table as he thrust into me again and again. I could hear the men talking around us merging with the sound of his pelvis smacking into my ass. Glasses clanged together and I heard men telling Logan harder. A girl sobbed and then the crack of a whip then more sobs. Raul laughed and then he was beside my head shoving his finger into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSuck it like it\u2019s my cock,\u201d Raul ordered.</p><p>Logan\u2019s hands dug into my hips as if in warning and I knew I had to. I willingly slid my tongue around Raul\u2019s finger, tasting the juices of meat from his meal. He shoved it back and forth into my mouth matching the rhythm of Logan as I suckled and teased his finger as if it was his cock.</p><p>Laughter surrounded me. Men yelling out suggestions that sent my stomach churning and I would\u2019ve thrown up if Raul hadn\u2019t taken his finger out of my mouth at that moment.</p><p>I heard Logan grunt and tighten his hands on my hips as he jerked one last time into me.</p><p>He\u2019d barely finished coming before I heard the sound of his zipper, then my dress was pulled down, and he was dragging me off the table.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to screw the shit out of her ass in privacy. Think I deserve that after winning that fight tonight, gentlemen.\u201d Logan took my hand, nodded to the men, and strode out of the dining hall, me in tow.</p><p>The ability to speak was torn from my mind as if Logan had ripped the vocal cords from my throat himself. Nothing could be said about what happened. I wasn\u2019t sure if he had the intention of fucking my ass, but as soon as we were out of sight of the others, it was like all the terror, anger, disgust, and horror rushed to my head.</p><p>I imagined grabbing the machine gun from the first passing guard and running back inside and killing every one of those men. Then I\u2019d watch them writhe around on the floor, suffering a slow, painful death ... Because that\u2019s what each of them deserved\u2014a slow, agonizing death. Nothing quick. Not jail\u2014that was far too kind. Justice would be dropping them into a pit of rats, covered in blood, and having the rats gnaw at them over days ... no weeks.</p><p>Each and every molecule in my body had been slowly bottling up with rage and disgust through the dinner. I knew if I was shaken the wrong way, I\u2019d explode into a frothy, screaming mess of a lunatic. I felt like I had to let go, scream, do anything to release all the emotions that were treading across my insides.</p><p>I\u2019d survive it, but those girls ... I wasn\u2019t so sure how long they would. And Kai\u2019s newly acquired gift, God, her eyes would haunt my dreams for eternity. She\u2019d been terrified when I tried to offer her comfort. Panic overrode any other emotion that may have once been part of that girl.</p><p>Tonight I had watched in horror the degradation of human beings.</p><p>Logan walked me back across the courtyard, his hand on the small of my back. \u201cYou did good, Emily.\u201d Logan\u2019s words hit me as if he\u2019d taken a bat and slammed it across my face. Good? I did good?</p><p>His words were the wrong ones. They shook the rage-filled molecules, and they all popped at the same time.</p><p>\u201cGood! Good! I did good?\u201d I screamed and then threw myself at him and began punching. I didn\u2019t care where or how, just as long as my fists were hitting something. I heard his curse as my fist connected with his jaw.</p><p>\u201cHow could you? How could you? Why did you do that? And those girls? You let them be abused. You let it happen while those pieces-of-shit men destroy them.\u201d I punched him again and again. \u201cThey\u2019re human beings, damn it.\u201d The images of the girl\u2019s dead eyes pressed into the forefront of my brain. \u201cKai is going to kill her. She\u2019s almost dead now. How can you let him do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily. Stop it.\u201d He tried to control me, but I was out of control, the images of what they suffered screaming through me. \u201cMouse!\u201d Logan\u2019s use of my nickname was lost to my screams, drowned beneath the undeniable anger.</p><p>I was crying and screaming at the same time. My voice unrecognizable as I yelled at him. He hooked me around the waist, put has hand over my mouth and picked me up while I continued to scream muffled words. It was then I saw Alfonzo running toward us.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Emily. Damn it.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo stopped. \u201cSculpt.\u201d</p><p>Logan let me go and placed his hand on my shoulder. \u201cKnees. Now.\u201d</p><p>I knew what Alfonzo could do to me, so I did what I was told, but my body still shook with anger.</p><p>\u201cGive her to me,\u201d Alfonzo said. \u201cRaul is furious. We heard her screams inside.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed Logan\u2019s leg. \u201cPlease. No. Don\u2019t let him take me. I\u2019ll be good. I promise. Please.\u201d</p><p>I never in my life thought I\u2019d beg like that, I don\u2019t think anyone ever thinks they will until they\u2019re faced with this. My mind was only built to take so much, and going through the torture again would kill me. I needed that piece of me that still wanted to live, to fight, to one day have my dream of freedom come true. Alfonzo was going to take that away. He was going to destroy that last fragment of hope, and I would become like those other girls. I\u2019d die inside.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Logan said to Alfonzo, and I choked back the sobs as overwhelming relief settled into me. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d</p><p>The sound of long, casual strides came toward us. I kept my head bowed, but knew the moment he came near enough who it was by his distinct smell\u2014Raul.</p><p>\u201cTake her.\u201d Raul\u2019s instructions to Alfonzo were clear. There wasn\u2019t a single ounce of sympathy in his steel tone. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t last.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alfonzo grabbed my arm and dragged me to my feet. I could\u2019ve begged Raul, but it was too late. I knew that. I also knew I had nothing to lose because going to the room downstairs or being sold would be the end of who I was.</p><p>I stood immobile in front of Raul then slowly raised my head until I met his eyes.</p><p>They flickered with surprise for a second at my bold, direct gaze.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d Logan\u2019s warning was low and barely audible. \u201cAlfonzo get her out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Alfonzo tugged, and I whipped around, hitting my two forefingers into Alfonzo\u2019s trachea. He let me go, staggering backward, choking. Before Raul and Logan could stop me, I reeled around and slammed my elbow into Raul\u2019s face so hard I felt his cheekbone crack.</p><p>\u201cEmily!\u201d Logan shouted grabbing for me.</p><p>I knew I\u2019d have no chance against him if he got a hold of me. He taught me everything I knew. It was Alfonzo who took me to the ground, his fury in every movement. His knee dug into the small of my back, and my arms were yanked behind me so hard I swear they both dislocated.</p><p>I felt something cold and hard press against my head. With my cheek shoved into the ground by Alfonzo\u2019s hand, I couldn\u2019t lift my head, but, from the corner of my eye, I saw Raul crouched down beside me, a gun pushed against my temple.</p><p>He cocked the hammer.</p> <p>\u201cRaul,\u201d Logan snapped.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were too close to her.\u201d Raul pressed the gun harder into my temple. \u201cI should kill her right now.\u201d I could hear his heavy breathing and smelled the scent of his last cigarette. \u201cIt is a good thing you\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re worth far more to me alive then the satisfaction of blowing your brains out. Perhaps Kai is interested. He did find you attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine, Raul. I won the fight, or did you forget that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you forget who you\u2019re talking too? Any of those men here tonight would be willing to buy her right now.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I operate, and second chances don\u2019t exist in this world. She belongs to me now.\u201d Raul tapped his gun against my head. \u201cOr would you rather I shoot her?\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t see what Logan did, but I heard the shuffle of feet, and I knew ... I knew Logan walked away.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>1 hour later</p><p>I sat blindfolded in the torture room, tied to the metal bed. Every noise made me jump then my body quivered with fear as I waited for ... what, I didn\u2019t know. Was Raul selling me off right now? Were one of those men going to own me? Kai? Would Raul have Alfonzo \u201ctrain\u201d me first?</p><p>The waiting was driving me senseless.</p><p>Never knowing when anyone was coming. Afraid of the creak in the floorboards. Of a distant scream. Of how the air in the room shifted.</p><p>The sound of Logan\u2019s footsteps as he walked away echoed over and over in my mind. He\u2019d left me. He gave me to Raul. He didn\u2019t argue. He acted as if I was nothing to him.</p><p>He told me he would, but I always had this crazy, far-off idea that he\u2019d defend me. He may have brought me here and kept me in this place, but he\u2019d also protected me against it too.</p> <p>I was wrong.</p><p>He\u2019d walked away.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care if I was sold or killed.</p><p>Logan walked away from me.</p><p>The door burst open, and I emitted a tiny scream, but I didn\u2019t cry. I wouldn\u2019t. No one deserved my tears in this place.</p><p>Hands grabbed my wrists, and I recognized them. Logan\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t Alfonzo or Jacob. Was he going to torture me? Was he the one taking me to a new owner? Could he be that cruel?</p><p>He took off the ropes on my wrists then tore off my blindfold and helped me stand.</p><p>Our eyes locked.</p><p>And somehow I knew. Whether I felt it or saw it in his expression, I didn\u2019t know, but the man standing in front of me was the man I used to love.</p><p>\u201cOne chance at this. One. We aren\u2019t ready, but there\u2019s no choice. He\u2019s selling you and ... Mouse, get changed. Now.\u201d It was then I noticed the clothes on the bed. Logan grabbed the front of the black lace dress and ripped it off me then threw it aside. I stood dumbstruck, staring until his voice cut through my shock. \u201cClothes. Now.\u201d</p><p>He picked up what looked like an oversized black T-shirt and a pair of jeans and tossed them at me, then walked back to the door. I kept looking at him as I changed, uncertain what was happening. There was a stern determination on his face, unrelenting and dangerous as he put his ear to the door.</p><p>I was doing up the zipper of the jeans when he strode towards me. \u201cI needed you gone ten minutes ago\u2014move it.\u201d He grabbed my arm just as the door burst open again. Logan shoved me so hard behind him that I fell to my butt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the ... Sculpt?\u201d Alfonzo\u2019s eyes went from me to Logan. \u201cWhat are you doing here? She\u2019s sold, Sculpt. I\u2019m taking her to her new owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice was steady and calm. \u201cThat is not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>I climbed to my feet.</p><p>Alfonzo\u2019s eyes kept darting between me and Logan. \u201cYour father will crucify you, then her.\u201d</p><p>Father? What? My eyes widened, and I staggered backward until my back hit the damp cement wall. Raul?</p><p>Oh God. Logan was Raul\u2019s son? Logan was Raul\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I get to live with the satisfaction of what I\u2019ve wanted to do for weeks.\u201d Logan took two strides and swung hard and fast, his fist connecting with Alfonzo\u2019s jaw and sending him back into the wall. \u201cYou. Are. Scum. A parasite.\u201d Logan hit him again and blood splattered from his nose and upper lip.</p><p>Alfonzo grunted and tried swinging back, but he was no match for Logan, and as soon as he went for his gun, Logan kicked it from his hand, and it went sliding across the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou touched her. That was your mistake.\u201d Logan continued to punch Alfonzo again and again until Alfonzo was lying on the ground unmoving. I was staring, watching, confused and not knowing what the hell was going on except that Alfonzo looked dead and Logan was covered in his blood.</p><p>I glanced at the gun then back to Logan who stood over Alfonzo staring down at the motionless form. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but I wasn\u2019t letting the chance escape me.</p><p>I dove for the gun.</p><p>My fingers curled around the butt, and I jumped to my feet just as I heard Logan\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cEmily. Put the gun down.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head back and forth as the gun trembled in my hand while I pointed it at him. \u201cNo. I\u2019m getting out of here. And you\u2019re not stopping me.\u201d</p><p>He took one step forward, and I steadied the gun with my other hand then cocked the hammer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You are getting out of here, but not on your own, and I think you know that. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d</p><p>I backed up as he came forward. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe you. Why would you do that? You brought me here. You\u2019ve kept me here. He\u2019s your ... he\u2019s your father. That man is ...\u201d I couldn\u2019t say it again; it made me sick to my stomach to think I\u2019d willingly slept with that bastard\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cPut the gun down.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cI never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>I jerked the gun toward him as I spoke. \u201cBullshit. You lied to me every single day. Were the nights a lie too? Am I just like all those other girls? Maybe I\u2019d be better off with a new owner, at least I know when he fucks me I will hate him. Not like you. You made me love you then you wrecked me with it. Then ... then you gave me back piece by piece every night only to take it away all over again in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you. Ever.\u201d He nodded to the gun. \u201cYou shoot that thing in here\u2014we\u2019re both dead. Every man in this place will be down here. I\u2019m trying to help you, and this shit is about to blow up in our faces.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe him. My trust had been destroyed, just like I was going to do to his heart when I shot him. \u201cStay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d He dove for me.</p><p>I tightened my finger on the trigger and closed my eyes.</p><p>Then I felt the jarring pain in my back when Logan threw his weight on top of me and we both crashed to the floor. He grabbed the gun out of my hands and slid it in the back of his jeans.</p><p>Without a word he pulled me to my feet, slid his cell from his pocket, and snagged my hand.</p><p>He pressed a number on his phone and put it to his ear. \u201cDeck.\u201d</p><p>Deck? Georgie\u2019s Deck? What? No, it couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s now,\u201d he said abruptly into the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t care if your guys aren\u2019t ready. This happens. You sure your man has her safe? Good.\u201d He nodded then his back stiffened as he listened. \u201cNot happening, Deck. I\u2019m not taking that chance.\u201d Silence, except for the thumping of my heart and the blood rushing through my veins. Logan pulled me up the stairs. \u201cDeck, I don\u2019t care. You hear me? Change in plans. She goes. I\u2019ll deal with Raul and the consequences.\u201d He propelled me down a hallway, then out a side door that led us outside. He stopped, placed his hand over the receiver and said, \u201cDave.\u201d</p><p>Dave appeared from behind the bushes. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a risk meeting.\u201d He nodded to the phone. \u201cTaking a risk using that. It\u2019s for the end game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the end game. It needs to happen. Alfonzo is down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Sculpt, that wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get her clear, and I\u2019ll look after the rest. You got the signal?\u201d</p><p>Dave ran his hand through his hair. \u201cYeah, but Sculpt. Jesus. Not a good idea. Deck says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I care? Do it.\u201d</p><p>I was so confused having no idea what was happening except Dave was shocked, Logan was losing control, and Deck was yelling through the speaker. They were speaking to one another as if ... as if this was planned. Could it be true? Was Deck here? Could Logan be talking about getting me out of here? Why now? Why would he suddenly change his mind?</p><p>The flicker of hope was trying to emerge from beneath my fear. I was scared of what Logan was doing, of what would happen if he was caught, if we were caught. I was confused as to why Dave was helping and worried that this was some kind of setup.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Logan said into the phone.</p><p>I could hear Deck on the line, \u201cSculpt, you screw with this, you\u2019re fucked. I told you it will go down, but you need to wait. My men are on mission, I\u2019m waiting on two more. We need them, Sculpt. We don\u2019t have enough men for a complete take down of this place. You fuck this now, he\u2019ll know something\u2019s up, and if he escapes, neither of you will be safe for the rest of your goddamn lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with Raul. Get her out.\u201d Logan closed his eyes for a half a second then looked at me. The pain I saw there was so raw that my breath hitched, and I wanted to go to him to ease it. How could I feel this way? He didn\u2019t deserve anything from me.</p><p>\u201cRaul will torture you until you piss and puke blood. Then he\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Deck shouted over the phone. \u201cJust hold the fuck up. We know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. Dave\u2019s bringing her out. Be ready.\u201d Logan dropped the phone from his ear. He must have pressed the End button, because Deck\u2019s shouts could no longer be heard. \u201cYou know what to do.\u201d He reached in his pocket and pulled out what looked like a passport. \u201cThis will get you home.\u201d He passed it to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My hand shook as I took it from him. Why was he doing this? It didn\u2019t make sense. He\u2019d made her fear him and threatened to sell her. He\u2019d told her he\u2019d not protect her if she misbehaved.</p><p>\u201cMan. Deck is right. A few more days\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a few more days, she has zero.\u201d He was talking about me as if ... as if he cared what happened to me. \u201cDeck will meet you. Don\u2019t come back, Dave. Don\u2019t ever come here again. What happened to your sister ... fuck ... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dave stiffened and nodded as if no more needed to be said, and Logan put his hand on Dave\u2019s shoulder and squeezed.</p> <p>Sister? What happened to Dave\u2019s sister? Could she have been a slave? Was she one of the girl\u2019s she\u2019d seen? Had she been killed? Why did Logan care? How good of friends were they?</p><p>When Logan shifted, his eyes met mine.</p><p>The Logan I\u2019d fallen in love with, not the cold man who held me captive, stood in front of me. I saw it in him, the way his eyes warmed, the way his fingers stroked the back of my hand.</p><p>And it terrified me. Because no matter how much I\u2019d fought it, I still loved this man.</p><p>Dave tugged on my arm, and mine and Logan\u2019s hands separated. I stared, unable to move.</p> <p>\u201cEmily. Go.\u201d</p><p>Dave yanked, but I refused to budge. \u201cChiquita, we have to leave now.\u201d</p><p>Then the coldness descended over Logan\u2019s face. \u201cGet out of here, Emily. This is who I am. Don\u2019t think any different just because I fucked you a few times.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. Dave swore beneath his breath.</p><p>\u201cGet her out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>I glared at the man that just sucked the last bit of hope from my heart. \u201cWhy are you letting me go then? Just sell me, you bastard! Why take the risk?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m risking nothing. My father will be marginally upset, but I\u2019m his prize fighter, and if I choose to let you go then that is my choice.\u201d His tone softened, the hardness in his eyes remained. \u201cGo repair from this place, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt.\u201d Dave sighed and lowered his head, clearly unhappy at what was going down.</p><p>My response was automatic, as if the words were sitting on the tip of my tongue waiting to be spoken. \u201cSome things can\u2019t be repaired. You break them bad enough, they can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d</p><p>His body flinched. His jaw clenched, and I saw his index finger twitch against his thigh. He was angry, but I also recognized the pain in his expression. And I was glad he hurt.</p><p>I\u2019d live. I\u2019d survive.</p><p>I realized I didn\u2019t have it in me to forgive him or to forget. But I\u2019d find a place in me that could\u2014live.</p><p>Dave yanked hard on my hand and we ran. The last vision I saw of Logan was him turning his back on me.</p><p>Dave hauled ass through the compound, sticking to the shadows while dragging me behind him. I was too frazzled to do anything but follow him, and if it was true and I was getting out of here, then I\u2019d do anything he asked of me.</p> <p>He stopped behind one of the houses, his finger up to his mouth making certain I stayed quiet. I heard the steady patter of paws and feet and leaned up against the wall, holding my breath, praying they couldn\u2019t hear my heart thumping erratically.</p><p>When the guard and dog passed, Dave gestured to me to stay put while he crept low across the yard. I saw the flash of his knife reflect against the moonlight as he unsheathed it. In one swift movement the guard standing near the wall fell to the ground.</p><p>Dave gestured to me, and I went running to him.</p><p>Suddenly there were three loud gun shots and lots of shouts as guards started running toward the main house.</p><p>\u201cFool.\u201d Dave said staring off in the direction of the gunshots. \u201cThat\u2019s our signal.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand again, and we ran the length of the wall. It felt like forever as I scrambled after him, trying to stop from ducking as more gun shots went off.</p><p>Dave stopped and dropped to his knees at a grate in the ground. He pulled several times before it gave way. \u201cThe ladder\u2019s slippery. Careful.\u201d</p><p>I slid through feet first and felt for the ladder rung then started climbing down. I stopped when I heard a clang of metal. \u201cDave?\u201d I didn\u2019t trust the guy, and I had no idea why he was helping me escape, but right now he was all I had.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, Chiquita.\u201d His voice carried down the damp sewer. \u201cYou need to hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ... are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Chiquita. Go quickly.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, he wasn\u2019t coming. I was all alone in a sewer with no money and somewhere in Mexico. I froze on the ladder, fingers tight around the damp, thin metal. I didn\u2019t know what to do, where to go, or even how to get there. Maybe this sewer was a dead end? Had Dave even checked where this led? Was this a test? Was Sculpt testing to see if I\u2019d leave if given the chance? Could all this be a cruel sick game to torment me?</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>My body instinctively plastered against the ladder. The voice came from below me ... It was vaguely familiar, but I was so scared I didn\u2019t trust anything my mind was thinking right now.</p><p>\u201cEmily? Hell.\u201d</p><p>Deck?</p><p>The rush of emotion hit me so hard I slipped down two rungs, and the sound echoed like a drum through the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d Deck called.</p><p>\u201cY-yes. Yes, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClimb down, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I was sobbing hysterically by the time I felt hands on my hips, and then I was being lifted and placed on my feet. I turned in Deck\u2019s arms and collapsed into them, my cheek pressed against his chest, and my arms holding him tight around the waist. I barely knew the guy, but he was the best sight I\u2019d seen in fifteen days.</p><p>The relief was overwhelming, like I\u2019d been pulled from being buried alive without hope, without breath ... alone with no one to trust\u2014until now.</p><p>Deck stroked the back of my hair. \u201cWe have to move hard, Emily. You good to run?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, sniffling.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s here. We\u2019re taking you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I cried. Matt. He\u2019d come. Him and Deck. They hadn\u2019t forgotten me.</p><p>I heard several more gun shots and jumped. I thought about Logan; I couldn\u2019t help it. He had something to do with me getting out of here. Even though I\u2019d never forgive him for what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d destroyed any innocence and tarnished it with mistrust and fear. He\u2019d put me in a world that would live in my nightmares forever.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know why Dave didn\u2019t come with me. Logan had sounded like Dave was supposed to, but he\u2019d opted to go back. For Logan? Did Logan need help? No, Logan was Raul\u2019s son.</p><p>Deck squeezed my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, Emily.\u201d</p><p>Safe? I\u2019d never be safe again. I knew I\u2019d never be the same girl who walked into an illegal fighting ring and asked Sculpt to teach her how to fight. I didn\u2019t know who I\u2019d become or how I\u2019d do it or where I\u2019d even go from here.</p><p>What I did know was that I\u2019d never forget.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>2 years later</p><p>Gravel crunched beneath tires as the distinct roar of a motorcycle come barreling up the driveway toward me.</p><p>It was rare anyone came to the farm except Deck who drove his sweet black Audi with the tinted windows. It crept up the driveway so silently that I rarely noticed it. Actually, the car reminded me of Deck, mysterious, dangerous with a quiet calmness that awakened every nerve in the body. Deck had taken it upon himself to check up on me every so often ever since he and Matt had brought me back from Mexico. Georgie said it was his way, and I was \u201cin the fold\u201d now. Well, the fold could be a pain in the butt, and Georgie completely agreed as she\u2019d been on Deck\u2019s radar since he was honorably discharged from the JTF2. He\u2019d started his own company called Unyielding Riot. I recently found out that Riot was Georgie\u2019s brother\u2019s call name in the JTF2.</p><p>Deck had been a huge help when I came back. He assisted with the police and FBI investigation and was with me when I had to tell them the story. Although, certain details were left out\u2014like Sculpt\u2019s identity. I never mentioned him; Deck\u2019s doing and I guess mine too. Sculpt had gotten me out of there.</p><p>Deck being an ex JTF2 often worked with law enforcement on cases and therefore had some \u2018friends\u2019 which helped when I wanted nothing more than to stop talking about it. He kept the pressure off of me and dealt with most of the questions and answers. At the time, I couldn\u2019t even recall most of what was said I was so numb to everything.</p><p>Stroking Havoc\u2019s sleek, white neck, I felt the veins popping out under her skin. A quiver raced through her body, and she trembled. Clucking, I moved Havoc into a walk. Horses were prey animals, and when scared\u2014they ran.</p><p>The bike\u2019s roar closed in on us.</p><p>Havoc\u2019s ears pricked forward and her muscles coiled like a spring.</p><p>I sunk deeper into the saddle, yet made certain I stayed relaxed. Clamping down tight on a fearful horse was like a mountain lion leaping on their back.</p><p>\u201cGood girl, Havoc.\u201d I urged her around so that we were facing the offending noise that still wasn\u2019t slowing. The bike paused at the fork in the driveway, one way went to the main house, the other to the barn. It revved then came straight for the barn.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>Havoc sucked in air to make a loud snorting sound.</p><p>I took my feet out of the stirrups to hop off, and at the same time the offending bike backfired.</p><p>Havoc exploded.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I looped my fingers in her mane as Havoc went up on her hind legs, pawing the air. My lower back hit hard against the back of the leather saddle as she came down on all fours. She took off in a mad gallop around the ring, her hind legs kicking out to the side and throwing my body off balance.</p><p>Havoc came to an abrupt halt, her nostrils flaring and sides heaving.</p><p>Then it happened.</p><p>The bike skidded to a stop in front of the barn, dust and gravel pebbles flew into the air hitting the aluminum barn wall and making a loud crackling sound like fireworks going off. Havoc\u2019s ears went straight back, her spine arched, and both hind legs went straight up into the air as she squealed.</p><p>I careened over her head and landed smack on my ass. \u201cUghhh.\u201d</p><p>I fell backward and lay in the dirt while I listened to Havoc bolt around the riding ring kicking up dust.</p><p>Undoing my chin strap, I flicked off my helmet and stared up at the ominous clouds. \u201cWhat the hell.\u201d</p><p>The gate clanged.</p><p>Footsteps.</p><p>I lay still contemplating what sort of pain I was going to cause the culprit. I\u2019d spent months gaining Havoc\u2019s trust and this would set me back weeks, if not months. The six other traumatized and abused rescue horses that had come with Havoc from the slaughter house had already been rehomed. I\u2019d helped them gain their pride and confidence back, but Havoc was taking much longer. She was an alpha mare and pushing her would only make her rebel\u2014the last reaction I wanted.</p><p>I figured another couple years of helping clients with \u201cproblem\u201d horses\u2014more like problem clients who didn\u2019t understand their horses\u2014and with the reselling of the abused horses to good homes I\u2019d be able to buy my own farm. I loved living here with Kat, but I wanted my own place. I think in a way I needed it. I\u2019d been latching onto Matt and Kat for too long, and I wanted a career and to be able to support myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The footsteps stopped beside me.</p><p>My eyes hit boots. Black leather with ankle mouldings\u2014motorcycle boots that were hidden partially by faded jeans on a pair of long, lean legs.</p><p>My eyes went up and up then\u2014</p><p>My world stopped.</p> <p>Oh God, I\u2019d worked so hard at burying the emotions, the pain, the hurt, and most of all the fear, and suddenly it was all back. Months of therapy obliterated.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Trapped within tightened lungs, suffocating with the shattering, mind-blowing knowledge of who was right next to me. It was like I had never left.</p><p>Logan.</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p> <p>No. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>But it was.</p><p>Logan.</p><p>Then he crouched, inches away from me.</p><p>My heart rate tripled its speed, and the saliva in my mouth vanished as my past slapped me in the face. Emotions swarmed, attacking me from all directions.</p><p>I wanted to run and hide, maybe even cower. This was the man who caused me to hide a knife beneath my mattress for the last two years.</p> <p>He looked different yet the same somehow. Harder\u2014scarier, definitely. He had a scar running the length of his chin, the place where I used to run my finger across to trace his dimple.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. No one had called me that since him. Hearing his voice ... him calling me that again\u2014</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His voice was barely a whisper, as if he had trouble saying my name.</p><p>Logan was still breathtaking, but now even more so, and it unsettled me that I thought that. His hair was a little longer, falling just below his ears in relaxed, soft waves, still messy and multilayered. The scruff on his face was new, and\u2014This man had torn my heart out. God, he made me his sex slave.</p><p>Suddenly I was wishing Havoc would trample him, so I could run away.</p><p>Logan stood and reached out his hand. My eyes hit his right arm that was now covered in tattoos from his elbow up to beneath his T-shirt. He\u2019d only had his left arm inked before.</p><p>Shuffling back on my ass, I scrambled to my feet. In my awkward rush I fell backward and tripped over my riding helmet.</p> <p>He reached again for me.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t.\u201d I held out my hands while I managed to gain my balance. Logan touching me again ... no. I couldn\u2019t yet register that he was here, in front of me, after two years. Three things crossed my mind. Run like hell. Beat on him, or leap into his arms and kiss him.</p><p>I did none of the above.</p><p>Logan ignored me and took my arm and pulled me back toward him before I had the chance to escape. I landed with my palms resting on his chest and my gaze hitting his neck. His corded muscles contracted, and his Adam\u2019s apple moved up then down as he swallowed.</p><p>Logan. I was in his arms. The guy who wrapped me up in his heart then destroyed it.</p><p>The guy I tried to forget. No, damn it, I did forget him. I lived every single day for two years without him. I lived. I suffered, and I breathed. Then I fought my way back and won.</p><p>Ironic that he was the one who ended up giving me the tools to repair from the very fear he had instilled in me.</p><p>His hand reached up to cup my cheek, and I turned my head away. Despite my lies to myself, I never forgot him.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d</p><p>A sob wrenched from my throat as he called me by my nickname.</p><p>I tried to wiggle out of his grasp, but his fingers dug into my arms. He wasn\u2019t letting go, and despite Logan being leaner than when I knew him, he was strong as hell. My mind was reeling with fear, anger and despair. I had to get my shit together. I needed to. I didn\u2019t get this far only to get torn apart again.</p><p>Pushing up against the wall of his chest I prepared myself for meeting his eyes and grit my teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His voice was soft and gentle.</p><p>My instinct was to hurt him anyway I could. To push him to the ground and have Havoc stomp all over him with her hooves.</p><p>Maybe love couldn\u2019t be forgotten. But maybe, just maybe it could be smothered by hate.</p><p>He ignored my steady push on his chest and stroked my hair like he used to do when I lay in his arms. \u201cYou hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you give a shit.\u201d I saw him flinch and was glad.</p><p>\u201cEme. Please.\u201d</p><p>My stomach bottomed out. Jesus, it was that voice. That tone. It was like a punch to the gut. \u201cLet me go, Logan.\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have said his real name; I knew it. Damn it, I remembered. Not the bad, but the warm protective man that sang to me. Who picked me up every morning to take me to work. Riding on his motorcycle, my arms around him, feeling so in love\u2014</p><p>I pushed on his chest again and the instant he let me go, I immediately took three steps back.</p><p>Distance. I may be a little older and have developed backbone but the moment I laid eyes on him again, that began to break away, and I felt him.</p><p>\u201cNo. You have no right to be here.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed when I took another step back. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I heard Havoc begin to paw the ground; it was a loud pounding that matched my beating heart. The swarm of heat that shifted across my body was intoxicating. Logan had made me feel real before he betrayed me, and yes, after it was a different kind of real. A raw and eye-opening real of what a man could do to you.</p><p>There was nothing to say. I had no words for him, so instead of standing in front of him looking like a mute, I swung around and headed for Havoc.</p><p>I heard the footsteps in the dirt behind me just as I reached the white Andalusian. He tagged my hand and pulled me to a stop. \u201cLet me explain, Eme.\u201d</p><p>A tremor of fear shifted through me at his tone and the reaction made me angry. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that. You let me go, remember. I\u2019m free now and I don\u2019t need anything from you. I\u2019m not your fucking sex slave to cram your cock into every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he growled. \u201cNot once did I take you without your consent. And you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because if I didn\u2019t, the consequences were worse.\u201d Okay, I was lying, because I was mad and hurt and yes, I was a little scared too. I had no clue why Sculpt was here, and the thought of going back ... no, I\u2019d never go back.</p><p>His voice was quiet, \u201cI never beat you, Emily. I tried to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you live with yourself? No, you just took away my choices. You watched while other people beat me. You bled my self-esteem. Damn it, you tore my fucking heart out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you out when I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, in pieces.\u201d</p><p>Logan never moved a muscle. Blazing, heated anger shot from his dark, chocolate eyes. \u201cEmily.\u201d Logan paused, as he waited for me to look at him. \u201cI\u2019ve lived two years without you. I\u2019m not doing it any longer. We are going to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My heart was pounding so fast I felt I would soon go into cardiac arrest.</p><p>\u201cThe compound is destroyed.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched as I immediately thought of all those girls. \u201cThe girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost got out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost?\u201d What did that mean?</p><p>\u201cRaul is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came to find me to tell me that? That your ruthless, piece-of-shit fucking father is dead? I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>I paused, and it was a mistake, because he noticed. \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p><p>He moved in, and I saw the intent on his face, the way his brows lowered, how his eyes turned dark. I knew what he was going to do, but before I could turn he grabbed me by the shoulders. \u201cI let you go once, because I had to. Now I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I started trembling with anger and fear stirred in my belly. There was an uncertainty if he was going to grab me and carry me away and I\u2019d never be found again.</p><p>My trust in Logan had snapped, and it couldn\u2019t be reconnected. \u201cYeah well, tell that to the police when I call them and have you arrested. They know what happened to me.\u201d But they didn\u2019t know Logan was involved. Maybe that was a mistake. I reached into my back pocket then realized I didn\u2019t have my phone.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d Logan\u2019s hand went to the nape of my neck, and his fingers caressed my skin causing disturbing goose bumps to rise. No. I didn\u2019t want my body to react to him. \u201cYou need to understand what went down and to hear it from me.\u201d</p><p>That pissed me off. He wanted me to understand? No. Nothing could ever make me understand. \u201cI live every single day with what you did to me.\u201d</p><p>So much pain had risen to the surface, because he dared to come here. It hurt. He hurt. The memories hurt. I knew escape was my only answer before I fell back into a place I swore I wouldn\u2019t go again.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Logan ran his hand through his bedroom hair, and the locks fell easily back in place. \u201cI did it to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I needed to be whipped for protection? And tortured? Oh and let\u2019s not forget that time in the courtyard when I had a gun pressed to my temple by your father and you walked away. And the humiliation of being publically ... fucked.\u201d</p><p>Logan stepped closer, and I felt his breath on my skin, his smell wafting into me just as I remembered it. \u201cI never took you against your will. Ever.\u201d</p><p>He was right, he never did. Even when he fucked me in the dining hall he\u2019d asked me. We did it to appease Raul and from making the situation any worse.</p><p>I felt like stomping like a fifteen-year-old when I was twenty-two. Instead I casually took the few steps to reach Havoc and picked up her lead. I started to walk Havoc from the ring when Logan called out. \u201cEmily.\u201d I kept walking. \"I\u2019m sorry it had to happen that way.\u201d</p><p>My hand on the latch of the gate dropped. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that.\u201d I turned, fury encompassing me like I was lit on fire. I dropped the lead and strode over to him glaring, unflinching as he stared right back at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say you\u2019re sorry, Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>He remained stoic and solid, and I was furious that he could be so calm and put together while I was falling apart inside.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His arms came around me in one heated embrace, and the loss I felt the last two years, the devastation, the loneliness, it was smothered by the weight of him. The tightening in my chest hurt so bad I wondered if my ribs were poking into my lungs. Breathing became unbearable as the distinct memories of this man hit like a tidal wave. My fingers curled into his T-shirt, and I felt the hardness of his chest, the way it contoured over taut skin, remembered how his tattoos rippled when he moved. I remembered, and it pissed me off that it was so clear.</p><p>\u201cLet me repair this.\u201d</p><p>His whispered words hit me, and I swallowed the sob threatening to escape and embarrass me. I was stronger now. I\u2019d survived him and his father. And I\u2019d survive this too.</p><p>I pulled back, instantly feeling the crushing despair descend on me. Why? Why did he come back? \u201cYou made me fear you. You made me fear myself. You locked me inside myself so deep that it took me months to break free again. Repair? You think you can repair that?\u201d I huffed. \u201cI think you should be looking at yourself and repairing your fucked up head before you offer to repair someone else.\u201d</p><p>I turned and walked away, staring straight ahead, ignoring the heat I felt blazing into my back. And I knew what it was from\u2014Logan.</p><p>Chapter 12 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put Havoc in her field and was walking back to the house when it started to rain. I heard the motorcycle start up minutes later, and a wave of relief swept over me. I didn\u2019t know where he was going, and I didn\u2019t care as long as it wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>The reality was I had no idea who Logan was\u2014the man I fell in love with or the son of a sadistic, ruthless Raul. Was he taking over his father\u2019s business now that he was dead? Maybe he was here to take me back?</p><p>Somewhere inside me, I knew that wasn\u2019t true. I\u2019d escaped because of him. He\u2019d managed to get Deck to Mexico to get me out. I\u2019m not sure how or why, but that was how it went down.</p><p>When I\u2019d left Logan that night all I knew was that Deck\u2019s men stayed behind. I never asked what happened, and Deck never told me. I had assumed the FBI had gone after Raul when I told them what happened. But why had it taken two years? And why wasn\u2019t Logan arrested if he was with his father?</p> <p>I leaned over the fence and watched as Havoc galloped across the field toward her herd. The rain teemed down on me, and I closed my eyes, tilted my face to the sky, and let it trickle down my cheeks.</p><p>It felt cool after the blazing heat of the day. Within seconds my T-shirt was soaked and my breeches stuck to my thighs like Velcro.</p><p>I shook out my wet hair and ran my fingers through it. An image of Logan caressing my head, stroking my hair\u2014</p><p>I slammed my palms into the fence and curled them. No. Stop.</p><p>I leaned my forehead against the cedar rail while the rain pounded hard onto my back and shoulders.</p> <p>I\u2019d liked it, his touch. How he was with me. I felt empty without him. Damn it, what was wrong with me?</p><p>My therapist had said the thoughts of what happened would fade, that with hard work and reconstructions, I\u2019d stop hearing the girls screams and having nightmares. But she didn\u2019t know everything; she had no idea that I loved the man that brought me into that world. To her he was a stranger who kidnapped me and took me to Mexico to be a sex slave.</p><p>Sliding down to the ground, I sat with my knees tucked up under my chin and my arms wrapped around them.</p><p>For two years I\u2019d been able to keep Logan locked up inside of me. My therapist and I worked through what I\u2019d witnessed and suffered, and the nightmares did fade. When she began pushing to know more about what I endured from the hands of the \u201cstranger\u201d, that was when I quit therapy. I refused to speak to Kat and Matt about what happened. Kat begged and pleaded with me to talk, but I couldn\u2019t. She knew about Logan and how I felt about him and I wanted to forget, not relive the humiliation.</p><p>But eventually they both stopped asking, and I slipped into my void of living. Georgie came by a few times a week, and she was her usual self, no-holds-barred Georgie. She told me about her brother Riot, and we talked about the loss and how Deck had been overprotective of her ever since.</p><p>My tears flowed like the rain, slipping down my cheeks as I rocked back and forth, the needles pounding into me. I cried. I don\u2019t know why really. I just did. And it hurt. Seeing Logan tore me open, and I was bleeding, and the thing was I didn\u2019t know how to stop it.</p> <p>\u201cMouse.\u201d</p><p>I jerked, raising my head. He stood in front of me, soaking wet, water dripping down his face like teardrops.</p><p>I stopped rocking. He looked like the man I loved standing there, with his hands tucked in his front jean pockets, a little uncomfortable, maybe unsure of himself. No, Logan was never uncertain.</p><p>He stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His voice. It was strained and harsh like it was when we ... we were together. He crouched in front of me, the rain having soaked his T-shirt, revealing the dark ink on his skin.</p><p>Logan had never left me. He\u2019d always been in me, yet I\u2019d denied it. Fought it because it was wrong. It was abnormal. I had to be crazy to still love this man, and yet ... some fragment of my soul did. I don\u2019t think it would ever be cut out. But I\u2019d keep trying.</p><p>He reached for me.</p><p>\u201cStay away.\u201d I punched him in the chest then in the shoulder, my fists like drum sticks hitting him over and over again. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Just leave.\u201d</p> <p>He held me by the shoulders, eyes never leaving my face, his expression calm as he let me assault him until I was exhausted. I closed my eyes and fell backward until I was sitting in the wet grass, chest heaving and fists throbbing.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flew open, and I raised my hand and slapped him across the face. The resounding sound echoed, and the palm of my hand stung like I\u2019d slapped a marble countertop as hard as I could. I didn\u2019t care. I wanted it to hurt. I needed the pain.</p><p>I made a strange moan in the back of my throat and went to slap him again, but this time he caught my wrist.</p><p>\u201cOnce I\u2019ll take. Not twice.\u201d</p><p>When I relaxed my arm, Logan let me go. He took off his jacket and tried to wrap it around me, but I pushed him away. His frown lowered and eyes darkened as he relented and threw it over the fence instead. And it was him yielding, because Logan did what he wanted, and if he chose to wrap a friggin\u2019 jacket around me he would.</p><p>I stared as the familiar crevices of his chest molded through his tight, wet T-shirt. Get a grip. He let me be tortured. He humiliated me.</p><p>I bit the inside of my cheeks until it was so painful that I remembered what I\u2019d suffered with Logan was a billion times more. \u201cYou left. I heard the motorcycle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put it in the garage, out of the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want it in my garage.\u201d</p><p>He ignored me. \u201cWe need to talk about this.\u201d He reached for my hand; his eyes were downcast and glassy, yet hard.</p><p>Emotions I\u2019d hidden away torpedoed to the surface. No. I don\u2019t want this.</p><p>I shot for the house, but Logan was a fighter, quick and agile. He ran after me then snagged my hand, swung me back around, and trapped me against a tree trunk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ... scared and angry, and you\u2019re entitled.\u201d He stared at me, and I remained frozen, droplets of rain sliding down my cheeks. \u201cEme, I\u2019m not here to take you away. I\u2019m here to tell you what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there, remember, I know exactly what went down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Eme, you don\u2019t.\u201d His eyes narrowed when I went to argue. I kept quiet. With Logan you learned when to pick your battles; this one wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cBelieving the shit you are right now is eating away at you.\u201d How did he know that? \u201cThe truth, Mouse. You have to hear the truth. I couldn\u2019t let Deck tell you anything until Raul was dead, it was too risky ... And I wanted to tell you myself.\u201d</p><p>I did realize that he helped me get out. It just wasn\u2019t enough to erase everything else.</p><p>His arms caged me in as he leaned forward, his chest inches from mine, water droplets glistening on his tanned skin. He leaned closer, and I turned my head to the side. A spark ignited as his breath hit my skin just below my ear. A deep throbbing within me weakened my resolve to beat him with my fists.</p><p>\u201cYou are not shutting me out like you\u2019ve done everyone else for the last two years.\u201d How did he know that too? His lips were so close to my skin that if I took a deep breath they\u2019d touch. Tears teetered-tottered on the edge of my lids.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d It was me begging, because I couldn\u2019t tell him no any other way.</p><p>He tucked my wet hair behind my ear. \u201cEme, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in air as his hand cupped my chin and brought my head forward to face him. I kept my eyes downcast, afraid to look at him and get lost within the chocolate depths. \u201cSculpt, you have to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever ask me to do that.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened and tightened my jaw as I ground out. \u201cNothing you say will make a difference. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking here.\u201d</p><p>Logan never asked. If I gave him this would he leave me alone? \u201cSay what you need to then I want you out of my life.\u201d</p><p>He drew back, but still I could feel his breath on my face. \u201cRaul\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stiffened and blurted out, \u201cThe man who had me waterboarded? Who dehumanizes girls? Who held a gun to my head? Are you referring to your fucking father?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed me by the shoulders. \u201cYes, Emily. Yes. He was my father, but I didn\u2019t choose him just like you didn\u2019t choose your mother.\u201d Okay, point, my mother was unkind and selfish who cared for nothing except her next drink. She didn\u2019t even know what had happened to me, not that she\u2019d care. \u201cDo you think I didn\u2019t want to shoot every single disgusting lowlife in there? Do you think I didn\u2019t want to shove that fuckin\u2019 gun down my father\u2019s throat and pull the goddamn trigger?\u201d I looked at my feet feeling vulnerable ... fine, I was feeling very vulnerable. Logan was always in control, and right now with his brows lowered, his jaw tight and his voice raised, Logan was losing that control.</p><p>\u201cEmily. Please. Look at me.\u201d I did. \u201cEverything that happened gutted me. I trained every morning to try and control the fury that was raging through me. So I didn\u2019t get you killed by screwing everything up. Damn it, Eme. I need you to look at me while I tell you this.\u201d I hadn\u2019t realized I was staring down again. Really, I was trying not to listen. I didn\u2019t want to hear what he was telling me. I\u2019d managed just fine believing what I did, and I couldn\u2019t handle changing it. \u201cI\u2019ve lived two years knowing you hate me.\u201d He shoved away from the tree, from me, and ran his hands through his soaking wet hair. \u201cTell me. What else was I supposed to do? I did everything I could to save you.\u201d</p><p>I lay my head back against the trunk of the tree and closed my eyes feeling sick to my stomach. I was confused and uncertain. His eyes were filled with this destructive blaze of anger that was ... could it be pain? Was it real pain? Or was it a front? More lies.</p><p>I shook my head back and forth. No. No. Logan had watched. He\u2019d done nothing. He\u2019d driven me across the country to his father\u2019s compound of hell. Why hadn\u2019t he killed Jacob instead of driving me three days to Mexico? Dave had been his friend, he could\u2019ve helped him. Why hadn\u2019t he just taken me someplace else to escape? He was a fighter; he could\u2019ve fought.</p><p>No. Logan was just as guilty as his father.</p><p>He walked back toward me and leaned forward, hands braced against the tree on either side of me. He put his finger under my chin and kept it there. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to run and hide. Forget he was ever here.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was Raul\u2019s slave for seventeen years.\u201d Oh God. My knees weakened at his words. I hadn\u2019t even thought of Logan\u2019s mother. \u201cShe became pregnant with me within a year of her capture. Raul wasn\u2019t happy about it until I was born a boy. Then he made plans for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fighting,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy mother tried to protect me from that shit you saw, Eme. But in a place like that, it wasn\u2019t easy. I met Dave, and we both trained since we were five years old for the ring. That\u2019s all we did. I can\u2019t remember much else besides hanging out with Dave and fighting. We did go to school, but no one would talk to us. I imagine that was because of Raul. No one wanted to mess with anything of his.</p><p>\u201cRaul had me in my first fight at twelve. I was gangly and hadn\u2019t bulked out, but I was agile and determined.\u201d He paused, and I felt his breath on my skin as he breathed in and out. \u201cI was never part of what you saw in the dining room, Mouse. Never. Raul didn\u2019t care that I wasn\u2019t, because he was focused on me fighting, and he didn\u2019t want girls clouding my focus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy mother, she kept me real. She taught me what she remembered of her life, values, morals, what was wrong about my father and the life I grew up in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she was taken?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p> <p>\u201cEighteen.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my head, and the rain hit the tip of my nose. God, that must have been terrifying and horrible, and she was there for so long, and here I was moaning about fifteen days.</p><p>\u201cMy mother had been planning to get us out for years. Finally an opportunity came, and she took it. We escaped.\u201d</p><p>I asked the question that I was afraid to ask. \u201cDid you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s all I knew. Despite the stories my mother told me, that place was where I spent sixteen years of my life.\u201d The back of his hand stroked my cheek, and I wanted to lean into it, instead I pulled away. \u201cStill, I hated that place. Every second of it. I fought to stay away from everything else, but I saw what went on there. The girls, the hurt, violence, the drugs.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother and I needed money after we escaped, so I continued the fighting, but I never liked it. I did what had to be done, Emily. That was one thing I learned to survive my father, determination and the will to do what you have to. Giving up doesn\u2019t exist for me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how he found me. He tracked fighting circuits, sending his men to look for me. Took him eight years, but word reached him about an undefeated Sculpt, and he showed up at one of my fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night I asked you to help me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you moved up your tour date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I had to leave. I had to get out of the fighting world, but it was too late. I thought once I refused to fight for him, he\u2019d leave it alone, and he did for a month or so. I should\u2019ve known better. Raul gets what he wants. And he wanted me fighting for him.\u201d He looked up and met my eyes. \u201cI would\u2019ve done it for however long he wanted me to if he\u2019d promised to leave you alone.\u201d</p> <p>My breath hitched. He couldn\u2019t do this to me. He couldn\u2019t make it better. I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle the truth.</p><p>He lowered his head while he ran his hand through his hair. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know him. He doesn\u2019t work that way. I knew that. Anyone who knows him does. He finds your weakness and destroys you with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was your weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and my mother. Raul had men on her, if I didn\u2019t show up with you in Mexico, she was to be killed and not just a gunshot to the head. Raul\u2019s kills are long, slow, and agonizing.\u201d That was why he never attempted to take off with me when we drove to Mexico. \u201cBefore I saw you, after you were taken by Alfonzo ... I contacted Deck. He was out of the country, but he dropped everything to come back. He told me what I had to do and what needed to go down. Deck managed to get my mother out from under Raul\u2019s men within four days.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized I was holding my breath until I let it go when he said that. He continued, \u201cThat\u2019s when I had to be really careful with how I treated you. Raul knew my mother was gone from his clutches and all he had was you for leverage. He didn\u2019t trust me, and I had to convince him that I was there because I wanted to fight and ... and that you meant nothing to me except a slave I wanted to fuck. If he knew how much I cared ... it was the only way to save you. I needed to give Deck time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell me? We were alone most of the time. You could have told me, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me this, Emily. If I\u2019d told you all this, would you have feared me? Would you have trembled? Would you have had that look of fear in your eyes?\u201d</p><p>I knew the answer. No. I would\u2019ve feared the place and Raul and Alfonzo, but I\u2019d always feel protected by Logan. But none of it really mattered, because I still felt like I\u2019d been ripped apart and was trying to put my pieces back together. \u201cI feel broken.\u201d</p> <p>His hand slipped into my hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix this.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to avoid his touch. \u201cSculpt.\u201d I saw him flinch when I avoided using his real name. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. We can\u2019t go back. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry ... God, what you grew up with, what happened to you and your mother ... it\u2019s horrible, unthinkable, but I ... Sculpt, I want to move on with my life, and you\u2019re a reminder of what I want to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it is what you had to do. But when I look at you now, I\u2019m not sure who I see, the man I fell in love with or the cold, expressionless man that watched me suffer and made me fear him.\u201d I took a deep breath and said the words I needed to say to save my already damaged heart. \u201cWhat I\u2019m sure of ... is that I\u2019m better without either one.\u201d</p><p>I turned, slipped under his arm, and ran through the raging rain. I heard him shouting my name and curse several times before I reached the house. I went into my room, shut the door and leaned up against it, my chest heaving in and out and my nerves shooting off like the Fourth of July.</p><p>After I caught my breath I took off my soaking wet breeches and shirt then dried myself off and slipped on jeans without even searching for underwear. I had no doubt Logan would come after me. My running would not deter him from finishing what he started. I grabbed my pink T-shirt from my bed and pulled it over my head just as the door swung open.</p><p>Logan stood in the doorway with his hands braced on either side. He looked determined and impenetrable. Water droplets fell off the tips of his hair, and his T-shirt was plastered to his broad, hard chest. There was no softness in his eyes; he was hard and determined with glistening moisture clinging to his skin.</p><p>He stole my breath away, and for a moment I couldn\u2019t move. It was his authority that made my body hyperaware. It was like this basic need in me begging to be fulfilled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m like him. Because I\u2019d have killed, murdered ... I would\u2019ve done it all if he\u2019d sold you. I\u2019d have done those things to get you back. Yes, I watched you being whipped, fondled, dragged away, knowing you were going to be tortured. And yes, my own father held a gun to your head and I had to walk away or risk him killing you, just to make a point.\u201d His hands tightened on the wood frame of the door. \u201cAnd I\u2019d do it again. Because there was no fuckin\u2019 way he was taking you from me. You get that, Emily? That\u2019s what this is about. I did what had to be done. You survived. And I\u2019m telling you right now, growing up with him, knowing what that shit was like, you wouldn\u2019t have survived being sold, and I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen. So, I did what I had to do, and so did you.\u201d</p><p>I sat on the bed, folding my trembling hands in my lap.</p><p>A tear slipped from its captivity, and I was furious at it. He didn\u2019t deserve my tears. \u201cI hate what you did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate what I pretended to be. You hate that I wasn\u2019t your knight in shining armor. You hate that I made you fear me. But don\u2019t run from the truth, Eme. You want to hide behind your Lego blocks and not take the chance at being vulnerable again. But the truth is you\u2019re more vulnerable now, because you are hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me this way. You made me vulnerable,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. You were strong as hell fighting Raul and Alfonzo. Shit, you held a gun to me.\u201d He walked toward me, and his hands ran up my arms then back down again. \u201cMouse, we can fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just broken, Sculpt. It\u2019s shattered.\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet, eyes meeting mine.</p><p>He watched me, and I continued to brush away the stupid tears that refused to stop.</p><p>\u201cThis. Us. It hurts too much.\u201d My words barely slipped from my mouth before he was lifting me up and kissing me. A slow, long kiss moving across my mouth like we\u2019d been melted together.</p><p>His hands came on either side of my head as his kiss grew harsher, his tongue slipping inside, his grip on me tightening. It was so fresh and raw, as if both of us had been starved for one another.</p><p>I tasted the salt of my tears on my tongue as his mouth took mine in a sweet urgency.</p><p>My body responded, remembering the taste of him, the feel of him against my skin, and it wanted more and that terrified me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pushed on his chest, and he backed away.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>A part of me, the side that was completely crazy for this guy, wanted to leap in his arms and devour him. But there was so much crippling anguish inside me. And I suspected him too. At his father, and himself. We were bound to destroy one another more than we were already. \u201cThis can\u2019t happen, Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry, baby.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head back and forth. \u201cI did. I hoped. I tried to believe you were the man I first met. But you snuffed that out every morning, and then when you let me go ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to be cruel, Eme. I was losing control, and I knew you saw it. You were beginning to have faith in me again. I needed you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why, damn it. Why didn\u2019t you just come with me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair and groaned. \u201cRaul ... wanted me. He used you to make sure he had me. So, it was imperative I stayed, so he wouldn\u2019t come after you.\u201d</p><p>I choked on my sob. I didn\u2019t want to believe him, yet I saw the truth like a flashing beacon in front of me. It was so much easier to bury the past than to have it plastered in front of me. And the reality was ... when I looked at Logan it hurt, and I didn\u2019t want hurt anymore.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened for several seconds, and I shifted under his intensity. A tremor of fear slithered through me, and I wrapped my arms around my chest like a shield.</p><p>He strode to the door and turned. I recognized the look, because I often had it in my eyes whenever I looked in the mirror\u2014torment. \u201cI won\u2019t walk away from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need time\u2014I get that. But I won\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay here. I live here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI own the fuckin\u2019 place, Emily. You\u2019ve been living on my farm for two years.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Kat found me an hour later sitting on the floor, leaning against the foot of my bed. Shock had settled in, and I felt as if I was buried under a sea of water. Too cold to react, numb and staring but not seeing.</p><p>Logan owned the farm. I\u2019d been living here for two years thinking ... But the puzzle fit; it made sense\u2014Matt bringing me here instead of the house in the city where the three of us had lived.</p><p>It had been their parents\u2019 house before they died in a drinking and driving accident\u2014their father was the driver and the drunk. He smashed into a cement bridge going ninety miles an hour.</p><p>Matt put the house on the market, a house I never thought he\u2019d sell. Not only that, he also put his bar up for sale. It took several months, but the house and bar sold, and Matt bought instead a condo downtown and the farm, at least I thought he had. With the sale of his old bar, he purchased a new one and named it Avalanche.</p><p>Had Logan told them to move? Or had it been Deck? Why did they listen? How did they occupy the farm so quickly? And how did Logan buy it when he was with me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat stood in the doorway. There were tears in her eyes. Kat never cried, not since we met when we were ten. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d And she never asked to come into my bedroom. She bounced in whenever it suited her.</p><p>I nodded, and she walked over and sat beside me, leaning against the bed, legs out, ankles crossed. She bowed her head and her short blonde hair swayed forward to cover her brilliant sea-blue eyes. She was a classic beauty; smooth and flawless skin, thin brows, and sharp features.</p><p>\u201cSculpt\u2019s gone.\u201d Of course if the farm belonged to Logan, Kat had known, and yet she\u2019d never said a word. \u201cWhen you disappeared that night ... God, Eme, it was like Armageddon.\u201d I could see her hands shaking. Kat was always steady and sure of herself, full of life, no regrets. Not now. Now she looked worried. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t come back from the bathroom that night, I got Matt. And then he called the police who weren\u2019t much help considering you\u2019re over eighteen, had been gone fifteen minutes, and we were at a bar. Matt lost it. He went right up on stage in the middle of the band jamming and shut it down. Everything. Closed the bar. When Sculpt found out ... he lost it. When his phone rang, his face ... as he listened ... it went so pale.</p><p>I was terrified. Fuck, it scared the shit out of all of us. Sculpt talked to Kite, and then he threw his guitar over the edge of the stage, broke it in half. He was ... Jesus, he was angry ... and scared, Emily. It was just a hint of it, but I swear he was scared. I didn\u2019t think a man like him ... I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d see something so raw and exposed in him.\u201d I pulled my knees up to my chest and lay my cheek on them. Tears began to leak from my eyes as I fought the feelings I was having at picturing Logan like that.</p> <p>\u201cHe knew Emily. He knew what happened to you. We weren\u2019t to tell the police anything otherwise your life ... He said if we did we\u2019d never see you again. So we didn\u2019t. He promised to bring you back. And then there was a mad rush to get hold of Georgie. She was the only one who had Deck\u2019s emergency number. Sculpt left that night. I hadn\u2019t seen him ... until today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d Matt sell the bar, Kat? And the house? It was your parents\u2019 house. Why are you ... Why are we living on a farm that belongs to Sculpt?\u201d</p><p>Kat reached over and took my hand. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you ... you know that, right? Matt would too. You\u2019re our family, Emily.\u201d She squeezed my hand. \u201cKite told us about Sculpt\u2019s dad. The sex trafficking.\u201d</p><p>Tears fell faster as I thought of the girls I\u2019d left behind, the girl with Kai who was so destroyed I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever come back from the abuse she\u2019d suffered. I\u2019d tried to forget them when ... when maybe they weren\u2019t to be forgotten.</p><p>\u201cKite told us that if Sculpt ... no, when Sculpt got you out, you couldn\u2019t go home. That you needed to start a new life somewhere else in case ... in case the plan failed, and Sculpt\u2019s father tried to come back for you.\u201d She shuffled closer so our shoulders touched. \u201cEverything Matt and I own is now under my grandmother\u2019s name, so Raul couldn\u2019t link it to you. Or at least not as easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt bought it under a numbered company he has with Kite. I don\u2019t know when that was set up or why, but Sculpt emptied out his account the day he left, gave everything to Kite and told him to buy a farm in the company\u2019s name that had room for horses and immediate occupancy. He gave up the tour money. All of it, to buy the farm.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Logan. No. His dream. For ... for my dream.</p><p>Kat paused, and I raised my head to look at her. There were tears streaming down her face, her black mascara leaking lines onto her cheeks. \u201cI wanted to tell you. But when Matt brought you back, you were so angry and hurt, and then you were ... you were a zombie, Emily. Matt and I tried to talk to you, but it was like talking to a stone wall. You wanted to forget. So, after a while we let you.\u201d</p><p>I lived in a dark hole for months, and it wasn\u2019t the therapy that brought me back, it was the horses. Kat made me come to the barn and help her offload six horses from the trailer. Horses that were so skinny their heads sunk in and their spines stuck out. Their coats so dull that you couldn\u2019t even tell what their real colors were. But the worst ... the worst was the look in their eyes. I knew that look so well. I\u2019d seen it in Kai\u2019s girl. Their eyes were dead. Glassed-over and dead. Their spirit ... It was gone\u2014broken.</p><p>That was the day I began to fight to put myself back together. The horses and I rebuilt our trust and refilled the light in our eyes. The horses started to gallop in the fields, and I began to laugh. It was also when I decided that I\u2019d stop living and hiding under Matt and Kat and earn enough to buy my own place and build a cliental helping others with their horses.</p> <p>\u201cKite asked us never to tell you Sculpt and him owned the farm. He said you\u2019d leave and you needed to stay.\u201d Yeah, I probably would have. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know if we were wrong to not tell you, but when those horses came ... Emily, you came alive, and Matt and I knew it was the right thing. You belonged here. And damn it, I did too. Never thought I\u2019d like shoveling shit, but the horses are amazing, and ever since I started painting them, the demand for my work has tripled. Who would\u2019ve thought we\u2019d both be living our dreams doing what we love.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. In the short time they\u2019d been here, Kat was learning to ride and was often out fixing fences and repairing the tractor. She was also selling her art work in three galleries in the city.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been the only one who suffered. Matt and Kat had too. I\u2019d put them through months of not speaking, the unwillingness to continue therapy even though I probably needed it. They stood by me and were there for me, never once telling me to stop hiding, to stop hating Logan, to stop feeling sorry for myself. No, they\u2019d just accepted who I\u2019d become and embraced it.</p><p>\u201cWas it Sculpt\u2019s idea to bring in the abused horses?\u201d Of course it had to have been. I\u2019d told him my dream of having my own horse farm and helping abused horses, and now I was living it. I felt sick to my stomach at how much I\u2019d loathed him, and he\u2019d ... he\u2019d given me my dream and taken away his. I made good money helping people with their horses. He\u2019d given me that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing, but I don\u2019t know for sure. None of us heard from Sculpt for months after you came back. Not even Kite. Deck went back down to Mexico, and this time he was gone a while. Don\u2019t know what happened, but when Deck came back Sculpt wasn\u2019t with him.\u201d Kat laid her hand on top of mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Emily. God, I wish I could take away what happened to both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happened there?\u201d I could feel my chest tightening and the panic begin to creep into my veins at the thought of telling Kat.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. Not really. I just know when Matt brought you home you were so broken and hurt. I could see the anger behind your pain. I love you. Matt and I would do anything for you.\u201d Her voice quieted. \u201cSculpt ... I know you hate him, but now that you know the truth maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat. God, he ... he did everything to get me out, but I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She lowered her head and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t forget. I get it. He did it to protect me. He got me out. And I guess ... He was a victim too. But the memories when I see him ... They\u2019re too much of who he became.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever want to ... Shit, Emily, I know you don\u2019t want to go back to a therapist, but if you need to talk, I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cKat, you\u2019re a horrible listener\u2014you\u2019re way too impatient.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, you and Matt mean the world to me. You\u2019re my family. After what happened ... you gave me time to heal. Yeah, I hate finding out Sculpt owns the farm. It makes me feel ...\u201d Guilty, maybe. He\u2019d given up his tour money so that I\u2019d have a place to live and be safe from his father. \u201cKat, you and Matt gave up everything for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hate to say this but, so did Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched. I looked at her, and my insides twisted as if she\u2019d just punched me in the stomach. She was right. He had. But she had no idea that Logan watched me being dragged away to be tortured. The worst was when Raul held the gun to my head and I heard his feet shift, and then ... he left me there.</p><p>In my head I knew the truth of why he had to do it that way, but I couldn\u2019t let him in again. The trust. The laughter. All that had been good between us, it was tainted.</p><p>A second chance ... there wasn\u2019t one for us.</p><p>Kat stood and placed her hands on her hips staring down at me. \u201cI need a drink. You need a drink. Lots of drinks. And I\u2019m sure Georgie needs lots of drinks, so we\u2019re going to Avalanche tonight.\u201d</p><p>I really didn\u2019t feel like dancing or socializing, but staying here wondering if Logan was coming back was the last thing I wanted to do. I needed to numb out the plague that was running through my head.</p><p>Kat went into action as she pulled open the closet doors and started tossing clothes out onto the bed. \u201cGo put your makeup on. I\u2019m picking you out something to wear. We\u2019re looking extra hot tonight.\u201d</p><p>What I wanted was a bottle of wine and to plop down in front of the TV. I walked into the bathroom and stared at myself for a long time in the mirror, unable to see who was looking back at me\u2014the girl broken and lost to a man she fell in love with or a woman who learned to survive with a broken heart. Maybe I was a little of both.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Brett was serving like a champion, pouring three drinks at once while taking cash and using his hip to close the cash register. I waited patiently to catch his attention. I was in no hurry, Kat and I had been dancing for an hour already, and I needed a break and another shot. We\u2019d chugged back three tequilas when we arrived, and I was due for another.</p><p>A hand slammed down in front of me. \u201cEmily, been a while. Where\u2019ve you been, hot stuff?\u201d</p><p>For all the commotion, Brett looked damn calm. His blue eyes flickered with amusement as he poured a Stella from the bar tap and slid it down the bar, all the while his attention never wavered from me.</p><p>\u201cStill recovering from our last night out.\u201d Kat and I were here a couple weeks ago, and the tequila shots didn\u2019t sit so well the next day, especially when having to ride Havoc and working with four rescue horses. We made it a habit to come to the bar twice a month and stay at the condo, so we could see Matt. Matt was so busy with Avalanche that we rarely saw him now. We\u2019d also go see Georgie who recently wasn\u2019t making it out to the farm as often to see us.</p><p>\u201cSo, you saying no more tequila tonight, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head and raised my brows. Brett laughed and poured me a shot. He was nearly always serving at Avalanche. Kat swore Brett only worked there to pick up chicks, as during the day he was a real estate tycoon. It was hard to imagine the blond with the unruly curls and dashing blue eyes wearing a business suit.</p><p>I put down a twenty. \u201cNice try, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tip.\u201d Matt insisted we get our drinks for free, but I still tried to pay whenever I was here. The bar was kind of like therapy for me, being around men, dancing and losing myself to the music. The first dozen times we\u2019d come here it had been disastrous. The second I felt a man near me I felt the fear, the terror that I\u2019d be kidnapped and then forced into that world again. I\u2019d have given up if Kat hadn\u2019t continued to push me to come back again and again. We\u2019d dance and she\u2019d keep close to me and talk to me or sing and make me laugh. Slowly over time the terror lessoned until I began looking forward to going out and dancing again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t need the money. Where\u2019s Kat?\u201d</p><p>I gestured to the dance floor, and Brett glanced over then rolled his eyes and shook his head which unleashed a curl that dangled in front of his face. I followed his gaze and saw Kat rubbing erotically against some guy, his hands up under her shirt.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to land herself in deep one of these times. And I\u2019m betting it\u2019ll be tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I asked. Kat was always a flirt, but there was something in the way she treated men that I thought was different in the last couple years. It wasn\u2019t like she enjoyed their attention, although she certainly looked like she did. It was more ... like she needed it and yet hated it at the same time.</p> <p>Brett shrugged while pouring a rum and Coke. He plopped a lime in it then slid it to a young guy a few seats away from me. \u201cJust a feelin\u2019 is all.\u201d</p><p>I noticed he was still watching Kat. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you date her?\u201d</p><p>Brett threw his head back and laughed. \u201cNot touching that sweet ass. Number one, don\u2019t want or need a relationship. Number two, overprotective brother, and number three, she belongs to Ream. And he\u2019s back. I\u2019d like to keep my teeth.\u201d What? Ream? The guy from Logan\u2019s old band? I\u2019d never met him, but had heard his name when I researched Logan on the Internet back when we met and Logan had mentioned Ream was a friend of Deck\u2019s.</p><p>Brett leaned forward, propping his elbows on the bar. \u201cBetter keep a close eye on your girl tonight. She stirs up too much trouble with Ream here ... He won\u2019t like it. Don\u2019t think she even knows he\u2019s back yet. The band has kept it hush-hush.\u201d The band used to have a large fan base in Toronto a few years ago, but she\u2019d thought they\u2019d stopped playing when Logan went to Mexico. Maybe they\u2019d found a new lead singer. Brett took another order and moved down the bar.</p><p>Before I had a chance to ask, Kat bumped me with her hip and grabbed the guy\u2019s beer next to us and chugged half of it. She ran her finger down his shoulder as he stared at her open mouthed. \u201cThanks, babe.\u201d Her voice was sultry and sweet, and it was enough to have the guy drooling instead of complaining.</p> <p>\u201cReam? You\u2019ve been seeing Ream?\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s face fell for a brief second before she covered it up with a half-smile. \u201cWe hooked up, Emily\u2014briefly, really brief, like not-even-worth-mentioning brief. When you and Sculpt ... Well, when you were gone he was around. Helped out, you know with moving to the farm and shit. I was upset, and he listened. Then you came back; I wasn\u2019t freaking anymore, and we hooked up then unhooked. End of story.\u201d She threw her arm over my shoulders. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s dance. It\u2019s lonely out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat? Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, Eme. Besides, you didn\u2019t want to talk about anything to do with Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>She was right. I would\u2019ve freaked if she\u2019d mentioned Logan or anything to do with Logan. \u201cDid you sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>I knew immediately she had, because she completely ignored me and started jumping up and down dancing. Kat handled problems like a kid. You know when a parent is telling their kid to stop doing something or to put their toys away and the kid just sits their pretending not to hear them, but you know damn well he or she does? That was Kat.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, missy, we need to let loose tonight,\u201d Kat grabbed my hand and yanked me through the crowd to the dance floor.</p><p>I liked to dance, and I was good at it. I could close my eyes and let myself go. The music thrived in me, and my body moved easily to the beat. Kat was more of a wild dancer, jumping around, swinging her arms and singing out loud. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to draw attention the slinky, red dress certainly did.</p><p>My eyes closed as my body moved back and forth, hips swaying, hands sliding up and down my sides as I lost myself to Avicii\u2019s new song. Heat surged into my back and I was about to turn around when hands settled on my hips. It wasn\u2019t unusual to have a guy come up behind and start dancing with you, and if he could dance and didn\u2019t push the boundaries then I was okay with it\u2014well that was a lie. I still felt uncomfortable, but the images of what happened at Raul\u2019s dining hall had faded and I no longer freaked out when a guy touched me from behind thinking he\u2019d suddenly strip me down.</p><p>His thighs brushed against me as he moved closer, placing his hands on top of mine and sliding them up the curve of my hips to my ribs then back down again to my thighs. I bit the inside of my cheek to stop from pushing him away. I could do this. This was my therapy, my way to convince myself that I was getting over what happened. I used to dance with strange guys all the time, but that was before Mexico. Now the feeling of a strange man against me so intimately was constricting, suffocating.</p><p>The guy pressed closer, his chest against my back as we moved in perfect rhythm to the beat. I could smell the alcohol on him as he leaned in, his heated breath sweeping across my bare neck. My stomach churned, and I swallowed back the bile.</p><p>I needed this, damn it. Logan coming into my life again had put me back down into a feeling of uncertainty and confusion. I just wanted to feel confident and free of all the emotions that came with Logan.</p><p>His finger pushed aside my hair so that it lay over my shoulder, and then his hands went back to my hips. When his tongue touched the tip of my ear I jerked away, but his hands were ready, and he tugged back.</p><p>\u201cTease,\u201d he slurred and chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d My heart rate tripled as I struggled to escape his arms. \u201cStop. No.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, his hands were torn from me and I whirled around to see Logan shoving the guy backward.</p><p>\u201cHey. Fuck, man.\u201d</p><p>That was the last word my dance partner got out before Logan hauled off and punched the guy in the face.</p><p>He went flying through the crowd landing on his back on the tiled floor. Logan stalked toward him his face red, lips pressed together, eyes narrowed, and brows drawn over them. Oh, God, Logan looked like he was going to kill him. And he could. Logan was a fighter; his hands were weapons and ...</p><p>\u201cSculpt, no,\u201d I shouted as he picked the guy up by the front of the shirt. I frantically shoved through the onlookers, forcing my way to him. My hands yanked at his arm. \u201cLet him go. Sculpt.\u201d He\u2019d kill him. I\u2019d never seen this side of Logan. Even when he was in the ring, he\u2019d been in complete control. This was out of control and so unlike him. \u201cLogan, please.\u201d</p><p>The use of his real name seemed to work as Logan turned toward me. I gasped when I saw the steel, cold look in his eyes. He looked dominant, unyielding and furious.</p><p>He dropped my dance partner to the floor. Three security guys pushed forward and picked up my dance partner taking him away, but I kept my focus on Logan.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Logan grabbed my hand and pulled me through the gawking crowd to the bar. He pushed up the bar flap, then slammed his palm into the swinging back door then dragged me halfway down the hall. He stopped, backed me into the wall, and then trapped me, his hands over my head, him towering over me.</p><p>\u201cLogan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He abruptly cut me off. I jumped, and he noticed. It was then I saw the fury slowly dissipate from his eyes. The lines around his mouth eased, and he drew in a deep breath. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not seeing that asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he didn\u2019t deserve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had his tongue in your fuckin\u2019 ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d Well, not technically anyway, but even if he did, the guy certainly didn\u2019t merit a fist to his face for it. \u201cAnd even if he had, it has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fuckin\u2019 does, Eme. I didn\u2019t wait two years to get to you only to watch some dick with his hands and tongue all over you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. He\u2019d lost it. Mr. Cool and Calm had literally blown a gasket. He was always in control of his emotions, even before Mexico. He\u2019d hid them well, except maybe his desire. \u201cSculpt, I was dancing. With a guy. It wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d But it was. God, it was, because I hated a stranger\u2019s hands on me. \u201cI can dance with whoever I want.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed me by the shoulders and leaned in, his eyes dark, pulse throbbing in his neck. \u201cNot while I\u2019m still breathing, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>We stared at one another, emotions rocketing with anger, and yes, there was desire. We\u2019d always had that between us, and even years later it pulsated.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being like this?\u201d I tried to keep my voice steady, but it quaked under his intensity, and Logan knew how to do intensity. \u201cWhat right do you have to come here and start punching a guy I\u2019m dancing with?\u201d</p><p>He growled then backed away while running his hand through his hair before he came back and cupped my chin. \u201cMouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>A quiet calm came over him. I saw the change as if a shield lowered. I\u2019d recognize that familiar coldness anywhere. \u201cI will smash through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmash through what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Legos, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>Kat came careening through the door. \u201cShit, there you are. Sculpt, what was that? Matt\u2019s furious. That guy you punched wants to press charges.\u201d</p><p>Logan pushed away from the wall and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cEveryone saw what you did. Matt is trying to calm him down, luckily you didn\u2019t break anything. Otherwise the police would have to be called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt!\u201d A guy yelled. I looked down the hall and saw three guys coming out of a back room. \u201cWe\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Coming.\u201d Logan chin-lifted to them and then turned back to me. His expression softened, and I felt myself melt just that tiny bit.</p><p>Logan being here was making my resolve to keep my emotions under control to fail miserably. His fingers slid across my collar bone back and forth, soft and slow.</p><p>\u201cYou still play?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He moved in. My butterflies I hadn\u2019t felt in two years started to cheer when a slow smile formed lighting up his eyes. God, why did he have to smile? When he smiled like this I saw the man I fell in love. It plowed over me, and I felt everything he\u2019d once meant to me.</p><p>The back of his hand brushed across my cheek. It was a fleeting moment, but still it sucked the breath right out of me. I put it off to the alcohol, but I knew Logan could make my body lose itself to him with a mere touch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re called Tear Asunder now.\u201d He ran his finger over the cleft on my chin. \u201cWe\u2019re finally touring.\u201d</p><p>This time my breath did leave as I stared. His dream. All those days we\u2019d spent sitting in the horse fields, him with his guitar, me watching the horses. \u201cThe band is still together?\u201d With everything that had happened, he was still following his dream. Logan never let anything stop him; he was determined and relentless. It was one the reason I\u2019d been attracted to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Eme. I needed to do something to keep from coming for you.\u201d He leaned in so close that his mouth touched my neck just below my ear. \u201cGod, you smell the same.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLet me in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Memories like ours lived with you forever, and I\u2019d managed to numb them out. Now, with Logan back, they hit full force. \u201cSculpt, you gave me my dream. I ... I can\u2019t even find words to tell you what that did for me after ...\u201d I closed my eyes and felt him stiffen. \u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d The words were soft, and I didn\u2019t even know if he heard me.</p><p>Kat cleared her throat, and it took him a second before he moved away and turned to Kat and said, \u201cMatt reserved a table for you both near the stage.\u201d Then he looked at me again. \u201cStay and hear me sing, Eme.\u201d He paused briefly as if waiting for a response from me, then turned and strode down the hall, and disappeared around the corner.</p><p>\u201cShit. What was that?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>I needed escape. Fast. With tequila in my blood and my head filled with Ping-Pong balls smashing around, I was a mess. I had to get out of here. Away from him and what he could do to me.</p> <p>\u201cKat. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>Kat took my hands in hers. \u201cYou\u2019re emotionally fucked up. I get it, and this is my fault. If I\u2019d known they were here, I\u2019d have never suggested we come. I didn\u2019t even know the whole band was in town. Come on. Let\u2019s go before they rock the stage.\u201d</p><p>Logan playing the guitar and singing was the last thing I wanted to see. I knew what he could do to me with his voice. He could wrap me up inside him with a pretty little bow and then with one pull unravel me into his arms. \u201cYou stay. Hang with Matt, calm him down. I\u2019ll grab a cab.\u201d Since we\u2019d decided to stay at the condo tonight, which we usually did on our nights out, it was only a ten-minute cab ride.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her hands. \u201cKat. You\u2019re my bestie, I love you, but I need some time ... Sculpt ...\u201d Fuck. How did I say that I just wanted to be alone?</p> <p>\u201cLet me call Deck. He can take you to the condo and hang with you for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat. No.\u201d Deck wasn\u2019t a babysitter. Jesus, the guy had been part of the most elite task force for counter terrorism.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and I tried my best to give her a half-smile. She nodded. \u201cYou want to be alone and don\u2019t want anyone pestering you.\u201d I nodded. God, she knew me too well. \u201cFine, but I don\u2019t like it. And text me as soon as you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Georgie I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll see her tomorrow for brunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgie hasn\u2019t even left her place yet. She texted me ten minutes ago, said Deck stopped in to check in on her.\u201d Kat lowered her voice. \u201cHer words, Emily, \u2018Deck needs a fucking army of red ants shoved up his ass.\u2019 Then she told me she had to go change her outfit. I swear Deck should just fuck her and get it out of both their systems.\u201d</p><p>I liked Deck, but I suspected he was the type who needed complete control and Georgie ... Georgie letting a guy like Deck tell her what to do ... well, that was an explosive overload.</p> <p>We weaved our way through the crowd. I had just ducked under a guy\u2019s arm when I heard him speak into the microphone.</p><p>I sucked in air, closed my eyes, and stopped dead. I knew without looking it was his voice. It made my pulse leap and my stomach drop as if I was in a free fall. It felt like his words were drawing across my skin.</p><p>Logan.</p><p>I slowly turned and saw him on stage.</p><p>I was locked on him.</p><p>His presence was captivating. He dominated as if nothing could touch him up there. He was sexy with his half-smile and messy hair yet still dangerous and unapproachable.</p><p>God, he was confident, always had been, and now looking up at him on stage I realized that this was where he belonged. Not in the ring beating his opponent to a bloody pulp, but up there with a guitar slung over his shoulder.</p><p>I knew why this band without even singing a single note would hit the big time. Him. Logan. His magnificence on stage drew you to him. That ease in his stance, how he held the microphone as if he was holding a woman in his arms.</p> <p>Jealousy bit a chunk out of me as I thought of Logan with another woman. It was a lead weight in my stomach, and I never wanted to picture him with his arm slung over a girl again.</p><p>As he spoke to the crowd, I was mesmerized ... lost to the sound of his voice that trickled down my spine and heated my entire body. If felt like he was next to me, his breath wafting over my ear, his hand pressed to the small of my back. Oh God, he was in me.</p><p>\u201cDamn, he looks smoking. Matt told me they\u2019ve been touring small-time gigs for almost a year and just got noticed by some manager who\u2019s taking them on,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Yeah, they were going to be big. I\u2019d known that since the day I first heard Logan sing. And listening to him sing tonight would undo me like it had before.</p><p>Did he think he was absolved because he let me go? Because he gave up his tour money? Because he did it to protect me? Because he was a victim of Raul too?</p><p>Yes. God, yes. He did deserve forgiveness, but I couldn\u2019t forget the image of him looking so cold and heartless at me. Was that inside him? Was there a part of him that could walk away if someone held a gun to my head?</p><p>I remembered him staring at me, expressionless, as I fell to my knees after being whipped. He watched it happen. He let it happen.</p><p>But Logan had saved me. Logically I knew that, but finding that trust again ... it was like reaching for an apple too high up in the tree.</p><p>Logan said something to the crowd, and then he laughed. It was the most magical sight. Logan rarely laughed, but when he did it was captivating. I couldn\u2019t look away from his bright smile, his sexy bedroom eyes. I swear I could hear the women in the bar moan, and I was among them.</p><p>I was about to uproot my feet and stop gawking at the man who made my body ignite when he found me.</p><p>He found me with his eyes and didn\u2019t let go. He was still talking to the crowd, but his eyes remained on me. His smile was gone, and even from a hundred feet away I noticed his hand tighten on the microphone.</p><p>Then he stopped talking and just stared.</p><p>My heart pounded at its cage. My blood pumped so quickly through my veins I thought I might combust. Logan was caressing me with his eyes and pulling at me to run to him.</p><p>And I did run\u2014in the opposite direction\u2014pushing my way through the crowd, ignoring Kat\u2019s shouts. I was out the door before Logan sang his first note.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>I woke to Kat jumping onto the bed.</p><p>Kat landed on her stomach beside me, alcohol wafting off her skin. Her face was flushed, and she was smiling ear to ear. I groaned, flinging my arm over my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cTwo. Nope, hmm, maybe fourishy. And you need to get up.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the duvet up over my shoulders and turned on my side. \u201cKat. Four in the morning? Not a chance. I have Georgie\u2019s brunch tomorrow morning then five horses to ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow, and you really need to get up.\u201d She yanked on the covers.</p><p>\u201cKat, seriously. Whatever it is can wait til morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. It can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I groaned and pried open my eyes. \u201cHope I\u2019m waking up to some hot story about you and that guy Ream.\u201d</p><p>Kat barked out, \u201cBah. Fantasy fuck denied. Nope. Ream won\u2019t touch me with a thousand-foot pole. Actually, when he saw me tonight, he looked ill, then he walked away. So, I partied with Crisis. Jesus, that guy is crude, but hilarious. Man-whore and totally fuckable.\u201d She put her finger to her lips. \u201cWhy did I come in ...? Oh yeah, your man is here.\u201d</p><p>I bolted up. \u201cWhat?\u201d Holy shit. Oh my God. At the condo? \u201cWhat? You mean here? In the condo here? Or downstairs and wants buzzed up?\u201d</p><p>Obviously drunk and unconcerned over my panic, Kat shrugged. \u201cIn the kitchen here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I repeated then pressed my head into the pillow mumbling every swear word I could think of.</p><p>Kat fluffed her pillow and plopped her head down, closing her eyes. \u201cI think he\u2019s hurt you didn\u2019t stay for the show. I saw him looking for you while he sang. He looked sad. Shit, I\u2019m drunk.\u201d She moaned and curled onto her side. \u201cI tried to stop him from coming here, but ... I\u2019m drunk, and well ... even when I punched him and told him you wanted nothing to do with him ... he kept coming. Did you know that he has abs like a damn brick house? Shit. Yeah, of course you do. I think I broke my hand punching him.\u201d She lifted it up then let it flop back down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t break your hand.\u201d</p><p>Kat mumbled something unintelligible. I think it was some sort of apology.</p><p>I heard a cupboard closing and then the fridge opening and closing. Then the sound of something being poured into a glass. He was here. Logan was in the kitchen. I shoved the covers aside, shaking my head at the passed-out Kat sprawled face first on my bed, her hands and legs spread-eagle.</p><p>Logan looked up the moment I appeared. It was an open-concept condo, and the only walls that existed surrounded the bathrooms and three bedrooms.</p><p>Time was in slow motion. His eyes started at my face, dipping down my body to my bare feet then back up again to meet my eyes. He leaned back against the counter and took a sip of his orange juice. A wave of desire hit me as I remembered him leaning against his truck eating ice cream and looking so ... so sexy. Like nothing in the world could touch him. I didn\u2019t know why, but his confidence was a huge turn on for me.</p><p>Suddenly I felt naked in my pink flowered boxer shorts and white camisole. His eyes taking me in, it felt like his fingertips were reading brail across my flesh.</p><p>But anger could undo my embarrassment, and it did as I stopped a few inches away and glared. \u201cNot cool, you being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot cool, you taking off alone at midnight, drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t drunk exa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drink four tequila shots?\u201d</p><p>How did he know that? \u201cWell, yeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were drunk. You should\u2019ve had Kat or Matt bring you back here, Eme.\u201d He set his orange juice on the counter, and the sound made my pulse jump. His eyes remained on me, never once wavering. It\u2019s what he did well. He could make someone quiver in fear without even opening his mouth.</p><p>He nodded toward the bedroom. \u201cKat?\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cWhat do you think? Passed out. It\u2019s four in the morning, and she\u2019s drunk as a beaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaver.\u201d He frowned as he thought about it. \u201cYour dad used to say that about your mom.\u201d</p><p>He remembered. I\u2019d told him that one afternoon while we sat and had ice cream on the way back from the horses. My dad said beaver, because my mom used to move shit around in the house whenever she got drunk. I told Logan how my father tried to help my mom get sober, but then he got lung cancer and within six months he was gone. I\u2019d been ten years old, and he died around the same time Kat and Matt lost their parents. I think that\u2019s why we all connected so well. We needed one another. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you run, Mouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have horses to ride tomorrow ... today and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop biting the inside of your cheeks and tell me the truth. Why\u2019d you run?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. I so wasn\u2019t ready for this conversation. He didn\u2019t deserve to know that his voice lit me up like a firecracker, that staring up at him on stage undid me, and I couldn\u2019t control the want inside me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Logan did something I hadn\u2019t been prepared for. He snagged my hand, jerked me up against him, and caressed my hair. \u201cI like the bed look. And the pink boxers ...\u201d He trapped my hand behind my back. \u201cLiking those too.\u201d</p><p>Anger, where are you? This guy hurt me. He shredded every single part of my dignity and stomped on it. But Logan\u2019s words were erotic. Sensual. Just like when he was up on stage. It reminded me of how he was before. He wove through me, made my body sing. Logan was in my kitchen drinking my orange juice at four in the morning, and for a second I wanted him here.</p><p>\u201cSculpt. Let me go.\u201d That was all I could come up with; chicken.</p><p>\u201cYou left a bar alone looking beautiful and drunk. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSculpt\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted, his voice hard and unrelenting \u201cNo, Emily. Matt should know better. You don\u2019t take drinks from guys, never leave a drink unattended, go to the bathroom in pairs, and never fuckin\u2019 go home alone drunk. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? He pops back into my life after two years, stirs up the past, blows up everything I thought about him, and then makes demands of me?</p><p>\u201cI see the Legos building. Stop thinking, and promise me you\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d</p><p>Okay, it was a little stupid. Drunk and cabbing it home alone was not smart, and despite wanting to tell him off, I nodded. Because fighting him on this was just making it harder on myself when all I could think about was him kissing me.</p> <p>Shit, I seriously needed a loony bin.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to hear us play, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear you play.\u201d There was no chance I was going to torture myself listening to him sing. \u201cYou have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d His free hand came up and traced the curve of my neck. I swallowed. He watched. \u201cGive us a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLog ... Sculpt, please ... don\u2019t.\u201d I pushed his hand off my neck then stepped back so I could take one breath without having to breathe in his delicious scent. He wasn\u2019t going to leave, and I needed him to\u2014fast.</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>I could hear the slow drip of the tap in the kitchen sink. Drip. Drip. Drip. It was driving me mad, and I was quickly becoming unravelled as he just stood there not saying anything.</p><p>Damn it. I strode over to the kitchen sink and pushed the tap all the way down.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>My hands gripped the edge of the counter as I kept my back to him, and if my fingernails could penetrate marble they\u2019d be indented into the stone.</p><p>He moved behind me, his hands running down my naked arms until they were resting on top of mine. His hard chest leaned into me so I was pressed into the counter, no escape. No place to run.</p><p>\u201cMouse,\u201d he whispered in my ear, his breath like a warm breeze caressing my skin. \u201cDon\u2019t let him win.\u201d His fingers forced mine apart so our hands could interlock. It was intimate, way too intimate.</p><p>\u201cYou wrecked me.\u201d I barely recognized my ragged whisper as my voice. \u201cI was scared of you. I ... I still am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Jesus, I know.\u201d His thighs were hard against mine; his groin pressed into my ass. \u201cI will always do everything I can to protect you from others hurting you. I don\u2019t want you to be scared of me. I would do anything for you. You know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>A small part of me wanted to believe him, but mostly I didn\u2019t. \u201cI was weak, and I hate myself for it.\u201d</p><p>He swore beneath his breath then pushed off the counter, and I instantly felt the coldness seep into my veins. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest woman I know. But baby, you need to forgive yourself. Your body knew what your heart and mind didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That it was okay to be fucked by you? To forgive myself for enjoying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave in to you. I begged. I knelt on the floor and called you Master.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed briefly and he took a deep breath. The outer corners of his lips pulled down and the darkness in his eyes, it was gone. Instead, I saw vulnerability. \u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly then ran his hand through his hair. \u201cYou submitted to me, in order to survive. If you hadn\u2019t, you would\u2019ve died or, worse, been sold. That is strength, Emily. I ... I did everything I could to protect you. But bad shit happens. Sometimes, it can\u2019t be stopped. I couldn\u2019t stop it, baby.\u201d He shifted his weight and the floorboards creaked. \u201cJesus, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, feeling the tears well up in my eyes. How could four little words make me want to run into his arms? No. I was stronger now. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t say the same.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and I saw the tightening of his face as if he winced at my words. \u201cEme, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>His words felt like a slap in the face. Jesus. What the hell was wrong with me? I wanted him gone. I needed him gone. Why was every part of me screaming like a five-year-old not getting her way?</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have looked at him, but I did anyway and turned around. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d As soon as I said it, I wanted to take it back. It wasn\u2019t good; well, it was, but it wasn\u2019t. God ... I was more screwed up than I thought.</p><p>That cold expression I knew intimately was back. It was so controlled that for a second I felt that familiar fear. I mean, I didn\u2019t really know him did I? Tonight was a good example when he beat up that guy for dancing with me. I never thought he\u2019d lose control like that.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. His hands clenched; his body grew tight. And he still looked hot. My body should be sick with disgust. I should be screaming my head off to get him away from me; instead I wanted to scream at him to touch me.</p><p>\u201cWhat we had, we can\u2019t get back, Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can, \u2019cause it never fuckin\u2019 left.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. My chest rose and fell unevenly, heavily, and I knew my nipples had to be showing through my snug camisole, although he wasn\u2019t looking there. No, his gaze never left my face\u2014again. It was unnerving. Unsettling.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Eme. I don\u2019t know what to do. Tell me what to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my head. There was nothing he could do. I didn\u2019t have it in me to go through this with him again. To take a chance and then be wrecked apart. \u201cDo nothing, Sculpt. That\u2019s what you should do.\u201d</p><p>He swung away then strode to the door and flung it open.</p><p>He was pissed, and yeah, I saw how much I hurt him. Logan may be hard and confident, but tonight I saw more of him. I saw him hurting. But I didn\u2019t trust him any longer.</p><p>He turned back around just as I was being stupid enough to admire his ass in his faded blue jeans. He caught me staring, and I felt my cheeks turn beet red, and I quickly looked at my feet.</p><p>I heard his boots on the hardwood floor come closer, and I gasped as he grabbed my chin. \u201cLook at me.\u201d His thumb rhythmically stroked across the cleft in my chin. \u201cJust... please give us a chance.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my eyes from his, and his hand fell away from my chin.</p><p>He moved in closer and his voice lowered to barely a whisper. \u201cEme. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Logan let me go, turned and walked out the door.</p><p>I collapsed onto the kitchen floor and began breathing again. Logan just ran me over, backed up, and did it again.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>I tried to extinguish Logan from my mind, but it didn\u2019t help that every time I heard a motorcycle my breath hitched, my heart started pounding, and the butterflies in my stomach erupted. I slammed the balcony door shut and locked out the sounds of the city streets, motorcycles included.</p><p>Then I kept hearing his voice saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ve missed you\u2019. It was chewing me up inside, knowing I was doing the right thing, yet seeing the hurt I caused\u2014no it was him that hurt me.</p><p>\u201cYou going to Georgie\u2019s for brunch?\u201d Kat nabbed her coffee off the counter and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Deck texted, said he\u2019d pick us up since he\u2019s passing right by the condo.\u201d Since we\u2019d moved to the farm, we made it a habit to visit Georgie whenever we stayed at the condo. Despite my head feeling like it had a set of drums vibrating in it, I knew I couldn\u2019t bail on Georgie since I missed seeing her last night. Matt hadn\u2019t come back to the condo, so we suspected he crashed at the bar like he often did.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t go. Hank sent me a text this morning. The tractor needs medical attention, and he thinks he knows the problem and is planning on fixing it. I have to get there before he gets to the tractor. He\u2019ll have metal parts thrown all over the garage, and we\u2019ll be out of a tractor for weeks.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Hank was an angel with the horses. But he had no skills when it came to fixing things. He was retired and kind of came with the farm. He had a little cottage at the back of the property and was super sweet. \u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll see you at the farm later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let me know if anything juicy goes down. Deck looked pretty pissed off last night. I swear his eyes never left Georgie once and his scowl ... That guy is the definition of danger. I\u2019m thinking Georgie\u2019s outfit had something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Deck was cagey about what Unyielding Riot actually did, but considering he got me out of Raul\u2019s compound and often worked with the authorities it had to be dangerous. I was uncertain whether he kept a close eye on Georgie because he had the hots for her or because her brother never came back from their last mission and he felt obligated to watch out for her. There was also the possibility that Deck\u2019s work had potential repercussions.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What was she wearing?\u201d Georgie dressed a little ... different, with no fear of what others might say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it to you this way. I bet Deck told her to change and she did ... into something even more revealing.\u201d Kat laughed. \u201cEven Matt\u2019s mouth dropped open when he saw her. And about Sculpt\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped her. \u201cSculpt\u2019s gone, Kat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo listen, I wanted to apologize for letting him in last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were drunk. And you hurt your hand trying to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But still.\u201d Kat sighed. \u201cI have a feeling he\u2019ll be back. Just saying ... Sculpt doesn\u2019t seem the type to give up easily, if at all.\u201d</p><p>I heard the buzzer and walked over to the door and pressed the Talk button. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gentleman is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks, Eddie. Let him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to shower. Say hi to Deck for me.\u201d Kat headed down the hallway. \u201cOh and just so you know, Hank and I are putting the horses in the lower field today if you\u2019re going to ride later.\u201d Kat stopped. \u201cEmily ... maybe it\u2019s time to, you know ... find someone. Let a guy back in. If not Sculpt then someone else.\u201d She disappeared into the washroom, and before I could even begin to contemplate her words, a knock sounded.</p><p>I turned the lock and opened the door.</p><p>Logan.</p><p>My stomach dropped hard and fast with a mixture of emotional uncertainty. Jesus, I was so screwed up whenever I saw him that my emotions didn\u2019t know how to react. Butterflies released in every direction, some looking for escape, others fluttering with joy.</p><p>He looked H\u00e4agen-Dazs delicious in his worn out blue jeans and a gray T-shirt that set off his dark eyes. And they were dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What was he doing here again?</p><p>\u201cYou going to let me in?\u201d</p><p>He was frowning and looked like he hadn\u2019t slept, and yet still he looked irresistible. Even with that scar on his chin. I wondered where he got it from. Fighting in Mexico after I left?</p><p>\u201cMouse?\u201d</p> <p>Right. Let the guy in. I was so speechless that I couldn\u2019t even think straight. I stepped out of the way, and Logan strode past me. He went directly to the island and leaned against it crossing his arms. I stood frozen in the wide-open doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou going to shut that?\u201d</p><p>I swung the door shut and leaned back against it mirroring him. He was watching me, eyes unwavering, intense, and yes, I recognized the hint of desire in his expression.</p><p>Finally I untangled my tongue, and I only did manage it, because he was on one side of the room and I was at the farthest point away. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Emily.\u201d</p> <p>I nearly did. It was automatic to do as he asked when he said an order like that. I had to stop myself and it felt like I was going against something inside me. No, I wasn\u2019t his slave anymore. Besides, stepping closer to Logan had an effect on me that I needed to stay clear of. That undeniable ache between my legs was dangerous, and distance was safety. Falling for Logan again was by far the worst sort of punishment I could put myself through. I had plans, and Logan was not part of them.</p><p>\u201cLast night ... \u201d He paused, and for a second I thought I saw that flash of vulnerability in his eyes again. Surprising since Logan had the confidence of a bull. All he had to do was walk in a room and all eyes would deviate to him as if he was someone important. \u201cWhat I should\u2019ve said was that I love you.\u201d My breath escaped, and I stared, mouth agape. And nothing deterred him it seemed. \u201cI\u2019ve never said that to anyone except my mother. Because I never loved anyone else\u2014until you.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. He couldn\u2019t do this. I was prepared to handle him being angry and cold\u2014not tell me he loves me and that he\u2019s never said that to anyone except his mother. A mother who risked everything in order to get her son out of a horrible immoral place.</p><p>\u201cEme. I wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shook my head back and forth. \u201cSculpt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me say this.\u201d</p> <p>My emotions were coiled tight, tied up with thoughts of Logan and when we first met. Thoughts of how when he looked at me\u2014he really looked and saw me. His presence reminded me of how he said he\u2019d hire a plane with a banner saying how beautiful I was to fly by my window. He\u2019d said I needed to be told often after all that shit my mother put in my head. Had that been real? Had any of it? I was constantly fighting the memories of the two months we\u2019d spent together to be overshadowed by the fifteen days of hell. Even with Logan telling me the truth, I was having trouble trusting that our time together had been real.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His tone was hard and inflexible, and for a second I felt that flicker of tremor skip across my insides, but then just as quick as it came, it was gone again. \u201cI wish more than anything I could\u2019ve been here for you over the last two years. Helped you. Told you the truth. Jesus, sometimes I wish I never agreed to teach you self-defence. But then ... then I\u2019d have never fallen in love with you.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re the one who gave me the strength to survive Raul. It has always been you. It will always be you. Emily ...you\u2019re my trophy. And I lost you.\u201d He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you again. I have to do whatever it takes to win you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never lose.\u201d I whispered more to myself then him.</p><p>He remained quiet.</p><p>I straightened my back and raised my chin, fighting against the urge to back down after hearing the most touching words I think I ever heard coming from Logan. My insides were churning and I was having trouble controlling my tears.</p><p>But I\u2019d fought hard for two years to regain my confidence and like one of my rescue horses, I finally had some dignity again and I couldn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t let him in.</p><p>A knock on the door had me jumping away from it, and I looked from the door back to Logan. Eddie the doorman must have recognized Deck and sent him up. I was thankful and yet in some masochistic way disappointed at our interruption.</p> <p>Logan watched me, and I nervously licked my lips under his gaze. His eyes followed the subtle action, and I quickly slammed my mouth shut then rubbed my arms as the shivers coursed through me.</p><p>Logan managed to erase every thought except for him and pulled me into a place I had no intention to ever go again. I was going to have my own farm, my business, and help save the horses that needed me. I\u2019d never submit to another man again and be that weak.</p><p>Another knock.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d I reached for the door handle, then stopped. \u201cSculpt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby.\u201d</p><p>God, when he called me that I felt like I could just erase everything that happened and start over.</p><p>Another knock. Louder.</p><p>I looked at the door then back to Logan. \u201cI\u2019m not something to win.\u201d</p><p>Logan frowned. \u201cNo. No, you\u2019re not. But you\u2019re something to treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan\u2014\u201d I stopped as soon as his name passed my lips.</p><p>He began his approach, slow and steady. I thought he was going to touch me, pull me into his arms, even kiss me. Instead he reached by me, his arm brushing my lower back.</p><p>\u201cAnd a trophy ... I will always treasure.\u201d Logan pulled the door open.</p><p>Deck stood in his faded jeans and black T-shirt as he looked from me to Logan then held out his hand, and Logan shook it. \u201cLogan.\u201d I jerked. Deck called him by his real name. \u201cBand sounded great last night. All good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be better.\u201d</p><p>Deck\u2019s eyes swung to me. He was scowling, not that scowling was unusual, but it was directed at me, and I wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cYou tell her?\u201d</p><p>Tell me what?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there, Deck.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice was low, and he ground out the words.</p><p>Go where? It was like suddenly I wasn\u2019t in the room and the two most assertive and self-assured men in the city were having a private conversation despite the fact that I was standing right there.</p><p>Deck gave a curt nod to Logan. \u201cYou coming with us?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened and looked at Logan. \u201cTo Georgie\u2019s? Why would you come to Georgie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Deck and Logan exchanged a look then Deck said, \u201cGeorgie invited the band over for brunch last night, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I didn\u2019t like that. It meant Logan integrating into my life.</p><p>Logan put his hand on the small of my back. It was barely a touch, a light dusting of his hand, but it was possessive and ... it felt protective.</p><p>\u201cI need to meet up with Matt then I\u2019ll be by. But you know what Georgie said last night?\u201d</p><p>Deck nodded.</p><p>Logan\u2019s fingers squeezed my waist. \u201cI want to see you before I leave, Mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>Deck\u2019s brows rose, and I noticed the slightest twitch at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Logan\u2019s hand found mine and he interlinked our fingers and squeezed. \u201cSee you in a bit, Eme.\u201d And then he was gone.</p><p>A whirlwind had just swept through me. I was so confused and uncertain at how to feel about Logan right now that I felt sick to my stomach. It was too much. The same friends, him owning the farm. It was like I was being thrown at him from every direction, and Logan was right there waiting with open arms.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>It took ten minutes to reach Georgie\u2019s, and Deck was silent the entire way. He wasn\u2019t a talker by any means, and I normally wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he didn\u2019t speak. Except Deck\u2019s expression was foreboding. Scowl in place, brows lowered, stiff shoulders, and lips tight. Something had pissed him off, but I had no idea what. I mean, he acted like he and Logan were cool with one another. Actually, it seemed like I was the one Deck wasn\u2019t cool with, and being on Deck\u2019s uncool side ... yeah, that made me edgy.</p><p>He pulled up to Georgie\u2019s semi-detached house in King Liberty Village, and we were walking through the alley between the houses to the backyard when Deck snagged my hand and brought me to an abrupt stop.</p><p>He was frowning in a way that caused shivers of insecurity to waltz across my skin. \u201cYou into him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Oh. My. God.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Sometimes his no-bullshit attitude was really annoying.</p><p>\u201cFine, I heard you. I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy\u2014yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Deck? What does it matter? Especially to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, get your head out of your butt. No guy goes through what he went through if he isn\u2019t into her. Logan is into you. I know you\u2019re having trouble dealing with the shit that went down, but if you knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done yet.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lower lip.</p><p>His tone softened. \u201cWhat I just saw between you and Logan looks like something. Logan got you out of that shit, and he went through hell. You ask him what happened after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what happened. He fought for his father and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off. \u201cNo. You think you know. Ask him. You owe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe him?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe he said that. Deck was as upfront as they came. He gave it to you straight. But in this case he was wrong. I owed Sculpt nothing, and yet, Deck was avoiding telling me something.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to come after you, Emily. Did you ever think about that? We could\u2019ve got his mother out from under Raul and disappeared. Logan never had to see his father again or go back there. Yes, I would\u2019ve come for you, but by then you would\u2019ve disappeared. Logan made certain that didn\u2019t happen by acting fast and doing what he did.\u201d He put his finger under my chin so he could see my face. \u201cHe hated his father. He asked me when he was eighteen, way before any of this shit went down, to try and find a way to get to Raul. But I couldn\u2019t locate him. The guy relocated after Logan and his mother escaped.\u201d I closed my eyes against the tears. \u201cBeautiful, he risked his life for you. And if you think for one second his life was not at risk even more than yours, then you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d</p><p>I nearly jumped out of my skin when the back gate clanged open interrupting us. Deck\u2019s hand dropped, and he put his hand on the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cNo screwing chicks in the alleyway, Deck. Fuck, thought you were over that teenage shit.\u201d I turned around, and the guy\u2019s eyes rose with recognition. \u201cOh shit, you\u2019re Emily. Finally I get to meet the hottie Sculpt\u2019s been pining over.\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine Logan pinning for anything. \u201cI\u2019m Crisis.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the band\u2019s guitarist. His blond curls blew in the cool summer breeze while his eyes danced with mischief. His blue eyes drooped in the outer corners, and his soft features made him look cute. He also had a killer smile.</p><p>\u201cDeck giving you trouble? \u2019Cause I\u2019m capable of kicking his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d I whispered, but he heard me. Crisis looked lean and agile, but Deck was taller and had more bulk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crisis put his hand to his chest and staggered backward. \u201cOhhh, wounded.\u201d</p><p>Deck shook his head back and forth then urged me ahead of him into the backyard. My head was still spinning, and I couldn\u2019t get a handle on what Deck had told me. What was Logan hiding? Obviously, Deck thought it was important enough to push the issue.</p><p>The small backyard had a patio table and chairs with a gaudy orange, yellow and purple umbrella, a BBQ and a rock garden along the edge of the back fence. Georgie called it her postage stamp backyard, but for the city it was a good size.</p><p>When Georgie saw me, she squealed and ran over and hugged me. \u201cHey, Eme.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cOh my God, you should\u2019ve seen Ream and Kat last night. Talk about a chemistry experiment gone wrong.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my brows. Wow. Kat hadn\u2019t mentioned anything.</p><p>\u201cCome meet Raven.\u201d Georgie pulled me to a girl sitting at the table with an untouched orange juice in front of her. From behind she looked frail, thin shoulders slouched forward as if she was trying to hide, and her hair hung in waves down her back. \u201cRaven, this is Emily.\u201d</p><p>Raven lifted her head and our gazes locked.</p><p>I gasped. It was her. Kai\u2019s girl. That vacant look was something I\u2019d never forget. I stood staring, and then I stared some more until Georgie nudged me, and I held out my hand.</p><p>\u201cHi, ah, Raven. Nice to meet you.\u201d I wasn\u2019t certain what to say really. I was so shocked the girl was here that I fumbled over my words.</p> <p>The girl shook my hand, if you could call it a shake. It was more like she touched my hand. By the way her eyes widened, I knew she recognized me too.</p><p>I glanced over at Deck. He gave a subtle nod, and that\u2019s when I knew. He had gotten her out. Had Logan asked him to? When had it gone down? It had been two years since I\u2019d seen her.</p><p>The screen door slammed, and Raven jumped. By the way she looked and reacted, my guess was she hadn\u2019t been rescued for very long. It was also bizarre she was here instead of with her family and friends.</p><p>Georgie\u2019s mom Karen came out and smiled when she saw me. I met Karen when I started working at Georgie\u2019s coffee shop a couple months before I met Logan. \u201cSweetie. Come give me a hug. We never see you anymore since you moved out to the farm.\u201d She squished me to her bosom then kissed my forehead. She lowered her voice and whispered in my ear. \u201cYou look better, sweetie. But still tired. You getting enough sleep? Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>Georgie\u2019s mom was the closest I had to a mother, and I suspected Georgie had told her about my mom being a bitch and thankfully out of my life.</p><p>\u201cDeck,\u201d she yelled, \u201cget Emily a drink.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cMen these days, all macho and no gallantry. What happened to the James Stewarts of the world.\u201d Karen was into classic movies.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t going to tell her that Deck was better than James. All sweet was out; hot and scary with a teaspoon of sweet was in. Deck had that. Damn, Logan had that.</p><p>Deck poured me a glass of orange juice, passed it to me then slid into the seat across from Raven. She looked ready to bolt at the sight of him, although I noticed her eyes never directly looked at him. Instead, she kept her head down and her hands on the edge of the chair as if ready to push off and run at any second.</p><p>Deck sighed then glanced over Raven\u2019s head to Georgie. Georgie put her hand on Raven\u2019s forearm and crouched down quietly talking to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emily. I\u2019m Ream.\u201d Oh wow. No wonder Kat didn\u2019t want to come today. Ream was here, and he was super-hot. He sat beside Deck, legs outstretched, hand casually turning his\u2014beer.</p><p>I remembered Logan telling me that Ream and Crisis had been friends with Deck and Georgie before they even hooked up with Logan and Kite.</p><p>Ream looked at Deck. \u201cSculpt coming by?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Deck glanced at me, eyes narrowed and his face pensive. Damn, the guy could send a girl to her knees with that look\u2014except Georgie. I took a sip of my juice. When I glanced back at Deck he was still watching me.</p> <p>I shifted uncomfortably in my chair.</p><p>Raven shifted uncomfortably in her chair.</p><p>Karen broke the silence. \u201cDeck, you ask my daughter out yet?\u201d That unhinged the stare, and he looked at Karen and there was a hint of a smile on her face.</p><p>Crisis opened the barbecue lid and checked the bacon. \u201cSo what the shit, Emily? Where were you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCussing in front of the girls. No gallantry. If Georgie\u2019s father were here right now, he\u2019d cuff you to the bumper of his car and drag you ten miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, I love your mom, Georgie,\u201d Crisis said.</p><p>Deck may have smirked, but it was more of a grunt.</p><p>Karen left before brunch was served, claiming she had to get home and feed the dog. Anyone who knew Karen, knew she was going home to her husband Frank who was usually gardening on a Sunday and she liked to be with him. When I met them, I instantly saw the love they had for one another. And now that I knew they\u2019d lost their son ... it was nice they had one another to depend on after something so tragic.</p><p>We ate bacon, scrambled eggs and hash browns. Well, most of us ate; Raven picked at hers. I knew the shit that had gone down with her was really bad. Alfonzo was immoral, corrupt and cruel, and she\u2019d been trained by him to be a sex slave.</p><p>Crisis did most of the talking, and the conversation was kept light, away from me, and nothing was mentioned about Logan, although I was constantly on edge waiting for him to come by. Wondering if he still was. Hoping he was, and yet praying he wasn\u2019t. Then wondering why it was taking him so long to get here. It was perpetual anxiety.</p><p>The gate clanged.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to turn to know who was behind me as goose bumps sped across my skin. My belly dropped as I slowly turned and locked eyes with him. God, he was magnetic. There wasn\u2019t a flicker of uncertainty in him, and it was unnerving and ... attractive. Yes, Logan was attractive as hell standing there watching me as if he was going to eat me alive with his desire.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. What\u2019s up?\u201d Crisis said, then looked at me and hit his head with the palm of his hand. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Logan was moving. I heard mumblings from Ream telling Crisis he was an ass.</p><p>I stood, so did Georgie and Ream.</p><p>There was determination in his stride as if nothing could stop him from reaching me, and it sent my pulse racing.</p><p>Logan stopped in front of me. Paused for a second. Then hooked his arm around my waist and dragged me up against his chest. His warm body sunk into me, and I could feel his chest rising and falling as he kept me locked to him.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d His whispered word dripped like honey across my mind, and I had a hard time not melting into him and ignoring the warning beacons. \u201cWe need some privacy. You good with that, Eme?\u201d</p><p>Was I? Georgie took my hand and squeezed. \u201cI specifically recall not inviting you, Logan. I told you last night, Emily was coming and it wasn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgie,\u201d Deck said. \u201cLeave it.\u201d</p><p>Georgie ignored Deck and looked at me. \u201cYou okay with this?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated then nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in ten.\u201d Logan tagged my hand and pulled me outside the gate and down the alley to the front of the house where he put me up against the wall and leaned into me. I wondered if he did it on purpose as the memory of him kissing me outside the Brazen Head restaurant hit me full force. I\u2019d loved him then. I trusted him.</p><p>Logan slid his finger across my temple, down the side of my face to the curve of my neck where he stopped. \u201cI wish we had more time together, Eme. I tried to get here earlier, but Matt had a lot to say.\u201d</p><p>I could imagine after the fight Logan started last night.</p><p>I stood against the wall; his fingers splayed on my neck, and with every word he spoke a breath of him swept into my ear. I ached. I wanted him, and yet, me giving him myself was all that I\u2019d left behind. I couldn\u2019t do it. I wouldn\u2019t be that girl again.</p><p>\u201cGive me your cell number, Mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His body stiffened, and the rhythmic motion of his thumb stopped. I felt every muscle flex, and there was a coldness that invaded my body as my words hit him.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is.\u201d His warm breath caressed across my cheek as he leaned into me. \u201cJesus. Why won't you look at me?\u201d</p><p>I did and regretted it because my belly dropped. \u201cIs your mother okay, Sculpt?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to relax at the mention of her. \u201cShe\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and nodded. I couldn\u2019t imagine what his mother must have gone through living with Raul then being pregnant with Logan and raising a child in that place. Deck was right, that place was Logan and his mother\u2019s nightmare. And he\u2019d willingly walked back into it.</p><p>He moved in closer. \u201cDeck and his men took the place down a few months after you left, Eme. Raul escaped and went underground. Deck found him recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months? What took so long, Sculpt? Why did you stay there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the place. It was well guarded. After you got out, Raul knew something was up and doubled his security. Took Deck some time to get organized and enough men to take out the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? After I got out, what happened, Sculpt? Did you stay to fight for Raul?\u201d</p><p>It was rare Logan avoided my eyes, but he did, and I knew instantly he wasn\u2019t going to tell me. Another reason why I couldn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>\u201cRaul is dead. We leave the rest out of our lives.\u201d He tilted my head up so I was looking directly at him. \u201cEmily, you mean more to me than anything. I love you. I want to be with you ... Help you get through this. Baby, I missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>I pushed on his chest, but he didn\u2019t to budge, so instead I pounded my fists into him. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t tell me you love me and you missed me and think it\u2019ll make it all better. That I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d</p><p>He remained stiff and unmovable. \u201cI don\u2019t need your forgiveness. I did it so you\u2019d stay alive, and if that meant I had to watch you suffer or make you fear me then that\u2019s what would happen.\u201d His hand went to the back of my head, and his fingers weaved into my hair. \u201cYou know why? Because I knew one day I\u2019d get you out and it would all be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me into that. You. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d But I knew it wasn\u2019t his fault. Raul was the only one responsible; Logan just happened to be his son.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d His hand tightened in my hair and he put his hand under my chin, to urge me to look up at him.</p><p>Oh God, he\u2019d see the watery depths, and I didn\u2019t want him to.</p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s my fault he got to you. He saw me with you and knew you were my weakness. I have to live with that. But the rest ... I\u2019d do it again. It\u2019d kill me, but without hesitation I would. Because you\u2019re standing here in front of me.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cEvery single time I\u2019ve touched you it was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved you. You used that against me,\u201d I whispered in a ragged voice.</p><p>\u201cNo. I used it to save you.\u201d His voice was quiet and steady. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The profound effect Logan had on me was undeniable. It was how he held me, how he looked at me, how he pushed me to my limits. My body and mind were starving for Logan, and I didn\u2019t want to admit it. Damn it, I wanted to submit to him. I wanted to surrender to him and I was fighting it with everything I had.</p><p>He pulled me into his arms wrapping me in his protective embrace, his hand stroking my back. I felt his breath in my hair then his fingers at the back of my neck, stroking, comforting.</p><p>He kissed the top of my head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me to let you go. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not strong enough to do it again.\u201d</p><p>I remained quiet, but my head was reeling. The Legos started falling apart.</p> <p>\u201cTour ends in a couple weeks.\u201d He stroked the side of my face with the back of his knuckles. \u201cThen I\u2019m back. In the meantime, I want you to be careful. You need anything Deck will help you, okay?\u201d</p><p>I pulled away. \u201cTell me what happened after I left Mexico.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hardened and lips pursed together. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Deck\u2014\u201d</p><p>His brows dropped over his eyes. \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe just said to ask you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, and I knew he wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>\u201cThe girl ... Kai\u2019s girl. Deck got her out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI told him about her. After you escaped, Kai disappeared in all the commotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gun shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A distraction. Kai\u2019s low-key, and no one knows much about him, but he vanished the moment things became unsettled. The girl was left behind, not sure if it was done on purpose or not. I told Deck about her, and he tracked her down a few months ago. She was up for auction. Kai was there. Deck got her out before he had a chance to buy her.\u201d</p> <p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s staying with Georgie until she\u2019s ready to go home. As of right now, she refuses to talk about it or go back to her family. They don\u2019t even know she\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo destroyed that girl. I couldn\u2019t imagine what had happened to her for the last two years. Kai ... I really wasn\u2019t sure about him, but I did know he was dangerous, and if he knew who took her, there was no doubt that Kai would come after them.</p><p>\u201cGive me your phone, Mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me. We aren\u2019t dating.\u201d I had no intentions of dating anyone again, but I\u2019d talk to him. It would be my therapy.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re way past that. Phone.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. Logan frowned. Then I pulled my phone from my purse, typed in the security password then handed it to him. He looked at the screen then began pressing numbers into my phone then passed it back. He didn\u2019t take his out. \u201cYou\u2019re going to remember my number from one glance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily. I lost you for two years. I finally got your number. Do you think I\u2019ll ever forget it? I programed my cell into your phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSculpt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer when I call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt, I\u2019m different now.\u201d</p><p>He moved in close, arm snug around her waist. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re stronger, sexier, and have an attitude. Makes me want you more.\u201d</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t defeated easily. Actually, I don\u2019t think he was ever defeated and as I stood in his arms I didn\u2019t want him to be. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He backed away, took my hand and squeezed, and then brought me back to the gang who were talking quietly on the patio. Well, Deck was standing alone leaning up against the fence.</p><p>As soon as we appeared, he pushed away from the fence and strode over.</p><p>\u201cThe band\u2019s leaving this afternoon,\u201d Logan said to Deck and jerked his chin toward me.</p><p>\u201cYeah. On it. You tell her?\u201d Deck asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing right here. You\u2019re on what? And tell me what?\u201d</p><p>Logan stared at Deck a second. \u201cNothing bad touches her. She doesn\u2019t need that shit on her, and I expect you to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt, what are you talking\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEme, I\u2019ll call you later,\u201d Logan interrupted, obviously on purpose. \u201cGuys, I\u2019m picking up Kite, see you at the airport. Crisis, you miss the flight this time, we\u2019re going on without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Ream picked up his beer. \u201cSure we can. You fuck up half the time anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horse shit ...\u201d Ream and Crisis argued back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk with you.\u201d Deck gave one extended glance at Georgie who was sitting with Raven, then followed Logan out of the yard.</p><p>I was left standing, staring after them.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>It was morning, and I needed coffee.</p><p>Kat was already awake, and the scent of coffee brewing had me inhaling deep. She sat on the bar stool with her sketch pad in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emily, you working with Havoc today? I can put her in the round pen after I feed.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m going to play with her out in the field. Free-work with the other horses around. See if I can get her to join up with me while they\u2019re distracting her.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou want to take the horses out this afternoon?\u201d Kat tapped her pencil on the edge of the counter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d We often took the more inexperienced horses out for a trail ride in the afternoons when Kat wasn\u2019t busy painting or fixing things. She\u2019d taken a mechanic\u2019s course last year and even tuned up Matt and Deck\u2019s cars.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Silence lasted all of ten seconds. Kat couldn\u2019t keep anything in. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened between you and Sculpt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You guys are like oil and water in a blender set on full blast.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they were like that. Trying to mesh, but unable to. \u201cWe\u2019re broken, Kat. What happened ... it broke us.\u201d My stomach turned over. I\u2019d been a mouse in a world of snakes. \u201cHe hurt me. Even though I know now that he ... He doesn\u2019t fit into my life anymore, Kat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still love him?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I really couldn\u2019t answer that, because I knew a part of me always would. A part of me would always be that innocent girl who fell in love with the guy who sat in the horse fields playing his guitar. But I wasn\u2019t innocent anymore, and he wasn\u2019t the same guy.</p><p>She looked at me, and I looked away for fear that I\u2019d start balling. \u201cI love you. More than anything, and if you choose to keep kicking Sculpt to the curb, I\u2019ll support you. I just want you to think about it before you do.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my coffee and slowly turned the mug in circles. I kept remembering him standing there and watching me being dragged away, the sound of Logan\u2019s feet in the gravel as he walked away when his father held a gun to my head. I felt so betrayed and ... God, where was my hero? I wanted Logan to be my hero, damn it. Why hadn\u2019t he fought for me? I wanted him to shout and scream and move heaven and earth ... I wanted him to kill his own father.</p><p>And yet, that wasn\u2019t fair. I knew it. He did fight for me, but it was in another way. He fought for me more than I ever could\u2019ve imagined. Maybe it was partly guilt that kept me pushing him away, because I had no right to hate him, and I had. I\u2019d said some horrible things to him, and now knowing the truth, the words had to have hurt him. Maybe in his own right, he\u2019d suffered more than I had. He\u2019d grown up in that place, and still, he managed to be strong and determined and fight for what he wanted in life.</p><p>Kat put her hand on top of mine. \u201cI saw the way he looked at you at Avalanche.\u201d She leaned back on the stool. \u201cHe loves you. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever stopped.\u201d The corners of her lips lifted. \u201cWe only have one life and ... well you never know when it will end. So, I\u2019m thinking you should just fuck him and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>I spit up my coffee, spraying it onto the countertop.</p><p>She laughed and shrugged. \u201cJust kidding\u2014kind of. Okay, not really. Emily, I\u2019m here for you and will be behind you one hundred percent. I\u2019m also your bestie and will tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you, just means I care. If I didn\u2019t care, I wouldn\u2019t say shit. Okay?\u201d</p><p>My phone vibrated on the counter between us.</p><p>Kat peered at the screen. \u201cSculpt. Huh. He got your cell number?\u201d</p><p>I titled my head and gave her a so what look. I picked it up, plugged in my password, and read the text.</p><p>You sleep okay Mouse? xxx</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cHe asked if I slept okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to reply?\u201d</p><p>Was I? It was no big deal really. Texting was impersonal. But somehow it felt real personal. Logan made it feel that way. Even via text I felt the protectiveness about him that I craved. Was I pathetic because I desired that? But when I went to type a message back, my hand was trembling.</p><p>Fine thanks. You?</p><p>As soon as I hit send I knew it was stupid, and I couldn\u2019t take it back. Of course he didn\u2019t sleep well. He had a flight yesterday to Chicago then had a gig and was probably up all night.</p><p>Slept on the plane. Call you later. Miss you Eme.</p><p>How could I not melt after reading that? I closed my eyes imagining his deep voice whispering those words in my ear, and shivers sprinkled like rain drops across my skin. God, he was hundreds of miles away, and I still felt him.</p><p>I texted back.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>No x\u2019s and o\u2019s. No emotions. Simple. Why did it feel anything but simple?</p><p>The day was therapeutic, and I nearly forgot all about Logan. Nearly. He only popped into my head, oh, about a thousand times. Havoc felt my tension on the trail ride, prancing, spooking at everything and anything.</p><p>The entire day was exhausting mentally, and when I finally crashed in bed it was with my phone sitting in my hand.</p><p>I jolted awake to my hand vibrating. Without opening my eyes, I answered my phone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d I sat upright, suddenly wide awake. Then I realized I just called him Logan, not Sculpt, and wanted to kick my own ass to the curb. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I fell back against the pillows, looked at my phone\u2019s time\u2014one in the morning. I sighed putting the phone back to my ear. \u201cI should hang up on you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and I knew I wouldn\u2019t, not after hearing that sexy graveled sound. Logan rarely laughed, but when he did it was like a hit of something sweet. And damn, I forgot how hot his voice was on the phone. I could picture him lying in bed, his sexy bedroom hair splayed on my pillow, eyes tired and lazy.</p><p>\u201cWanted to say goodnight, Eme.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cI could\u2019ve used that hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could be there with you.\u201d He paused. \u201cI loved that. Us. Together every night. Feeling you next to me. I hated waking every morning knowing what I had to do. Knowing you\u2019d hate and fear me when all I wanted to do was protect you.\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d watch you sleep for hours. Your nose would twitch whenever I stroked your hair and you\u2019d smile then moan and cuddle closer to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I did?

Well not anymore, but I was, and it was a good dream.\u201d</p> <p>He swore beneath his breath then what sounded like a groan. \u201cWhat was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and over the phone it came out rough and sexy. \u201cDream, Mouse. What was it about? I want to know everything about you, Eme. Even your dreams.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Crap. I scrambled for something to say and came up nothing. So, I wisely moved on. \u201cListen, Sculpt, I was thinking and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, stop with the Lego building.\u201d His voice was demanding and harsh, and the butterflies airlifted. Was it from being turned on, or was it from my hint of fear? Or both? Why did I like it when he sounded like that?</p><p>\u201cMaybe us talking isn\u2019t such a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cDid you take anything in that I said yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I pictured him scowling and his hand clenching the phone.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I listened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you heard that part where I said I loved you?\u201d</p><p>Yes. And how he missed me. And I wanted to let him in\u2014but it made me feel exposed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not chasing after just some chick I want to fuck. I\u2019m chasing after a woman I love who isn\u2019t letting me in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, Sculpt. I\u2019m pretty certain you don\u2019t have to chase any woman.\u201d</p><p>I heard a loud bang. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about other women. Are listening to me?\u201d I was, but I was ignoring the parts about how he was chasing after a woman he loves. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? What do you need from me and you have it.\u201d</p><p>I threw off the covers and sat up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after I left, Sculpt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Eme. This isn\u2019t about that. You\u2019re trying to push me away, because you\u2019re scared of how you still react to me. You\u2019re changing this into something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, fuck. Tell me. Just tell me what the hell is happening in that head of yours.\u201d</p><p>I was so pissed off from him pushing me that I couldn\u2019t stop the overflowing words. \u201cDo you want to know what it felt like when I saw you again? The anguish. The pain. The feeling like I was free-falling off a waterfall in the scorching heat. Like I lost my breath. A stupid tingling in my skin that felt like I\u2019d been set on fire. The deep ache that refuses to go away whenever I think about you. Oh, and the butterflies in my belly, they go into a freaking frenzy every single time I hear your damn voice, but I\u2019m uncertain whether all that is because I\u2019m turned on or because I\u2019m scared. Or what I\u2019m scared of. I feel it all hanging around my neck like a cowbell. It\u2019s a reminder of how much I loved you and feared you. And how stupid I was to want you at the same fuckin\u2019 time. I want that out of me. I never want to feel helpless again. I feel like I\u2019m out of control and only you know how to stop it and I hate that.\u201d I took a deep breath.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>More silence.</p><p>Then ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few hours.\u201d I could hear him moving around. Rustling. A zipper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I threw my legs over the side of the bed and got up and began to pace. \u201cNo. Why would you do that? You were just here. Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. I shouldn\u2019t have left. I should be there with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan. Seriously\u2014no. Please. I don\u2019t want you catching a flight just to come here. You\u2019re with the band. Doing what you\u2019ve always dreamed of. You\u2019ll ruin your chances if you leave. Logan, think about what you\u2019re saying.\u201d God, was Logan crazy? No, he just went after whatever he wanted.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, \u201cCall me Logan. No more Sculpt.\u201d</p><p>Mistake. Twice I\u2019d done that.</p><p>\u201cEme?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d It\u2019s that voice, the one I yearn for. And that terrified me because I felt ... God, it made me feel whole again.</p><p>I sunk down on the bed, lowered my head into my hands. \u201cLogan,\u201d I whispered. I imagined the corners of his lips were edging up, and damn if I didn\u2019t want to see it.</p><p>\u201cDream sweet, Emily.\u201d Then he hung up.</p><p>I fell backward onto my bed, phone held to my chest with both hands. Dream sweet, Emily.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>I threw a flake of hay into Stanley\u2019s stall for his night feed. He was a big Clydesdale cross that had several open wounds on his back from an improperly fitted harness when he used to pull a wagon far too heavy for one horse. His owner sent him to slaughter two weeks ago where Hank had seen him and picked him up.</p><p>Stanley and a few other horses with injuries came in the barn at night until they healed. We didn\u2019t have wolves, but there were coyotes prowling at night.</p><p>\u201cYou already did that.\u201d Kat was sitting on the cement floor with her sketch pad on her bent knees.</p><p>I looked over the stall door and saw the two flakes of hay. Shit. I had. Stanley would have extra tonight, which I\u2019m certain he wouldn\u2019t mind.</p><p>I was completely distracted wondering why Logan hadn\u2019t called or texted yet. He always called before ten. Well, every night for the past ten days. I was used to it. I expected it. Shit, I was mad because I noticed that he hadn\u2019t called. Kat noticed that I noticed. And I realized that listening to Logan before bed was becoming something I looked forward to every night.</p><p>Last night we\u2019d been talking while I lay in bed, and he was telling me about the last venue they played at and how Ream was giving attitude to a chick who\u2019d been following them. The chick wanted Ream; Ream had her once and now no longer wanted her.</p><p>Logan then proceeded to tell me that Crisis fucked anything that had tits and ass. Kite was more subdued about it, but he did it too, just quieter than Crisis. I also found out that they were all coming back to the farm after the tour. They had a celebration bash planned at the end of the month their manager was organizing.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to Sculpt yet?\u201d Kat was sketching again, trying to act nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>I knew she was waiting for me to say more, but I had no intention of talking about it. Logan was with the band. Or with a chick. Shit. I rested my forehead on the wood beam. Damn it. Damn it. I knew this would happen. I was getting too close again. I was thinking about him constantly. Counting the days until he came home. Home? I sounded like a girlfriend waiting for her boyfriend to get back.</p><p>Oh God. This was my home, and shit ... this was Logan\u2019s too. I was working hard to gain my independence from Matt and Kat, and I was feeling like I was losing it to Logan. He was taking it away by making me need him. God, what was I saying? Logan wasn\u2019t making me do anything. It was me. It was my need to surrender to him. He fulfilled something inside me that I was trying desperately to block out and deny.</p><p>I felt a hand on my back. \u201cEmily, it\u2019s cool. He\u2019s in a band, they\u2019re unreliable. Shit happens.\u201d</p><p>I was trying to convince myself that I didn\u2019t care whether he called or texted. I thought I could get past the intensity between us. I failed. And it had only strengthened with his calls. We talked about everything except Raul and what happened. Mostly the band, his love of motorcycles and my love of horses. It was like we used to talk. We skirted around his mother, but he did tell me her name, Isabella, and that she had long, dark-brown hair with a slight wave to it. Logan also said she had a smile that lit up her whole face like a child opening presents at Christmas. Then he ruined that image with the fact that he rarely saw her smile.</p><p>I had to stop thinking about him. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Avalanche,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m declaring it a girls\u2019 night.\u201d I needed to go out and forget. Drink. Have fun. \u201cNo guy talk. Just the girls.\u201d I stroked Stanley\u2019s muzzle and he nudged my shoulder.</p><p>Kat was already on her phone. \u201cTexting Georgie.\u201d</p><p>We were showered and dressed within the hour. I wore tight jeans with my red strappy heels and a white blouse that fit snug at the waist.</p><p>\u201cKat. Emily. Looking good,\u201d the bouncer Dan said as he held the door open for us. \u201cYou girls hear? Real good band playing tonight. Matt hired them a few weeks ago. Have that Hinder feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh raspy voice. Like it. Wicked. Thanks, Dan.\u201d Kat kissed him on the cheek, and we strolled in, quickly finding Georgie at a table near the stage. She had Raven with her who looked completely out of her element, all curled into herself. Her shoulders were slouched, hands clasped together in her lap; her head was down and her face hidden by her long, stringy hair. I wanted to wrap her up in my arms and just cry for her, but I suspected that would be the last thing she\u2019d want.</p><p>We drank, talked, laughed ... well, all except Raven. Although, at the beginning of the evening I did chat with her a few minutes. I was surprised when she initiated the chat, leaning forward in her chair and looking up at me. She had dark circles under her eyes as if her mascara, that she wasn\u2019t wearing, had smudged. She asked where I was living now. I smiled and went to put my hand over top of hers, but stopped mid-approach when she flinched back in her chair.</p><p>I told her about the farm and the horses then suggested she come by and I\u2019d take her riding. I thought her eyes would light up at that\u2014they didn\u2019t. Dead. Dull. It was really eerie how she had no emotion except fear. Every movement made her jump, and she looked nervous and uncomfortable. I understood why. I mean I didn\u2019t, but I probably did better than anyone here. It would take a long time before she trusted again. If ever.</p><p>Kat and I danced a few times while Georgie stayed with Raven. I was on my fifth cosmopolitan by the time the band came on, and I was feeling it. I mean really feeling it as I danced to the music, letting myself get lost in the beat.</p><p>The band rocked. The lead singer was a thirty something blond with piercing blue eyes and a deep voice that gripped the music like he was part of it. We danced, drank, and laughed until my sides were hurting.</p><p>The band finished, and we were on our last drink as Matt had cut us off\u2014to which we all laughed hysterically. He rolled his eyes and walked off giving Brett the cut sign over the throat. Brett and I met eyes then we both laughed. I nearly toppled off my chair and suspected I would\u2019ve if it hadn\u2019t been for the hand grabbing my arm and holding me upright. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glanced up. \u201cHey, thanks.\u201d Then I smiled when I recognized him. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the singer.\u201d Shit, I was slurring, and he had two noses.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYeah, Princess.\u201d He nodded to Kat, Georgie, and Raven. I noticed the other three band members had already sat at the table. Raven was looking uneasy as one of the guys, I think the lead guitarist, started quietly talking to her.</p><p>Lead singer guy pulled up a chair beside me and sat on it backward, leaning his crossed arms on the back of it. \u201cThat last song was for you ...\u201d</p><p>I held out my hand. \u201cEmily.\u201d</p> <p>He took my hand and kissed the back of it then smiled. My blurred vision took in the dimples on his cheeks. \u201cEthan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I know you.\u201d I found myself leaning too far forward in my seat. I remembered his face; Kat showed me his picture in the Toronto Now magazine a few months ago.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but you will.\u201d He took my hands, and his thumb stroked back and forth across the backs of them. \u201cNo boyfriend tonight?\u201d</p><p>Nope. No Logan. He was extinguished from my mind. Numerous cosmos could do that to a girl. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear, Emily. You want to give me your number?\u201d</p> <p>Number? That was fast. \u201cUm, well ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a number, Princess. Been watching you all night and know I\u2019d like to talk to you some more, but looks like Matt is shutting down soon, so your number would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell ... Why not?\u201d After all, I\u2019d given it to Logan. Who cares if this guy had it too? I was on a roll. Didn\u2019t seem to matter much tonight. Actually nothing mattered except finishing off my drink. I gulped back more of it before reaching into my purse and pulling out my phone. I typed in the password, well it took me three tries, then passed it to Ethan. \u201cMight as well give me yours so I know who\u2019s calling when you call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you know you have twenty missed calls? Popular girl.\u201d He was typing in both our phones then passed mine back.</p><p>Twenty missed calls? I squinted as I glanced at the number. Logan. Shit. My phone lit up again, and his number flashed. Fuck. I quickly clicked it to silent and put it in my purse.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s brows rose. \u201cNot into talking, I take it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Not ... to him.\u201d I leaned closer and bit my lower lip. I felt daring, bolder now. I was pissed, both in the angered way and in the drunk way. What is he doing calling twenty times? I\u2019d normally be in bed sleeping by now. Why the hell was he calling so late? Why hadn\u2019t he called me earlier?</p><p>Kat pushed back her chair and came to her feet, swaying a little. She had her phone to her ear and was yelling at someone. When her eyes darted to me I knew who it was.</p><p>\u201cGod, Sculpt, she\u2019s fine. What\u2019s the big deal? And if she doesn\u2019t answer her phone, she doesn\u2019t have to. How the hell did you get my number anyway?\u201d Silence. \u201cFuckin\u2019 Ream.\u201d Kat shook her head, pulled the phone away from her ear, and pressed End. \u201cYou get that, Emily?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Kat glanced at Ethan then back to me. \u201cThink we should go. Washroom first.\u201d Kat snagged Georgie\u2019s hand. None of them ever went to the washroom alone\u2014ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Ethan shifted his chair closer. He reached forward and ran his finger across my chin. A soft, feathery touch that should\u2019ve sent goose bumps waltzing across my skin ... instead, the caress sent nothing.</p><p>Ethan was rock star hot\u2014tattoos, lean, tall, sexy as hell on stage with his raspy voice and sweet roll of his hips. Exactly what I promised to stay away from, and yet, tonight I felt like taking chances. I needed to prove to myself that I had control.</p><p>I leaned closer into his touch as did he. His finger stopped caressing my chin, and he cupped the nape of my neck, pulling me closer. We were a breath away and I wanted him to kiss me. I wanted him to erase the stamp of Logan.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet, Emily. Real sweet, I\u2019m guessing. And I\u2019d like you to come back to my place tonight.\u201d Ethan\u2019s hand tightened, and I suddenly felt a tremor run through me, and it wasn\u2019t a good tremor.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>I jolted back as Matt came up beside me holding his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Sculpt.\u201d Then he turned to Ethan. \u201cHands off, Ethan.\u201d</p><p>Tonight was Forget Logan night, and I was doing a fine good job of it. Cosmos and Ethan.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried about you. I told him you\u2019re good, but he wants to hear your voice. What do you want me to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the phone.\u201d Logan had no right calling Kat and now Matt trying to get to me. God, what was his problem? Why was he being like this?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Matt placed the phone in my hand, but kept hold. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go, Matt.\u201d He hesitated a few seconds then released his phone.</p><p>Ethan still held me, his hand having slid down to my waist.</p><p>\u201cYou want this gig, take your hands off before I make you,\u201d Matt said, glaring at Ethan. \u201cShe\u2019s drunk, man.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone to my ear as Ethan put both hands up and sat back.</p><p>\u201cStop calling.\u201d It was said in a mumbled slur.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>This is why I knew I shouldn\u2019t talk to him. It was like his voice curled me into him\u2014tight. All this work trying to drink him out of my mind and he plowed back full force with a few words.</p><p>\u201cEmily. It\u2019s two in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... stamping you ... out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stamp. I have to get rid of it.\u201d I knew my words were mumbled with the cosmos at full effect.</p><p>\u201cIs Kat with you?\u201d</p><p>I looked around. \u201cNope. Just Ethan.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cEthan? From Strikeback?\u201d</p><p>I turned to Ethan. \u201cYou from Shrrikeback?\u201d My words came out very slurred, but it sounded like he understood me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Princess. My band.\u201d He smiled and winked.</p><p>\u201cHe says yep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I just here him call you Princess?\u201d</p><p>Ummm.</p><p>\u201cGive him the phone. Now.\u201d Oh, he sounded angry. What I needed was another drink. I passed Ethan Matt\u2019s phone. \u201cHe wants to talk to you.\u201d I stood then stumbled to where Brett was cleaning off the bar. It took me three tries to get onto the bar stool.</p><p>Brett nodded toward Ethan chuckling. \u201cI can hear Sculpt shouting from here. He just told Ethan he\u2019s going to kick his ass when he gets back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, no. He ... he can\u2019t do that.\u201d I didn\u2019t want Logan fighting anyone. I knew he hated it and ... Logan had gone to Mexico to fight for his father\u2014to save me.</p><p>I nearly fell onto my ass when I went scrambling back to Ethan and grabbed the phone from him. Logan was still shouting something about his woman.</p><p>\u201cLogan. Logan ... Stop yelling.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet then, \u201cEme.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re out with your girls. But ... you need to go home. I need you to be safe, baby.\u201d I heard him swear as something crashed. Someone yelled in the background, maybe Ream or Crisis.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything happened to you ... I just\u2014damn it, I need you to be safe.\u201d</p><p>God, he sounded so worried. I didn\u2019t understand what the big deal was and right now my head was pounding and I couldn\u2019t think straight.</p><p>I sank into the chair, my head in my hands. \u201cI can\u2019t erase you. I tried, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t erase what\u2019s engraved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cGive the phone to Matt, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I passed it to Matt, and he kissed my brow before striding away, phone to his ear.</p><p>Kat was walking toward me, her brows raised at something over my left shoulder. She looked surprised and a little worried. I spun around, well I stumbled around, and had to grab the chair for balance.</p><p>\u201cOh look, trouble just walked in and is sucking the fun right out from between my legs,\u201d Georgie said as she followed Kat\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Kat looked at me then back at Deck. \u201cYou think he\u2019ll have a cosmo with us?\u201d</p><p>Georgie picked up the remainder of her cocktail and chugged back half of it. \u201cCan you really see Deck sipping on a cosmo? Besides, you see that wrinkle between his brows? Yep ... right pissed, like turnip-up-the-butt kind of mad.\u201d</p><p>I was either too drunk or too emotional after Logan\u2019s words to say anything. I slipped down into the chair closest to me, my ass cheek half off cause I kind of missed. Deck was making his way toward us, and his scowl was the kind that would have most running. I\u2019d have hid under the table if I thought it would do any good.</p><p>Not sure why Deck\u2019s eyes were on me, as if I\u2019d just brought hell down on him. I picked up my cosmo and slurped the last of it, making a loud sucking noise. Matt suddenly was at my side, and he snatched the drink from my hand and slammed it down none to gently on the other side of the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d Deck said. Was Deck ever happy? I mean, really, he rarely spoke, and when he did it was serious.</p><p>\u201cI am. Fantastic night,\u201d Georgie said smirking. \u201cCosmo, Deck? Might make you smile.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darted to Georgie, and she cocked her hip and held up her nearly empty drink. He grabbed it, chugged the contents back then tossed it on the table. \u201cYou see me smiling, Georgie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Kat said and laughed.</p><p>Deck wasn\u2019t laughing. He was pissed. I was thinking either Logan called him, or Matt. Not sure why; I mean, we were out having fun and were a little drunk, but girls did that, and it was fun, and we were allowed to have fun.</p><p>\u201cYou get why I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>Georgie, Kat and I looked at one another and giggled while we shook our heads. Georgie was the only one smashed or stupid or brave enough to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hoping I\u2019m drunk enough to take me home and fuck me all night long in every orifice possible?\u201d Georgie said.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Georgie.\u201d Matt groaned.</p><p>Deck\u2019s brow lowered, and his hands clenched. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this shit every fuckin\u2019 night, Georgie. You need to get your crap together.\u201d</p><p>What was he talking about?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you do. And dragging Raven out with you? What the fuck were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked to come,\u201d Georgie objected.</p><p>Deck scowled. \u201cYeah right. Get in the car. All of you,\u201d Deck ordered, and even though I could see Georgie wanting to protest, she didn\u2019t.</p><p>I knew she was going out a lot, but the conversation sounded like she was \u201cgoing out\u201d a little too often, and Deck didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Georgie walked over to Raven who was still sitting with the guitarist from Strikeback and put out her hand. Raven ignored her hand, but rose and followed behind her as Georgie waved to Matt and the band as if she hadn\u2019t just been given shit by Deck.</p><p>I started walking to the door when Deck fell in beside me. He gave a chin-lift to Matt who was on the phone, my guess with Logan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk, and you may not remember what I\u2019m telling you, beautiful, but you need to hear it anyway.\u201d Deck pulled me to a halt before we reached the car. \u201cHe should\u2019ve fuckin\u2019 told you the other day what went down after you left that shit hole. He didn\u2019t\u2014his choice. Not mine.\u201d Deck grabbed my arm to steady me as I swayed. \u201cIt was bad, Emily. Real bad. He gained my respect for life for what he did for you, walking back into that hellhole ... Hard to get my respect, easy to lose it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deck respected Logan.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t him asking me to look out for you. This is me looking out for you, because I care about you and so does Logan. He\u2019s worried about you and he has every right to be.\u201d What did that mean? Deck swore beneath his breath. \u201cEmily ...\u201d He stopped at the car where Georgie, Kat and Raven were already piled in the backseat. I thought he was going to say something else, but instead he helped me into the car then shut the door. I was left wondering what the hell he was talking about. What did he mean really bad? I had this sudden need to talk to Logan, hear his voice and make certain he was alright. I clutched my purse to my chest to keep from taking out my phone.</p><p>Then Deck took us to the condo where I proceeded to throw up in the toilet then pass out on the floor.</p><p>Chapter 20</p> <p>Waking on the cold, hard tiled floor sometime the next day, I felt as if a skunk had sprayed in my mouth and I had iron pokers sticking in my head.</p><p>Groaning, I used the toilet to hoist myself up to the sink, tagged my toothbrush, piled on toothpaste, and stuck it in my mouth. I did that three times then tilted my head into the sink and drank the cool water relieving some of my dry mouth.</p><p>As I shut off the water, my purse vibrated beside the toilet on the floor. Falling back onto my ass, I propped up against the cupboard while shuffling through my purse for my phone. I glanced at the screen and groaned again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me this early on purpose, aren\u2019t you? Punishment for my sins.\u201d</p><p>Logan chuckled, and despite loving the sound of his sexy, deep chuckle that I rarely heard, I held the phone away from my ear.</p> <p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Closing my eyes, I brought my knees up to hook my arm around them.</p><p>\u201cI should be there.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cYeah, you\u2019d be clanging frying pans together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d bring you breakfast in bed with Advil.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. Damn it, why did he have to do sweet? It made all my reservations about him blowtorch into ash. And I had no return comment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s after I talked to you about last night, Eme.\u201d He paused, and I could picture him running his hand through his hair; I wanted my hands running through it. Well, maybe not such a good idea right at this moment. I put my head down and rested it on my knees. \u201cWhen we talk, it\u2019s good. Then last night we didn\u2019t. I got caught up with the new manager, and I couldn\u2019t call you. We did our gig, and I tried after the set, but you didn\u2019t pick up. I thought you might be asleep, so I called Matt after we were done to see how Strikeback was working out, and he told me you were there. Then he said you were slurring your words. Eight cosmos. Eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm yeah. I\u2019m paying for it today, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily. You had eight cosmos, and I wasn\u2019t there to take care of you. I called, and you never picked up and ... fuck, Eme, I was worried.\u201d</p><p>Well, to be fair, I hadn\u2019t heard my phone ringing, although even if I had I wouldn\u2019t have picked it up. Not last night on my mission of stamp removal. \u201cTwenty times,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Twenty times.\u201d He sounded really mad, the kind of mad where he just had to look at you and there\u2019d be no more arguing. Luckily, I couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>\u201cLogan, I didn\u2019t hear the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sighed. \u201cMouse, you go out with the girls, I need you to make sure you can hear your phone. You were drunk and slurring your words. Ethan was thinking he was getting some, and I wasn\u2019t there and couldn\u2019t get there. Jesus ... There\u2019s some shit happening that\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cYou not answering your phone and then getting drunk at the bar ...\u201d He groaned and it sounded like he hit something hard with his fist. \u201cFuck.\u201d He paused then in a soft voice he said, \u201cI get nightmares, baby. Everything inside me wants to protect you and I feel like I keep failing.\u201d</p> <p>I lifted my head and hit it on the cupboard door. Wow. Just wow. And also shit. I quietly said, \u201cMatt was there. And Logan ... you can\u2019t fail at something that isn\u2019t your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>I was hung over, sitting with the phone to my ear listening to Logan\u2019s words, and feeling like crying. Him saying stuff like that made it difficult to keep my emotions hardened against him.</p><p>Logan had been worried. He had nightmares. He thought he was failing me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to cry. God, it felt overwhelmingly good that he\u2019d been worried, and it scared me. I didn\u2019t want any guy to ever control me again.</p><p>He wanted to make certain I was safe. He knew Ethan was a dog and freaked on him. \u201cI gave him my number,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>He made a sort of grunt. \u201cAll I had to do was get you drunk? Eme, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in my defense I was pissed at you. So I gave it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pissed at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Logan. I was mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, baby?\u201d His tone had softened, and I imagined him singing a slow love ballad in his graveled, sexy voice, microphone between his hands, eyes closed. Yeah, I knew he could sing a love song really well. And I didn\u2019t want to answer his question. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my hand down the side of my face. If I wasn\u2019t so hung over I\u2019d have some kind of evasive technique. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being stupid, and I wanted to try and forget you, and alcohol can do that if you drink enough, which I tried to do but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngraved Emily.\u201d I knew exactly what he meant. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared about us, but when I get back we\u2019ll work it out. Baby, if you need a call from me then call. If I\u2019m busy I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m busy, and I\u2019ll call you back. Don\u2019t go out pissed off at me and drink with the girls all night and give your number to some guy you don\u2019t know.\u201d I heard him cover the mouth piece and shout something to Crisis. \u201cEme, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I mean for whatever happened to you after ... you know, after you,\u201d I took a deep breath, \u201cgot me out.\u201d</p><p>There was breathing on the other end, but he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cDeck said last night ... he respects you. He said it was bad after I left. It had to do with me leaving, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cTell me he didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d I felt the tears well up, because I knew. Deck wouldn\u2019t push this if it wasn\u2019t something horrible, and knowing Raul and his cruel streak, I suspected he didn\u2019t take me leaving and Logan\u2019s involvement very well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later before the gig. Coffee. Advil. Then a big breakfast. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat something, Eme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Ethan calls, you tell him you don\u2019t date dogs.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Logan hung up.</p><p>I held the phone to my chest, trying to hold back tears. I realized that Logan not saying anything meant whatever went down had been bad. Raul was cruel, but would he have harmed his own son? I knew already\u2014yes. Raul wouldn\u2019t let anyone get away with making him out to be a fool.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Logan texted me numerous times over the next couple days. Little reminders that he was sweet and ... yes, he was reminding me of the Logan I once loved. He still laid it out raw and in my face that this\u2014us\u2014was going somewhere, but instead of getting angry at him for pushing for more than I wanted, I found myself smiling and rolling my eyes.</p><p>Logan would be back in four days, and despite our recent texting and conversations, I still had trouble trusting him. Once he got back, I knew things would have to change, and I did realize that I may have to move from the farm sooner than I had anticipated. Logan and I may be talking, but living together was not something I was even close to considering.</p><p>He\u2019d called last night twice. It was noisy and difficult to talk when Crisis and Kite kept yelling at one another while playing what sounded like a video game in the background. So, he called me back later after the guys crashed. I lay in bed talking to him for an hour, mostly about stuff we liked, music, food, movies. It wasn\u2019t deep, but it was nice, and it was normal. Logan and I hadn\u2019t had much normal.</p><p>I picked up my phone which sadly, I hated to admit, went everywhere with me in case Logan texted\u2014pathetic\u2014and ran downstairs. Kat was already sitting on the couch, a bowl of popcorn on her lap and two glasses of red wine on the coffee table. We\u2019d decided that an evening of The Walking Dead was in order.</p><p>I plopped down and grabbed my pillow and beer then set my phone on the table. Kat glanced at it, brows raised. Then she smiled and stuck her tongue out and wiggled it.</p><p>\u201cGross, Kat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be saying that when he gets back and has his head between your thighs.\u201d She turned up the volume on the TV when I started stuttering my objection.</p><p>I reached over and picked up a kernel of popcorn and threw it at her.</p><p>It hit her right on the temple. I heard the sound of ripping guts in the background.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d I popped a few kernels in my mouth and took a sip of wine.</p><p>Kat picked up a piece of popcorn and threw it back at me. I turned my head at the last second, and it bounced off my ear. \u201cSculpt wants in your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt was in my pants, now he doesn\u2019t get that.\u201d I threw the rest of my handful of popcorn at her. It tangled in her hair, and she set her wine down then picked it out one at a time. \u201cTalking to Sculpt is my therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah, it\u2019s more than that. You\u2019re constantly looking at your phone to see if he\u2019s texted, you\u2019re so falling for him\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>Kat put her hands over her ears and started singing\u2014loud. I threw a handful of popcorn at her laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at him. You\u2019re drooling. Panting. Your wet panties will be off the moment he says, \u2018Come here Emily.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I tried to control the burst of laughter at Kat\u2019s Logan impression and failed. \u201cKat,\u201d I yelled then grabbed for the bowl of popcorn. She squealed diving for it at the same time. We both had a hold of the bowl, and popcorn was everywhere. Kat tugged hard, and I let go at the same time. We both went flying backward and landed on floor opposite one another. Kat grabbed a handful of popcorn and shoved it all in her mouth then we were rolling on the floor laughing hysterically.</p><p>\u201cWhat the shit?\u201d</p><p>I had no clue whose voice that was, and I quickly scrambled to my feet, hearing the crunch of popcorn beneath me.</p><p>\u201cReam,\u201d Kat garbled on her overflowing mouth of popcorn.</p><p>Oh fuck. Standing in the doorway looking at us like we were crazy was Kat\u2019s Ream. Well, not her Ream per say, but Brett said he was, and by the way his eyes were traveling over her I was thinking he was right.</p><p>Kat was still on the floor, her hair covered in white kernels.</p><p>\u201cKat.\u201d Ream walked further into the room then dropped his bag on the floor. He wore a white T-shirt, and ink crawled down his arms and up his neck on the right side. He was leaner than Logan and about an inch shorter which meant he was still really tall. \u201cEmily.\u201d He nodded to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat got up and looked from Ream to the bag. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrashing here.\u201d</p><p>Kat slowly brushed off the white kernels. \u201cReally? Surprising, considering you can\u2019t stand to be in the same room as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Kitkat.\u201d Kitkat? He had a nickname for her? Holy shit, there was way more between them than Kat had told her about. \u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot starting anything, just pointing out the facts.\u201d Kat started picking up the kernels on the floor and tossing them in the bowl. She was acting nonchalant, but there was more to it than that. Kat was uncomfortable; she never fidgeted. Right now she was doing everything she could to not look at Ream.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Kat, that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect to stay here?\u201d Kat grabbed the bowl of popcorn, walked into the kitchen and placed it in the sink before turning around and looking at Ream. \u201cYou have the nerve to stay here? I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarm is Logan\u2019s. The band is back in T.O., so that means we\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. But I assumed you wouldn\u2019t. You know I live here Ream, and I don\u2019t want you anywhere near me,\u201d Kat burst out.</p> <p>Ream\u2019s face hardened, and I dropped to my knees and quickly began picking up stray popcorn kernels Kat had missed. The history between these two was explosive and not in a good way.</p><p>\u201cKat.\u201d Ream ran his hand through his hair. \u201cYou have to get why I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked off as soon as I had a little freak out over my shit. Not cool. You need a reward for shittiest move ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, you\u2019re not being fair.\u201d His voice was calm, but there was an edge to it. \u201cThat\u2019s some serious shit.\u201d</p><p>Her voice hardened. \u201cDamn right it is. And I saw your face when I told you. Your feet were running before I finished speaking.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what they were talking about, which was strange because I\u2019d known Kat since we were kids. What serious shit did Ream now know that I didn\u2019t?</p> <p>Ream\u2019s face dropped. \u201cFuck, Kitkat. That\u2019s bull. I needed time to take it in.\u201d</p><p>Kat threw up her arms. \u201cYou know what? I really don\u2019t give a crap anymore. Sleep wherever the hell you want.\u201d Kat stalked off into her bedroom and slammed the door.</p><p>I looked up at Ream and wished I hadn\u2019t. The guy looked pissed, eyes cold as if he was going to join The Walking Dead crew and rip zombie heads from their shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSculpt\u2019s back but dealing with some shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is the band back early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sculpt\u2019s deal.\u201d Ream avoided my eyes as he threw his bag over his shoulder then glanced at Kat\u2019s closed bedroom door, shook his head, and walked up the stairs to the second floor.</p><p>I finished cleaning up, turned off the TV, and went and knocked on Kat\u2019s door. \u201cIt\u2019s me. You want to talk?\u201d</p><p>I heard her walking across the hardwood floors then the door opened. She\u2019d been crying. Her face was all blotchy, and there were tears rolling down her cheeks. Shit. What was going on between those two?</p> <p>I took one step and pulled her into a hug. She wrapped her arms around me and then sobbed on my shoulder. Kat pulled back and wiped her tears away with her arm then sniffled. \u201cThanks, Eme. But I can\u2019t talk about it now. And I see your face ... Yeah, I should\u2019ve told you a long time ago, but it\u2019s ... I don\u2019t ever want to be treated differently.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea what she was talking about. Why would I treat her differently?</p><p>But whatever it was Ream knew, it was serious, which meant I understood why it was hard to talk about. \u201cYou need me ... anytime, Kat. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but her lips were quivering, and I knew she was trying to hold back. I heard her door close behind me.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>The bed dipped.</p><p>My eyes flew open, and I came face to face with Logan. He was sitting beside me, his back up against the headboard, his legs resting on the mattress, ankles crossed. His hair was wet, and a few drops had fallen and were making blotches on the shoulders of his white T-shirt. He looked absolutely delicious and sexy, and he was in my bed.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d His voice was low and quiet, deeper when he spoke like that. Sexier. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He was going to watch me sleep? I was uncertain whether I was comfortable with that or not. The intimacy of him sitting in bed, albeit fully clothed, was unsettling. Okay, really unsettling, because it reminded me of those nights in Mexico when he held me to him after we had sex, and I had loved those moments.</p><p>I frowned when I saw the cut above his right eye and knew instantly why he arrived back later than Ream. I was disappointed really. He didn\u2019t have to fight anymore, and he\u2019d told me he hated it. So, why was he still doing it? \u201cDid you win?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched, and my belly did this flip and dive and left an insatiable ache. God, I wanted to grab him and taste his lips so badly that I nearly reached up and touched his face. Damn it, my sleepy-self needed some control.</p><p>\u201cI never lose. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Figures. Actually, it was hard to imagine Logan lying on the ground after getting the shit kicked out of him. My heart picked up speed at the thought. I never wanted to see him like that. Was that what happened in Mexico after I left? Was Deck trying to tell me that Logan had lost a fight really badly? Maybe Raul had done something to him because he lost?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fight like that anymore. Haven\u2019t since the night you got out.\u201d Oh. So that blew that theory up. \u201cThe cut is from breaking up an altercation Crisis had at the last venue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here so late?\u201d</p><p>I expected hesitation or some sign that he\u2019d avoid telling me or not tell me at all. Instead he surprised me when he said, \u201cHad a meeting with Deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck? What kind of meeting?\u201d Why would he have a \u2018meeting\u2019 with Deck?</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, maybe you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>He scowled, and I felt like smiling. He was good at looking mad, and yet for some reason I just felt like running my finger over his lowered brows. It was strange, because this is how I used to feel when we were together.</p><p>I wanted him to hold me while I slept. There was nothing sexual about it, just to feel protected and cared for. He\u2019d always given me that. Even when he had no choice but to hurt me, he still protected me, I just hadn\u2019t known it.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d Logan looked down at me and waited until I did as he asked. \u201cDream sweet, Emily.\u201d</p><p>When I woke, Logan was gone, but his imprint remained on me and the bed. I had no clue how long he stayed; all I knew was that I could still smell him. I rolled over and hugged the pillow where he\u2019d been and breathed in deep. He was back. I pressed the pillow into my face and moaned.</p><p>After showering, taking extra care to shave and wash my hair, I dressed in my chocolate-brown breeches with a snug black T-shirt.</p><p>When I came out to the kitchen, Kat was standing at the counter looking rather disheveled. She was dressed in ripped jeans, a grubby top with paint splattered all over it, and her hair needed an appointment with a brush. I found it surprising to see her awake considering she usually fell out of bed five minutes before she went out to the horses. But from the looks of her, she had probably been painting all night.</p><p>She half-smiled, and I noticed the puffiness around her eyes. Whatever went down between her and Ream was bad. Kat was tough, and this was wrecking her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kat mumbled then tagged her coffee and went and sat at the island.</p><p>I was in the middle of pouring myself one when I felt a presence behind me. I nearly dropped the coffee pot when his hands rested on my hips. My body reacted to him instantly, and I felt the goose bumps race along my skin like wildfire.</p><p>His breath wafted across my bare neck, and I closed my eyes as I tried to control the urge to swing around and launch myself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he whispered into my ear.</p><p>It was the most erotic words I\u2019d ever heard. Low and graveled with a hint of sex as if we\u2019d just made passionate love all night and he was kissing my neck as he said the words. I wanted him to kiss my neck, to feel his lips against my skin. Damn it, the touch of his breath was enough to cause an ache so intense between my legs, I thought I might have to go back to my room and bring out my bunny before I could function.</p><p>I found my voice, but it crackled. \u201cUm, morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream sweet?\u201d</p><p>I wish he\u2019d back away so I could think clearly. I couldn\u2019t even pick up my coffee without him seeing my hands tremble. I nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His fingers squeezed my hips as he leaned closer, his mouth inches away from my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re sexy while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>When he moved away, I took several deep breaths before turning around. Coffee in hand, I immediately met Kat\u2019s eyes. Her brows rose, and she pretended to undo her pants. I shot her an evil glare and glanced at Logan who thankfully had his back to us while he browsed through the fridge.</p><p>My gaze froze on him. Logan wasn\u2019t wearing his shirt, and every muscle was visible, flexing with each movement he made while shifting things around in the fridge. He had a tattoo that went from the top of his right shoulder down the back of his shoulder blade midway to his waist then it swung around to I guessed, his chest. I never expected the stunning drawings of what appeared like a horse merged with a hawk surrounded by what I could see of it\u2014a dragon\u2019s tail. I also got a good glimpse of the side tat that said, Tear Asunder in calligraphy writing.</p><p>Christ, I was drooling.</p><p>He straightened then turned with the milk jug in hand. My mouth dropped open as I stared at his chest. Memories of him hit me like a huge wave of heat. How I used to touch him, hold him, curl into him, and yes, even the memories I tried to forget but couldn\u2019t. Of us in the shower. Kneeling. Taking his cock into my mouth. When he\u2019d tell me to undress. To lie down and give myself completely to him. It turned me on and I wanted it again\u2014I wanted the dominant Logan without the fear that had come with it during those fifteen days. And he was making that happen.</p><p>He must have known I was gawking by the way his mouth twitched as he watched me watch him.</p><p>I quickly looked down at my feet and went and sat beside Kat who was eyeing us both. She unzipped her jeans and the sound echoed. I gasped. She laughed then hid it by clearing her throat. At least I\u2019d made her smile.</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t paying attention to us as he chugged back the contents of the milk then threw it in the recycling bin. When he looked over at me, I glanced away. I was confident over the phone that I could resist him but now\u2014now I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you leaving to see that horse?\u201d</p><p>He remembered. I told him about a new client the other day. The potential to expand my cliental from this one client was enormous considering he was involved in the thoroughbred racing community. If I helped his horse then word would spread and I could gain more cliental which meant having my own farm sooner than I planned. \u201cUmm well, I said I\u2019d be there for ten. So shortly.\u201d Was my voice quaking? Did he notice? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shit. Not a good idea. Spending even a few hours close to him wasn\u2019t a good idea. Kat was right, I was caving and it terrified me. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEme. Lego. Stop.\u201d His short abrupt use of my nickname sent a jolt right through me. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking on the phone for weeks, now were going to talk in person.\u201d He leaned against the counter, palms on either side of him resting on the marble surface. With his stance like that, it made his tatted arm muscles bulge and his chest to ... \u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>My gaze darted away from his arms and up to his face. His eyes danced with mischief and I suspected Logan knew exactly how to make himself look irresistible. He\u2019d never done that during the weeks in Mexico. Never flirted, never looked at me with anything other than cold steel eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like people around when I\u2019m working so ...\u201d Yeah, he so wasn\u2019t going to take no for an answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going alone. You don\u2019t know who this guy is and it\u2019s not safe. I\u2019m not taking any chances.\u201d Logan\u2019s tone had turned calm and assertive. He was going to push this.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take Kat.\u201d</p><p>She held up both hands. \u201cSorry, Eme. No go. I have the farrier coming this morning and twenty horses getting trimmed and a deadline for the gallery for two more paintings by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cThen I\u2019ll call Deck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeck has better things to do,\u201d Logan said abruptly.</p><p>Yeah, like hunt down guys like Raul and save girls like Raven. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing clients\u2019 horses for two years. I\u2019m not changing now because you\u2019re suddenly back and being overprotective. The guy is well known in the racing world and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I looked to Kat and she immediately jumped in. \u201cSculpt, you\u2019re being ridiculous. This is her business now. She helps horses and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Kat. This isn\u2019t overprotective, this is being cautious.\u201d</p><p>I put my coffee cup down a little too hard on the counter and dark liquid spilled over the sides. \u201cFine.\u201d Was I crazy? Yes. I had sucker written all over my forehead, but a part of me\u2014okay a huge part of me\u2014was excited about spending the day with Logan.</p> <p>Ream strode into the kitchen looking just as bad as Kat. The tension went from about sixty to a thousand within seconds. Kat\u2019s back stiffened and she glared at Ream who was avoiding looking at her all together. He did say morning though then grabbed a mug and poured a coffee.</p><p>Ream chin-lifted to Logan. I noticed his quick glance at Kat. \u201cWhere are Crisis and Kite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent to Avalanche last night. This morning ... passed out with chicks I suspect.\u201d</p><p>Ream huffed. \u201cThinking I should\u2019ve been with them.\u201d</p><p>The scrape of the stool moving across the hardwood floors sounded then Kat took off to her bedroom. I noticed as soon as her back was turned, Ream\u2019s eyes never left her.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>When Logan said he\u2019d drive, I didn\u2019t expect it to be on his motorcycle, I mean, I should\u2019ve, but I didn\u2019t think about it.</p><p>He stroked the handlebars, his long fingers a gentle caress like he was touching a woman\u2019s back. My lips parted as I watched.</p> <p>Damn it, I was going to explode before I even got on the bloody bike.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been on my bike before, why do you look like I\u2019m asking you to kick a kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ... it\u2019s been a while. I\u2019m uncomfortable.\u201d What woman wouldn\u2019t want to ride on the back of a bike with someone like Logan. This situation is like a fantasy come true and another step toward what I was desperately trying to avoid.</p><p>\u201cUncomfortable? I assume it\u2019s having your pussy tight to my ass that has you\u2014uncomfortable.\u201d His lips quirked upward, and it catapulted me back to when he\u2019d been eyeing a bike at the corner store where we used to stop and get ice cream. His eyes had lit up like a kid on Christmas morning. He had a bike; I\u2019d been on it, but it was nothing like the one we saw that day.</p><p>The owner came out of the store, and they chatted for a half hour about motors while I went and got us ice cream sandwiches then ate both of them while leaning up against his truck admiring his sweet ass.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that bike we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw at the convenience store,\u201d I finished. \u201cYeah. You had a hard-on for it.\u201d</p><p>Logan choked back a laugh, and the sound sent a thrill of desire straight through me. \u201cEme. I had a hard-on for you. The bike was a bonus.\u201d He picked up a helmet then gently slid it down over my head. He tucked in strands of hair then did up the chin strap. He leaned back. \u201cYou still rock a helmet, baby.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what came over me, but I hit a pose, putting my finger to my mouth and cocking my hip with my other hand resting on it.</p><p>This time he laughed outright, flashing his white, perfectly aligned teeth. I turned into a splat of butter sizzling on high heat. The guy was brooding and demanding most of the time. When he laughed, it was like filling me up with a rainbow.</p><p>He turned serious. \u201cYou still don\u2019t get how hot you are, do you?\u201d</p><p>No. I was fine with how I looked; I mean, I accepted what I was given.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is a piece of work. She put you down to make herself feel better. You deserve better than a piss-drunk mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had issues. And Logan, I think your father takes the \u2018piece of work\u2019 award.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 right he does. When we\u2019re good, you\u2019re meeting my mom and finding out what a real one is like.\u201d</p><p>I was taken aback by Logan\u2019s casual mention of his mom and me meeting her. He was right, my mom was a bitch. She never gave a crap when I moved out and in with Kat and Matt. The only time I heard from her was if she broke up with a guy and needed money, which I rarely had. Since she knew nothing about the farm or where to find me, I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in years.</p><p>\u201cEme?\u201d He stroked a line down my nose. \u201cYou have that look. What\u2019s happening in that non-stop thinking brain of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand into mine, and our fingers linked. The scent of his soap drifted into me, and I inhaled deep, closing my eyes. I couldn\u2019t let go even if a train came between us. I wanted to cry for what I was slowly losing\u2014myself. I was losing myself to him again, and no matter how much I wanted to keep him out, he was breaking his way back in. But he\u2019d leave with the band again, and I\u2019d leave his farm. Even though Logan had given me the ability to have my dream, it wasn\u2019t my farm. I\u2019d lived off Matt, now Logan. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I wouldn\u2019t. And soon, I\u2019d have enough money to get my own place.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d I met his eyes. \u201cLet go of what happened for today.\u201d</p><p>Did I have that in me? Could I let the old Logan I loved in for one day?</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>The bike. The horses. Logan looking at me like I was the only woman in the world. All reminders. Could I trust him? No, that wasn\u2019t the question anymore, I realized. It was could I trust myself with him?</p><p>I nodded, and the weight of the helmet slipped forward, and he grinned as he shifted it back. \u201cSmall head considering all the shit it carries around.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. He was right.</p><p>He put on his helmet, and I slapped my hand on the top where the painted skull was. Underneath were the words Tear Asunder. \u201cWhat does it mean? I mean I know it means tear apart, but what does it mean to the band? Why the band name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was done to us. The band voted. And since the band was also torn apart for a while, as well as you and I, well, it fit.\u201d</p><p>He snapped the kickstand up then started the bike, revving the throttle. He nodded to me, and I slipped on behind him. I was in shock. It meant ... it meant Logan had seen what happened between them as being torn apart. Not him pushing me away. Or me escaping him. It was both of us\u2014Torn apart. Forced. Ripped. Broken.</p><p>Did the band know the details of what happened? They had to know about Logan\u2019s father and my kidnapping, but how much more?</p><p>The moment I slid up against him, my inner thighs next to his outer, my pelvis tight to his ass, I felt the scorching heat sweep through my veins. \u201cLogan?\u201d I barely said his name; it was a hint of a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWe were torn apart, because Eme\u2014I\u2019d never have stayed away from you any other way.\u201d</p><p>I had nothing to fight with. Nothing. I felt like falling against him and sobbing for him, for us, and for what had been done to us both.</p><p>His hand rested on my thigh, and he squeezed. \u201cFeet.\u201d I put my feet up. \u201cNeed you closer. Arms.\u201d I snuggled in, and then felt the rumble in his chest and what sounded like a groan. \u201cChrist, how far is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d I wanted to tell him ... to have him turn and look at me so I could tell him that I felt it too. We had been torn apart.</p><p>\u201cNot now, baby.\u201d He shook his head once. \u201cHow far?\u201d</p><p>I relented. \u201cAn hour.\u201d I wrapped my arms around his waist, my fingers interlocking. I felt the muscles of his abdomen against my forearms, rock hard and tense. He was breathing in and out rather quickly, and I bet if I reached down I\u2019d feel the hardness a little lower. I bit my lip, swallowed, and then closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Logan shot off, careening down the driveway as if the bike was part of him, and they were part of the road.</p><p>It took me five minutes before I relaxed into him. Then I raised my head that had been pressed up against his back and it felt like old times.</p><p>It was exhilarating.</p><p>The vibration of power beneath me took hold and refused to let go. I felt part of him again.</p><p>This was something he loved, which made me love it too.</p><p>The ride went by too quickly. Logan stopped the bike outside the gates to a long driveway lined with willow trees. Paddocks with thoroughbreds grazing on the lush grass lined either side. The owner had called me about a racehorse that\u2019d been in an accident. The trailer had flipped over on the Four Hundred highway, and the horse had been trapped for hours. It took the Jaws of Life to get the stallion out, and since then, the horse panicked whenever he felt pressure on him. According to the owner, the champion racehorse also couldn\u2019t go into a stall without a tranquilizer.</p><p>Logan rolled the bike up to the intercom and pressed the button. A male, heavily accented voice, asked if I was Emily. The gates opened as soon as I verified who I was.</p><p>I gestured to the long driveway. \u201cTake it slow, rock star. Scare the horses, and I lose this job.\u201d</p><p>The twitch in the outer corner of his lips appeared. \u201cI like you calling me rock star, Mouse.\u201d He turned back, revved the throttle then passed through the gates at a snail\u2019s pace.</p><p>It took all of five seconds after meeting the owner of the estate and the racehorse before I had to stop Logan from knocking the guy on his ass. Tattooed rock star ex-fighter and rich developer didn\u2019t mix; unfortunately developer guy Rob wanted his racehorse fixed, and supposedly, I was his last hope.</p><p>Blame it on the sweetness of my name\u2014shit, I don\u2019t know\u2014but Rob took me in with his eyes, and it was clear he planned to have me in his bed by noon. Logan was juicing up his male testosterone, ready to slam his fist through Rob\u2019s aristocratic face as soon as Rob\u2019s eyes went from my face down to my toes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rob wore a cocky expression and a half-smile as he took my hand and kissed it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a beautiful woman. I\u2019m a little caught off guard here, Emily. I\u2019m suddenly wishing now that I was the stallion with the issue.\u201d</p><p>Uh oh.</p><p>Logan was standing behind me, but out of nowhere he was in front, the bulldog effect. I put my hand on his arm and squeezed. Please don\u2019t ruin this for me. Rob was willing to pay whatever it took, and the horse needed me.</p><p>Rob laughed; it was more of a fake crackle really. \u201cSculpt from Tear Asunder. Just saw your picture in the Toronto Now magazine. Didn\u2019t know you had a hand in horses. Not thoroughbreds, I imagine. I know everyone in the racing world. Shetlands, perhaps?\u201d</p> <p>I balked. I knew Logan wouldn\u2019t have any idea what a Shetland was, and I was thanking God for that. The miniature ponies were cute and fuzzy, not something Logan would find amusing coming from Rob.</p><p>\u201cEmily and I bring in abused horses. We\u2019re not prejudice about the breed.\u201d Logan looped his arm around my shoulders and tugged me close. Logan obviously believed that possession was nine-tenths of the law.</p><p>Suddenly Logan had made us into a couple, and I was uncertain whether he was just saying that to give Rob that impression or if he really did consider us together.</p><p>Rob\u2019s brows rose. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize. And the pretty blonde in the picture?\u201d</p><p>Wow. Rob knew how to play hardball, and I tried to ignore the comment, but still a wave of jealousy sifted through me at the thought of any pretty blonde on his arm. Was she a groupie maybe? Kat said the band was pretty popular now, and there would be tons of girls wanting more than just a picture with Logan.</p> <p>I cleared my throat trying to draw both of their attention away from one another. \u201cSo, where\u2019s the horse?\u201d</p><p>Logan set his helmet down on the seat of his bike. It was a calculated move\u2014slow, deliberate, and it freed up his hands. I\u2019m sure Rob had no idea that Logan grew up fighting.</p><p>And I was going to lose a client which possibly meant a whole slew of new clients.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play games, Richard. Emily belongs with me. You want to fuck with that then we have a problem. Give me a problem, then it makes Emily have one. She wants to work for an ass like you, that\u2019s her business. You hitting on her, that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. I just lost a client.</p><p>My heart was racing probably just as fast as a thoroughbred\u2019s in a starting gate. Rob was watching us both, his face showing me nothing as to whether he was going to kick us off the property or not.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see that horse, shall we.\u201d Rob turned and walked towards the barn, and I breathed a heavy sigh of relief. Then I smacked Logan in the chest. I hurt my hand, but refused to admit to it.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t react, but what he did do was cup my face, lean down and meet my eyes. \u201cYou, Emily. You\u2019re worth fighting for. I fought all my life, but never for anything worthwhile. Now ... Now I\u2019m fighting for my heart. Bullshit ends here and now.\u201d</p><p>Any argument I had was burned with those words. But I couldn\u2019t help still imagining him with his arm around some blonde. I pulled from his grasp and stepped back. \u201cAnd the blonde?\u201d</p><p>His look of surprise changed to a smile. \u201cBlonde was a fan, baby. Wanted an autograph for her little brother.\u201d He was quick as he snagged me around the waist and kissed me on the lips. \u201cBut I love you being jealous. It\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you coming? Horse is behind the stable,\u201d Rob called.</p><p>Logan dropped his hands from my waist and I turned and headed for the barn, hearing Logan\u2019s sexy chuckle behind me.</p><p>Logan</p><p>Logan watched Emily work with the chestnut stallion in the round pen. The dance she played with the horse was mesmerizing. She became another person, calmness settling over her as if nothing the stallion did could unglue her. She was patient and relaxed with a steady, consistent confidence that the stallion tried to test time and again with his antics.</p> <p>It was magical. Emily was magical.</p><p>This bullshit she kept putting up between them had to stop. The bike\u2014Christ, the bike with her up against him\u2014was hot and pure torture. He could feel her body quivering, the pulse of her heartbeat against his back. It took two years to get the shit out of his life that robbed both of them of a chance together. According to Deck last night\u2014that shit still wasn\u2019t gone.</p><p>Rob had sent him into fight mode. He made it damn clear that Emily was his, and if developer slime ball didn\u2019t respect that, then he was hauling her ass out of there. Not a chance was she working for some guy who didn\u2019t respect her. Shit like that led to unwanted attention, and unwanted attention led to worse shit.</p><p>Rob came to stand beside him, arms hooking over the third rail of the fence. Logan didn\u2019t bother acknowledging him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Logan remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI was skeptical when I heard about \u2018the girl who speaks to horses.\u2019 Googled her, but didn\u2019t find much. Surprising considering how good she is.\u201d</p><p>Logan kept his eyes forward. Emily was in the middle of the ring, eyes downcast, her body language inviting the stallion in. The horse\u2019s eyes were calmer now. Then he lowered his head and walked slowly toward her. It was a beautiful sight. Ten minutes ago the whites of the stallion\u2019s eyes were blazing, his muscles contracting, fear emanating from his every pore.</p><p>The stallion nudged her in the back with his muzzle, and Emily slowly turned and began stroking his nose.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Rob said while shaking his head. \u201cMy guys have been trying to get near this horse for weeks.\u201d</p><p>Logan chin-lifted toward her. \u201cShe\u2019s always had a way with horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve known her a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a while.\u201d Logan kept his eyes glued to Eme. God, it reminded him of when they\u2019d sit and watch the herd of quarter horses all day and she\u2019d explain what they were doing, how a horse was telling the other to screw off. He could never see it, but Eme ... It was like she saw into them.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you meet?\u201d</p><p>He really didn\u2019t feel like explaining his past to some dick who hit on his girl, but he\u2019d play semi-cordial for Emily\u2019s sake. \u201cAn underground fighting ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Rob cleared his throat then continued, \u201cShe needs a website. Your girl is good. She\u2019d do well in the racing community. High profile. Lots of money.\u201d Rob nodded toward Emily. \u201cShe\u2019s a natural. If word gets out, and I\u2019ll make sure it does, she\u2019ll be turning down clients she\u2019ll be so busy.\u201d</p><p>He liked Rob calling Emily \u201cyour girl.\u201d Maybe the guy wasn\u2019t so bad after all\u2014 Fuck no. He was a guy, and he\u2019d been thinking of getting in Emily\u2019s pants. That thought doesn\u2019t disappear because the guy got shot down. He\u2019s still thinking what\u2019s beneath her tight ass, and it pissed Logan off.</p><p>\u201cEmily doesn\u2019t have a website, might be because she doesn\u2019t want to be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney talks. Never known anyone who\u2019d turn it down. You ever turn down a gig if the money is good?\u201d</p><p>No. But he would if need be.</p><p>\u201cBetter clear it with her before you go publicizing.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t traipsing off to every dick\u2019s farm alone, not fuckin\u2019 now. Jesus, he was on edge every second she was out of his sight. Shit had to go down soon or he\u2019d have to tell her what was happening and he\u2019d do everything he could to avoid that. Seeing that fear in her eyes again\u2014no. Never. Again. Deck said they were close. That he was handling it.</p><p>Rob turned to him, brows raised, eyes questioning. \u201cPretty hard to stay in the shadows when you\u2019re dating the lead singer of an up-and-coming band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah well, Eme\u2019s tougher than she looks. She\u2019ll deal with whatever is thrown her way.\u201d And those words were truer than Rob would ever know. Eme had spirit, more than she gave herself credit for; he\u2019d seen it in her the day they met.</p><p>Shit, Emily had come right up to him at in an abandoned warehouse where he\u2019d just pulverized his opponent. He had a cut on his temple, blood running down his face, and no shirt.</p><p>She\u2019d wrapped her small, delicate hand around his bicep, and he remembered wondering where the sexy blonde who had latched onto him had fucked off to. He\u2019d just won a shitload of money and was running off adrenaline. Raul had been there that night. It was the first time Logan had seen him since he was sixteen; so he was revved up and fucked up.</p><p>Emily had been wearing short cut-off jeans, a cute little pink top with sparkles on the front, and her hair was a mess. Her long, brown strands reached past her shoulders and were having a hard time deciding which side to part on.</p><p>Did he fall in love right there? No. Not even close. She was timid and couldn\u2019t meet his eyes; there was no sexiness about her. Fuck, he could remember thinking that fucking her would be boring as hell. He told her he didn\u2019t do brunettes. Not a lie, he never did.</p><p>He would\u2019ve walked away and never given her a second thought except when she said, \u201cI need to learn how to fight.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d laughed, pretty damn hard, and he rarely laughed. She looked like a mouse\u2014small, couldn\u2019t be more than five foot four, tiny little nose, petite waist, sweet hips. He remembered thinking for one second, despite her meekness, that those hips would be nice to grab as he pumped into her from behind. That thought pulverized when she told him why she wanted to learn how to fight, and then he felt like a goddamn schmuck for thinking that.</p><p>Then Kite came up, and that was it. Girl forgotten.</p><p>But she persisted, and that\u2019s when he knew there was something more to her than he first thought. When she grabbed his arm, fingers curling around his bicep, he\u2019d looked down at her small hand against his skin and felt strange warmth shoot through him. He told her to let go, but the words didn\u2019t stick, because for some reason he didn\u2019t want her to let him go. At the time, he\u2019d put it to the adrenaline still rifting through him.</p><p>He watched as she shook her head to tell him she wasn\u2019t listening. Her hair fell in front of her eyes, and he had the urge to push it back. It was like a sucker punch to the solar plexus. He didn\u2019t like getting sucker punched\u2014at all.</p><p>She looked down at her feet, shuffled a bit then met his gaze dead on. When she said, \u201cI was attacked after work by a guy ...\u201d</p><p>Rage rose up in him so fuckin\u2019 high that he was ready to get in the ring and beat the crap out of his next opponent. The words tearing out of his mouth felt like acid, and he could only hold his breath waiting for an answer, because if this chick was getting\u2014 Jesus, he couldn\u2019t even say the word and the thought made him sick to his stomach. It brought back memories of the screams, the girls beaten, the abuse, and his father. It may have hit him harder than usual because of seeing his father that night. But when he asked if she was sexually assaulted and she told him no, it was like a wave of cool relief blanketed him.</p><p>Thank fuck.</p><p>He had stared down at the delicate fingers over his bulging muscle. Imagining that hand curled into a fist ... No, he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Then he was being an asshole, telling her how she could never fight, because really, picturing this girl having to fight anyone was pissing him off. He felt like wrapping her up in his arms and carrying her away from all the bad shit in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then what did he fuckin\u2019 do ...? He led her into the worst sludge of the world\u2014his father.</p><p>He\u2019d brought her gift-wrapped to his father. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d Emily\u2019s hand rested on his arm, still small and delicate, just like the first time he met her.</p><p>Looking at her now, he didn\u2019t know why he hadn\u2019t fallen in love with her the moment he laid eyes on her. She was perfect\u2014the way her lashes dropped to cover half her eyes when she was thinking, how her breasts peaked perfectly beneath her shirt, and her thighs, damn her thighs were rock solid. He felt every bit of them on his bloody bike.</p> <p>But it was way more than that. His girl had a strong empathy for horses, and the way she was around them, it was sexy as hell. God, she couldn\u2019t see how beautiful she was which drove him crazy, but when she was with those horses, her uncertainty or insecurity or mistrust vanished. Determined as hell, yet still sensual and ... feminine. Her determination was playing against him right now, but despite that he respected her more for it, Jesus, he\u2019d dragged her into hell and hurt her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see her strength, but he saw it from the beginning. God, he prayed every fuckin\u2019 day that Raul or Alfonzo or Jacob wouldn\u2019t break her. And he\u2019d been so fuckin\u2019 proud of her when she stood up to his piece-of-crap father, and even though it was the worst play she could\u2019ve done, a part of him wanted to pull her into his arms and cry\u2014 Because she wasn\u2019t broken. Emily never gave up.</p><p>Logan groaned, as he wrapped her into his arms and sighed when she came willingly. Jesus, he loved this woman. He\u2019d thought of nothing except her for two years. She didn\u2019t know what went down after he let her go, and he\u2019d never tell her; she didn\u2019t need that tainting her life. But it was her that gave him the strength to survive the hell Raul put him through. Deck ... He owed Deck his life for getting him out.</p><p>He squeezed her to him. \u201cYou looked hot, Mouse. Out there with that stallion ... I\u2019m buying you more horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can buy my own horses, Logan.\u201d</p> <p>He loved when she called him Logan. Eme and his mother were the only ones who called him that. Now he was called Logan by two remarkable women in his life that survived his father. And Deck. Deck survived his father too and risked his life. He got him out of there and witnessed the shape he was in. Deck wanted him to tell Eme what happened, but he couldn\u2019t. She had enough horror in her life; she didn\u2019t need to hear his horror. He\u2019d shield her from that forever if he could.</p><p>\u201cI know you can, it\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her cheek, and she leaned into his touch, her eyes closing as she sighed.</p><p>\u201cRescue horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to buy horses? Save the ones that need it.\u201d</p> <p>That was his Emily. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cTrophy, Emily. You\u2019re a trophy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>When they pulled up to the house, Crisis and Kite were sitting on the porch drinking beers, and Ream was leaning against the railing.</p><p>I unsnapped my helmet and passed it to Logan who placed it on the handle bars beside his. I quickly ran my fingers through my hair while avoiding his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll, ah ... see you later. I better check on the horses.\u201d</p><p>I turned, my heart in my throat and the familiar ache pulsating. Being with Logan today had been ... it was like the sun burning through the fog of my mind. And there in the brightness stood Logan and he was protective and strong and willing to do anything to repair us. Did I trust him? I believed him, so why was I hesitating on trusting him?</p><p>Logan tagged my hand and reeled me back in.</p><p>\u201cNo more running.\u201d His thumb casually stroked the back of my hand, and it felt good. Really good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are.\u201d He tugged, and I was up against his chest, breath seized, and he was watching me with those sexy heart-stopping eyes. \u201cWhy, baby?\u201d His hands squeezed mine, and I felt that familiar warmth of his protectiveness come over me. He knew when I needed soft, encouraging words, or rough, harsh commands. He liked control; I got that and he did it well, I wanted that escape he gave me when I didn\u2019t have to think and just felt. God, he knew me better than I knew myself. In Mexico there had been no trust; now our relationship had to have it more than anything.</p><p>\u201cLogan. The trust between us, it\u2019s still\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped me, leaning in and kissing me on the lips. It was hard, and it was sweet. When he pulled back, the soft skin on our lips held briefly together like when you touch your tongue to a dry ice cube. \u201cTrust is built. Ours just needs to be rebuilt and it takes time. But baby, we\u2019ll do it together.\u201d</p><p>And for the first time, I gave into him completely. I let go of my head shit and what happened and took in what he was giving me\u2014him. And God, it felt like the elephant sitting on my chest finally got up and walked away.</p><p>All chatter stopped, and three sets of eyes landed on me and Logan as we walked up onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cSweetness, looking mighty fine on that bike.\u201d Crisis winked. \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 now I need to get myself one.\u201d His slight draw was sex on wheels with that voice and look. \u201cPussy tight against\u2014\u201d</p><p>Logan interrupted abruptly. \u201cAnd you know Kite.\u201d I nodded to him, and he smiled. With those cheekbones and brilliant green eyes, he must have broken hearts in every bar they went. \u201cEmily. Good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Kite had ink all over his arms, and the left side of his neck was a hawk or eagle in flight. He had a shaved head and several piercings, one being on his left eye brow. He looked scary, but he\u2019d been sweet when he\u2019d protected me against Matt\u2019s wraith that night we snuck in to watch Logan\u2019s underground fight.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know Ream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. We met briefly at Georgie\u2019s and again last night.\u201d Kat\u2019s sexy, hot monster that lacked a smile but oozed in sex appeal.</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d Logan went inside, and the screen door slammed shut behind him.</p><p>I sat on the wooden swing chair, and it creaked.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen Sculpt look so relaxed in months.\u201d Kite winked at me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been a fuckin\u2019 asshole,\u201d Crisis said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been the asshole. With that shit you pulled with that chick\u2019s boyfriend. Not doing us any favors,\u201d Ream said. \u201cYou know you can leave the band any time you want.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. I was uncertain what was going on, but Ream was glaring at Crisis, and Crisis was smirking.</p><p>The screen door creaked open, and Logan came out holding two cold beers. He passed me one then sat beside me, his thigh right up against mine. He put his arm around the back of the swing, his fingers weaving into my hair as he played with it.</p><p>\u201cSculpt says you\u2019ve been doing well with the talking to horses thing,\u201d Kite said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it talking to horses. But yes, I communicate to them in their language\u2014body language you could say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow any other body language talkers, Emily? This horse could use a real talking to.\u201d Crisis looked down at himself, and both Ream and Kite sprayed beer out their mouths.</p><p>Ream wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to him, Emily. He\u2019s just pissed his little pony didn\u2019t get any last night.\u201d</p><p>Logan stiffened. \u201cJesus, guys. Enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReam, what the fuck\u2019s your issue? On your monthly again?\u201d Crisis set his beer down hard on the table beside him. \u201cYou all pissy because Kat asked me to go riding tomorrow and not you? Bet you\u2019re wondering what kind of riding we\u2019ll be doing.\u201d</p><p>Ream was clenching his fists, and Crisis was smiling as if he wanted to fight. Logan leaned into me, his arm around shoulders pulling me closer as he whispered, \u201cBaby. Shit, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Crisis took a long drag of beer. \u201cLogan was brooding and quiet, Emily. I swear the only time he spoke was when we got up on stage. I don\u2019t know why the fuck it took him ten months to get back here. Jesus, if I was screwing something hot like you, I\u2019d have been back to Toronto fucking pronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Crisis. Cool it.\u201d Logan glared at him and was shaking his head back and forth.</p><p>\u201cTwo years you mean,\u201d Eme corrected.</p><p>Crisis\u2019s brow rose and he raised his beer to Logan. \u201cYou\u2019re up, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>He swept my hair back with his fingers then trailed a caress down the side of my face. \u201cTook a while to get back. Needed some time alone after that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Deck was talking about?\u201d</p><p>He paused and I thought he wasn\u2019t going to tell me then he said, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t push it. It wasn\u2019t the time or place to talk about it, but I was glad that he didn\u2019t close me down this time.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of God, look at her.\u201d Crisis stood, his eyes on Kat who was walking toward the house. She had on a pair of tight faded cut-off jeans, an even tighter turquoise tank top, and a pair of leather paddock boots. \u201cI so need to get into her pants.\u201d</p><p>Ream caught what Crisis was looking at, and I saw the instant tension go from his jaw right down to his feet. His eyes narrowed, and his brows lowered. His hands clenched the railing, and if the wood had any give in it, the thing was breaking under the pressure.</p><p>Kat walked up the steps.</p><p>\u201cFuck, babe. Lookin\u2019 good. That sweet ass can sit in my saddle anytime,\u201d Crisis said.</p><p>Kat laughed, but she didn\u2019t object and sauntered close to Crisis and snagged his beer, chugging back half of it before setting it back down on the table. That was becoming a habit of hers. Her slow, long lick of her lips had Crisis groaning.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Kat. Put some fucking clothes on.\u201d Ream\u2019s voice was bitter and cruel \u201cYou gonna screw everyone in the band like some groupie?\u201d</p><p>Holy wow. Ream was raging mad. Like bull fighting mad. I could see his temples throbbing, and his lips were pursed together\u2014tight.</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t flinch, and I have to say I was proud of her. She smiled and put her arm around Crisis who instantly reciprocated by placing his hand in her back jean pocket and squeezing her ass.</p><p>\u201cLeast it\u2019s only four of you. Not like you ... fucking the hundreds of groupies who kiss your goddamn feet like they\u2019re made of ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh they\u2019re not kissing my feet, Kitkat. The ice cream is up a bit further,\u201d Ream shot back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, cold and always melting.\u201d</p><p>Insulting a man\u2019s dick was the quickest way to him hating you, and it looked like that was what she was aiming for.</p><p>Crisis and Kite threw back their heads in hysterics.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only when you\u2019re around,\u201d Ream said.</p><p>Kat came at him, her cool finally breaking. Crisis snagged her around the waist as she kicked and shouted to let her go. He whispered something in her ear, and she settled down, but Ream was striding toward her and Crisis, and he was ready to pop a blood vessel.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, Ream. Let it the fuck go.\u201d Kite slapped Ream on the back, his hand digging into his shoulder, halting him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI swear, Kitkat, I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a walk,\u201d Logan suddenly thundered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret it man, leave it alone.\u201d Kite guided him down the porch steps, and I saw Ream plow his fist into the pillar at the bottom of the steps.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with them?\u201d I whispered to Logan.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But whatever it is, they need to work it out before they kill one another.\u201d</p><p>Watching Ream walk across the yard with Kite, I knew whatever made Ream and Kat lash out at one another was big. I tried to recall Kat acting weird back when I\u2019d come back from Mexico but I had been so self-absorbed after what happened that I may have missed it.</p><p>\u201cSo, barbecue. Steaks or burgers?\u201d Crisis had let Kat go, but his hand was still in her back pocket. Kat was zoned out, eyes focused on one thing\u2014Ream.</p><p>\u201cYou good with steaks?\u201d Logan asked me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not really hungry\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating, and then you\u2019re in my bed,\u201d Logan said quietly.</p><p>My breath hitched. \u201cLogan, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was keeping his voice low, so others wouldn\u2019t hear. \u201cEme, we\u2019ve slept together before.\u201d</p><p>It was like a medicine ball was lodged in my throat. I tried again. \u201cThat was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to sleep with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnswer me, Eme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking for the truth. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d</p><p>God. \u201cYes. But Logan, I need some time to digest this. It\u2019s too fast, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled me to my feet and dragged me into the house, down a hallway then opened the door to the office. He slammed it behind us. \u201cYou had time.\u201d</p><p>I backed away until I was up against a desk, my hands gripping the edge.</p> <p>\u201cBut mainly, you\u2019re lying.\u201d He approached.</p><p>I knew that look; it was unbending. Determined. And I wasn\u2019t afraid. Not for one second.</p><p>I took several deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cI see it.\u201d His voice was graveled and low.</p><p>What did he see? I raised my chin and locked my jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou want me.\u201d He kept his distance a few feet away. \u201cStop denying it. I know who you are. I know what you need and what your body needs. There wasn\u2019t a single time you weren\u2019t turned on when we were together. Not once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Public sex wasn\u2019t my thing.\u201d</p><p>He took the final steps toward me. I couldn\u2019t control it. Unleashed need blanketed me. He must have seen it, saw me wavering on the edge, the hook that was holding me back from trusting him slowly ripping from my skin.</p><p>\u201cLet me love you.\u201d</p><p>And then I did what I wanted to do since the day he walked back into my life. I crumpled into his arms, and Logan wrapped me in his warm protective embrace. \u201cI loved you, Logan. You didn\u2019t care what they did to me, and it was devastating. I know now why and that you had to, but sometimes ... I never want to feel that helpless again.\u201d</p><p>Logan caressed my hair while his other hand linked with mine and gave a reassuring squeeze. \u201cWhatever happens between us now, it\u2019s because we both want it. No one\u2014no one will ever make you feel helpless again. Baby, I love you. I never stopped, and regardless of how destitute you felt, you weren\u2019t alone. You\u2019ll never be helpless. You\u2019re too strong.\u201d His fingers stroked the side of my face. \u201cYou know what the first thing my mother taught me in that place? To take emotion out of the equation. That\u2019s what always made me a good fighter. I never lost control.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve hide my emotions for a long time. I\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I came back here for you, I needed you to see who I am, and yeah, I\u2019ve lost it a few times like with your dance partner at the bar. But Mouse, I\u2019m letting you see all of me so you can learn to trust me again. I need you to trust me again.\u201d</p><p>I knew that whatever Logan said or did it was always about protecting me. He pushed his authority and liked control, but I trusted him. Sexually, I craved that escape he gave me. It set me free from decisions and as Logan would say, \u201cLego building\u201d.</p><p>I sniffled and few tears fell. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For what you and your mother have been through.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tears. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>I knew that whatever Logan said or did it was to protect me.</p><p>Nothing more was said as he held me close. It felt right in his arms. He had done everything for me. That emotionless cage he locked himself in to hide his feelings from his father was to save me. He\u2019d suffered too. We both did. And maybe my body had known all along that the Logan I hated was also the Logan I loved. Maybe my body knew that the man I feared wasn\u2019t the real Logan.</p><p>\u201cYou good, Eme?\u201d</p><p>I nodded into his chest, the feel of his muscles sliding across my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with me from now on.\u201d</p><p>My fingers curled into his shirt. Then I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou need something from me, tell me. We fight this shit together.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded on the door and Crisis yelled, \u201cHey you guys done makin\u2019 out? Fuckin\u2019 starving here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It was a whisper of one word, and with it every Lego previously built up in my head crumbled to the ground at Logan\u2019s feet.</p><p>I was letting him back in.</p><p>He caressed the side of my face, and I leaned into it, sighing. \u201cMake a salad with Kat. We\u2019ll do the steaks and potatoes on the barbecue. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He took my hand and walked us out of the office.</p><p>When the boys yelled that the steaks were ready, Kat and I brought the salad and wine outside to the table on the deck which overlooked the pool. There was never lack of conversation as the men shared stories of the bars they\u2019d performed in and then the excitement over acquiring their new manager Daryl.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you guys staying?\u201d I asked, uncertain what Logan\u2019s plans were.</p><p>\u201cNot sure yet, sugar,\u201d Crisis replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m liking staying here if it means I get to check out two hot chicks every morning.\u201d Crisis winked at me, but when he looked at Logan, he was backtracking. \u201cFrom a distance. Like a mile. Maybe ten miles. Fuck, sorry sweet stuff, but not going to admire you at all. I\u2019ll just admire Kat.\u201d</p><p>Kite chuckled. \u201cYou can admire all the babes you want at the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah. Sweet asses aplenty.\u201d Crisis wiggled his brows. \u201cThis horse needs some jumping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pig,\u201d Kat said laughing.</p><p>Crisis leaned over and put his arm around her, pulling her close. \u201cHow high can you jump, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t jump. Kitkat plows right through.\u201d Ream shoved back his chair, picked up his plate, and went inside. There was a loud bang and then crash. Then the front door slammed.</p><p>\u201cShit, Kat. You ever goin\u2019 tell us what the fuck went down between you two?\u201d Kite sat back and stretched out his legs, crossing his ankles.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pushed back her chair and crossed her legs. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m never touching that again.\u201d</p><p>Crisis coughed bullshit under his breath, and Kat smacked his arm. He rubbed it and feigned a pout.</p><p>Logan stood up and brought me with him. He leaned over and whispered. \u201cHelp me with the dishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I may have been missing from Logan\u2019s life for two years, but I knew exactly what he was doing. Time alone.</p><p>Three trips with dishes to the kitchen, and then I was rinsing off the plates in the sink when Logan came up behind me and swept my hair aside with the lightest touch of his finger.</p><p>\u201cEme. Why are you doing that? We have a dishwasher.\u201d He shut off the tap, took my hands and pulled me around to face him. Then he grabbed me by the hips and lifted me up onto the counter.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around my waist, the other to the nape of my neck. \u201cFuck, I love it when you say my name. I need to taste you again, baby.\u201d He pulled me toward him. The heat of his mouth hit the spot just below my ear and goose bumps sparked across my skin. He trickled light kisses downward, his tongue playing, tasting.</p><p>\u201cI like how you shake in my arms. It\u2019s like your body can\u2019t wait to be with mine.\u201d His arm around my waist tightened. \u201cIt\u2019s known. All this time, it\u2019s known you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, my head tilting back. Oh God. What he did to me ...</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, and I swear I wasn\u2019t alone in this, but when a guy tucks your hair behind your ear, it\u2019s ... well it\u2019s the most erotic, attractive and panty melting move, and Logan did it all the time, so I melted\u2014big time. Liquid heat was running through me, and I let it in.</p><p>I met his eyes and explosive desire hit me\u2014hard. Logan\u2019s head was tilted, eyes were burning with craving; his lips were slightly parted. Melted wasn\u2019t good enough; I was boiling over.</p><p>He whispered my name again then claimed my lips; I was his. Not that I\u2019d ever been anyone else\u2019s. No, I\u2019ve always been his.</p><p>His pressed into me, hard and warm, unrelenting as his mouth took mine in a slow need, an exploration of what we both craved. My arms wrapped around his neck, fingers curling into his hair, gripping, holding, never letting go as I pulled and tilted his head so I could get deeper.</p><p>His groan vibrated in my mouth, and my body shivered.</p><p>His hands gripped my ass. \u201cLegs, Eme.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my legs around his waist and locked my ankles. I never wanted to let go. Of him. Of Logan.</p><p>He trailed kisses down my neck, and I tilted my head back, eyes closed, sighing as his tongue flicked across my heated skin. The wetness between my thighs soaked my panties, and that intense twinge heightened.</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>He groaned against my throat, hand coming up between us to circle my nipple then lightly pinch.</p><p>I gasped.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I missed you.\u201d He continued to circle my nipple, then squeezed. \u201cWe\u2019re not wasting any more time.\u201d His other hand kept me in place holding the back of my head as he met my eyes.</p><p>I flexed my thighs, and I knew he felt it by how his hand tightened on the strands of my hair. I pictured him above me, my thighs around him as he slide inside me, the fullness, him driving into me hard then slow. Then I imagined Logan looking down at me before he comes, before I let go to join him.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 hell, Sculpt.\u201d Kite sauntered into the kitchen and threw his beer into the empty case on the floor.</p><p>I tried to unhook my legs, but Logan wouldn\u2019t let me as he grabbed my thigh. He leaned into me and whispered, \u201cStay. Don\u2019t move until I tell you.\u201d</p><p>Kite opened the fridge and grabbed another beer. \u201cBetter get out there. Ream\u2019s back and looks like he\u2019s pounded back more than a few of something burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Logan said. \u201cCrisis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiling it up.\u201d Kite opened his beer, and a hiss sounded.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Logan let my legs go, put his hands on my hips and helped me off the counter. \u201cI have to deal with this, Mouse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll finish up here.\u201d</p><p>Logan snagged my hand. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not staying here cleaning up. I\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>We went outside to the pool, Kite followed. Crisis, Kat, and Ream were there and it was heated. Gray slate cobblestones gleamed under the lights that surrounded the pool. The water glistened, and the moonlight reflected off the smooth surface.</p><p>\u201cBack the fuck off, Ream,\u201d Crisis shouted. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my problem, asshole. Get your hands off her.\u201d Ream\u2019s eyes shot to Kat. \u201cYou gonna fuck him too? Going to screw every fuckin\u2019 guy that looks at you? Ever thought of asking for money? You\u2019d be rich by now.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s face paled, and I suspected if Crisis didn\u2019t have his arm around her waist, she would\u2019ve collapsed. Her expression was so damaged\u2014eyes wide with horror, mouth open with shock. \u201cAre you offering to compensate me for services rendered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Logan muttered. \u201cStay here.\u201d He started to walk toward them.</p><p>Ream was in Crisis\u2019s face, slurring his words. \u201cFuckin\u2019 Crisis, Kat? Man whore? This isn\u2019t going down. No fuckin\u2019 goddamn way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReam, you need to walk away man,\u201d Kite said approaching.</p> <p>\u201cReam.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice was more of a warning sound, and I recognized it well.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t own me, Ream. Remember. You think I\u2019m a piece of shit, so it doesn\u2019t matter what you think of me.\u201d I was close enough to see Kat\u2019s tears teetering in the rims of her eyes.</p><p>Ream\u2019s face dropped, and he ran his hand twice over his shaved head. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that shit from? I never said that. I never fuckin\u2019 said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look at me like I\u2019m garbage. I might as well play the part.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s body was tight, ready. Like he looked before a fight\u2014controlled and calm but deadly. He chin-lifted to Kite then they walked up behind Crisis and Kat.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, I don\u2019t think that. But you keep this up and I\u2019m changing my mind. Fuckin\u2019 hell, Kat, why are you doing this? The men. Jesus.\u201d</p> <p>Kat slipped from Crisis and backed up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even talk to me afterward.\u201d</p><p>Ream ran his hand through his hair, and he staggered a step as he lost his balance. \u201cKitkat ... I couldn\u2019t ... I couldn\u2019t face\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kat erupted. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t face it? Are you serious? I fuckin\u2019 face it! I knew it. I fuckin\u2019 knew this would happen. I never told anyone for this very goddamn reason.\u201d She walked toward him, her hands balled into fists. \u201cI still face it, Ream. Me.\u201d Kat shoved him in the chest, and he staggered back a step. \u201cYou have no right telling me who I can be with. None.\u201d She slammed both palms into him again.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Logan swore as Ream lost his balance and went back several feet then slipped over the edge into the pool.</p><p>Crisis roared with laughter.</p><p>It took several seconds before he came sputtering to the surface. Crisis was still laughing while Kat frowned, her gaze focused on Ream as he swam to the side and pulled himself out.</p><p>His jeans and T-shirt clung to his body like a second skin, and when I looked at Kat, she was staring at Ream like ... she was in love with him.</p><p>Crisis was bowled over, clutching his stomach laughing.</p> <p>But it was the look in Ream\u2019s eyes that had me worried for Kat. Logan got that look, a twinkle in his eyes that I knew meant mischief. Ream shook his head and droplets of water dispersed like a dog shaking after his bath. He looked nonchalant, casual, and that was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cKat\u2014\u201d I was too late. The moment I said her name, Ream dove for her. His head was down as his arms wrapped around her waist and heaved her over his shoulder. She squelched and kicked and struggled.</p><p>\u201cReam! Let me\u2014\u201d He jumped. Kat\u2019s scream was cut off as they disappeared beneath the surface of the water.</p><p>Logan looked at Kite. \u201cWe need to step on this shit.\u201d</p><p>Kite smacked Crisis in the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re no fuckin\u2019 help, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? He needs to wake the fuck up. I\u2019m helping him.\u201d Crisis\u2019s held up his hands, feigning innocence although his lips were twitching. What a shit disturber.</p><p>I bit my lip. Logan scoffed.</p><p>Ream and Kat came up from the beneath the surface of the water and Ream had his arm hooked around her waist, helping her to the side of the pool.</p><p>Logan met my eyes and I recognized the spark, knew it, felt it, and I remembered. I remembered when I\u2019d first fallen in love with Logan.</p><p>He approached, a slow, casual stride. I stepped back one foot after the other. His eyes slid down me then back up again. Then, God that smile.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d I held up my hand as I continued backward.</p><p>His brows rose to match his grin.</p><p>\u201cLogan, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Emily.\u201d</p><p>I turned and ran, but he was on me in two strides, looping his arm around my waist and carrying me kicking and screaming to the edge of the pool.</p><p>\u201cLogan! Logan, don\u2019t you dare.\u201d I pounded my fists into his back. \u201cNo. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you staying in my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. I mean yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not understanding your answer. Maybe a little cold water will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooo.\u201d</p><p>He leapt high into the air. I screamed.</p><p>I felt the cold water descend over my body, then my head as we went under. Logan\u2019s hands were on me, holding me against him as we hit the bottom and he crouched and pushed off.</p><p>The moment I could suck in air, I struggled to dislodge his hands so I could swim to the edge of the pool. Logan was laughing so hard that he couldn\u2019t hold onto me as I kicked out and hit him in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d I yelled. I was trying my hardest to hold in my laughter and act all pissy, but when he caught me at the side of the pool and dragged me into him, I felt his lips on the back of my neck then the touch of his hands under my shirt, his skin against mine. He was caressing my abdomen then up across my ribs and ...</p><p>\u201cWater clear it up for you any?\u201d He nibbled the lobe of my ear. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for sex. But you\u2019re in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Resisting Logan was like stopping a freight train with my hands. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I saw Ream reach for Kat as she climbed out of the pool, snagging her hand. She paused, turned her head and all I saw the unquestionable rawness of hostility.</p><p>Ream said quietly, \u201cWhy, Kat?\u201d</p><p>Kat never said anything, merely pulling away and walked back up to the house. Then Crisis and Kite cannonballed into the water.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Despite the cold water from the pool, I was burning up. There was no denying my attraction to him had catapulted to another level. This wasn\u2019t just love, this was an overwhelming debilitating love that I couldn\u2019t even begin to decipher.</p><p>Soul gripping. Fuck, it was complete mind enfolding; not a single thought could be procured without him embraced within it.</p><p>Logan showed me to his bathroom upstairs on the third floor. Kat and I had stayed on the main floor since we\u2019d moved onto the farm. It was odd seeing the second floor occupied by the band and third floor by Logan. The rooms had remained unused before the band came except for one on the second floor on the south side. Kat had been using it as an art room; now it was occupied by Crisis, when he stayed here.</p><p>The bathroom happened to have all my toiletries laid out; apparently Logan moved them from the downstairs bathroom. He took my hands, held them at my sides, and then bent his head and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexted Kite when you were working with the stallion.\u201d He caressed my cheek then nodded to the right. \u201cWear the shirt to bed, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He picked up a white button-down men\u2019s shirt. I went to object and tell him I had my own pajamas when he scowled. \u201cSeeing you in my shirt is sweet. And I want sweet tonight.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Stop. Why did he have to say shit like that? I mean what girl didn\u2019t want to hear a guy telling her he wanted her in his shirt. That he wanted sweet and she\u2019d be sweet in his shirt.</p><p>My mouth opened then slammed shut as he went over, turning on the taps. Water blasted out of the showerhead. He adjusted the water temperature.</p><p>He stood up straight. \u201cYou need help taking off those wet clothes?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes heavenward. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>Logan grinned holding up his hands. \u201cTrying to be helpful.\u201d</p><p>I let my pursed lips slip, and I smiled. I couldn\u2019t help it, seeing Logan laugh and smile was contagious. \u201cOut. Now.\u201d</p><p>Watching Logan casually stride from the bathroom, I admired his ass in wet jeans, the corded muscles on his back visible beneath his white T-shirt clinging to his body like a second skin.</p><p>I leaned over and felt the temperature of the water\u2014perfect. Peeling off my clothes, I hung them on the towel rack then stepped under the warm spray.</p><p>I washed as fast as I could to avoid the image of Logan that was afflicting me as I ran my hands over my body. I was imagining my touches were his hands on every inch of me.</p><p>Everything he\u2019d done, he\u2019d done to save me. To save us.</p><p>I was letting him in, and he was letting me in. I was sleeping beside him tonight, and I felt all giddy inside and a little nervous, but it was a good nervous.</p><p>I closed my eyes, hands against the wall, the water pounding into my body like he had during my captivity two years ago. His hands had been on my hips, fingers digging into my flesh as he fucked me from behind that day in the shower. His lips nibbled at the crook of my neck as he slowed, sliding in and out. I moaned, then begged for him to go harder, faster as he pulled out, hands wrapping around my hair and yanking my head back so he could take my mouth with a cruel, deep kiss that had my body screaming for more.</p><p>He\u2019d been right. He was engraved in me, and no amount of time or washing or running was going to get him out of me. I had to accept that. I did accept that.</p><p>I leaned back against the tiles as more memories flooded.</p><p>I never heard the door open, nor the dropping of clothes on the floor, still lost in my grip of desire.</p><p>Hands cupped my cheeks, and my eyes flew open.</p><p>Our eyes locked.</p><p>Held.</p><p>Desire spiraled around us tying us together. Logan tilted his head, the water pounding down on him as he leaned closer.</p><p>I closed my eyes and inhaled him.</p><p>He was part of me.</p><p>Logan had never left me. And I knew that even if I denied us, I\u2019d never get him out of me. Love didn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to touch that yourself without me.\u201d</p><p>I moaned, and that was all it took before his lips crashed down onto mine. Our need was so intense every part of my body ached.</p><p>There was nothing sweet in his kiss. His force was bruising, relentless, and he stole my breath. My hands were all over him, gripping, fondling, pulling at his hair one minute then stroking his back the next.</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d he murmured as his mouth scorched my skin and nibbled across the curve of my neck until he was suckling my shoulder. His hands ran down my sides to my thighs then back up again. I leaned my head back, his rough hands caressing my wet skin. I needed it stronger. I wanted more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped. \u201cYou still on the pill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck.\u201d</p><p>His hands leaving me drained my body of heat even though the water was still driving down on us. My eyes flew open.</p> <p>\u201cLogan?\u201d I was breathing hard, and I reached for him unable to stop myself. I needed him, screw sensible. I didn\u2019t know how to be sensible around him. He knocked sensible right out of the universe.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. It was that voice. That deep, resounding voice he used when I was forced to call him Master.</p><p>My body lurched with desire, and I stopped breathing as I stared at him watching me. This man controlled everything about me.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged.</p> <p>\u201cPart your legs.\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>\u201cWider.\u201d</p><p>I did, my chest rising and falling as my eyes never left his. He moved in, then his hand cupped me, and I moaned at the touch.</p><p>\u201cShh, Emily. No sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d It was me still begging. His hand moved away, and I cried out grabbing for his hand to put it back. But he stopped me with one look, and my hands dropped to my sides, and I knew exactly what he was doing to me. He\u2019d make me wait. He\u2019d fill my body with such need that I\u2019d do anything for him so he\u2019d end my blissful torture.</p> <p>\u201cNo touching.\u201d The orders were familiar, but this time I knew the intent of the man who said them. Logan loved me, and damn it, he knew this is what I needed. He\u2019d known all along, and he was showing me that no matter what he\u2019d done to me for those two weeks, I desired this. I wanted this and still did.</p><p>He never forced me. He gave me what I wanted, yet I tried to deny.</p><p>I nearly broke when his fingers glided down between my breasts to my bellybutton then lower until he was slipping back and forth through my folds. My eyes closed, legs shook, and I held my breath as he tortured me. The pads of his two fingers scissored on either side of my clit, just touching then backing off again. I was about to break when his fingers drove inside me, and my head fell back hard against the tiled wall. When I moaned, he withdrew, and I nearly screamed at him, but knew that I got nothing doing that, so I looked at him and swallowed, waiting.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He smiled, and his fingers circled my clit, slow and soft until I was panting, the urgency building in me so intense. I was desperate to come.</p><p>But Logan didn\u2019t let me as he pulled back and bent his head to suckle my nipples, first one and then the other. His hands gripped my hips while he relentlessly pulled on the sensitive nipple with his teeth until he saw my body tense and arch against him in pain. Then he let go and circled the sensitive nub with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>The moment I had my cheek up against the tiles, he took my hands and placed them above my head spread eagle. His hands curled around my wrists and locked them there.</p><p>I pushed back into him and felt his cock twitch as it touched my ass. He groaned, and his mouth delved into the crook of my neck. \u201cI need my cock inside you. I need to fuck you so hard I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll break you.\u201d</p> <p>In response, I wiggled against him, and he let go of my wrist to slide down my chest to between my legs where he began his assault, bringing me so close yet stopping again and again until I almost cried.</p><p>\u201cLogan. Now. Please. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBend over.\u201d He took a step back so I could.</p><p>He groaned, and then his fingers wove into my hair and pulled back so he could reach my mouth. His kiss was fierce as he pushed inside me so deep it was almost painful. He filled me, the swell of him stretching my insides as he began to move in and out. His arm locked around my waist, my hands pressed up against the wall, his mouth at my ear, hearing his rough, harsh breathing as he went faster.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d He drove harder, and I pushed back against him. \u201cI can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t ever stop.\u201d</p><p>He pushed again and again, pumping into me, water pounding onto our backs and shoulders. The water may be running cold by now, but I didn\u2019t care, because I couldn\u2019t feel it. All I could feel were Logan\u2019s teeth biting my shoulder and mine biting my lip.</p><p>When his hand came between my legs and touched my clit, I screamed and went over the edge, long jolts ricocheting through me as he relentlessly pounded until his entire body tightened, and he shoved hard one last time.</p><p>Twitches flickered through my body as he leaned into me, hands covering mine against the wet tiles. His fingers curled until our fingers were knit together then I felt the jerk of his cock before he pulled out.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Logan whispered close to my ear. He brought our arms down then locked his around me. He kissed the side of my neck. \u201cI\u2019d have never fucked you if you didn\u2019t want it. Never. When we were together ... Eme, that was just me and you. No one else. I was scared there too, and I needed you.\u201d He stepped out of the shower and snagged a towel. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I turned off the taps and came to him. He dried my body, slow and gentle, taking his time. It was erotic the way his hands ran over my skin in a rhythmic stroke with the softness of the towel.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I\u2019d just been given an orgasm to kill all orgasms. Yeah, I was good.</p><p>He nodded once then grabbed a towel and walked out of the bathroom.</p><p>I stood staring at myself in the mirror, my skin pink from the water and Logan\u2019s hands. I could see his teeth marks in my left shoulder and another red mark further up, below my ear. I ran my finger across it then down to my shoulder where he left his mark on me, and then I closed my eyes and wrapped my arms around myself. I still felt him all over me, inside of me like he was swimming through my veins.</p><p>I loved him. This man that had broken me, and at the same time saved me. We were both broken in a way. I realized that he was more than me. We were unable to be repaired. But maybe that was why we were so good together.</p><p>Logan</p><p>He heard the door to the bathroom open and his cock sprang to attention before she even appeared. Fuck. It was like the flood gates of the Hoover Dam had been broken. He wanted to have her again so bad; it was excruciating. Nothing, not even the months of torture he\u2019d endured had hurt more than being denied Emily.</p><p>Logan lay on his back, one arm crooked above his head as he watched her walk out of the bathroom wearing his white button-down shirt that barely covered her ass. She looked like a timid angel; she was nervous, her steps hesitant and pausing near the bed. He made no secret of his appreciation and took in every inch of her. She flushed under his intense gaze; and it was sweet, and his cock was already swelling, needing her again.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d lost this woman. He thought he\u2019d die in that shitty cold cellar. Raul had done a number on him, gutted Dave right in front of him, and that was only the beginning. Being a fighter didn\u2019t help against chains that held his muscles stretched past their limit. He could remember hearing the click of the door, the inevitable slow stride of Raul as he walked through the darkness until father stood in front of his son. Then Raul asked the same question he asked every single day for months. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>And Logan gave his same answer. \u201cFuck you.\u201d He\u2019d suffer a thousand years before he\u2019d give up Emily or his mother\u2019s location. Deck had relocated his mother, and Emily was safe at the farm with Deck and his men making certain nothing touched her.</p><p>Yeah, he was screwed up after Deck got him out of there, took three months to physically recover and then another few to get his head on straight. He grew up with fucked up shit; he knew how to cope, block shit out. That didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t have trouble dealing; it meant he found an outlet\u2014his music.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d Her soft voice was a whisper of sweetness, and he shoved the memory into the locked, black box of his mind.</p><p>\u201cBaby, come here.\u201d She almost looked fragile, the shielded look in her eyes was gone. He\u2019d fucked it right out of her. It was about goddamn time too.</p><p>She knelt on the bed, and the shirt moved up to reveal her inner thigh. He groaned as his cock twitched again. This is what she did to him. He was putty in her hands, and the fucked up thing was she thought he was the one in control.</p><p>When she started to crawl up from the end of the bed toward him like a cat, he nearly blew his load. Every muscle tensed, and he was panting like a female dog in heat. She wasn\u2019t trying to be sexy; it was just the way she moved that sent his libido through the sky right into Pluto.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take watching her anymore and grabbed her under the arms and pulled her up against him. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sore, I\u2019m fucking you again.\u201d</p><p>Heat flashed in her eyes, and he wanted to bow to the Gods for giving him this woman. A water droplet slipped down a strand of her hair, and he caught it between his fingers before it dropped onto her shirt. He slipped his finger into his mouth and tasted the scent of her shampoo, coconut papaya with a hint of vanilla.</p><p>He rolled her over onto her back then came on top of her, grabbing her hands so they were above their heads. \u201cHold the rails.\u201d</p><p>His cock was at full attention and hardened further when he saw her submit to his command. She was so submissive, and she didn\u2019t even know it. Damn, she was made for him. Screw the shit that went down. Screw everything; this woman had him locked to her, and he\u2019d suffer a million Raul\u2019s in order to be right where he was now.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>And that right there, her soft begging of his name could undo any man. He grit his teeth to keep from plunging into her and not stopping until he came. Instead, he hardened his jaw and gave her what she wanted and needed.</p><p>\u201cUse one hand. Play with your breasts.\u201d He waited, watching to see what she\u2019d do, and slowly, she obeyed, caressing the swells, her fingers circling her nipples. \u201cPinch them.\u201d Her mouth fell open, hesitant at first, but she did it. And it was beautiful. Her back arched, and she gasped as her fingers tightened on the perky red peaks. Damn.</p><p>\u201cHarder.\u201d He saw the reluctance again. She needed this just as much as he did. \u201cHarder, Emily.\u201d</p><p>When her fingers squeezed her nipples this time, he saw her wince, and every one of her muscles lying beneath him tightened. Perfect. Fuckin\u2019 perfect. He pushed her hand aside then leaned down and grabbed her nipple between his teeth and pulled until he heard her suck in air. Then, he swirled his tongue soft and sweet around the nub, soothing the pain.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs, baby.\u201d There was no hesitation at that, and he smiled as he reached between them and felt her soaking wet already\u2014or still. Whichever, it didn\u2019t matter. Her pelvis tilted toward him, and he shook his head. \u201cNo. Wait.\u201d He wanted to laugh when he saw her frustration, the adorable flash of defiance in her eyes and then the deep breath and her resolve to obey.</p><p>He slipped his finger inside her and groaned. So tight. No wonder his cock wanted her so bad.</p><p>He curled his finger inside her while his thumb played with her clit, circling, stroking, changing between hard and soft pressure, never letting her body know what he was doing next. He watched her face, the play of emotions telling him when she was getting too close and he needed to back off.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it. Stop torturing me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was a little pissed now, and he couldn\u2019t have that. She should know better. He stopped his thumb\u2019s movement but kept his finger inside her, completely still. He let her make the mistake and move up against him, trying to get what she desperately needed. Fuck, it was like being handed a slice of heaven. He almost caved seeing her body move up and down on his finger, and if he hadn\u2019t just had her in the shower he would\u2019ve said fuck it and taken her.</p><p>\u201cNo moving.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open, and she stopped moving. There was that look of panic on her face, not from whether he\u2019d hurt her, well ... a little ... but how he was going to make her scream. \u201cI think you know the rules?\u201d</p><p>Frozen, she gave him those begging eyes, and he wanted to eat her out for a goddamn two-week feast. Instead, he decided to eat her out and have her squirming into his mouth for mercy. And he\u2019d let her scream, he decided. Just hearing her voice was going to make him come. Christ, little did she know that this was more torture for him than her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need to beg.\u201d His mouth twitched when he saw her eyes close briefly and her head sink further back into the pillow. Yeah, better lay back and relax, because he was taking his sweet ass time.</p><p>He kissed his way down her body, tongue tasting every inch of her delectable velvet skin until he reached her naked mound. Fuck, he loved that she kept herself shaved.</p><p>Her head moved back and forth as he took her in his mouth and sucked. Jesus, she tasted like paradise wrapped up in a bow. He groaned, the vibration making her shudder and her legs quiver. He pushed her legs up so her knees bent more.</p><p>\u201cWider.\u201d That\u2019s all he needed to say; she hadn\u2019t forgotten. She parted her legs to the limit, and he moved in to start his feast, tongue rolling over her clit then sliding down into the wetness and back up again. He used his fingers to part her and sunk in deep, pushing his tongue up into her.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Logan. Stop.\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t in pain. He could hear the pleasure in her voice. And if it pleased her, he would never stop. He ignored her pleas and swirled his tongue around her clit, feeling her tremble and her back arch up pushing herself further into his mouth. She was close. Fuck. He wanted her to come so he could swallow every inch of her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, honey. Please let me come.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let that happen, not yet. He slipped his fingers into her and pumped hard and fast, but purposely avoided touching where she was burning for him to finish her off. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cEme, legs.\u201d She was trying to close them, to find some sort of relief. \u201cOpen. Now.\u201d She instantly obeyed hoping he\u2019d give her a reward sooner. Not happening. He lived to see her writhe beneath him.</p><p>He moved up her body and heard her groan of frustration, but he wouldn\u2019t let it deter him. She needed this just as much as he did. He stopped to circle his tongue around her nipples then continued upward until he was face-to-face to her half-lidded eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet go, Emily.\u201d He wanted her hands on him, touching him, setting him in flames like a fuckin\u2019 city on fire. Her hands sunk into his hair, and he took her mouth, kissing her until she was gasping for breath. When he drew back, he saw the complete and utter submission, and if he wasn\u2019t lying on the bed, he\u2019d be on his goddamn knees. She did that to him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m making you come in my mouth. Then I\u2019m fucking you until you come again.\u201d He didn\u2019t expect a reply; she could barely breathe by the way her chest was heaving beneath him.</p><p>By the time he reached her pussy, her hands were gripping tightly in his hair and her body was wiggling. He thought she\u2019d come before he even reached his destination.</p><p>\u201cTilt for me.\u201d When she pushed up with her pelvis and he stared down at that gleaming, naked pussy, he came a little bit, and it pissed him off. He was losing control, and fuck if that was happening. As his eyes roamed up her body to lock with hers; he knew that this woman could destroy him. He let go of his emotions to get her back; he never felt so vulnerable as he had in the last few weeks, but it was worth it.</p><p>He stared at her as she lay panting. \u201cLogan?\u201d It was a mix of begging and uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Emily. You don\u2019t get to take that from me. Ever. No one does.\u201d He saw her eyes light up with surprise, and then he went down on her and made her world spiral out of control, and fuck, did she scream.</p><p>When he entered her she was limp and pliable beneath him. \u201cLegs.\u201d He helped her slip them around his hips, and then he had his way ... Well, he always had his way, but it was all about her. Always. It was knowing what she needed and when. With her pleasure, came his. He went slow and took his time, building her up again until she was quivering then calling out his name as her body tensed and shook.</p><p>God, it was the most beautiful sight. Emily wrapped around him trembling, her lips against his, the sweet scent of her skin so close he tasted it. And when he released into her groaning her name, his hands interlocked with hers above their heads.</p><p>When Logan rolled over, he took her with him so her one leg was over top of his and her head was on his chest. He stroked her hair and closed his eyes, squeezing her to him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, Logan,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cEme, us ... We\u2019re only broken when we\u2019re apart.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>I woke to my face snuggled into the crook of his neck, hand resting on his chest and my legs entwined with Logan\u2019s. The scent of him with each breath had my insides quaking and my stomach dropping. It felt warm and safe and protective.</p><p>Logan. It was hard to fathom that I was in his bed. My body sore but still wanting more of him. I inhaled deep, and my nipples brushed up against him. He was intoxicating, and I didn\u2019t want to get out of bed ever, but another need pushed me to get up.</p><p>I slowly tried to slip my legs out from under his and lift his arm that was slung over my waist. I\u2019d made it a few inches before he moaned and, with one rough yank, pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cNot ready to get up,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cKiss me good morning, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Kiss me. And if it\u2019s good, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d I stammered.</p><p>One of his eyes flicked open, and his brows rose. \u201cI can lie in bed all day. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to pee, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter kiss me quick then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I really did need to pee and arguing over this was only going to make it harder on me. Besides, I wanted to kiss him. Tilting my head up so my lips were on par with his, I leaned forward and kissed him. The second moisture connected to moisture, I shivered.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d He rolled me over to my back and hovered above me.</p><p>I was breathing hard, my heart pounding and everything inside me pulsating as I met his eyes. He did that sexy half-grin, and his eyes were dancing.</p><p>\u201cAre you good?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Too breathless for words. Afraid my voice would crack.</p><p>The weight of him felt so good, powerful and warm and ... and all Logan. He was my sweet. My popsicle and I was melting into him further and further. I still was uncertain for how long, but for now I was letting him in. I\u2019d think about my plans to move out later; right now I felt as if I was finally healing, and I was grabbing hold while I could.</p><p>He groaned and backed off, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. \u201cGo pee. I\u2019ll make coffee. Two creams, no sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He nodded then left, and I got up and went to the bathroom.</p><p>I came downstairs wearing my black breeches and pink T-shirt. I had tied my hair back in a low ponytail, and after contemplating how much makeup to put on for a good ten minutes, not wanting appear like I tried too hard, because despite what I tried to convince myself, I did want to look good for Logan.</p><p>I ended up with mascara and light pink lip gloss.</p><p>I padded into the kitchen and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d even heard me when he nodded toward the steaming coffee on the island. \u201cYours, Mouse.\u201d</p><p>Walking toward it, I couldn\u2019t help but eye his broad naked back as he flipped something in the frying pan. He reached up into the cupboard. There was a tat I\u2019d noticed last night on the opposite side of his Tear Asunder tat. It was of a horse, rearing up, but it was broken like a heart cut in half. Jagged edges split it down the center. The edges matched perfectly or at least it appeared as they did. Between the two pieces of the horse was a guitar with its strings broken, and the intense, black lines looped around the horse\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cYou hear me?\u201d</p><p>I jerked. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>He half-turned toward me. \u201cToast, baby. Push it down for me. Eggs are nearly done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Sure.\u201d I walked over to the counter and pushed the lever down, and the bread disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou want orange juice or is coffee good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust coffee.\u201d</p><p>He took the frying pan off the burner while I got the plates. He scooped a heaving amount onto both plates then set the pan in the sink and started the blender. He still did his protein shake.</p><p>I smiled as I went to the toaster just as the toast popped to a nice golden brown. Wasn\u2019t often a toaster did its job to perfection. I quickly pulled them out and placed two pieces each on our plates then buttered them.</p><p>He looked relaxed working in the kitchen. It was sexy and ... Well, it was hot having a guy standing over the stove making eggs. If he grew up in the compound with Raul, he couldn\u2019t have spent much time doing stuff like this. My guess, Raul had slaves to feed them.</p><p>I felt him come up next to me, and I looked up just as his hand settled on top of mine. \u201cYou\u2019re drowning the bread.\u201d</p><p>I looked down and laughed, noticing the gobs of butter on one piece of toast. \u201cOh.\u201d I began scrapping it off when he stilled my movements. He leaned his back against the counter then swung me around so that I was up against him, butter knife in one hand and my other grabbing hold of his bicep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re distracted. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re comfortable here. The kitchen I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, lots of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Huh.</p><p>\u201cJust ask.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to hurt him bringing up his childhood. He\u2019d always been closed off about his life. Would he not want to tell me? Would he let me in?</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well you grew up with Raul. I just thought, that you ... I don\u2019t know, you wouldn\u2019t have learned to cook.\u201d</p><p>His hands rubbed slowly up and down my arms. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see a kitchen there. Spent most my time training, but food was always available. I learned to cook after we escaped and came here. My mother was a ghost, barely spoke, just existed. It was like all the adrenaline and fight she had was to protect me and then to get us out; the trauma finally caught up to her, and she crashed. So, I looked after her. And I learned to cook.\u201d Logan stopped stroking my arms, and I looked up into his eyes. \u201cI grew up in a shit place with shittier people who had no morals or values. My mom tried to shield me from that. She fought hard against it so I wouldn\u2019t get stained by it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy the time I was six I was seeing and understanding what she saw, the horror and disgust with who Raul was. She shielded that from me as best she could. I learned patience and persistence from her too, resilience that I was better than all of them. The fighting helped to release my anger at what they were doing to the women, and yes, there were children. All Raul cared about was making me the best fighter he could. So I was left untouched by most of it. But my mother ...\u201d I rested my head on his shoulder and tightened my arms; tears streamed down my face as I listened. \u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t so lucky. She suffered. But she also knew how to keep Raul happy, so she did what she had to do. To survive. To protect me. She gave me that will to fight for whatever I wanted. To never give up. And to protect whatever I love with everything I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got out. And I learned how to cook. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a damn good thing for you.\u201d</p><p>I half-smiled into his shirt, and I could feel his chuckle rumble in his chest. \u201cMouse, eggs are getting cold.\u201d He grabbed the plates, and we went to the stools and sat next to one another. \u201cYou\u2019re dressed to ride.\u201d</p> <p>Despite knowing what I was wearing, I still looked down at myself. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll take Havoc out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you with me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ah I ...\u201d</p><p>His fork dropped on the plate and made a loud clang. \u201cNo running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d And for the first time, I meant it.</p> <p>He grabbed my chin and made me look at him. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I attempted to dislodge his hand, but he held tight.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re not running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running.\u201d</p><p>He let me go and nodded as if satisfied with my answer. \u201cYou\u2019re meeting my mom. Not today, but you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Oh God.</p> <p>\u201cYour mom is no longer part of our lives, and I know you haven\u2019t seen her in years. Now you\u2019re getting my mom.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d But I knew the answer. Deck. It had to be Deck. In the two years Logan had been vacant from my life, Deck must have kept him informed. That\u2019s why he checked up on me. Oh God, all this time, Logan had been watching out for me. It might explain the \u201cbuddy\u201d thing, how close they appeared now. Deck and Logan had been talking for the last two years.</p><p>When I met his eyes, he knew I knew.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Eme. I kept tabs on you. Deck made certain you were good. I had to be sure you were looked after. Even if I couldn\u2019t be with you. Even if this shit took me from you, I\u2019d always know you were looked after. Now, go get changed. Wear jeans and a sexy white blouse. I\u2019m taking you on my bike, we\u2019re riding a while then we\u2019re getting ice cream.\u201d</p><p>It was then I let it go. All of the mistrust, the pain, the hurt. I let it all go, and I let Logan\u2019s security wrap around my heart. He was mine, and I was his, and I wanted him to protect me. And it wasn\u2019t because I was passive or weak or helpless. It was because he gave me everything I needed. A basic pure and raw need he fulfilled because he cared about me.</p><p>Logan must have sensed some of my epiphany, because he was there, reaching out his hand and taking me into his arms.</p><p>Logan was my avalanche.</p><p>He crashed into my life again and wiped everything bad between us away, until I was naked with nothing except acceptance for what happened to us. It wasn\u2019t me anymore; it was us.</p> <p>We spent the day on his bike, eating ice cream, and talking, We laughed. We went to the city and saw Georgie at the coffee shop then had dinner at the Brazen Head where we first ate when we were a new couple over two years ago.</p><p>Logan even kissed me outside, up against the wall like he\u2019d done back then. We made it back to the farm record time, though Logan took care to obey most traffic laws. He\u2019d once told me he liked to drive fast, but when I was with him, his cargo was more precious than his pleasure. We didn\u2019t stop to chat to Kite and Ream sitting in the kitchen; instead, Logan dragged me upstairs and we made love\u2014hot, hard, and fast. Then I fell asleep nested within his embrace.</p><p>I woke to Logan nuzzling my neck, his leg between mine as he slid his cheek across my back. His arm draped over my hip, fingers splaying on my stomach. I smiled as shivers trickled across my skin when his velvet tongue licked the sensitive part below my ear.</p><p>\u201cMouse?\u201d The gravelly whispered words made my insides ache to be taken again. \u201cI can feel your heart pounding.\u201d</p><p>Linking my fingers with his, I pulled him closer. We were still naked, and his cock jerked against my butt. \u201cPut it inside me, honey.\u201d</p><p>He tensed.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>Then he let my hand go, and his fingers traveled down my skin until he slid into the heat between my legs. \u201cShit, you\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always wet for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I love that.\u201d He untangled our legs then in a slow languid motion, he pushed himself inside me.</p><p>I groaned and pushed back against him.</p><p>\u201cDamn. You\u2019re tight.\u201d</p><p>It was a slow before-breakfast sex, not the hard desperate need of last night. Instead, he held me close, our bodies connected, awakening from sleep with a slow ride into stomach dropping ecstasy.</p><p>It was hot.</p><p>Logan kissed my neck, my back then held me up against him while murmuring sweet words of love in my ear. Each sensation was engraved in my mind, just like he was. We were set in stone.</p><p>The morning was lazy as we made love twice more, each time more intense than the last. I was raw and sore, but as soon as he touched me, I was ready for him again. There was no pretention, no worries, and I did as he wanted and left the thinking out of the bedroom.</p><p>By eleven we ambled from our nest, and I went to shower while Logan went to make some calls. He was on the phone when I came downstairs, hair still wet. I could see Ream and Kite outside by the pool talking.</p><p>Logan nodded to a mug sitting on the island then he walked to the sliding door that led out to the pool. He stepped out, and I sat on one of the stools and watched as he paced back and forth, his brows lowered and the crease around his eyes accentuated.</p><p>There was no doubt he was angry about something. He took long strides; his muscles flexing beneath his T-shirt, hair falling haphazardly across his forehead. I wanted to encase him in my embrace and take away whatever was riling him up.</p><p>He kicked one of the patio chairs, and it toppled over. He looked up. Saw me. Stared for three seconds then turned away and began pacing again.</p><p>When he came back inside he tossed his phone on the counter and came right for me. He sat on the bar stool, grabbed either side of my stool, and pulled me in close so my legs were between his. Then he rested his hands on either side of my outer thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou and me, we need time together. I\u2019m trying to get that time.\u201d He rubbed his hands up and down my thighs and a quiver shot through me. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a but?\u201d I raised my brows and tilted my head.</p><p>He huffed. \u201cSmart ass.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. The first time we talked about buts, he took my virginity.</p><p>Logan leaned in close and cupped my chin. \u201cBut I love smart ass Emily. She\u2019s cute, and I want to spend the next sixty years listening to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, okay.\u201d I leaned forward and went into him, my mouth coming down on his as I took what I\u2019d gone without for far too long.</p><p>\u201cI have to meet Deck this morning. We have that party in a week, and we need to run over a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party. Right.\u201d Logan had mentioned something about a party a while ago.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had one almost every year at Matt\u2019s bar since the band started, but this year we\u2019re having it here. Manager has organized a few producers to come hear us play.\u201d</p><p>Oh. This was big for the band. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Logan. Really great.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come with you and go hang with Georgie at the coffee shop while you talk to Deck.\u201d</p><p>His face grew dark, and his hand tightened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I don\u2019t have any horses coming today or clients, and I can ride Havoc later when it\u2019s cooler. What else am I going to do without you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie by the pool. Go back to bed. Watch a movie. Just promise you won\u2019t leave the farm. And no trail rides. I want you close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d Something wasn\u2019t right. Why didn\u2019t he want me going on a trail ride? Why close by? \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Eme. I just worry when I\u2019m not with you.\u201d</p><p>I knew the second that he said the words that he was avoiding telling me something when his index finger tapped against my hip. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, it\u2019s not that at all.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>It felt like minutes before he spoke and I could see him contemplate ignoring me, by the way he avoided looking at me. Then he did and I wished he hadn\u2019t because I knew what he was going to tell me wasn\u2019t good. \u201cDeck has been looking for Alfonzo. He was seen at the auction Raven was at. That\u2019s how we found out he\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>I felt sick to my stomach. I\u2019d assumed Alfonzo had died, if not when Logan had beaten him to a bloody pulp then when the compound was taken down.</p><p>Logan cupped my cheek. \u201cAlfonzo has no clue about the farm. Deck\u2019s men have made certain none of us have been followed here for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve know about this for weeks?\u201d Of course he had. That explained why he\u2019d warned me to be careful, why Deck came to get them at the bar. Why Logan came with me to Rob\u2019s farm to work with the racehorse. Or that could\u2019ve been just as he said\u2014to be with me.</p><p>\u201cWeeks, yes. But Alfonzo wasn\u2019t a threat to you. He was in New York up until yesterday. But, Deck\u2019s man lost him.\u201d Logan kissed me and it was long and slow, lingering. \u201cI tried to cancel the party, but it\u2019s not just me here. It\u2019s the guys. They need this. Deck\u2019s doing security and is confident that the farm is still safe. That might change though.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I was scared and nervous, but for some reason not as much as I thought I would be. I was more focused on the fact that Logan had trusted me to be able to handle this. Because I knew Logan and the reason he hadn\u2019t told me up until now was because he didn\u2019t want me feeling scared, or nervous.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can stay inside and play with my vibrator.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s brows lowered, and his eyes got that dark intensity. He was so sexy when he heard something he didn\u2019t like. \u201cThat pussy doesn\u2019t get fucked, touched, or played with without me. You need it, I\u2019m happy to give it to you. But you, lying in bed playing by yourself\u2014no.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to laugh; instead, I hid my smile, because I thought laughing might be bad considering he looked genuinely angry. I liked that he wanted to be the one to look after my needs. It was hot, and I felt wanted, treasured. \u201cOkay, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you call me that. Cute and sweet.\u201d He got up and walked over to the sink and started putting dishes into the dishwasher. \u201cWhat are you going to do while I\u2019m gone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll ride your horse then lounge by the pool.\u201d</p><p>He stopped what he was doing and was quiet for a second. \u201cThey\u2019ve never been mine, Emily. Any horse here has always been yours. The bike is my horse. I\u2019m not getting on anything that can kick, bite, and toss me on my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bike can toss you on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not coming back to bite me afterward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLogan, the horses aren\u2019t going to bite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can stand up on their hind legs and dump me on my ass then come down on my head with big feet that cost a fortune every few weeks to get manicures.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou mean rearing up, and horses don\u2019t like to step on people. Actually, they avoid it at all costs, and their feet are called hooves which need trimming every six weeks or you\u2019ll have crabby horses walking around on overgrown turned up toes. For your information, Sculpt.\u201d He growled low, and then set the fork he had in his hand on the counter and started stalking toward me. I moved to my feet, but not in time to avoid his dive for me. He snagged my arm and, in one swoop, lifted me up and over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy real name. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I teased.</p> <p>\u201cMy name, say it.\u201d</p><p>I knew what would happen and it made me giddy inside. It had been a long time since I felt this playful and relaxed. Fine, I could admit to being totally and irrefutably in love. \u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t want to\u2014Sculpt?\u201d</p><p>He smacked my ass and started for the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll fuck you all day.\u201d My heart rate tripled.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You\u2019re meeting Deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck will understand.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my butt. \u201cSculpt. Stop.\u201d But really, I didn\u2019t want him to stop anything as he took the stairs two at a time, kicked the bedroom door open then closed, and then threw me on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSculpt.\u201d</p><p>He came down hard on top of me, already tearing off my shirt. I struggled at first, laughing until his hand brushed against my nipple, and I gasped.</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d I said, knowing if I didn\u2019t he\u2019d torture me for longer than I wanted or could take.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t do that again, will you?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated.</p> <p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Logan.\u201d</p><p>His mouth came down hard on mine, and then he fucked me.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>We had a week of lying by the pool and having sex and doing nothing but being together. He did spend some time with the band practicing, but the guys made themselves scarce whenever they could. I rarely saw Kat, and my guess was she was staying at the condo with Matt most nights. Whether it was to give Logan and me some time alone or to avoid Ream, I didn\u2019t know for sure, but I was guessing the latter.</p><p>Georgie popped by with Deck, and we hung by the pool while Deck and Logan went off to chat. Logan had been strung up as tight his guitar strings, but he played it off as nothing but the plans for the party. I knew it was Alfonzo that was getting to him, but when I asked about it he threw me over his shoulder then took the stairs two at a time and tossed me on the bed where he had me forgetting everything except him between my legs. Then we did some slexing, and ate our next meal in bed.</p><p>It was sweet, and he fed me grapes and wine. He commanded and I surrendered to him. I never thought I\u2019d find submitting to a man again sensual after what I\u2019d seen in Mexico, but it wasn\u2019t about that. It was about submitting to the love we shared. I realized giving up my control to Logan didn\u2019t make me weak. It was my escape. My need, and he was fulfilling that by giving me what I needed. It was about complete openness and trust.</p><p>And I did love him. I never stopped; it had just been smothered.</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d</p><p>I looked up. Logan had stopped playing his guitar and was looking at me with eyes that were so exposed and revealing. I felt like I could see right into them, all his desires and strength, even a hint of uncertainty that lay beneath the depths.</p><p>We were sitting in the horse field like we used to do, and he was playing me the new song the band was debuting tonight at the party. It was mellow, raw, crass, and it brought tears to my eyes. His voice cut through the words as if he hurt to say them.</p><p>It was called \u201cTorn from You,\u201d and it was about us.</p><p>He reached forward and wiped the stray tear from my cheek. I leaned into his hand and smiled, closing my eyes. I never thought we\u2019d get back to this place. I think I was afraid to hope that we could.</p><p>\u201cThat song\u2019s going to make you famous. It\u2019s beautiful. I love you, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He put his guitar aside then grabbed me, flipped me onto my back and hovered above.</p><p>Slowly his weight lowered onto me, and I felt his cock press between my legs. It sent the raging through my body.</p><p>\u201cAre you good with being fucked out in the middle of a horse field?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, because it was out in a horse field where he had taken my virginity. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m good with that. Now kiss me,\u201d I ordered.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m rubbing off on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop messing around and put your cock inside me, rock star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Eme.\u201d He groaned, and his mouth smashed onto mine. It was hard, and it was Logan taking what I was giving to him with every part of myself.</p><p>We were putting our clothes back on\u2014well I was; he was doing up his jeans\u2014when I heard the gate off in the distance clang.</p><p>I looked up. \u201cDeck.\u201d</p><p>Logan turned then quickly stood in front of me while I finished clasping my bra and pulled on my shirt. When I was done, I came up beside him and took his hand; he squeezed.</p><p>\u201cEmily. Logan.\u201d Deck chin-lifted. He looked pissed, but then again, Deck always was hard to read. His mood could easily be off because he had a shitty coffee this morning. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d He directed the statement at Logan.</p><p>Logan stiffened, and I knew Deck didn\u2019t have a problem with shitty coffee. This was about Alfonzo.</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d Logan leaned down and kissed me then let my hand go.</p><p>\u201cIs it about him?\u201d I asked Deck. \u201cDid you find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her.\u201d Logan put his arm over my shoulders.</p><p>Deck nodded once. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t resurfaced yet. But we do know he hasn\u2019t crossed the border. We have that angle covered.\u201d Deck nodded to me. \u201cYou mind giving us a few minutes, Emily?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in asking if I could stay. Both these guys were super protective and they\u2019d want to keep as much of this from me as possible.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll start getting ready for tonight.\u201d I started to walk away when Logan snagged my hand and brought me up against his chest. Deck stepped away from us and turned his back. Then Logan was whispering into my ear with that sexy voice that dialed up my desire once again.</p><p>\u201cTake a shower. Then lie naked on our bed on your back. Arms above your head. Legs apart, knees bent.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched, and I pulled back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tie you up.\u201d</p><p>Again my breath hitched, but because I remembered the last time I was tied up and left alone for hours.</p><p>I was still shaking my head no when he tucked my hair behind my ear and kissed the tip of my nose. \u201cYou trust me?\u201d</p><p>I did. Despite what happened, I knew everything he\u2019d done was to protect me. \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about being helpless. Or me dictating or controlling. It\u2019s about you trusting me to give you what your body needs. It\u2019s knowing I\u2019ll always take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, still hesitant at the thought of ropes around me. It made me nervous and unsure of myself, and yet, I wanted to trust him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and then he let me go, and I was walking away, my heart slamming against my ribs. Fear or excitement tap danced through me. There was a fine line between the two.</p><p>By the time Logan came into the room, my limbs were trembling so badly the bed was shaking.</p><p>His eyes traveled down my naked body then back up. His expression to others would look cold, dark, maybe even stiff, but what I saw was deeper, and it was awe. It was what kept me on my back and not running for my life. He looked so floored at the sight before him, and all my confidence skyrocketed, because I could do this to him.</p><p>He kicked the door shut, and the loud noise made me jump, but I kept in the position he\u2019d asked of me.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d His eyes were on my pussy that I swear was leaking wetness down the inside of my thighs having him stare at me like that. \u201cJesus.\u201d His eyes came to mine. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d I wanted him to stop standing there and come to me, but he was taking his time, just admiring the sight, and it made me hotter, and I was shifting uneasily as my need heightened. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Logan walked over to the dresser by the far wall, and opened the lower drawer. I heard him shuffling around and then he stood up straight with a black silk scarf in his hands. My chest started heaving.</p><p>The bed dipped.</p><p>He knelt near my head, the silk falling over his wrist as he reached for my hands. I jerked away, and he frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, baby.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but the thought of being tied up again and unable to get away sent my stomach churning.</p><p>He let the scarf fall to lie over my wrists then cupped my chin and turned my head to look at him instead of at the scarf. \u201cYou can always say no. One word and it stops. I think you need this. We need it. I want your trust, and to get that we have to work through what happened. Change what you\u2019re feeling to something beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I breathed, and it was a lie.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. You haven\u2019t. I saw your face when I mentioned tying you up.\u201d Logan leaned forward and kissed me. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready, we\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>He left the bed taking the scarf with him. The drawer opened, and the disappointment I felt was overwhelming. I did want this. I wanted him to have control. I needed to let go\u2014completely. I wanted to wash away the bad memories with good ones, and Logan could do that.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Logan turned.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I want to. I trust you, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He walked back over to me and slid the silk over my wrists. I felt the desire swim through me to replace the fear. The smooth material caressed my skin like the tip of a feather as he glided it up each arm and then down again. It wasn\u2019t rough and chafing, but soft and cool to my heated flesh.</p><p>He slowly wrapped the silk around my wrists above my head, but he didn\u2019t tie them to the bed rungs like I thought he\u2019d do. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready for that. Another time.\u201d</p><p>I was. I wanted whatever he wanted from me.</p><p>He stroked the side of my face. \u201cI want you to submit and give all of yourself to me. Fear isn\u2019t part of that.\u201d</p><p>He slipped off the bed then began to undress, and I watched, aching to touch myself as each piece of clothing fell to the floor. Then he crawled up from the bottom of the bed, so his head was between my legs.</p><p>I was gripping the bed post so tight I heard it creak with my movements. I was arching toward him, wanting him to lick me, give me what I hungered for. What I needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStay still.\u201d He ordered, and at the sound of his deep, resonate voice a wave of desire shot through me. He leaned closer, and I could feel his breath on my pussy, scorching heat blazing so hot that I was ready to scream at him to just touch me. I knew my sweet torture would last longer though.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re swollen and glistening. God, Emily. You\u2019re mine. This pussy is mine. Nothing touches it but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney. Please.\u201d My knees were trembling so badly that he had to steady them with his hands around my ankles.</p><p>Then he spread my lips apart, and his tongue touched me. I moaned, sinking further into the bed as he began suckling deep and hard, then soft and sweet. Dragging my wetness upward with his tongue, and then swirling over me, he had my entire body arching to meet him.</p> <p>Unable to touch, my hands were tied together, and Logan had complete control over my body; it was a release of pure ecstasy. A giving of myself to him, trusting him to do what I needed, what my body desired.</p><p>I was near exploding as two fingers drove inside me at the same time as he sucked hard on my clit. I screamed, arching, and he put his other hand on my stomach to keep me in place. He pulled his head back.</p><p>I moaned. \u201cOh God, Logan. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. You will wait, Emily. Every time, unless I tell you otherwise.\u201d Then he turned around and lay on his side beside me, his cock inches from my mouth, so close I could\u2019ve swept my tongue out and touched it. I wanted to, God, I wanted to taste it.</p><p>\u201cYou want this?\u201d He gripped his cock in his hand.</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019m giving it to you.\u201d His knees came on either side of my head, and then he lowered until the tip of his cock was touching my lips. \u201cOpen. Take all of me. I\u2019m coming inside your mouth, baby.\u201d</p><p>I opened, and his heated hardness came into my mouth, and I wrapped my lips around him tasting the sweet, salty pre-cum on the tip of my tongue.</p><p>He stiffened and groaned. \u201cOh fuck.\u201d He settled further on top of me, and then I felt his hands pushing my legs open.</p><p>I sucked while he moved up and down, fucking my mouth while he drove his fingers inside me and licked and sucked until I was screaming inside, wanting release. Yet every time I got close, he backed off.</p><p>His balls hit my face as he pumped hard into my mouth again and again, and I knew he was close when he began sucking on me ruthlessly.</p> <p>\u201cNow, baby.\u201d</p><p>I sucked his cock hard, taking him deep into my throat, my wrists straining against the silk scarf as my body arched then reached its peak at the same time as I felt him stiffen. His cock was deep in my mouth, and the spurt of his cum slipped down my throat. I swallowed and moaned and swallowed more as he came at the same time I did. It was beautiful and it was him giving me everything I wanted.</p><p>He pulled out then turned around and pulled me into his arms. \u201cI love you, Eme.\u201d He stroked my back then over my ass then up again until his hands undid the scarf, and I was finally able to touch him.</p><p>And with my hands on his chest feeling his heartbeat, and my head nested in the crook of his arm I fell asleep.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d</p><p>I woke to Logan\u2019s sexy voice, but it wasn\u2019t beside me.</p><p>\u201cThe party has started. Let\u2019s go, baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit. You let me sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it.\u201d</p><p>I stretched like a cat after a good nap and felt the sweet soreness in my jaw and smiled. Damn, I\u2019d never done anything so erotic as last night. The thought of Logan sent a wave of heat through me. A heat that filled my heart and made it feel\u2014complete. And when I looked up at Logan standing at the end of the bed dressed in dark jeans and a purple pinstriped button-down dress shirt, I totally fell in love all over again.</p><p>I could lie here for hours and admire him with his delicious bedroom hair and purple shirt that showed off his russet eyes.</p><p>He frowned. I licked my lips.</p><p>God, I loved him. He looked so confident and self-assured even though tonight the band had to impress some big names in the music industry. I was probably more nervous than he was.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe this man was mine. He never gave up on me. He never gave up on us.</p><p>\u201cDo I get a kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, all I want to do is say fuck it and crawl back into bed with you. So coming any closer ... is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>The sheet slipped to my waist as I sat up and I heard him groan.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>There was no question I wasn\u2019t getting a kiss, so I threw the covers aside and slipped to the edge of the bed.</p><p>His hands clenched into fists as his eyes travelled down my naked body then back up again. He shook his head back and forth and inhaled a deep breath. It felt amazing that I could do that to this man, make him want me. He\u2019d always made me feel beautiful. He still did, and I loved him even more if that was possible.</p><p>He cleared his throat, but it was still a little unsteady as he said, \u201cI bought you a dress. It\u2019s in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>I sat up. \u201cYou bought me a dress?\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod. \u201cShoes are there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you do that?\u201d We\u2019d spent nearly every moment of the last week together.</p><p>\u201cWhen I went to see Deck. Get dressed, Eme. Meet me downstairs. I want you to meet our new manager.\u201d He walked out of the room shutting the door a little too hard behind him, and I laughed. I also noticed how his jeans had become snug between his legs when I\u2019d thrown back the covers.</p><p>When I walked downstairs, following the sound of voices out onto patio that now had a huge white canvas tent over it, I was feeling ... well beautiful. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I truly felt attractive. I mean, I definitely didn\u2019t when I was a girl growing up with my mother\u2019s constant belligerence.</p><p>Logan was staring at me.</p><p>Our eyes locked. The guy he was chatting with stopped talking and turned to look at me too. Yeah, I felt beautiful. Logan had always made me feel that way. No matter what crap my mother spilled, it was all lies. The only way to make herself feel better was to put someone else down, and that someone happened to be her daughter.</p><p>My dress fit perfectly, a simple asymmetrical white chiffon skirt, plunging neckline top with a dipped back that contrasted with a subtle black lining. Logan had laid out a pair of stunning white and black strappy heels which, surprisingly, fit too. I wondered if Kat had anything to do with it.</p><p>Then there was the box he left wrapped with a yellow bow on top of my makeup bag. I gasped when I opened it, eyes filling with tears as I saw the pendant necklace laid in blue velvet. The tasteful diamonds hung on a solid, thin gold chain. When I put it on, the necklace fit snug to my neck, the pendant touching the center of my throat so that you could see my skin through the center of the diamonds. It was striking, and for a few minutes I admired it in the mirror as it nestled against my skin. I wasn\u2019t sure where he had the money for it, but it was from him, and he\u2019d been thinking about me.</p><p>When I saw the note folded neatly below the box, I smiled.</p><p>It said,</p><p>\u201cNo panties tonight, Emily. I want to be on stage knowing you\u2019re naked beneath that dress. I love every part of you.\u201d</p><p>Now he was standing in front of me and I felt like we were the only two people in the room.</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d Logan looped his arm around my waist as he leaned in and whispered in my ear \u201cYou make me breathless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do as I requested?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to laugh at him using the word \u201crequested.\u201d Logan rarely requested; he spoke, and it was done, and that wasn\u2019t only with me. I nodded, and he swore and groaned then kissed me. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>Then we were pulled apart by a voice. \u201cNow I understand what kept you away from my office this week.\u201d</p><p>Logan squeezed me in tight. It was possessive and was saying something to the guy. \u201cEmily, this is our new manager Daryl. Daryl, Emily.\u201d</p><p>I shook his hand and instantly felt the warmth emanating from him. He wore a suit and tie that fit his lean, tall form, and his hair was kept short and styled close. There was no rock star look in him. He was controlled, yet he had this casual air that made me feel relaxed.</p><p>We chatted for several minutes until the crowds started to arrive, and I was swept up into the fray as Logan introduced me to people I recognized from Avalanche, but mostly the guests were strangers. I caught a glimpse of Deck at one point, but he was in work mode, prowling the grounds and making certain the security was tight.</p><p>\u201cEmily!\u201d Georgie called as she pushed aside the throes of guests and came toward me.</p><p>She looked me up and down. \u201cDamn, you look like you\u2019re ready to be fucked or were just fucked.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWhatever, it\u2019s smacking hot. Logan, what the hell? You tying this girl up all week or what? Haven\u2019t heard a peep from her.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks heat up at the mention of being tied up, and typical Georgie didn\u2019t let it pass.</p><p>\u201cHa, well strap me down.\u201d She grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me in to whisper, \u201cRock star fighter who likes a little extracurricular activity in bed? Damn, he is one hell of a cupcake. Wonder if he likes spanking?\u201d</p><p>Matt and Kat arrived, Kat looking stunning with her little black dress and blonde hair falling down over her slim shoulders. She was nearly as tall as Matt since she was wearing her spikey black heels, and she towered over me.</p><p>Logan leaned in and squeezed my ass. \u201cStay close to Matt. He knows what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re safer in a crowd, so don\u2019t leave the party. I mean it, Eme. Not for a second.\u201d I knew he was concerned about Alfonzo even though Deck and his men had the place covered. \u201cYou need to go the bathroom or freshen up, call Deck. He will have his phone on. No one else.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI hate to be away from you even for a second.\u201d</p><p>I caressed his cheek and he took my hand and kissed my palm. \u201cMy heart is repaired, Logan. You did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d He pulled me into his arms, his hands on either side of my head as he kissed me. It was hard and intense and made me forget that we were surrounded by people. \u201cYou obliterated the bad in my life.\u201d He kissed my forehead then drew back. \u201cI have some suits to impress. You good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey.\u201d</p><p>He chin-lifted to Matt, and there was a look between them. And then Matt was beside me, his hand on the small of my back. Logan nodded then disappeared through the crowd. I saw him stop and talk to Ream who was with a cute little blonde, and then they were walking toward the stage.</p><p>It was another ten minutes before the band came on stage, and I was able to see Logan again. He was comfortable as he stood in front of the crowds, his confidence was natural, like being on stage was where he belonged.</p><p>And he did. There was no doubt that Tear Asunder was making it big, and Daryl obviously thought so, too.</p><p>Logan said a few words to the crowd and had them laughing and instantly falling under his spell. It was incredible that this man who oozed authority and power could have a group of posh executives melt at his feet. When Logan was on stage, it was like no one spoke unless he told them to.</p><p>He turned me on, but it was so much more powerful than that. It was like he was inside me, making my heart beat, my lungs breathe. He made me feel like whole again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He did repair us.</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyes found mine. I waited breathless then he winked, and I felt like he\u2019d just swept his hands over my heated skin.</p><p>\u201cThis is a new song we\u2019re playing tonight called \u2018Torn from You.\u2019\u201d He closed his eyes and nodded his head three times then Kite clicked his sticks together.</p><p>They brought it, real and raw with each cord, each note rushing a thrill through the crowd. Logan\u2019s voice was powerful, graveled and crass with the chorus, then seeking the soft deepness that sent shivers across my flesh during the verses.</p> <p>\u201cFuck. They rock.\u201d Georgie was nodding her head to the beat, and as I looked across the crowd, everyone was riveted to Logan. \u201cThinking maybe I need to get some of that.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open.</p><p>Georgie laughed. \u201cNot your man, girl. Crisis. That tongue could do me wonders.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, and Matt grunted, obviously hating to hear anything about Crisis, tongue, and Georgie in the same sentence.</p><p>The rest of the night, I didn\u2019t see much of Logan, but who I did see a lot of was Deck. He was always within eye sight of me, and Matt never left my side.</p> <p>It was one in the morning by the time everyone cleared out except the band, Georgie, Matt, and Kat. Deck appeared out of nowhere as we hung by the pool. He nodded to each of us then spoke quietly to Logan for a few minutes before he walked down the path toward the front of the house.</p><p>When Logan came back to me I looked up at him and he knew exactly what I wanted to know before I even had to ask. \u201cNo sign of him. Deck says it\u2019s highly unlikely Alfonzo can find out about the farm unless he\u2019s been following any of us, which I told you, Deck\u2019s men has made certain he hasn\u2019t. We\u2019re just taking precautions until he\u2019s located. There is no reason he\u2019d even want to come after you, Eme. It would be stupid if he did. He knows Deck\u2019s after him.\u201d</p><p>Deck shouted, \u201cGeorgie. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Georgie came up beside me and threw her arm around my shoulders. She was slurring her words, and her weight was on me. \u201cI\u2019m staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgie. Get your ass over here.\u201d Deck\u2019s voice was harsh and a little annoyed. Okay super annoyed.</p><p>\u201cPooh. No fun. I\u2019m not going with ... you.\u201d Georgie stumbled forward right into Crisis\u2019s chest. \u201cGoing to get fucked by Mr. Delicious here.\u201d</p> <p>Crisis\u2019s eyes widened then he put his arm around Georgie. I wasn\u2019t certain if that was to keep her from falling or because he was going to screw with Deck and take Georgie to bed.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Logan swore under his breath as Deck came striding toward Georgie. \u201cLet up, Crisis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Not fucking with that.\u201d Crisis whispered something into Georgie\u2019s ear, and her smile faded, and her lips pursed together in a drunken pout.</p><p>She must not have heard Deck\u2019s approach, but we all saw it, and suddenly, she was being picked up and carried over his shoulder like a sack of grain.</p><p>He never said a word as he left with a dangling Georgie that was laughing and cursing at the same time.</p><p>Logan watched them leave then without even looking at me he said, \u201cEme. Bed. Now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, caveman Logan. No more rock star with the sexy wink and to-die-for grin.</p><p>We said goodnight to everyone, and then as soon as we were out of sight, Logan was slamming me up against the wall and kissing me. \u201cFuck. I\u2019ve wanted to kiss you all goddamn night.\u201d</p> <p>His cock pressed into me as his hands weaved into my hair, and we devoured one another. It was wild and raw with nothing but raging need between us. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it to the bedroom, but we stumbled up the stairs, and I had him half naked by the time we got there and slammed the door.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t wait to take my dress off. He yanked it up, and then had me against the door, lifting me up. \u201cLegs,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>I wrapped my legs around him, hooking my ankles, and then he plunged inside me.</p><p>My head hit the wall hard with each thrust as he groaned and took me without mercy, and I wanted it.</p><p>\u201cHarder, Logan.\u201d</p><p>His hips pushed back then shoved forward harder, and I felt him sink even further into me. \u201cOh, God. Yes. Logan.\u201d</p><p>He rested his head against my shoulder, teeth biting my flesh as he groaned and thrust. \u201cNow, baby. Now.\u201d</p><p>I was there already. Each thrust putting me closer to the top until he shouted my name and I crashed and shouted with him.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He was sunk deep inside me, and I could feel his cock twitching. He raised his head from my shoulder and kissed me, hard and relentless.</p><p>He carried me to bed where he slowly undressed me, and then we made love until early morning. We fell asleep with tangled naked limbs.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>When I woke, Logan was gone, but there was a note on the pillow, and I smiled as I unfolded it.</p><p>\u201cLove you baby. In the city at the studio with the guys. Don\u2019t leave the farm, Emily. Matt\u2019s staying with you for the day. Dinner tonight, my mom\u2019s coming over.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit, I thought, then finished reading.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, Mouse. She\u2019ll love you. And I\u2019m cooking. Call me when you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>His mom was coming over, and that felt serious, because Logan hadn\u2019t shared his mom with anyone except maybe Kite. I realized that we were going to be together, but I still needed my own place. This was Logan\u2019s farm, and I know he\u2019d say different, but it felt like his, not mine. It wasn\u2019t my home, and regardless of what was happening to us, I still needed that. The question was when and how was I going to bring that up to Logan.</p><p>I reached for my phone and already there were three messages: one from Georgie asking what the hell happened last night and how did she end up sleeping in her bra and panties on Deck\u2019s bed, another from Kat about ten minutes ago asking for help rounding up the horses in the east field who broke through the fence\u2014my guess it was Havoc reacting to all the noise last night, then a text from Logan saying good morning and to call him.</p><p>I quickly dressed, a little sore from last night\u2019s marathon. I texted Georgie back first as I went to wake up Matt.</p><p>Drunk. Deck took you home. And he didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>Georgie immediately texted back.</p><p>Not drunk. Sloshed. LOL. Feel like Deck plowed my head into the side of his car. Did he?</p><p>I laughed. No doubt Deck felt like doing that.</p><p>Not that I know of. Text you later. Horses broke out last night, party must have scared them.</p><p>Georgie sent me a sad face.</p><p>Matt was passed out in the spare bedroom next to my old one. I nudged his shoulder. \u201cHey. Horses are out. I need to go help your sister round them up.\u201d</p><p>Matt groaned then rolled over and threw the covers back. He still was wearing what he had on last night. \u201cFuck. How\u2019d they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a party last night, Matt. The horses were probably scared of the noise. Come on. If they get on the road, someone could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah. I\u2019m up.\u201d Matt ran his hand back and forth over his head and then down his face. \u201cGive me a sec.\u201d</p><p>I quickly called Logan while Matt went the washroom, but it went straight to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cMorning, honey. Have fun at the studio. Still thinking about last night and thinking I need some more of that tonight. After you mother leaves. And Logan, thank you. For wanting to share her with me.\u201d</p><p>As we walked out to the back field, I didn\u2019t see Kat or the horses. Shit, that meant they\u2019d probably gone over to the neighbor\u2019s or on the road.</p><p>\u201cSo, you and Sculpt are good?\u201d Matt said, his arm slung over my shoulder as we walked up the hill.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah. We are. Really good, Matt.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my shoulders. \u201cHe loves y\u2014down.\u201d Matt suddenly shoved me away from him and I fell to the ground.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d I screamed as I watched him crumple to the grass. \u201cMatt. No, Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo near him and she dies.\u201d Alfonzo held a gun to Kat\u2019s head, and I could see blood dripping from her temple. She was gagged, and her hands were tied behind her back. Her eyes were wild with a mixture of fear and anger.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Alfonzo bellowed.</p><p>I hesitated as I looked to Matt who was clutching his leg and trying to crawl to Kat.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>I screamed as Matt\u2019s body jerked and he fell forward onto his face. \u201cNo. Stop. Stop. I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo was burning with hatred, his eyes wild and unsteady as he leered at me. His clothes were dirty and his hair was greasy like he hadn\u2019t showered in weeks.</p><p>\u201cBitch, get on the ground.\u201d</p><p>I slowly sank to my knees sobbing.</p><p>Kat made a sound, and Alfonzo raised his gun and slammed the barrel into her head. She cried out and fell to her side, and he reared back and kicked her in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed and jumped up, running toward her. I fell on top of Kat to save her from the brunt of his abuse. He continued to boot me in the side until finally, he stopped, and picked me up by the hair and forced me to kneel in front of him.</p><p>Alfonzo raised the gun.</p><p>Click.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>I screamed at the same time the bullet went off, and I saw Kat\u2019s body jerk.</p><p>\u201cNooooo! Oh God. Oh God. No. Kat.\u201d I was screaming hysterically now, tears streaming down my cheeks as a pool of her blood started to seep into ground staining the green grass.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, bitch.\u201d Alfonzo aimed the gun at me, and I waited for the pain as I crouched over Kat, refusing to leave her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll crucify you,\u201d I promised through sputtered breaths. \u201cDeck and his men. Logan. They\u2019ll kill you.\u201d My voice grew steadier. If Kat was still alive then her only chance would be to get pressure on the wound and to a hospital.</p><p>Over Alfonzo\u2019s shoulder I saw the white mare--Havoc. She must have heard my screams and the gunshot. Eyes steady and watching. Nostrils flaring. It was the only thing I could think of\u2014I whistled a long, high-pitched sound.</p><p>Havoc\u2019s ears perked, and she tossed her head then came galloping toward us. Alfonzo heard the hooves pounding into the hard ground and turned. I did two things\u2014pressed Redial on my phone then dove for Alfonzo.</p><p>I landed hard on top of him, my hands going for the gun. Havoc\u2019s hooves kept coming toward us. Alfonzo elbowed me between the ribs and knocked the wind out of me. I fell backward, and he came on top, the gun shoved hard into my chest.</p><p>\u201cI like fighters. The more you fight the better. I\u2019m going to string you up and fuck you until you bleed. You\u2019re going to suck me, and then when I\u2019m done I\u2019m going to sell you.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth and refused to look away from him.</p><p>Havoc whinnied behind us, then reared up, legs flailing.</p><p>Alfonzo turned and pointed the gun at Havoc. I yelled just as the bullet went off.</p><p>I felt the vibration in the ground as Havoc fell.</p><p>\u201cHavoc,\u201d I yelled.</p><p>Alfonzo jammed his gun so hard into my chest that my breath was cut off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d I could hear Havoc screeching and thrashing to get to her feet. \u201cRaul should\u2019ve killed Sculpt when he had the chance. Bastard was too greedy. Thought his son would join him and become his prize fighter. I knew. I warned Raul Sculpt was planning shit. But the bastard was too cocky. He thought no one would attempt to take him down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen Logan gets his hands on you\u2014you\u2019ll wish you were dead.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHe can try. But once we disappear in that world, no one will find us. Not even those elite commando guys. And your boyfriend? That bastard\u2019s blessed as fuck he\u2019s still alive. Your fighter boyfriend didn\u2019t look much like a fighter when his father tortured him for months after he let you go.\u201d I swallowed the bile in my throat. Oh, Logan. No.</p><p>\u201cI bet he couldn\u2019t even walk when that Deck guy got him out. That bastard managed to shut us down. Found Raul too. But he hasn\u2019t found me and now I have you. Raul intended for Sculpt to die a long, slow death for his betrayal. Instead, I\u2019ve made it my mission to let you take his place.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo got up, and then pulled me to my feet. He put my hands up behind my head and tied them together.</p> <p>I glanced over at Kat, trying to see if she was still alive, but I couldn\u2019t see anything. Matt moved his leg, then I saw him slowly reach in his pocket and take out his phone. He was halfway to reaching the phone to his ear when he dropped it and went still. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave them like that.\u201d</p><p>Havoc was lying on her side, her chest heaving in and out, but there was no longer any fight to get up. Deep red blood soaked into her white coat where the bullet had penetrated her neck.</p><p>He pulled me behind into the tree line. \u201cKat!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>I tried to pull free of Alfonzo, but with my hands tied above and behind my head, I quickly lost my balance and fell hard to my knees.</p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d He kicked me in the side, and I tried to stand, but couldn\u2019t. He grabbed hold of my elbow and pulled me through the bush until we reached the road where a car was parked.</p> <p>I knew the worst thing I could do was panic, Logan taught me that. He also said to never get into a car. They always had the advantage at a second location. I knew once I disappeared, I\u2019d be lost. Logan had told me that. Alfonzo told me that.</p><p>He patted me down, found my cell, and cursed, throwing it into the long grass in the ditch. I prayed it had gotten through to Logan, but I didn\u2019t know, and all I could rely on right now was myself.</p><p>He opened the trunk and tugged me toward it.</p><p>No. This wasn\u2019t going to happen to me. I swung around just as he was about to push me inside, and my elbow hit him in the side of the face, then I ducked at the same time as he made a grab for me. I stumbled. Fell to my knees on the gravel and tried to get up.</p><p>His hands were around my waist, and I was picked up off the ground kicking and screaming as loud as I could.</p><p>\u201cLogan! Kat\u2019s shot. Matt. Havoc\u2019s field. Alfonzo.\u201d I prayed my screaming reached the phone. That somehow, Logan\u2019s voicemail picked up what was happening.</p> <p>The trunk slammed shut, and I was immersed in darkness.</p><p>Logan</p><p>\u201cWe hitting Avalanche later?\u201d Crisis asked. \u201cAfter smokin\u2019 hot Georgie last night, I need some pussy riding this horse fast. Damn, that woman rocks. I think I came a little bit when she said she wanted to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch that ass and your ass will be no longer. That\u2019s Deck\u2019s.\u201d Kite tossed his sticks in the air, caught them, then placed them in his back pocket.</p><p>Logan looked at his phone and grinned when he saw a missed call from Emily. His cock twitched when her sweet voice sounded on his voice mail.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Kat\u2019s Ream\u2019s, but he\u2019s not doing her, and Georgie\u2019s Deck\u2019s, and he\u2019s not doing her. I\u2019d be doing them both and at the same fucking time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Crisis.\u201d Kite said.</p><p>Logan glanced at Ream who was standing with his hand on the doorknob ready to leave the studio. The voicemail clicked to the next message, and while he waited for her voice again he said, \u201cHaving dinner with my mother tonight guys. Emily is\u2014fuck.\u201d Logan raced toward the door, the phone pressed to his ear.</p> <p>\u201cMan. What?\u201d Kite said.</p><p>\u201cSculpt? What the fuck?\u201d Crisis said following.</p><p>Ream yanked opened the door. \u201cSculpt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the police, and have an ambulance meet us at the farm.\u201d</p><p>Ream grabbed his arm just as Emily\u2019s screams went through the phone.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Logan shouted. No, fuckin\u2019 way. Alfonzo was not getting his woman. Logan had never felt this intensity of fear and rage cut through him. He needed to reel it back in before he lost it completely. He pressed the phone harder to his ear and listened closely. There was the sound of Emily screaming Kat\u2019s name. Then Alfonzo was talking about the torture. He heard a car door then Emily screaming for him. She yelled something indistinguishable and muffled then the word shot and then Havoc something. Logan heard the squealing tires and the line was silent.</p><p>The ambulance was waiting when he arrived. Deck was talking with two officers, but as soon as he saw him he jogged over.</p><p>\u201cThe police are searching the house, and my men are already headed for all known locations for transporting girls.\u201d</p><p>Logan felt sick to his stomach. \u201cI was supposed to protect her. I promised her.\u201d The emotions running rampant through him were debilitating as thoughts of any harm coming to Emily. \u201cFuck.\u201d He smashed his fist into the hood of the car.</p><p>\u201cThere was no way Alfonzo could\u2019ve known she was here. Someone had to have told him. Someone we trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Logan started toward the house, but Deck stopped him grabbing his arm. Logan shoved his hand away. \u201cI have to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. But that\u2019s not going to happen if you\u2019re acting irrational. You know that better than anyone. I need to hear her message.\u201d</p><p>Trying to act calm and patient was killing him. All he wanted to do was find her. Hold her. Protect her. God, he didn\u2019t deserve her. Fuck. How did this happen?</p><p>Logan took out his phone and cursed when he saw his hand shaking. He went to his voice mail, then passed it to Deck.</p><p>Emily\u2019s voice could be heard over the phone and it felt like a knife was ripping through him. When he heard her scream the name Havoc this time he heard the word field too. He looked at Deck and they both went running for the horse\u2019s field.</p><p>It felt like his feet were in quicksand. The thumping of feet were behind him as they all went running. He went over the dip in the hill and stumbled when he saw first the horse\u2019s body lying in the grass, then Matt and Kat.</p><p>\u201cI got Matt,\u201d Deck shouted.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Logan dropped down beside Kat\u2019s body, blood pooling beneath her.</p><p>Logan checked for a pulse. Fuck, Kat. He needed to keep it together. Calm and controlled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ream\u2019s stunned voice was behind him.</p><p>Logan nodded to Kite who grabbed Ream\u2019s arm just as he fell to his knees beside Kat.</p><p>His voice was a haunted whisper as he repeated Kat\u2019s name over and over again. One of the paramedics snapped a collar around her neck then they gently rolled her over onto the stretcher.</p><p>Matt was surrounded by three officers and a paramedic. Logan heard someone calling in another ambulance over the radio.</p><p>Deck had his phone to his ear and was calling out orders to whoever was on the other end.</p><p>Logan\u2019s mind was in a whirlwind, and he was trying desperately to keep control, but Emily\u2019s scream kept haunting him. He knew the sex trafficking ring; he knew how fast girls disappeared, and if Alfonzo still had connections, Emily could be out of Canada within hours never to be seen again.</p><p>Fuck, he knew it. Deck said Alfonzo had surfaced, but neither of them thought he\u2019d link the farm to Emily. They\u2019d taken precautions just in case, had security at the party, kept a man following them whenever any of them came to the farm to make certain they weren\u2019t tailed. But Alfonzo had somehow found her.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>One paramedic applied pressure to the stomach wound while the other took one end of the stretcher and Crisis the other.</p><p>\u201cKitkat,\u201d Ream said. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare die on me.\u201d Ream had tears in his eyes as he gripped her hand.</p><p>\u201cKat.\u201d Logan heard Matt shout and a paramedic urged him to stay still and don\u2019t talk. \u201cIs she alive, damn it?\u201d</p><p>Logan heard the paramedic trying to keep him calm and then Kite was talking to him, telling Matt Kat was fine. Logan wasn\u2019t sure if that was true or not, but Matt had to calm down or he\u2019d do worse damage to himself.</p><p>An officer was beside Havoc applying pressure to the bullet wound, but the mare wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>Logan looked at Deck and he shook his head. He knew what it meant\u2014no sign of Emily.</p><p>His heart felt like a cement block had landed on it. He was having trouble breathing; even the churning in his stomach had stopped as if it was building into a huge wave of unbearable pain.</p><p>Ream and Crisis helped the paramedics with the two stretchers back to the ambulance, and Ream jumped inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital too,\u201d Crisis said.</p><p>\u201cNot good, man. You and Ream all fucked up and in the same hospital. I\u2019ll go,\u201d Kite offered.</p><p>\u201cNo. It may not look like it, but Ream\u2019s my best friend. This is his chick, and she\u2019s my friend, I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Another ambulance pulled up and the paramedics rushed to load Matt into it. Crisis jumped in with Matt.</p><p>Deck was striding to the car as he listened to whoever was on the phone with him.</p><p>Logan started after him then jumped in the car. Kite got in the other side and nodded to him.</p><p>Kite was the guy that would stand behind you a hundred percent even when there was a chance you might not come back alive.</p><p>Deck threw the car in gear. \u201cThat was Georgie. Raven was the one who gave away Emily\u2019s location. She\u2019s helping Alfonzo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>I was thrown onto the floor, and my nose hit hard and immediately started bleeding onto the carpet. Orange shag carpet. Not many people had orange shag carpet, except Georgie.</p><p>\u201cKeep it on her,\u201d Alfonzo said. \u201cShe makes a move, shoot her in the leg.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and saw Raven pointing the gun at my head. Oh God, no. Why? Why would Raven help him? Why were they at Georgie\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the other girl?\u201d</p><p>He had to be talking about Georgie.</p><p>\u201cShe ... she heard me talking to you on the phone and ran. I ... I didn\u2019t see where she went, Master. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. Stupid girl. We have to get out of here.\u201d Alfonzo took out his phone and started to walk in the other room.</p><p>\u201cRaven?\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo came charging back, phone to his ear as his fist plowed into my stomach knocking the wind of me. \u201cNo fucking talking.\u201d I heard his phone ring, and then Alfonzo was walking into the other room talking quietly. He sounded frazzled as he paced back and forth.</p><p>\u201cRaven. Please.\u201d I struggled to sit up then rubbed the blood from my eyes as best as I could with my shoulder. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Raven was trembling and pale. The gun wavered, and her eyes were blank as she did as she was told. She looked terrified. I wondered if she was doing this out of fear of Alfonzo. A fear likely ingrained so deeply that she was like a robot, unable to act on her own free will any longer.</p><p>\u201cRaven. Please. Deck will help you. Don\u2019t do this. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was shaking so badly now that she had to clutch her arms close to her sides to keep from dropping the gun.</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it.\u201d Alfonzo was shouting in the other room. \u201cYou\u2019ll have her back.\u201d He kicked a chair in the kitchen, and it went flying into the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Georgie, Raven?\u201d</p><p>Raven stared at me as if I hadn\u2019t spoken.</p> <p>Alfonzo came striding from the kitchen, and Raven flinched so hard she dropped the gun.</p><p>\u201cUseless slut.\u201d Alfonzo picked up the weapon, then grabbed her around the neck, hauling her against him. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Master,\u201d Raven replied in a quivering whispered voice.</p><p>\u201cKai says to behave yourself, Raven. Keep doing exactly as I say, and he\u2019ll still buy you.\u201d He lowered his mouth and kissed her cruelly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been good. Very good at getting the information for me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. That\u2019s why Raven came and talked to me at the bar. I thought it had been strange she\u2019d taken initiative like that, but she has been feeding Alfonzo information. Had he put her on auction, set it up so Deck would get her out? Had Raven refused to go home because she knew she had to get information for Alfonzo as to where I was?</p><p>\u201cYou keep doing as I tell you, and I will sell you to him. You want to go to Kai? Or stay with me?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, the thought of Raven under Alfonzo\u2019s hand for the last two years made me sick to my stomach. I really had no idea if Kai was any better, but I understood why Raven would do anything to get away from Alfonzo.</p><p>Raven didn\u2019t answer, and he raised his hand and slapped her across the face. She didn\u2019t even whimper, but she lowered her eyes from Alfonzo and said, \u201cTo him, Master.\u201d</p><p>I saw Raven\u2019s eyes close in defeat; Alfonzo would punish her for that, for answering a question he forced on her. A slave admitting she wanted someone other than her Master is against the rules.</p><p>I heard a sound above me\u2014attic. Georgie? If she was hiding, there was the chance she had called Deck. God, please, let her have told someone where we are.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Emily.\u201d</p><p>I jerked at the sound of Georgie\u2019s muffled voice above me, but didn\u2019t hesitate as I pushed to my feet and ran bent over at Alfonzo, head-butting him in the back of the legs.</p><p>He went buckling forward, into the porch door, and the gun went flying. \u201cBitch!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking torture you until\u2014\u201d Georgie landed on top of him as she came out of the scuttle hole in the ceiling.</p><p>They rolled out the screen door and down the steps of the porch. I could hear Alfonzo shouting as I used the wall to gain my feet again. I was about to follow when I saw Raven with the gun pointing at me.</p><p>\u201cRaven. No. Put it down. I\u2019ll help you. You don\u2019t have to go to Kai.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>Raven cocked the hammer and pointed the gun at my leg.</p><p>\u201cRaven. No. You don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ... I ... have to.\u201d Her voice was a whisper of a shiver, and I could tell that she didn\u2019t want to do it, but she thought she had no choice\u2014that whatever was driving her made her do this.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you to hurt me, Raven. You have to protect me.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking so badly I thought she\u2019d pass out, her face pale and her eyes wild as she kept flinching from the noises made by Georgie and Alfonzo fighting outside.</p><p>Then suddenly silence.</p><p>Raven\u2019s eyes darted to the screen door, and I leapt.</p><p>I tackled her, the gun sliding away across the orange carpet, and my body landing right on top of her. I almost wanted to say I was sorry, because it felt like her frail bones cracked under my weight and she didn\u2019t even struggle.</p><p>Suddenly I was dragged off her by the leg and picked up with a hand latched around my upper arm. I started struggling until I heard the voice. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>I did. I was shocked to see him. And terrified because this wasn\u2019t Alfonzo\u2014instead a man who was more than likely deadlier.</p><p>Kai exuded power, even more, I expected, than Raul, and that made him extremely dangerous. \u201cRaven,\u201d Kai said. Raven was on her feet and at his side. He didn\u2019t even look at her. \u201cWhere is the transporter?\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo had brought Georgie back inside. He kicked her in the back of the legs, and she winced as she fell to her knees. He had ropes on her wrists behind her back. All I could think of was Deck and how he was going to have a fit if he saw Georgie like that.</p><p>Alfonzo picked up his gun. \u201cI promised you Raven. You have her. That\u2019s our deal.\u201d</p><p>Kai\u2019s hand tightened on my neck. \u201cOur deal has changed. What are you doing with that one?\u201d Kai nodded to Georgie.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming with us. And that bitch\u201d he nodded toward me, \u201cescaped Raul. No one escapes Raul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaul\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo kicked Georgie in the back, and she grunted and fell forward. \u201cOnce I\u2019m done with their training, they\u2019ll go on auction and never been found again. That\u2019s if they live through it.\u201d</p><p>I knew Georgie couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut no matter how much pain she was in. Her lips were pursed together and her brows were drawn down over her eyes. Suddenly, she slammed her head backward into Alfonzo\u2019s knee.</p><p>I heard the sound of her skull hitting his knee cap; then Alfonzo was yelling.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted as Alfonzo raised his gun to Georgie.</p><p>\u201cKilling her is a waste,\u201d Kai stated, his voice steady and cool. \u201cTake me to the transporter. I need to see him.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo had his gun to Georgie\u2019s head, his fingers weaved into her hair. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. That wasn\u2019t the deal. Raven and the money. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the deal now.\u201d Kai remained unflinching.</p><p>Alfonzo\u2019s face turned beet read. \u201cI\u2019m selling you the girl for half her price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have easily found Raven myself. I found you, didn\u2019t I? What I want is the transporter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one gets to meet him. He doesn\u2019t meet with anyone. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Kai shrugged. \u201cHe will me. Call him.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo blanched. \u201cYou just don\u2019t call him. It\u2019s been set up already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaul is dead. That means you and your transporter no longer have a main source. Call him. Now. Or I kill you and take all three girls myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Alfonzo was fumbling and upset. His fingers were jerking on the gun, and it was obvious he was scared of Kai and what he\u2019d do if he didn\u2019t call this transporter guy. Alfonzo raised gun and hit Georgie on the head.</p><p>\u201cGeorgie.\u201d I tried to pull away from Kai, but his grip was unrelenting. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Kai\u2019s voice was low and almost inaudible as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s better this way.\u201d</p><p>Alfonzo tied a strip of cloth around Georgie\u2019s arm and I saw the syringe. I didn\u2019t know if it was street drugs or something else, but anything put into her system was not good. I struggled to get to her, my legs kicking out at Kai. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t. Georgie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Kai yanked on my arm to the side and I cried out in agony.</p><p>Georgie didn\u2019t move, but I could see her eyes flickering, looking dazed from the blow. Alfonzo slid the needle into her vein, and within seconds her body relaxed and her eyes closed.</p><p>I started crying, and my legs gave out, but I didn\u2019t fall. Kai held me against him, his arm now locked around my chest. Whether it was to keep me upright or to stop me from running to Georgie, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Alfonzo was on the phone mumbling something about Kai and a meeting. Then he hung up and nodded to Kai.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kai ordered.</p><p>Alfonzo slung Georgie over his shoulder, and we walked out the back door.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>I lay on the cement floor beside Georgie. We were in some kind of warehouse that looked like it had once been a factory. I could smell the distinct odor of the Don River which was the acrid scent of garbage. I guessed since we hadn\u2019t driven very far that we were still downtown. Alfonzo had blindfolded me and tied my wrists together before he shoved me in the trunk, but I\u2019d managed to slip off the blindfold about an hour ago.</p><p>Kai was standing with his arms crossed, leaning against a large piece of machinery looking completely relaxed. Raven knelt beside him, her hands in her lap and her head bowed.</p><p>Georgie was still drugged, and her eyes were glassed over and she was not responding to her name. Her breathing was slow, but steady, and I suspected whatever they\u2019d given her wasn\u2019t harmful enough to kill her.</p><p>Alfonzo paced back and forth constantly looking to the door then his phone.</p><p>Finally the metal door slid on its tracks and opened.</p><p>It was dark, and I couldn\u2019t see the large shadow that came toward us until the moonlight hit him just as he stopped in front of Kai.</p><p>Fear and recognition slammed into me.</p><p>Jacob.</p><p>He had waterboarded me again and again without mercy when I was held captive. He tortured me without pity, and he looked stone cold now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like changing plans,\u201d Jacob said to Alfonzo. \u201cIt causes mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Kai kept his eyes on Jacob. \u201cRaul\u2019s right hand man. I thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does everyone.\u201d Jacob nodded to Raven. \u201cYou\u2019ve travelled a great distance for one girl, she doesn\u2019t look worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the other girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Awaiting shipment.\u201d</p><p>I was about ten feet away, and I noticed the tension in Kai go from zero to a hundred within seconds. Something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cGeorgie,\u201d I whispered. \u201cGeorgie.\u201d I nudged her with my shoulder, and she moaned. Kai, Jacob, and Alfonzo\u2019s attention were on one another. \u201cGeorgie.\u201d</p><p>It happened so fast, Jacob pulled a gun, turned, and shot Alfonzo in the head.</p><p>Alfonzo dropped to the ground.</p><p>Kai never moved a muscle, instead he looked even more casual as his hand went to Raven\u2019s head, and he stroked her hair as if to soothe her.</p><p>\u201cI told him, I don\u2019t meet clients. He didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that would make me a liability.\u201d Kai sounded as if he didn\u2019t care that Jacob had just killed Alfonzo and that he might be next.</p><p>I was holding my breath, waiting for the loud bang that would kill Kai. It didn\u2019t matter to me if he died; Jacob was just as dangerous as any of them, but every dead man is one less to defend again.</p><p>\u201cYour offer piqued my interest.\u201d He thought about it for a second. \u201cI require a base to bring the girls before auction. You can provide me with that.\u201d</p><p>Kai\u2019s hand stopped stroking Raven\u2019s hair. \u201cWho has been providing since Raul\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Jacob slipped his gun back into his belt. \u201cNo one. This is our first shipment in over a year. That guy Deck and his men have been all over us, and now, Alfonzo screwed up taking that one.\u201d He nodded to Georgie. \u201cI don\u2019t make mistakes, Kai. I\u2019m careful. Alfonzo wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you made a mistake, Jacob.\u201d</p><p>I could only see a side profile of Jacob, but his face suddenly flashed with a moment of surprise, and then he dove and rolled just as Kai threw a knife narrowly missing Jacob\u2019s throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRaven. Go to the girls,\u201d Kai demanded, and then he was moving.</p><p>Jacob had disappeared behind a large piece of machinery.</p><p>I needed to get Georgie out of here.</p><p>Raven came and sat beside us, her features expressionless, but there was something in her eyes, a look of panic as she kept looking around the warehouse.</p> <p>\u201cUntie me, Raven.\u201d</p><p>She ignored me, and I used a stronger voice. \u201cRaven. Untie me now.\u201d</p><p>That got her attention, but she still didn\u2019t make a move to help. Fuck. \u201cKai will be angry if you don\u2019t untie me and we get hurt. He\u2019ll be angry you\u2019ve lessened our value.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back to her so she could untie the rope. I waited for what seemed like forever; then I heard a gunshot echo, and her hands were on my wrists. I was nearly hyperventilating, I was so anxious to get free. I wanted to scream at her to hurry up, but knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good.</p><p>Finally, the rope slipped from my sore, raw skin, and I went for Georgie who was moaning and\u2014what the hell?\u2014smiling. Whatever they had given her, she was enjoying. I pulled her up under the armpits and started walking backwards dragging her toward the door.</p> <p>I was halfway there when I saw him\u2014Logan. I held in my sob, but kept pulling Georgie. He hid behind a conveyor belt, and he had a gun. I didn\u2019t even know Logan knew how to shoot. But he had grown up with Raul, of course he did. I wanted to run to him, throw my arms around him. Cry. Tell him I loved him. I couldn\u2019t do any of that as he shook his head, telling me no.</p><p>I glanced behind me and saw Jacob. He had Raven held in front of him and his gun pointed at me. I slowly lowered Georgie to the ground and turned to face him.</p><p>Kai appeared to the left of Jacob, he didn\u2019t hold a gun but a knife, and it was held down by his side.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Kai\u2019s tone was furious. His eyes never left Jacob for a second, even when Raven whimpered as Jacob\u2019s hold tightened.</p><p>\u201cIn seconds, I can shoot Sculpt\u2019s woman and snap your slave\u2019s neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it,\u201d Kai said.</p> <p>I glanced over at Logan, but he was gone. I didn\u2019t look for him. He wouldn\u2019t leave me here. I knew he wouldn\u2019t. No matter what he\u2019d done when his father held a gun to my head, I knew Logan wouldn\u2019t leave me. I trusted him.</p><p>Logan had always been my knight.</p><p>That\u2019s when I saw Deck to the right of Jacob crouched behind a pile of barrels. He was motioning to Kai. It happened all at once. A gun went off, and I was thrown on the floor beside Georgie, the wind knocked out of me as a large body landed on top.</p><p>I smelled him; I felt the familiar length of him, and when I caught my breath, I said his name, \u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay down.\u201d He was covering my head with his hands, and I could hear the shuffling of feet and voices then the sound of a gun going off again.</p><p>I jerked.</p><p>Logan suddenly was flipping me over and looking down at me, his hands on either side of my cheeks. \u201cEme. God, baby.\u201d Deck crouched beside Georgie, and Logan leaned down and kissed me\u2014hard.</p><p>\u201cYou found us. How\u2019s Georgie?\u201d I asked, clinging to Logan and watching Deck inspect Georgie.</p> <p>\u201cHigh. But fine.\u201d Deck held Georgie\u2019s arm outstretched while he ran his finger over what I guessed was the needle mark.</p><p>\u201cHeroin,\u201d said Kai\u2019s voice, and I jerked at the sound.</p><p>He was standing a few feet away, his arm around Raven\u2019s waist, her head tucked into his chest.</p><p>Deck nodded. \u201cProbably better. Georgie would\u2019ve gotten herself killed with that mouth of hers.\u201d Deck stood. \u201cPolice will be here shortly. You better go.\u201d</p><p>What? Deck was letting Kai go?</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Kai untangled Raven from him, and I saw her eyes widen as he pushed her toward us. \u201cYou need to stay with them, Raven. Deck will take you home.\u201d</p><p>Raven\u2019s face dropped, and paled. She fell to her knees in front of him and grabbed his jeans. \u201cPlease. Please take me with you.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s arms tightened around me as I watched Kai and Raven, horrified that the girl had the chance to go home, and she was begging Kai to take her with him.</p><p>Kai remained motionless as he looked at her. He sighed, and then nodded to Deck who strode over and snagged Raven\u2019s arm, pulling her away. Tears streamed down Raven\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t make a sound. She looked so devastated that I broke inside for her. This girl was so screwed up that she didn\u2019t want to go home. I felt the tears slip from my eyes, and Logan brushed them away.</p><p>Sirens could be heard in the distance.</p><p>Kai took one last look at Raven then disappeared into the darkness of the warehouse.</p><p>\u201cLogan? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Deck looked at me. \u201cKai was never here. Do understand, Emily. Never here.\u201d Then he was on the phone, Raven at his side and Georgie at his feet. The police burst in with Kite, and Deck talked to the guy in charge, telling him everything. Everything\u2014except not a word was mentioned about Kai.</p><p>3 Weeks Later</p><p>\u201cEme, get down here.\u201d</p><p>I stared at my name on the document and couldn\u2019t believe he went and did this without even telling me. I hadn\u2019t talked to him about buying my own farm, and yet, he knew. Logan knew what I needed. There was a yellow sticky note on the front of the envelope. It read:</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard to make the farm a place for horses to heal. And Eme ... for you to repair too. You\u2019ve made it a success. The rent you paid Matt went toward the down payment I made on the farm. I know you\u2019d never be happy to live on my farm, so now it\u2019s yours, and you earned it. You bought it. The farm has always been yours, baby. Now sign the bloody thing, stop arguing with me and promise to come on tour with me.\u201d</p><p>I wiped the tears away from my cheeks and laughed. Then I picked up the pen on the vanity and signed the document and put it back in the vanilla envelope.</p><p>I took one last look in the mirror, dabbed my lips again, and then took a deep breath and made my way downstairs. My stomach had been tied up in knots for days. Ever since Logan told me his mother was coming to the welcome home party for Kat. My chest was tight; I had a rabble of butterflies dancing in my stomach, and my mouth was dry.</p><p>But Kat was finally coming home. She\u2019d been in critical care for days, having lost a large amount of blood. She had bullet fragments extracted from her abdomen and damage to her bowels. The worry was she could die of infection, so she remained for weeks on intravenous antibiotics, under strict hospital observation.</p><p>Matt had been in the hospital for five days with superficial wounds to both legs. According to the nurses, he had been a horrible patient, having tried to get out of bed right after surgery in order to get to Kat. They had to keep him sedated for forty-eight hours.</p><p>When he was able to go to Kat\u2019s room, Logan and I had been sitting with her. We headed to the door to give him time alone with her, but before the door shut I heard Matt choke on a sob then say to his sister, \u201cYou\u2019ve beat all odds before, baby sis. You can do it again.\u201d</p><p>Logan and I stayed downtown at Matt\u2019s condo most nights for the first week she was in the hospital. Matt was a wreck and shut down the bar for a week; then had Brett run it ever since. Matt was never far from the hospital and Kat.</p><p>Ream lived at the hospital for four straight days, and then when the nurses finally allowed him in to visit Kat\u2014he left without seeing her. No one had seen him since.</p><p>And Havoc. She was like me ... a fighter. She fought her way back first from severe abuse and now from being shot. She was recuperating, with attitude, in the stable.</p><p>I walked down the stairs to the kitchen. When I saw a woman standing beside Logan in the kitchen, I knew ... I knew instantly that she was warmth and kindness. A dark-haired angel with the softest blue eyes and smooth, white skin. She had a classic beauty about her, subtle and sincere. There wasn\u2019t a hint of my mother in her and a wave of relief swept over me.</p><p>She was talking to Logan, her voice calm and quiet as she placed her hand on his chest as if she was saying something meaningful. I noticed she didn\u2019t smile, but I imagined if she did, it would light up her entire face like her son\u2019s. But there was a hint in her eyes, that glow I knew must have taken a long time to get back after living with Raul.</p><p>Logan lifted his head and saw me standing at the doorway observing them. \u201cEme.\u201d He walked over and snagged my hand, pulling me up toward him then stealing a kiss. \u201cYou look gorgeous,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou do as I say?\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my hand around the back of his neck and pulled him back down to me. \u201cThank you, Logan. For everything.\u201d I kissed his cheek and he groaned then tightened his hold and kissed me on the lips.</p><p>I pulled back. \u201cYour mom is right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, and she\u2019ll see that I can\u2019t keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>I glanced over at his mother who was watching us. \u201cYour mother\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd excited to meet you.\u201d His hand slid down my back to my ass, and he slapped it inconspicuously. \u201cSmile, Mouse.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep inhale. \u201cI want her to like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you already. Any mother that sees her son as happy as I am loves the woman that does that to him.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand. \u201cI love you, Logan.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all I needed, his brilliant grin lighting up his entire face. When I faced Isabella, she was smiling at us, and that\u2019s when I saw it. Her smile was exactly like his, majestic.</p><p>Logan introduced me to his mom, and she immediately pulled me into a hug. There were tears in her eyes when she pulled back. She knew what happened to Logan and I. Well, she didn\u2019t know everything that happened\u2014especially what Logan suffered for months after he\u2019d got me out. As far as his mother knew and anyone else, Logan had stayed and fought for Raul until he finally left to join his band.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Where\u2019s the guest of honor?\u201d Crisis strode into the house and placed a case of beer on the counter then he came over and kissed Isabella on each cheek. \u201cHey, you\u2019re mom.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, and it was so sweet, I wanted to hug her again. Logan was right; this was what a mother was supposed to be like, warm and kind. Isabella had given more than most women; she gave her son a chance at a better life.</p><p>Kite opened the sliding glass door, tongs in hand. \u201cBurgers are on. Where\u2019s Kat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d I replied. Matt texted me ten minutes ago from the hospital. \u201cThey\u2019re about fifteen minutes away.\u201d</p><p>The screen door squeaked as it opened. \u201cHey cupcakes. Whoa, wow, that your mom, Sculpt?\u201d Georgie went straight to Isabella and pulled her into a hug. \u201cI\u2019m Georgie.\u201d She pulled back and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a real looker. Hot. Damn. Sculpt, what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Logan rolled his eyes and whispered something to his mom who gave a half-smile to Georgie and then turned her attention to Deck who had come in after Georgie. I excused myself to pull Georgie aside.</p><p>\u201cRaven?\u201d I couldn\u2019t get the girl out of my head, and I couldn\u2019t imagine what she had to have gone through to get to the point she was at\u2014unable to mentally make decisions on her own, to be so conditioned to do what her master wanted, that she\u2019d even kill someone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDeck is being tightlipped, and Deck being tightlipped means nothing gets past his sweet, sexy, fuck-me lips.\u201d Georgie looked over at Deck who was talking quietly to Isabella and Logan. \u201cHe says she\u2019s safe, whatever that means. Deck leaves tonight to fuck knows where for an undisclosed amount of time.\u201d She lowered her voice like Deck\u2019s when she said the \u201cundisclosed amount of time\u201d part.</p><p>Georgie always became a little unsettled when Deck went off on a job; I suspected it was because of what happened to her brother, but it was more than that. I knew Georgie really cared about Deck, maybe more than she\u2019d ever admit. \u201cDeck likes you, Georgie.\u201d</p><p>Georgie laughed\u2014hard. So hard she smacked her hand onto the kitchen counter and everyone paused to look at her. She leaned in, hand on my shoulder. \u201cI annoy the hell out of him. Deck\u2019s incapable of liking much except his way. And if you don\u2019t like his way, then he\u2019ll shove it up your ass, down your throat, and then make sure you learn to like it. I don\u2019t like his way.\u201d</p><p>Georgie and I chatted a while then Logan came over to join us, sliding his arm around my waist and kissing the side of my neck. Crisis was his usual loud and obnoxious self while Kite ended up chatting with Isabelle for a long while.</p> <p>A car horn honked.</p><p>I slipped from Logan\u2019s arms, and Georgie and I went running out through the patio door and around to the driveway where Matt and Kat were getting out of the car.</p><p>I reached Kat and threw my arms around her. I was careful not to squeeze too tight, but it was hard not to. \u201cGod, it\u2019s good to have you home.\u201d</p><p>Kat pulled back a bit, and despite her smile, I saw the haunted look in her eyes. I\u2019d seen it in the hospital too, but she was so closed off, she wouldn\u2019t talk about anything. I knew the feeling firsthand so I kept quiet and didn\u2019t push her.</p><p>\u201cCome here, lollipop. Give me a hug.\u201d Georgie hugged Kat, kissed her on both cheeks, and then looped her arm around both of us and started walking back to the house.</p> <p>Matt was getting the bags out of the trunk, but I noticed that his eyes never left Kat. It would take him a long time to get over this. I suspected longer than when their parents died.</p><p>\u201cHey, be careful with her, Georgie,\u201d Matt shouted as Georgie started skipping and jarred us both.</p><p>Everyone cheered and gave Kat hugs and kisses. Crisis passed her a beer and kept beside Kat as if he was her private bulldog, although from what I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYou good, Emily?\u201d</p><p>It was Deck. Logan had his arm around my waist and his fingers were caressing my bare skin beneath my blouse at my belly. I nodded. \u201cYeah, Deck. Glad to have Kat home.\u201d</p><p>Deck glanced at Logan then back at me again. \u201cYou need anything. Call. That goes for you both.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, need you to convince her to leave Kat and Matt and come on tour with the band in a few months. Can you help with that?\u201d</p><p>Deck lowered his head as if to hide the twitch at the corner of his mouth I caught a glance of. It was hot. Deck was hot, and Georgie needed to wrap her head around the fact that Deck didn\u2019t watch over her because he had an obligation to her brother; he did it because he cared, and Deck caring was huge. I guaranteed he didn\u2019t care easily.</p><p>Dinner was a barbecue on the patio, and it was nice. Better than nice. Georgie\u2019s mom and dad showed up. Her dad was cool, but he didn\u2019t take attitude from anyone, meaning he was scary, and he was also hot.</p><p>\u201cReam, buddy!\u201d Kite shouted. \u201cWhere the fuck have you been, man?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Kite, then to where he was looking at the patio door. Then I searched out Kat, who was looking right at Ream. She paled. Turned white actually, and I think it had to do with the girl holding onto Ream\u2019s arm.</p><p>Logan\u2019s hand reached under the table and took mine and squeezed. He knew. He\u2019d seen Kat\u2019s reaction too.</p><p>Ream chin lifted. \u201cThis is Lana.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother introducing her to any of us. Instead he leaned into her and whispered something in her ear. The tall blonde giggled, gave him a kiss, and then walked back into the house.</p><p>\u201cNot smart, buddy,\u201d Kite said then turned away and started talking to Georgie\u2019s mom.</p> <p>Ream ignored the comment as he met Kat\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou feel okay?\u201d</p><p>I was holding my breath. I knew Kat she could fly off the handle pretty easily, and it was a real dick move for Ream to bring some chick to Kat\u2019s welcome home party. But she did something I hadn\u2019t expected\u2014Kat nodded then looked away. She looked defeated, and it broke my heart seeing her like that. Crisis put his arm around the back of her chair, and his hand came on her shoulder and stroked back and forth. He leaned in and whispered something to her.</p><p>Lana came out seconds later with two beers, passing one to Ream.</p><p>The tension finally faded as everyone chatted and drank and ate a ton. It was Georgie getting drunk and stumbling into the sliding glass doors after coming back from the washroom that finally broke up the party.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d She rubbed her head where she\u2019d hit the glass pane. \u201cThat thing is so clean I didn\u2019t even see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see it because your vision is blurred the fuck up,\u201d Crisis yelled, laughing.</p><p>Georgie laughed then staggered out onto the patio. I got up at the same time as Deck.</p><p>\u201cEme, let him deal,\u201d Logan said and dragged me back down, but this time he put me on his lap and wrapped his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d Logan growled in my ear, and it did two things\u2014got me wet and made me concede.</p><p>Deck strode over to Georgie. She backed away. He pursued, and his face looked pissed. I mean, I know I wouldn\u2019t have fucked around with that face, but Georgie was Georgie, and she was drunk.</p><p>\u201cYou going to spank me again?\u201d</p><p>Again?</p><p>Logan chuckled. And I saw Georgie\u2019s mom and dad weren\u2019t moving to protect their daughter from Deck.</p><p>Deck did briefly look at Georgie\u2019s dad Frank, and I noticed him nod at Deck as if he was giving his okay. To what?</p><p>\u201cDeck.\u201d Georgie smiled. \u201cYou going to take me home again and put me in your bed naked?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. Crisis out-and-out laughed, and I saw Georgie\u2019s mom smile.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Deck said. \u201cGoing to do something else entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sounds delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>Georgie frowned. \u201cThink I\u2019ll stay here then.\u201d</p><p>Deck wasn\u2019t doing anymore talking as he latched onto her hand. He nodded to Logan then dragged Georgie inside. I could hear her squeal then shout, and finally, she was screeching profanities.</p><p>A car door slammed and then another.</p><p>Soon Georgie and Deck were forgotten, and the party broke up an hour later.</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d Logan had dragged me upstairs the second his mother and Georgie\u2019s parents left. He locked the door then pulled me hard up against him. \u201cMy mother loves you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s an incredible woman, Logan. You\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s yours now too.\u201d</p><p>That made me feel warm inside, and I moved into him further.</p><p>His hand curled around the nape of my neck. \u201cYou\u2019re touring with me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question; it was a statement. \u201cLogan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking anymore. This is big and I want you with me.\u201d</p><p>The band got asked to open for Damaged and they\u2019d be gone six months. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s kind of selfish? I do have a business to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you. We\u2019ll try and work in you doing clinics at the stops we make. We need time together, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d He was right. We did. It was Logan\u2019s turn to live his dream. He\u2019d given me mine now it was my turn to be there for his.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed me, and I melted. I mean it was an amazing kiss, one that took away any argument I had left, and he damn well knew it. I\u2019d tour with him. I wanted to see him play in front of huge crowds; I wanted to hear him sing every night. God, I just wanted to be with him.</p><p>He sank his hands into my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re my everything.\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him, my finger tracing across his lips. He caught it between his teeth then drew it into his mouth and sucked. My rabble of butterflies took flight in every direction, and my stomach dipped. I smiled up at the man who had been my knight in shining armor all along, I just hadn\u2019t seen it.</p><p>Together we were able to repair.</p><p>I kissed him then nibbled at the lobe of his ear as I whispered, \u201cYou fixed me.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
