He was an immortal warrior, beautiful in a way no mortal could ever hope to be. Silky hair of jet, chestnut and flax spilled over the pillow, the multicolored strands forming a flawless tapestry, inviting the eye to linger a minute, then a minute more...sweet mercy, why not forever?</p> <p>His name was Kane. He had long, boyish lashes, a strong nose and a stubborn chin. At six feet four, he was cut with the kind of muscle only earned on the bloodiest of battlefields. Though he wore stained and dirty pants, she knew a large butterfly tattoo dominated the right side of his hip, the ink thick and black, a little jagged. The tops of the wings stretched over the material and every so often tiny waves rippled through them, as though the insect struggled to lift from his skin\u2014or burrow deeper.</p><p>Either was possible. The tattoo was a mark of absolute, utter evil, a visible sign of the demon contained inside Kane\u2019s body.</p><p>Demon...she shuddered. Rulers of hell. Liars, thieves. Murderers. They were darkness without any hint of light. They lured and tempted. They ruined, tortured and destroyed.</p><p>But Kane wasn\u2019t the demon.</p><p>Like all of her race, the mighty Fae, she had spent a good portion of her life studying Kane and his friends\u2014the Lords of the Underworld. In fact, at the command of the Fae king, spies had spent countless centuries following the warriors, watching and reporting back. Scribes had then printed books with stories and pictures of what they\u2019d witnessed. Mothers had bought those books and read them to their children. Then, when those children had grown up, they had made their own purchases, the need to know what happened next too strong to ignore.</p> <p>The Lords of the Underworld had become the stars of the best and the worst soap opera in S\u00e9duire, the realm of the Fae.</p><p>Josephina always ate up every detail. Especially those about the ultra sexy Paris and the devastatingly lonely Torin. Kane, the beautiful tragedy, was a close third. She could probably recite his life history better than she could her own.</p><p>He was thousands of years old. He\u2019d only had four serious girlfriends in his lifetime. Although, for a while, he\u2019d had a string of meaningless one-night stands. He\u2019d fought in bloody battle after bloody battle with his enemy, the Hunters. Three times, they\u2019d managed to capture and torture him\u2014and she\u2019d waited, breathless, to hear of his escape.</p><p>Going back even further, to the beginning, he and his friends had stolen and opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the demons from inside. The Greeks had been in power at the time, and they\u2019d decided to punish the warriors by turning their bodies into receptacles for the very evil they\u2019d freed. Kane carried Disaster. The others carried Promiscuity, Disease, Distrust, Violence, Death, Pain, Wrath, Doubt, Lies, Misery, Secrets and Defeat. Each creature came with a nearly debilitating curse.</p><p>Promiscuity had to sleep with a new woman every day or he weakened and died.</p><p>Disease couldn\u2019t touch another living creature without starting a plague.</p> <p>Disaster caused catastrophes everywhere Kane went, a fact that sliced at Josephina\u2019s heart and resonated deep. Her entire life was a disaster.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he muttered, his voice a sharp, callous rasp. Powerful legs kicked the already battered sheets away. \u201cHands off. Stop. I said stop!\u201d</p><p>Poor Kane. Another nightmare plagued him.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s touching you,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>He calmed, and she released a relieved breath.</p><p>When she\u2019d first stumbled upon him, he\u2019d been chained to a dais in hell, his chest cavity split open, his ribs spread and exposed, his wrists and ankles hanging on by fraying tendons.</p><p>He\u2019d looked like a slab of beef at the local butcher\u2019s.</p><p>I\u2019ll have a two-pound rump roast and a pound of ground chuck.</p> <p>Gross. Just gross. I\u2019m thoroughly disgusted with you. Over the years, she\u2019d spent so much time alone, conversing with herself had become her only source of amusement...and sadly, companionship. I would have ordered four pounds of pork loin.</p><p>Despite his condition, finding him was the best thing to ever happen to her. He was her ticket to freedom. Or possibly...acceptance?</p><p>Princess Synda, her half sister and the Fae\u2019s most bestest female ever born, wasn\u2019t a Lord, but she carried the demon of Irresponsibility. Apparently, there had been more demons than naughty, box-stealing warriors, and the excess had been given to the inmates of Tartarus\u2014an underground prison for immortals. Synda\u2019s first husband had been one of those inmates, and somehow, when the male had died, the demon had wormed its way inside her.</p><p>When the king of the Fae had learned of it, he\u2019d launched a hunt for details about the cause\u2014and the solution. So far, everyone had come up empty.</p><p>I could bring Kane to a meeting of the Fae High Court, show him off, let him answer any questions the congregation has, and my father might see me, really see me, for the first time in my life.</p><p>Her shoulders drooped. No, I\u2019m not ever going back.</p><p>Josephina had always been, and would always be the royal whipping girl, there to receive the punishments Synda the Beloved was due.</p><p>Synda was always due.</p><p>Last week, in a fit of temper, the princess had burned to the ground the royal stables, and all of the animals trapped inside. Josephina\u2019s sentence? A ticket to the Never-ending\u2014a portal leading into hell.</p><p>There, a day was like a thousand years and a thousand years like a day, so, for what had seemed like an endless eternity, she had fallen down, down, down a blackened pit. She had screamed, but no one had heard. Had begged for mercy, but no one had cared. Had cried, but had never found an anchor.</p><p>Then, she and another girl had landed in the center of hell.</p><p>How startling to realize she\u2019d never actually been alone.</p><p>The girl had been a Phoenix, a race descended from the Greeks. Every full-blooded warrior possessed the ability to rise from the dead, time and time again, growing stronger after every resurrection\u2014until the final death came, and there could be no more bodily restoration.</p><p>Kane began to thrash and moan again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Again, he stilled.</p><p>If only the Phoenix had responded to her so well. When the girl had first seen her, hatred had lanced at her, hatred going far beyond what the children of the Titans\u2014like Josephina\u2014and the children of the Greeks usually felt for each other. But even still, the Phoenix hadn\u2019t tried to kill her, had instead allowed her to follow her through the cave, searching for the exit, without having to exert any of her own waning energy. Like Josephina, she\u2019d just wanted out.</p><p>They had stumbled past crimson-splattered walls, inhaling the fetid stink of sulfur. Grunts and groans had reverberated in their ears, creating a terrible symphony their deprived senses hadn\u2019t been ready for. Then they\u2019d stumbled upon the mutilated warrior. Josephina had recognized him, despite his condition, and stopped.</p><p>Awe had filled her. There, in front of her\u2014her!\u2014had been one of the infamous Lords of the Underworld. She hadn\u2019t known how she could help him, when she could barely help herself, but she\u2019d been determined to try. Whatever proved necessary.</p><p>A lot had proven necessary.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYou were my first and only opportunity to achieve my new greatest desire,\u201d she admitted, \u201csomething I definitely couldn\u2019t do on my own. And as soon as you wake up, I\u2019m going to need you to make good on your promise.\u201d</p><p>And then...</p><p>She sighed, quieted. She brushed her fingertips over his brow.</p><p>Even in his sleep, he flinched. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll destroy you, piece by piece. You and your entire family.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t bragging, wasn\u2019t issuing a hollow threat. He would ensure it happened, and he would probably smile the entire time.</p><p>Probably? Ha! He would. Typical Lord.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said, and again, he calmed. \u201cI think maybe it\u2019s time to wake you up. My family is out there, and they want me back. While a thousand years passed for me inside that pit, only a day passed for them. Since I failed to return to S\u00e9duire, Fae soldiers are probably hunting me.\u201d</p><p>To add to her bowl of miserypuffs, the Phoenix was definitely hunting her, determined to enslave her and avenge the wrong Josephina had done her during their escape.</p><p>\u201cKane.\u201d She gently shook his shoulder. His skin was shockingly soft and exquisitely smooth, yet also feverishly hot, the muscles beneath as tight and firm as grenades. \u201cI need you to open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Long lashes flipped up, revealing gold-and-emerald irises glassed over and dulled. A second later, big masculine hands wrapped around her neck and tossed her to her back. The mattress bounced, even with her slight weight. She offered no resistance as Kane rolled on top of her, pinning her in place. He was heavy, his grip so tight she couldn\u2019t breathe in the rose scent she\u2019d come to associate with him. An odd fragrance for a male, and one she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he snarled. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s speaking directly to me. Me!</p><p>\u201cAnswer.\u201d</p><p>She tried to reply, couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He loosened his hold.</p><p>There. Better. Deep breath in. Out. \u201cFor starters, I\u2019m your amazing and wonderful rescuer.\u201d Since receiving compliments had died with her mother, she\u2019d decided to give them to herself at every opportunity. \u201cRelease me, and we\u2019ll work out the particulars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho,\u201d he demanded, squeezing her tighter.</p><p>Black winked through her line of sight. Her lungs burned, desperate for air, but still she offered no resistance.</p><p>\u201cFemale.\u201d The pressure eased again. \u201cAnswer. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaveman. Free. Now,\u201d she retorted as she sucked in oxygen.</p><p>Could you watch your mouth, please? You don\u2019t want to scare him away.</p><p>He jerked away from her to crouch at the end of the bed. His gaze remained on her, watching intently as she slowly sat up. A red flush colored his cheeks, and she wondered if he was embarrassed by his actions or simply struggling to hide the weakness still pumping through him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have five seconds, female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what, warrior? You\u2019ll hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Determined. Assured.</p> <p>Silly man. Would it be totally gauche of her to ask him to sign her T-shirt? \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what you promised me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t promise you anything,\u201d he said, and though his tone was confident, his features darkened with confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou did. Think back to your last day in hell. It was you, me and a couple thousand of your worst enemies.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together, and his eyes glazed with remembrance, comprehension...then horror. He shook his head, as though desperate to dislodge the thoughts now swirling through his mind. \u201cYou weren\u2019t serious. You couldn\u2019t have been serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p> <p>He popped his jaw, an action of frustrated aggression. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t know. That way, there\u2019s no emotional attachment and you can more easily do what I require.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never actually said I\u2019d do it,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cAnd why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m...a giant box of chocolates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of you,\u201d she said, and left it at that. Truth, without explanation.</p> <p>\u201cHardly. If you\u2019d heard anything about me, you\u2019d be running away in fear.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really? \u201cI know that during the many wars you\u2019ve fought, your friends often left you behind, afraid you\u2019d cause some kind of travesty for them. I know you often keep yourself shut away from the world, terrified of the same. And yet, still you\u2019ve managed to slay thousands. Dare I say bazillions?\u201d</p><p>He ran his tongue over perfect white teeth. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we call it...gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossip isn\u2019t always right,\u201d he muttered. In seconds, he had swept his gaze through the small room and refocused on her.</p><p>She also happened to know that visual caress was a habit he\u2019d developed through the years, one meant to take everything in. Entrances, exits, weapons that could be used against him\u2014weapons he could use.</p><p>This time, all he would have seen was the peeling yellow wallpaper, the scarred nightstand with the chipped lamp. The sputtering air-conditioning unit. The brown shag carpet. The trash bin filled with bloody rags and emptied tubes of medicine she\u2019d used on his abrasions.</p><p>\u201cThat day in hell,\u201d he began. \u201cYou told me what you wanted, and then you made the mistake of assuming I agreed.\u201d</p> <p>That sounded like a refusal. But...he can\u2019t refuse me. Not now. \u201cYou gurgled your assent. Afterward, I did my part. Now you will do yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never asked for your help.\u201d His voice lashed like the sharpest of whips, striking at her, leaving an undeniable sting. \u201cNever wanted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, too! Your eyes begged me, and you can\u2019t deny it. You couldn\u2019t see your eyes, so you have no idea what they were doing.\u201d</p><p>A protracted pause. Then, quite calmly, he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s the most illogical argument I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the smartest, but your puny brain simply can\u2019t compute it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy eyes did not beg,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did, too,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAnd I did a terrible thing to get you out.\u201d Sadly, sending the Phoenix a note of apology wouldn\u2019t fix the problem.</p><p>As weak as Josephina had been in hell, she\u2019d required help with Kane. Only, once she\u2019d caught up to the Phoenix, still hacking her way to freedom, there\u2019d been a slight problem. The girl had refused so vehemently\u2014rot in hell, Fae whore\u2014that Josephina had known there would be no hope of changing her mind. So, Josephina had used the ability she alone carried. A blessing in the right circumstances. A curse that had kept her locked in a world without physical contact. With only a touch, she\u2019d stolen the strength right out of the Phoenix\u2019s body, reducing the girl to a boneless heap.</p><p>Yes, Josephina had draped the warrior woman over one shoulder and carried her out of hell, the same as she\u2019d done for Kane, fighting demons along the way\u2014a miracle considering she\u2019d never fought a day in her life\u2014eventually finding a way outside, but that wouldn\u2019t matter to the Phoenix. A crime had been committed, and a price had to be paid.</p><p>\u201cI never asked you to do terrible things.\u201d His voice contained the darkest of warnings.</p><p>One she did not heed. \u201cMaybe not audibly, but even still, I nearly broke my back saving you.\u201d She settled to her knees, shaking the mattress and nearly bouncing the weakened Kane to the floor. \u201cYou weigh, like, ten thousand pounds. But they\u2019re glorious pounds,\u201d she rushed to add. Stop insulting the man!</p><p>His slitted gaze tripped over every inch of her. The action lacked the stealth he\u2019d used for the room, and yet, it was almost tactile, as if he\u2019d touched her, too. Could he see the goose bumps now breaking over her skin?</p><p>\u201cHow did a girl like you manage such a feat?\u201d</p><p>A girl like her. Did he sense her inferiority? She lifted her chin, saying, \u201cAn information exchange wasn\u2019t part of our bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, woman, there was no bargain.\u201d</p><p>Tremors of dread rocked her, overshadowing...whatever he\u2019d previously made her feel. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do what you promised, I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Suffer for the rest of my life. \u201cWhat would it take to change your mind and make you do the right thing?\u201d</p><p>His expression shuttered, hiding all of his thoughts. \u201cWhat species are you?\u201d</p><p>A question totally off topic, but okay, she could roll. Since the Fae were not a well-liked race, the men best known for their lack of honor in battle, as well as their insatiable need to sleep with anything that moved, and the women known for backstabbing and scandal\u2014and okay, fine, their ability to sew a killer wardrobe\u2014the knowledge might spur him into action.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half human, half Fae. See?\u201d She pulled back the sides of her hair, drawing his attention to her ears and the points at the end.</p><p>His gaze locked on those points and narrowed. \u201cFae are descendants of Titans. Titans are children of fallen angels and humans. They are the current rulers of the lowest level of the skies.\u201d He shot out each fact as if it were a bullet.</p><p>Can\u2019t roll my eyes at a star. \u201cThank you for the history lesson.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat makes you...\u201d</p><p>Evil in his eyes? An enemy?</p><p>He shook his head, refusing to finish the thought. Then, his nose wrinkled, as if he\u2019d just smelled something...not unpleasant, but not welcome, either. He inhaled sharply, and his frown deepened. \u201cYou look nothing like the girl who rescued me...girls who rescued me...no, just one,\u201d he said with another shake of his head, as if he were trying to make sense of things that had happened. \u201cHer face and hair kept changing, and I recall each countenance, yet what I see now I didn\u2019t see then. But your scent...\u201d</p><p>Was the same, yes. \u201cI possessed the ability to switch my appearance.\u201d</p><p>One of his brows arched. \u201cPossessed. Past tense.\u201d</p><p>Even in his compromised state, he\u2019d caught her meaning. \u201cCorrect. I no longer have the ability.\u201d The strength\u2014and capabilities\u2014she borrowed from others could remain with her for as little time as an hour to as long as a few weeks. She had no control over the time frame. What she\u2019d taken from the Phoenix had faded yesterday.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying. No one has an ability one day, but not the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lie\u2014except for the few times I do, in fact, lie, but it\u2019s never intentional, and I\u2019m totally telling the truth right now.\u201d She raised her right hand. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven days,\u201d he gasped out.</p><p>\u201cYes. We spent most of our time playing incompetent doctor and ungrateful patient.\u201d</p><p>A dark scowl contorted his features, and oh, it was a scary thing to behold. The books hadn\u2019t done him justice. \u201cSeven days,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t miscount, I assure you. I\u2019ve been crossing off the seconds in the calendar in my heart.\u201d</p><p>He gave her the stink eye. \u201cYou have a smart mouth, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She brightened. \u201cYou think so? Really?\u201d It was the first compliment she\u2019d received from someone other than herself since her mother had died, and she would cherish it. \u201cThank you. Would you say my mouth is extremely intelligent or just slightly above average?\u201d</p><p>His jaw fell, as if he meant to reply, but no sound emerged from him. His eyelids were closing...opening...closing again, and his big body was swaying from side to side. He was about to go down, and if he hit the floor, she would never be able to lift him onto the bed.</p><p>Josephina surged forward, reaching for him with gloved hands. Though he teetered backward, he slapped her arms away, wanting no contact between them. Smart man. (As smart as he thought she was?) Down he fell, slamming into the carpet with a loud thud.</p><p>As she scrambled to her feet to rush to his side\u2014and do what, she didn\u2019t know\u2014the motel door burst open, shards of wood raining in every direction. A tall, thickly muscled warrior with dark hair stood in the center of the gaping hole, his features bathed in shadows. Menace lanced from him. Maybe because he gripped two daggers\u2014and they were already stained with blood.</p><p>Another warrior moved in behind him, this one blond, with...oh, someone save me. Guts hung from his hair.</p><p>Her father\u2019s men had found her.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>KANE BATTLED A tide of pain, humiliation and failure. He\u2019d been created fully formed, a warrior to the depths of his core. Throughout the centuries, he had fought in countless wars. He had slain enemy after enemy, and had walked away with many a blood-drenched injury\u2014but he\u2019d walked with a smile. He\u2019d fought, and he\u2019d won, and others had suffered for coming after him. And yet, here he was, on the floor of a dirty motel, too weak to move, at the mercy of a beautiful, fragile female who\u2019d seen him at his worst: chained, violated and carved open after yet another round of torture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted those images cut from her mind, even if he had to reach inside and remove them with a blade.</p><p>Then, he would cut them out of his own. The Hunters, blaming him for every disaster they\u2019d ever faced. Their bomb. A trip into hell. A horde of demon minions attacking, killing the Hunters and secreting Kane away. Day after day of torment.</p><p>Shackles. The drip, drip of blood. Satisfied grins, bloodstained teeth. Hands, everywhere. Mouths, seeking. Tongues, licking.</p> <p>A soundtrack played quietly in the background. Moans of pain\u2014his. Moans of pleasure\u2014none his own. The slap of flesh against flesh. The scrape of nails, digging deep. A bark of laughter.</p><p>Terrible scents filled his nose. Sulfur. Arousal. Dirt. Old copper. Sweat. The pungent sting of fear.</p><p>One brutal emotion after another bombarded him. Disgust, rage, feelings of utter violation. Sorrow, humiliation, sadness. Helplessness. Panic. More disgust.</p><p>He moaned, a tragic sound. Desperate to avoid a breakdown, he erected a brick wall around his screaming mind, blocking the worst of the emotions. Can\u2019t deal right now. Just...can\u2019t. He was free at least. He couldn\u2019t forget that. Rescue had come.</p><p>No, not a rescue. Not at first. Warriors had stolen him from the minions, only to tie him down for their own special brand of torture.</p> <p>Then, the girl had arrived, demanding he help her with the vilest of tasks.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d a male voice roared. \u201cWhy were there Fae soldiers ready to sneak into this room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You\u2019re not with the Fae?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, female?\u201d</p><p>Kane recognized the speaker. Sabin, his leader, and the keeper of the demon of Doubt. Sabin was a male who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to snap a woman\u2019s neck if he thought that woman had hurt one of his soldiers.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d the girl said. \u201cI\u2019m no one, and I\u2019ve done nothing. Really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLies will only make it worse for you.\u201d</p><p>Another speaker Kane recognized. Strider, the keeper of the demon of Defeat. Like Sabin, Strider wouldn\u2019t hesitate to harm a woman in defense of a friend.</p><p>Kane should have been comforted by their appearance. They were brothers of his heart, the family he needed, and they would protect him, whisk him to safety, and do everything within their power to ensure he healed. But he was scabbed, bruised and emotionally naked, and they were now witnesses to his shame, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet heat. Why didn\u2019t you step into the light sooner? I know who you are,\u201d the girl gasped out. \u201cYou\u2019re...you\u2019re...you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m also your doom,\u201d Sabin snapped.</p><p>The warrior assumed the black-haired girl was responsible for Kane\u2019s condition. A mistake. He tried to sit up, but the muscles in his stomach were useless, not yet completely woven back together.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t take this the wrong way,\u201d said the girl, \u201cbut that\u2019s got to be the lamest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me, and Kane here has said some doozies. You\u2019re a magnificent warrior known throughout all the lands for your strength and cunning. I know you can issue a better threat than that.\u201d</p><p>More than once, the silly things that had come out of that candy-apple mouth had made him want to smile, despite the pain relentlessly battering him. Now was one of those times. He didn\u2019t understand it.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a right way to take that?\u201d Sabin snapped. \u201cGuard the door,\u201d he said to Strider. \u201cI\u2019m going to tear her from limb to limb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do, boss. I\u2019m calling dibs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean we\u2019re battling to the death?\u201d she asked casually.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d both men replied in unison.</p><p>\u201cOh, well. Okay, then. Let\u2019s get started, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Kane stiffened.</p><p>\u201cIs she serious?\u201d Sabin.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Strider.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>Big talk for such a tiny girl.</p><p>A girl who confused Kane in every way.</p><p>She had tended him gently, tenderly, and yet he had hurt from more than just his injuries. And not a good hurt, either, to let him know he was alive, but a sharp throb that rode the waves in his veins, reaching him at a cellular level, like a disease, a cancer, eating at him, demanding he get away from her as quickly as possible. And yet, inside, deeper still, where primal instinct jerked at a flimsy leash, a desire to grab her, to hold on and never let go, consumed him.</p><p>She was beautiful, funny and sweet, and he heard one word every time he looked at her. Mine.</p><p>Mine. Mine. MINE.</p><p>It was a constant stream of noise, undeniable\u2014unstoppable. It was also wrong. His \u201cmine\u201d would never cause him pain. And he didn\u2019t want a \u201cmine.\u201d Any time he\u2019d tried to make a go of a relationship, the evil inside him swiftly destroyed it\u2014and the female. Now, after everything that had happened to him...</p><p>A rise of the disgust, sizzling and blistering, tightened his hands into dangerous weapons. No, he didn\u2019t want a \u201cmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou eager to die?\u201d Strider asked, stalking a circle around her.</p><p>\u201cYou stalling?\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can take me?\u201d</p><p>The warrior sucked in a breath.</p><p>The girl had issued a challenge\u2014intentional or unintentional?\u2014and the warrior\u2019s demon had just accepted. Strider would do everything in his power to win, and Kane couldn\u2019t blame him. Anytime the male lost a challenge, he suffered in agonizing pain for days.</p><p>Demons always came with a curse.</p><p>Have to stop him. Whether the girl belonged to Kane or not, she wasn\u2019t to be harmed. Seeing a single bruise on that sun-licked skin would unhinge him, he knew it, could already feel the darkness rising, his control teetering at the edge of chilling violence.</p><p>As he again struggled to sit up, multiple footsteps pounded, causing the floor to reverberate. Low growls erupted. The swish of clothing whispered past. Flesh met flesh, bone met bone. Metal clinked against metal. The males would destroy her.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you got?\u201d the girl taunted\u2014a taunt undercut by her heavy panting. \u201cCome on, fellas. Let\u2019s make this memorable, one for the history books!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kane tried to shout, but not even his ears picked up the sound.</p><p>Strider jumped over him. Another clang of metal echoed.</p><p>\u201cHow can this be memorable?\u201d Sabin roared. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019re doing is leaping out of the way when we strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not meaning to, but instinct keeps kicking in,\u201d she said.</p><p>To anyone but Kane, who knew her secret desire, the conversation would have sounded weird.</p><p>The fight continued, the two men chasing the girl around the small room, leaping on furniture, bouncing off the walls, slashing out with hungry blades and missing as she darted out of the way.</p><p>The urge to commit violence sharpened with deadly force.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you back.\u201d He would do anything to protect her.</p><p>Even in this pitiful state?</p><p>He ignored the humiliating question.</p><p>Question. Yes. He had more questions for the girl than he\u2019d already asked\u2014and this time, she would answer satisfactorily or he would...he wasn\u2019t sure what he would do. He\u2019d lost all sense of mercy and compassion inside that cave.</p><p>The threat stopped Sabin in his tracks. The warrior lowered his weapons.</p><p>Strider refused to give up, and finally managed to grab the girl by the hair. She yelped as he jerked, tugging her into the hard line of his body.</p><p>Kane managed to get to his feet, intending to rip the two apart. Mine. He stalked forward, tripped over a shoe, thanks to the demon, and came crashing down. Pain consumed him.</p><p>Before the girl had a chance to scream for help, or curse Strider\u2019s very existence, he knocked her ankles together and sent her propelling to the floor. He went down with her, pinning her shoulders to the floor with his knees. Though she struggled, she couldn\u2019t work her way free.</p><p>\u201cI said...don\u2019t hurt,\u201d Kane shouted with what little strength he had left.</p><p>\u201cHey. I barely touched her. I also won,\u201d the warrior announced, a huge grin lifting the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Sabin marched to Kane\u2019s side, crouched, and helped roll him to his back. Then the warrior slid gentle hands under his head and shoulders. Kane flinched from the contact, his mind blaring out a protest he refused to let his mouth deliver, but still his friend held firm, easing him into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you, my man.\u201d Tender words meant to assure and comfort him. Too bad nothing would ever assure and comfort him again. \u201cWeren\u2019t ever going to give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he managed to ask. Let me go. Please, just let me go.</p><p>Sabin understood his question, but not his inner plea. \u201cThere was a story in a tabloid about a superwoman in New York carrying a hulk over her shoulder. Torin worked his magic and hacked into security cameras in the area, and boom. We had you.\u201d</p><p>From her trapped position on the floor, the girl looked over at him. Panting, she said to Sabin, \u201cHey, can\u2019t you tell he\u2019s not liking the physical contact? Let him go.\u201d</p><p>How had she known, when one of his best friends hadn\u2019t noticed?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Strider said. \u201cWhy are you wearing gloves, female?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the question, she closed her eyes and asked, \u201cAre you going to kill me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kane roared. MINE! MINE!</p><p>Strider sheathed his blades and stood. Immediately the girl climbed to her feet. Long strands of hair had fallen over her brow, onto her cheeks; she pushed the locks behind the pointed ears that had so startled him.</p><p>Most of the Fae preferred to remain in their realm. They weren\u2019t the most beloved of races, and immortals tended to attack first and ask questions later. Still, Kane had run into a few throughout the centuries. Each Fae had possessed curling white hair and skin as pale as milk. This one had a slick fall of jet-black silk, with no hint of a wave, and skin the most luscious shade of bronze. Marks of her humanity? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes belonged to the Fae, though. Large and blue, like the rarest of jewels, the color lightened and darkened with her moods. Right now they were crystalline, almost lacking any color at all. Was she frightened?</p><p>The demon of Disaster liked the thought and purred his approval.</p><p>Shut up, Kane snarled. I\u2019ll kill you. Kill you so dead.</p> <p>The purrs became chuckles, and Kane had to force himself to breathe, in and out, in and out, slow and measured. He wanted to cut off his ears in the hopes of silencing all that sickening amusement. He wanted to tear the room apart, destroy every piece of furniture, take down every wall, rip up every inch of carpet. He wanted to...grab the girl and carry her away from this awful place.</p><p>His gaze met hers, and she offered the sweetest of smiles. A smile that said, It\u2019s going to be okay, I promise.</p><p>The rage dialed down to a simmer.</p><p>That. Quickly.</p><p>How had she done that?</p> <p>Of all the faces she had flashed, this was by far the prettiest. She had the longest lashes he\u2019d ever seen. Her cheekbones were high and sharp, her nose perfectly sloped and her lips heart-shaped. There was a slight point in her chin.</p><p>She was like a little girl\u2019s doll come to dazzling life, and she smelled of rosemary and spearmint\u2014a fresh-baked bread paired with an after-dinner mint. In other words, home.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Never, the demon snipped, and the ground began to shake.</p><p>Stupid demon. Like any other living creature, Disaster experienced hunger. Unlike others, fear and upset were his favorite foods. So when he yearned for a meal\u2014or just wanted dessert\u2014he caused some sort of catastrophe for Kane, as well as those around him.</p><p>Sometimes, those catastrophes were small. A light bulb would short out, or the floor would crack at his feet. Too many times, those catastrophes were large. A limb would fall from a tree. Cars would crash. Buildings would crumble.</p> <p>Hatred scraped at his chest. One day, I\u2019ll be free of you. One day, I\u2019ll destroy you.</p><p>The shaking stopped as the demon laughed with glee. I\u2019m a part of you. There\u2019ll be no getting rid of me. Ever.</p><p>Kane pounded a fist into the floor. Long ago, the Greeks had told him only death would separate him from the demon\u2014his death\u2014but that Disaster would live on forevermore. Perhaps that was true. Perhaps not. The Greeks were famous for their lies. But either way, Kane wouldn\u2019t risk death. He was twisted enough to want to witness Disaster\u2019s defeat, and just cold enough to want to be the one to deliver the final blow.</p><p>There had to be a way to have both.</p><p>\u201c\u2014right? Yes?\u201d the girl was saying.</p><p>Her lilting voice brought him back to the present.</p><p>\u201cUh, Kane,\u201d Sabin prompted. \u201cDid you promise to do that?\u201d</p><p>She had been speaking to Kane, then, and he could imagine what she\u2019d said. He shook his head, his neck almost too weak to support the action. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...but...his memory must be impaired.\u201d Her gaze swung to Strider, cerulean flooding her irises, becoming an ocean of anger. \u201cWhat about you? Will you carry out his end of the bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Strider thumped his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do you want me to proceed, hmm?\u201d</p><p>A violent tremor swept through her, but she said, \u201cI want...I want you to take your dagger and...stab me in the heart.\u201d</p><p>The warrior blinked, shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you? You actually want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to, no, but I need to,\u201d she whispered, the anger giving way to defeat.</p><p>Kane swallowed a roar, remembering her words in the cave.</p><p>I will take you to the human world\u2014and in return, you will kill me. I\u2019ll have your vow first.</p><p>Maybe he hadn\u2019t believed her then. Maybe he\u2019d been too lost to his own pain to care. But now, the fact that she wanted to die...not just no, but hell no. He would die first.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you dodge my blows?\u201d Strider demanded of the girl.</p><p>\u201cI told you. Instinct. But I\u2019ll do better next time, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Mine, Kane heard again, a deep, rumbling growl rising...rising...escaping. \u201cMine! Touch her and I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Both Sabin and Strider stared at him with astonishment. Kane had always been the calm one, and had never before raised his voice to his friends. But he wasn\u2019t the man he used to be\u2014wouldn\u2019t ever be that man again.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged the warrior, those eyes swirling with flecks of baby blue. How desperate she sounded.</p><p>How much more hotly his rage burned.</p><p>Something terrible had to have happened to her to make her feel death was the only option available. Had someone...had she been forced\u2014he couldn\u2019t finish the thought. He would erupt. Or bury his head in the hollow of her neck and sob.</p><p>He peered up at Strider. Big, blond Strider, with his navy eyes and warped sense of humor. \u201cBind her. Gently. Bring her with us.\u201d He would help her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She held up her hands, palms up, and backed away from the warrior. \u201cNo way. Just no way. Unless you\u2019re planning to take me to an undisclosed location, so no one will see the blood.\u201d</p><p>He could have lied. Instead, he remained quiet as Sabin assisted him to his feet. Broken bones that had only recently been reset screamed in protest, and his knees nearly buckled, but he held steady. He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to go down. Not again. Not in front of his min\u2014the girl.</p><p>\u201cSorry, honey cakes,\u201d Strider said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t get a say in what happens next. You\u2019re gonna live and not die, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...\u201d Her gaze found Kane and pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ve wasted so much time with you. I have no one else to ask for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Any man who thought to give her what she asked for would die the worst of deaths.</p><p>\u201cGood? Good! Oh!\u201d Anger overshadowed everything else, and she stomped her foot. \u201cYou heartless, overgrown lout!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he won\u2019t hurt you? That\u2019s a first.\u201d Strider reached out, intending to grab her.</p><p>In a snap, she kicked out her leg, nailing the male between the legs. As Strider hunched over, gasping for breath, she bolted for the door, tossing over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed in you, Lord Kane!\u201d</p><p>She vanished into the night.</p><p>He tried to follow after her, but curse his weakness, his knees buckled. \u201cCome back, female! Now!\u201d</p><p>She never reappeared.</p><p>Kane experienced a tidal wave of rage that made a mockery of what had come before. He would get her back. He would stalk through the night, grab everyone he spotted, and, if they couldn\u2019t point him in the right direction, rip their spines out of their mouths. He would leave an ocean of blood in his wake, and she would have only herself to blame. He would\u2014</p><p>Do nothing, Disaster finished with a laugh.</p><p>It stung all the worse because Kane could only remain crumpled on the floor.</p><p>\u201cBring her back to me,\u201d he shouted to Strider.</p><p>Moaning in agony, the warrior toppled to the floor. He\u2019d just been bested by a puny little girl; his demon would be throwing out pain for the next several days.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Kane commanded Sabin.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he insisted. \u201cBring her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYelling at me isn\u2019t going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Kane tried to crawl to the door, but dizziness crowded into his mind, stopping him. He spit out a mouthful of curses.</p><p>Could nothing go right for him? Not even once?</p><p>Disaster started laughing all over again.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The Realm of Blood and Shadows</p><p>A week later</p><p>KANE ROSE FROM the king-size bed and padded to his private bathroom. Already naked, he stepped into the shower. Hot water beat against newly healed skin, all the bruises and scabs finally gone. And yet, his muscles had yet to unknot.</p><p>The fury he\u2019d experienced at the loss of his rescuer had yet to fade, and hatred for Disaster was a constant burn in his chest. And his memories...they were the worst.</p><p>They came during the day. They came during the night. He could be lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling, and all of a sudden he would be transported back to hell, his wrists and ankles bound. He could be in the shower, like now, with the water raining over him, and all of a sudden he would see the dirt, blood and...other things once caked on his skin, and no amount of scrubbing would make him clean.</p><p>He was pretty sure the wires in his brain had gotten cut during his torture. And as he\u2019d healed physically, those wires had been reattached in the wrong places. Darkness had become a perfume that constantly wafted from his pores. Hungry anger now simmered inside him, desperate for a target.</p><p>No one was safe.</p><p>He\u2019d lost his appetite. He could no longer sleep. Sudden noises made him scramble for a weapon.</p><p>Once, he\u2019d rolled with the punches life threw at him. Once, he\u2019d been a softer, nicer guy. Now, there would be no more rolling. Now, he was a raging bull, at times too violent to contain. Any wrong was punished immediately\u2014no one would ever think him weak enough to challenge again.</p><p>The shambles of his room proved it.</p><p>He soaped up, rinsed off and towel dried, every action stiff, forced. Standing in front of the mirror, he studied his foggy reflection. His skin was pale. Dark hair dripped water down his shoulders and chest. Because of the weight he\u2019d lost, his cheeks had yet to fill out. His lips were compressed into a thin line, as though they\u2019d never known a smile. Maybe they hadn\u2019t. Any memory with an accompaniment of amusement no longer seemed to belong to him. Everything positive had happened to someone else. Surely.</p><p>But the worst thing about him? His eyes were no longer a mix of brown and green. They were a mix of brown, green\u2014and red. Demon red.</p><p>A sense of repugnance grew. Disaster was attempting to control him. And the demon was actually succeeding, whispering reminders about what had happened inside that cave.</p><p>A hand here...a mouth there...so helpless...</p><p>How dirty was Kane now? How tainted?</p><p>A whip across your legs. A dagger along your ribs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How much of a failure was he?</p><p>Hot breath on your wounded skin...kisses...tongues...</p><p>Fighting to breathe, Kane flattened his hands on the edge of the sink. He hardly cared when the porcelain cracked. He wanted to rip Disaster out of his chest, and strangle the creature with his bare hands.</p> <p>Yes. That\u2019s the way his tormentor would die.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>If he could get his mind right, at least a little, he could figure out a way to make it happen. But any time he wasn\u2019t plagued by gut-wrenching memories, he was plagued by thoughts about the girl from the motel. The Fae. He ached as he\u2019d done when she\u2019d touched him. He tensed. He cursed.</p><p>He yearned.</p><p>He remembered the adoration painted on her face as she looked at him, as if he were someone special. A look he still didn\u2019t understand\u2014but wanted to experience again.</p> <p>He replayed the silly words she\u2019d spoken to him.</p><p>I never lie\u2014except for the few times I do, in fact, lie, but it\u2019s never intentional, and I\u2019m totally telling the truth right now, I promise.</p><p>You weigh, like, ten thousand pounds. But they\u2019re glorious pounds.</p><p>I\u2019ve been crossing off the seconds in the calendar in my heart.</p><p>He wanted to know what else she would say.</p><p>Who was she? Where was she? What was she doing?</p> <p>Were memories she\u2019d rather not recall afflicting her? Was she hurt? Alone? Scared?</p><p>A few times, fear had wiped away her adoration and sass, leaving her with nothing but tremors.</p><p>He understood all too well the difficulty\u2014the desperation\u2014of an inescapable past.</p><p>Had she found someone to end her? Had she ended herself?</p><p>Or was she still alive?</p><p>His arms dropped to his sides as his hands fisted. She was his. She\u2014</p><p>Wasn\u2019t his.</p><p>Still, he wasn\u2019t going to take care of his problem until he\u2019d taken care of hers, was he? He couldn\u2019t leave her out there, desperate and afraid, possibly in danger. The girl had saved him from the most horrific situation of his life. Even though she\u2019d run away from him, he had to step up and save her from what had to be the most horrific situation of hers.</p> <p>She was right, after all. He owed her. And he would pay up. Just not the way she wished. He would fix her life the way he couldn\u2019t fix his own. Then, one of them would be happy.</p><p>She deserved to be happy.</p><p>If she still lived.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. She had better still live, or he would...he would... He punched the mirror, shattering the glass. The sound of tinkling bells filled the small enclosure. Several pieces arrowed into his leg, cutting into his thigh. A gift from Disaster, he was sure. Gritting his teeth, he removed the shards.</p><p>After he helped the girl, he could concentrate on killing the demon. He wouldn\u2019t give up until he succeeded. He couldn\u2019t take this anymore, and he didn\u2019t want his friends to have to take it anymore, either. He was too much of a danger to those around him, and there were too many innocents here.</p><p>He would leave today, he decided, and he wouldn\u2019t ever come back.</p><p>Sorrow settled heavily on his shoulders, weighing him down. He couldn\u2019t talk to his friends about his decision. They wouldn\u2019t understand. They would try to talk him into taking another path. They might even lock him away for his \u201cown good.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d done it once before.</p><p>Kane wouldn\u2019t sneak away, but he wouldn\u2019t admit the truth, either. He would say his goodbyes, as if he meant to return after his rescuer had been saved. Only he would know this was it. The end.</p><p>Jaw locked, Kane strapped weapons all over his body. There were multiple blades, two Sigs and several clips. He dressed in a black T-shirt and camo pants, then tugged on his favorite pair of combat boots. He stomped from the bathroom, glass crunching under his feet, his mind a field of evil laughter.</p><p>Stupid demon.</p><p>During Kane\u2019s absence, his friends had moved into a fortress in the Realm of Blood and Shadows, a kingdom hidden in a pocket between earth and the lower level of the skies. He strode down the hall, his gaze on the walls covered with pictures of a beautiful blonde female in various outfits and positions. Lounging on a velvet-lined couch, standing in a rose garden, dancing on a table. Blowing a kiss. Winking.</p><p>Her name was Viola, and she was a minor goddess of something or other, as well as the keeper of Narcissism. He couldn\u2019t help but compare her to sperm: she had about a one in three million chance of becoming a human being with actual emotions. The girl irritated the fire out of him.</p><p>He pounded down the stairs, then down another hallway, this one littered with ridiculous portraits of the warriors wearing ribbons and lace and smiles\u2014and nothing else. They\u2019d been painted by a dead man, if ever Kane met the guy, and had been commissioned by Lucien\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Anya, the goddess of Anarchy, without permission.</p><p>Finally Kane reached his destination. Maddox and Ashlyn\u2019s bedroom. His first stop on the Tour of Goodbyes.</p><p>Maddox was the keeper of Violence. Ashlyn was the new mother of the warrior\u2019s twin babies.</p><p>For a long while, Kane watched Ashlyn, silent. She was a delicate beauty with honey-colored hair and skin, and she swayed in a rocker, singing to the bundle of joy clutched lovingly in her arms. Beside her, Maddox swayed in a second rocker. He was a brute of a man with black hair and violet eyes, and seeing him kiss the tiny fingers wrapped around his pinky did something to Kane\u2019s insides. Twisted and knotted them, until he experienced the same lance of pain his pointy-eared rescuer had caused.</p><p>What was that?</p><p>William the Ever Randy\u2014aka the Panty Melter, Kane thought with an eye-roll\u2014sat at the edge of the king-size bed, a pink comforter plumped around his battle-honed body. Somehow, the feminine coverlet failed to diminish the savage intensity of his strength. He wasn\u2019t demon-possessed. No one knew what he was, exactly. All they knew was that he had a temper rivaled by few, and a mean streak longer than any Kane had ever before encountered. He smiled when he killed his enemies\u2014and laughed when he stabbed his friends.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s it gonna be my turn?\u201d William whined. \u201cI want to hold my preciouses. Preciousees? Whatever. I want!\u201d</p><p>O-kay. That was new.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t yours,\u201d Maddox snapped, doing his best to whisper for the sake of the babies.</p><p>\u201cThey kind of are. I delivered them,\u201d William pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI conceived them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig deal. Most guys can do that. Not many have the know-how to slice a woman from hip to hip and dig the little creatures out of her...uh, never mind,\u201d William said as a fierce growl rose from Maddox.</p><p>Expecting a fight, Kane stepped inside to claim the baby.</p><p>William\u2019s electric blues swung his way. \u201cDisaster. Couldn\u2019t stay away from the most delightful darlings ever born? Oh, yes, you are,\u201d he cast at the children. \u201cYes, yes, you are.\u201d</p><p>Baby talk. Disgusting.</p><p>The negative reaction surprised him. Once, he would have been right there beside William, saying the same things, in the same manner. In the dark of night, he used to dream of such a happily ever after for himself. A loving wife. Adoring children. Then the minions had tried to steal his seed and he...he...</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me by the demon\u2019s name,\u201d he snarled, then realized his fervency had caused the children to jolt awake and cry. Shame coursed through him. \u201cSorry. But I\u2019m not that disgusting piece of\u2014\u201d Yelling again. \u201cSorry. Just watch your mouth, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush now,\u201d William said sternly, and Kane had no idea who the command was for.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, really. Everyone quieted.</p><p>Ashlyn glanced over at Kane, her amber eyes welcoming. She looked nothing like Kane\u2019s woman\u2014no, not his, he quickly amended\u2014and yet she reminded him of the girl. The delicacy of her bone structure, perhaps. Or the depth of her concern for those around her, maybe. \u201cDo you want to hold Urban?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he replied at the same time Maddox said, \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A stilted moment of silence elapsed.</p><p>Kane ignored the hurt the words caused. The refusal was justified. He was a danger to everyone he encountered. Had his mind not been such a mess, constantly feeding the demon the tastiest of meals, light bulbs would have been shorting out and the walls and floors would have been cracking.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to get a look at them before... Well, I\u2019ll be leaving a little later today. I\u2019ve got a female to help.\u201d He cleared the clog of emotion from his throat.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, then,\u201d Ashlyn said. \u201cSabin and Strider mentioned the pointy-eared woman from New York. I like the sound of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...\u201d Magnificent. Lovely. Witty. \u201cSomething.\u201d His insides tightened as he approached the rockers.</p><p>William stood to do the same, remaining by his side, stiff, his hand poised over the hilt of a dagger. To protect the babies from Kane\u2019s affliction? Yeah. Probably.</p><p>Can\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cYou gettin\u2019 so close to me \u2019cause you\u2019re trying to taste my flavor, Willy boy?\u201d he said to the warrior who had yet to back off. Teasing was better than raging. Or worse. Crying.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d William allowed a few more inches of space. \u201cBut you just ruined it. Flavor? Seriously? I like my conquests with a little more maturity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mature. I\u2019m even old enough to plow your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. She would eat your liver for lunch and your kidneys for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you guys be any more disgusting?\u201d Ashlyn asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>Urban chortled, as if he understood. The kid had a full head of black hair, and his eyes were the same shade of violet as his father\u2019s\u2014though they were far more serious and too intelligent for a newborn. As Kane looked him over, two horns rose from the baby\u2019s skull, and black scales appeared on his hands.</p><p>\u201cDefensive actions?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe think so,\u201d Ashlyn replied, sounding somewhat embarrassed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean any insult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He shifted his gaze to Maddox. The female child, Ever, had the honey-colored hair of her mother, the strands wound into tight little curls. Her eyes swam with orange and gold flames, and a mouthful of teeth peeked out from under her lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The twins had been born a little over a month ago, and yet they appeared quite older.</p><p>The boy stared at Kane as if plotting his murder.</p><p>The girl looked him over and dismissed him, concentrating on William and holding out her arms. Grinning, William claimed her from her father. She nuzzled against the warrior\u2019s neck, resting her head on his shoulder and sighing with contentment.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she the best?\u201d William said, his grin widening. \u201cShe used to have claws, but they shrank. Didn\u2019t they, princess? Oh, yes, they did, but they\u2019ll come out to play if some dumb loser ever tries to take what you don\u2019t want to give, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Another sharp pain tore through Kane\u2019s chest. \u201cThe children are beautiful,\u201d he told the beaming parents, and he meant it. He removed a bejeweled dagger from the sheath at his side, and handed it hilt first to Maddox. \u201cThis is for Ever, from her uncle Kane.\u201d</p><p>Maddox nodded his head in acceptance.</p><p>He palmed the matching dagger, and placed it on the small table beside Ashlyn. \u201cThis is for Urban.\u201d</p><p>She offered a soft, sweet smile in thanks. \u201cHow wonderfully thoughtful. The children will love them, I know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t. Put those dangerous things away,\u201d William chided. \u201cMy darlings can\u2019t play with knives for another couple of months. And why are you giving them presents now? Why can\u2019t you wait until the appropriate time and\u2014\u201d His gaze zeroed in on Kane, and he pressed his lips together.</p><p>Did he suspect the truth\u2014that Kane was leaving for good?</p><p>Whatever. Kane ignored him, slapping Maddox on the shoulder. \u201cI want to thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for me. Words cannot express what you mean to me.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait around for the warrior\u2019s reply; he couldn\u2019t. The backs of his eyes were burning. He must have gotten dust in them.</p><p>He strode from the room, intending to hunt down the remaining warriors he loved more than life. Torin, Lucien, Reyes, Paris, Aeron, Gideon, Amun, Sabin, Strider and Cameo. Over the centuries, they\u2019d fought together, avenged each other, saved each other. Yes, for many years they\u2019d been split into two different groups, one determined to battle the Hunters, the other determined to exist in peace. But at heart, they\u2019d always been together. And in the end, the war had boiled over, bringing them back to the same purpose. Survival.</p><p>Each warrior would be devastated by his departure. He knew that for a fact\u2014because they\u2019d once lost another of their brethren. Baden, the keeper of Distrust. They had mourned for centuries, and still hadn\u2019t truly recovered. But Kane didn\u2019t have a chance to hunt down a single person. William swept up to his side, keeping pace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving,\u201d the warrior said.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d already admitted that much.</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d A statement, not a question.</p><p>He wanted to lie. William could try to stop him. William could tell the others, and they could try to stop him. Still he said, \u201cYes.\u201d Demons loved lies, and while there wasn\u2019t much Kane could do to deny Disaster pleasure, telling the truth was one of them.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going with you,\u201d William announced.</p><p>Kane stopped and faced the male, irritation hanging in the air as heavily as shackles.</p><p>Shackles.</p><p>Breathe. \u201cWhy?\u201d His tone lashed with more force than he\u2019d intended. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going or what I\u2019m planning.\u201d</p><p>A shrug of those wide shoulders. \u201cMaybe I could use a distraction. I\u2019ve been hunting a Sent One, some punk kid named Axel, but he\u2019s proven to be wily and it\u2019s starting to annoy me.\u201d</p> <p>Sent Ones policed the skies, killing demons. They were winged, like angels, but as vulnerable to their emotions as humans. Right now, the Lords and the Sent Ones were on the same team.</p><p>Everyone knew that could change at any moment.</p><p>Kane narrowed his eyes. \u201cMaybe you think I need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d As always, William was utterly unabashed.</p><p>\u201cWell, no thanks. I don\u2019t need you, and I certainly don\u2019t want you nearby, bugging me all the time.\u201d</p><p>William clutched his heart, as though offended. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You used to be so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I\u2019ve never been sweet, and I never will be. Your needs and wants don\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019m more concerned with saving my babies. I have to make sure you live up to your word and stay away from the fortress. Have you forgotten you\u2019re destined to start an apocalypse?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Los Angeles</p><p>APOCALYPSE. THE WORD echoed in Kane\u2019s mind for days. No matter what he tried, he couldn\u2019t escape it.</p><p>Right before he was captured by the Hunters and escorted into hell, the Moirai had summoned him to their realm in the lowest level of the skies.</p><p>The three keepers of fate were neither Greek nor Titan. He thought they might be witches, but he wasn\u2019t sure. They\u2019d told him three things\u2014one for every witch. He could marry the keeper of Irresponsibility. He could marry another female\u2014William\u2019s daughter. And lastly, he would cause an apocalypse.</p><p>He believed them. To his knowledge, their predictions had never been wrong.</p><p>He knew there were two definitions for the word he would love to forget. The first: to uncover or reveal. More specifically, to give revelation, especially concerning a cataclysm in which the forces of good permanently triumphed over the forces of evil.</p><p>That, he liked.</p><p>The second? Not so much. Universal or widespread devastation.</p><p>With the demon of Disaster living inside him, he had to assume he would be responsible for widespread devastation.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t regret a pit stop like this,\u201d William said, pushing his way through the crowded nightclub. He had to yell to be heard over the erratic pulse of rock screaming from large speakers. \u201cIt\u2019s just what the doctor ordered\u2014that, and a pair of testicles, but I can only deliver on the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d he said drily.</p><p>Kane had made the mistake of sharing a motel room with William, and apparently he\u2019d thrashed and moaned in his sleep, giving Detective William a few hints about what had happened in hell. Now the warrior was convinced a night with a woman of Kane\u2019s choosing was the only way to ever really heal.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d William added, \u201cyou can call me Dr. Love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stab you in the heart before I called you that.\u201d He stayed on William\u2019s tail, already wishing he\u2019d said no to this. He should be hunting his Fae. And he would have been, if he weren\u2019t just desperate enough to try anything.</p><p>What William told him this morning made sense, in a sick, twisted way. If Kane could be with a woman of his choosing...if he could control how things went down...if he could use someone the way he\u2019d been used...maybe the dark cloud of his memories would finally dissipate. Maybe he would stop hurting when he neared the Fae. Without the pain, he would be stronger, more alert. He would have a better chance of helping her with her problems.</p><p>At least, for tonight, he didn\u2019t have to worry about her. She was alive, holed up, and safe. With some fancy computer work, illegally tapping into satellite feed, Torin had found her in Montana. Kane had only to swoop in and grab her.</p><p>Soon I\u2019ll be ready.</p><p>Disaster banged against his skull. A second later, the floor cracked at Kane\u2019s feet.</p><p>Apparently, the mire of Kane\u2019s emotions no longer satisfied the demon. Since leaving the fortress, any time Kane even considered helping the Fae, Disaster worked himself into a frenzy.</p><p>Hate her, the demon snarled.</p><p>The person passing by him tripped and fell, and bone snapped. A howl of agony blended with the pulse of music.</p><p>Grinding his teeth, Kane followed William up a flight of stairs, thankfully leaving the bar and dance area behind. Almost to the top, the step under his boot broke, and he fell to his knees.</p><p>Disaster laughed, proud of himself.</p><p>Kane blanked his mind before he erupted, stood and stomped the rest of the way up. He spotted a big red door at the end of a long hallway, with an armed guard posted in front. The male was tall and muscled, but human. Hardly a threat, even with a weapon.</p><p>The guard grinned with genuine happiness when he spotted William. \u201cWilly! Our best money-maker is back.\u201d</p><p>William grinned, saying to Kane, \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m bored, I do a little Magic Mike show for the ladies. Very tasteful. I\u2019ll get you tickets.\u201d He returned his attention to the guard. \u201cMy boy here needs the private room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure. Anything for you.\u201d The guy opened the door, but Kane couldn\u2019t see past the thick cloud of shadows. He heard gasping, the slap of skin against skin, moans and groans, and then curses as the guard \u201chelped\u201d the couple stop and dress. A moment later, the pair was tripping past the entrance, red-faced as they pulled on their clothes.</p><p>The guard reappeared, his grin wider than before. \u201cAll yours, Willy.\u201d</p><p>William pushed Kane inside. \u201cDid you see anyone you wanted on the way up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone will do.\u201d A woman was a woman, as far as he was concerned.</p><p>Just as soon as the thought registered, some part of his mind spit and hissed at it. The Fae wasn\u2019t just\u2014whatever. No thinking about her. Anyone was better than a demon minion, and that\u2019s all his sense of choice cared about.</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes,\u201d William said. \u201cI know the working girls. I\u2019ll find you someone who will let you take her any way you want her.\u201d</p><p>Crude, but necessary.</p><p>The door shut, sealing Kane inside. The pungent smell of sex thickened the air and his stomach filled with acid. He hated the dark, and quickly flipped on the light. In front of him was a wet bar, and beside it a couch, the cushions askew. On the coffee table was a box of condoms. At the other end of the room was a small bathroom with only a toilet and a sink, and beside it a queen-size bed with the covers tangled in a heap at the end. There was a condom stuck to the top.</p><p>After pouring himself a shot of whiskey\u2014then another and another and another, then deciding to take the entire bottle with him\u2014Kane settled on the couch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time the door opened a short while later, the bottle was empty. Alcohol never affected him as strongly as it did a human, and only served to dull out the fiercest of his emotions. That dullness was desperately needed now. His limbs were trembling, and sweat had beaded over every inch of his skin. He expected to melt\u2014or shatter\u2014at any moment.</p><p>William walked in with a pretty blonde tucked into his side. She wore a short red dress and lipstick to match, and she was smiling at something the warrior had said.</p><p>\u201cThis is my friend.\u201d William motioned to Kane with a tilt of his chin. \u201cThe guy I was telling you about. He\u2019ll pay you whatever you want. Just make sure you do whatever he wants.\u201d</p> <p>Kane set the bottle on the ground, pretending he wasn\u2019t about to vomit.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She bit her lip as she studied Kane. Interest lit her dark eyes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d William said, chucking her under the chin. \u201cYou have nothing to worry about. He won\u2019t bite\u2014unless you ask him real nice.\u201d With that, the warrior took off, leaving Kane alone with the girl. The stranger.</p><p>His lungs constricted, nearly blocking his airways.</p><p>A moment of silence passed as she shifted from one high-heeled foot to the other. \u201cYou\u2019re even more gorgeous than William promised.\u201d There was a bead of excitement in her tone.</p> <p>She was talking. Why was she talking? He didn\u2019t want to have a conversation with her. He would begin to wonder what kind of life she\u2019d led, what had brought her to this point, and he would feel sorry for her. He didn\u2019t want to feel sorry for her.</p><p>Disaster hummed with contentment.</p><p>Contentment? Why?</p><p>Just get this over with. \u201cCome here,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>The female obeyed, slipping into the spot beside him. Her scent hit him, and he wrinkled his nose in distaste. A cloying perfume, laced with the scent of cigarette smoke. Nothing like the Fae, who had smelled as though she\u2019d spent the day in the kitchen. Like a wife.</p><p>Maybe he shouldn\u2019t do this.</p> <p>A gust of wind burst through the room, lifting the bottle of whiskey off the ground and slamming it into the woman\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Kane cursed the day he\u2019d stolen Pandora\u2019s box.</p><p>She rubbed her chest, saying, \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have been an air vent.\u201d It was possible.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you kiss me better?\u201d She inched closer to him.</p><p>\u201cNo kissing.\u201d Harsh words. Even harsher tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat about sucking? I\u2019m really good at sucking.\u201d She leaned over to unfasten his pants, but Kane flipped her over. He pressed her stomach into the cushions of the couch, holding her down. He didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s lips on him.</p> <p>\u201cWe do this my way.\u201d Bile rose as he lifted the hem of her dress and tugged down her panties. Though he would have rather sawed off one of his limbs, he unbuttoned his pants, undid the zipper. The trembling of his hands magnified. Acid rose from his stomach and collected in his throat, scorching him. He paused.</p><p>What was the problem? He\u2019d done this before. When he\u2019d realized relationships weren\u2019t feasible, he\u2019d lived off one-night stands. At least for a little while. But none of them had ever broken him down like this....</p><p>\u201cAm I doing something wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he sheathed himself in a condom and...and...</p><p>Do it! Disaster commanded.</p><p>He took her.</p><p>He was rough, ragged, utterly without sensuality and carnal ambition. He had no focus, no desire to watch her reach climax. His mind despised this. And yet, his body liked it. But then, his body was a traitor. It had liked what the minions had done, too, and that\u2019s what haunted him most. That a part of him had enjoyed his own violation.</p><p>This had been a mistake.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want this woman, didn\u2019t know her, might not even like her if he did. She wasn\u2019t...her, the Fae his instincts craved so desperately.</p><p>Disaster cursed at the direction of his thoughts.</p><p>And as the female groaned to encourage him, images began to fill his head. Hands here...mouths there...minions everywhere...</p><p>Nearing panic, Kane somehow, some way, managed to finish. He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he\u2019d gotten her off, and at the moment, he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The demon\u2019s curses tapered into statements of approval.</p><p>Fighting a tide of self-disgust, Kane discarded the condom and fixed his clothing, then threw a few hundreds on the couch cushions beside her. He walked to the door, and motioned her out. First thing he saw was William taking a woman against the wall. The guard was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cBut...don\u2019t you want my number?\u201d asked the blonde. \u201cIn case the urge strikes again? I\u2019ll make myself available to you any day, any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, being blunt to be kind. He would never call her, and he didn\u2019t want her hoping for the impossible.</p><p>\u201cWas I not what you were looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You weren\u2019t. Now leave.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she straightened her dress and strode out of the room, the hall.</p><p>\u201cAll done?\u201d William called. He hadn\u2019t pulled from the woman, but he\u2019d stopped moving at least.</p><p>More, Disaster said.</p><p>As much as Kane hated the words brewing at the back of his tongue, he said, \u201cBring me another one.\u201d The sex hadn\u2019t done what he\u2019d wanted. The memories and all that came with them were still knocking at the door of his mind, ready to pounce. But Disaster was happy. So, Kane would take a second woman. And a third. However many proved necessary, until the demon was so saturated with satisfaction, he forgot what had happened.</p><p>Kane received an unapologetic and shameless thumbs-up before he shut the door, stalked to the bathroom and vomited. When he finished, he cleaned his mouth with the contents of another bottle of whiskey.</p><p>And not a second too soon.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door. William and a brunette strutted inside.</p><p>\u201cHow about this one?\u201d the warrior asked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kane said. \u201cShe\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Before the night was over, Kane took twelve women. He used different positions, and different types of females. Girls in their twenties, women in their forties, more blondes, more brunettes and even two redheads. He hated every second, even hated himself. He vomited every time.</p><p>Disaster loved it all, and yet he never stopped tossing out images of Kane\u2019s torture.</p><p>He hated the demon a thousand times more.</p><p>His time\u2019s coming...soon...</p><p>The mountains of Montana</p><p>KANE HACKED THROUGH the foliage in front of him. Branches continually slapped at him, courtesy of Disaster. The satisfaction the creature had experienced during the sexual marathon hadn\u2019t lasted long. Now, rocks rolled in his way, tripping him. Insects snapped at him.</p><p>He had to reach the Fae before the demon did any major damage...or Kane\u2019s mind finally snapped. Whichever came first.</p><p>His head was even more unfamiliar terrain, with dark valleys and impossibly high mountains he could never hope to climb. Or maybe he could. When he\u2019d left the club, he\u2019d realized the Fae had become a source of light to him. His only source of light. She had made him want to smile during the worst period of his life. For that alone, she was a miracle.</p><p>He could really use a miracle.</p><p>Perhaps she could do what the parade of women had not: wash away the worst of his memories. Bring peace, if only for a little while.</p><p>Perhaps. But perhaps not.</p><p>Either way, he had to know. Had to see her, talk to her. Save her.</p><p>Deep inside, where instinct still demanded she belonged to him, he suspected she was his only hope of survival.</p><p>So, he would find her.</p><p>Would she smell the stale cigarettes and old perfume he hadn\u2019t been able to wash from his skin? Would she demand he leave her alone?</p><p>Probably.</p><p>Would he obey?</p><p>No.</p><p>I\u2019m disgusting. Cruel. A user and a whore.</p><p>I didn\u2019t used to be this way, he wanted to shout.</p><p>What was the Fae\u2019s name? The fact that he didn\u2019t know was starting to irritate him. He would call her...Kewpie? No. Those big, gorgeous eyes fit, but nothing else. Tinker Bell, then. Yeah. Tinker Bell worked. She was such a delicate little thing, with her pointy ears and sharp little chin, and she flittered from here to there, always out of reach.</p><p>According to Torin\u2019s surveillance, she was staying in a cabin in these woods. About an hour ago, Kane had found the cabin but not the girl. However, he had discovered fresh tracks. Human. Female. Size six feet. She couldn\u2019t have much of a head start on him, and she couldn\u2019t be moving very fast. As deep as her prints were, she was carrying a heavy load. Plus, night had fallen.</p><p>The half-moon lacked its usual glow, allowing an almost suffocating darkness to reign. The air was cold, the breeze wafting from the snow-capped mountains and chasing away any hint of warmth. Trees knifed toward the blackened sky.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got your panties in such a twist?\u201d William asked from behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the pleasure train failed to work for you. You must not have done it right.\u201d</p><p>Kane ignored him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so important about this girl, anyway? I mean, really.\u201d</p><p>Again silence.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have a magic pu\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kane spun around and punched him in the jaw. \u201cEnough!\u201d Fury bubbled in his blood, molten, acidic\u2014poisonous. \u201cDon\u2019t go there. Don\u2019t ever go there. Not with her.\u201d</p><p>William rubbed the wound. \u201cSo why are we hunting her?\u201d he asked as if Kane hadn\u2019t just resorted to violence.</p><p>Could nothing shut the warrior up? Kane jolted back into motion. \u201cShe says I owe her.\u201d And it was true...if not the full truth.</p><p>\u201cAnd you always pay your debts? What kind of craziness is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people would say it\u2019s honorable.\u201d Maybe the only honor Kane had left.</p><p>\u201cSome people are stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s the number-one reason I\u2019ll never do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re stupid like everyone else? That\u2019s being a little harsh on yourself, don\u2019t you think? I mean, sure, if you ever entertained a bright idea I\u2019d have to say it was beginners\u2019 luck, but you have your moments.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can act like I\u2019m a calm, rational being. Kane stalked past a wall of green and entered a clearing. He stopped and breathed deeply. The air was clean here. Pure and untouched. Also kind of annoying. He wanted to catch a hint of rosemary, mint and maybe even smoke, indicating Tinker Bell was still here and warming herself in front of a fire.</p><p>He could swoop in and grab her. She would probably fight him, but he wasn\u2019t worried. She lacked skill. And strength. Was probably fatigued. But she\u2019s got heart, he thought, a now familiar ache lancing through his chest.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d William prompted.</p> <p>\u201cWe set up camp.\u201d Not because they\u2019d been on the move since leaving the club and needed to rest\u2014though they had and they did\u2014but because he could tell they were being followed and he didn\u2019t want to lead his shadow to Tinker Bell.</p><p>He doubted the Hunters were after him. Apparently, during Kane\u2019s forced stay in hell, a battle had been waged in the skies, Hunters against Lords, Titans against Sent Ones.</p><p>The Lords and Sent Ones had won, utterly destroying the Hunters and severely weakening the Titans.</p><p>Kane gathered stones, twigs and dried leaves to build a fire. He cared little about warmth. He wanted the one following him to see the smoke and assume he was relaxed, unprepared. Was the culprit immortal? If so, what race? And why was he after Kane?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter. He withdrew a dagger and sharpened it against one of the stones he\u2019d set aside. His reflection caught on the silver metal, and firelight illuminated the image. The red in his eyes had intensified.</p> <p>Disaster had grown stronger, Kane far weaker. Disgusted, he set the weapon away.</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019ve got a female Phoenix on our tail, right?\u201d William asked.</p><p>A Phoenix? He\u2019d never messed with the fire-happy race. \u201cI do. Of course I do.\u201d Now. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can smell her. How else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd slaughter her on our own turf,\u201d William said with a nod, black hair shagging around his supermodel face\u2014or whatever he insisted on calling that ugly mug. \u201cI like it. Simple, yet elegant.\u201d He eased onto the only rock in front of the fire he hadn\u2019t helped build, and dug through his backpack. He withdrew a pistachio nutrition bar he\u2019d stolen from Kane, tore off the wrapper\u2014and ate every bite, never offering Kane a taste.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>\u201cThat was good. You should have brought one.\u201d William brushed his hands together. He wore a T-shirt that read I\u2019m a Jenius, and that pretty much encapsulated the male\u2019s entire personality. Silly, unconcerned, irreverent. Misleading.</p><p>Kane dug through his own pack. He withdrew three daggers, two Sigs and the parts to his long-range rifle. What could a female Phoenix want with him? He knew the race lived for the enslavement of others. He knew they were nearing extinction, many having met their final end. Like cats with nine lives. He knew they were bloodthirsty and war-hungry...but they usually only picked battles they could win.</p><p>So confident. Disaster chuckled with evil glee. So wrong.</p><p>Kane ignored him. He\u2019d tried engaging the fiend, snapping retorts, issuing threats, but look where that had gotten him. Now, he wasn\u2019t going to waste his time or energy. And why should he? This was a full-on case of dead demon talking.</p><p>Suddenly sparks flew from the fire, shooting out white-hot streams in every direction. Grass sizzled, and black smoke billowed. Heat licked over Kane\u2019s pants, blistering his calves.</p> <p>William scrambled around, patting out the flames. \u201cYou\u2019re a menace. You know that, right? Everywhere we go, something terrible happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And the worst was yet to come. \u201cTo your knowledge, have the Moirai ever had a wrong prediction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d William said. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Hope bloomed. \u201cWhen?\u201d He fit the rifle\u2019s barrel on top of the frame, and the scope on top of that. He inserted the screws and gently tightened. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2014too many times to count. How\u2014free will. Our choices dictate our future, nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Intelligent words from a Jenius. Go figure. \u201cThey think I\u2019m destined to marry the keeper of Irresponsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do it. Hunt her down and marry her.\u201d</p><p>William made it sound so easy. Just snap his fingers, and boom. Done. Only one little problem. He had yet to meet the keeper of Irresponsibility.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sentencing a woman to an eternity with me.\u201d He attached the bipod and rested the entire weapon on a thick stump.</p><p>\u201cWhat about White?\u201d William grumbled. \u201cI happen to think you\u2019ll end up with her, whether I like it or not.\u201d</p><p>White was William\u2019s only daughter, and, if Kane had to take a guess, one of the reasons William had followed him out here. William wanted Kane to stay away from the girl.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t know is why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple. I was once told her husband would cause an apocalypse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the Moirai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the Moirai. I slept with Klotho. And both of her sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI so did not need to hear that. Dude, they\u2019re ancient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t at the time,\u201d William said with his classic wanton grin.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. What about your whole free-will over fate spiel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ll choose her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate her.\u201d He remembered how, in hell, she had stood over his bound and mutilated form. Silent. Uncaring. Then, she\u2019d left him to his suffering.</p><p>Actually, hate was too soft a word for what he felt for her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just avoid both women,\u201d he added, \u201cand save myself the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Avoid trouble? Ha!\u201d</p><p>He gnashed his molars. \u201cI can try. And what will you do if White and I do end up together, huh? You don\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t. You just slept your way through a baker\u2019s dozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your urging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point? I didn\u2019t hold a gun to your head.\u201d</p><p>In some ways, Disaster had.</p><p>\u201cIf you two hook up, I\u2019m moving back to hell. I don\u2019t want to clean up her mess,\u201d William said. \u201cAnd I know she\u2019ll make one. She won\u2019t be able to help herself. It\u2019s her nature.\u201d</p><p>William, the adopted brother of the underworld\u2019s king, Lucifer, had once lived in hell. Eventually, the hate, greed, envy and wickedness living in his soul had mated with the vengeance living in his heart. White, as well as her brothers, Red, Black and Green, had spewed from him.</p><p>He\u2019d heard demons call them the four horsemen of the apocalypse. But these four were not, not really; they were more like shadows of the originals.</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s exactly what they were. Shadow warriors.</p><p>They had been birthed in evil, and prophecy claimed they had futures to match. White was to conquer anyone she encountered, before somehow enslaving herself. Red was to bring war, Black famine, and Green death.</p><p>Little wonder Kane wanted nothing to do with White. He had enough problems, thanks.</p><p>And yes, he knew being conceived in evil had no bearing on the girl herself. He knew those in darkness could find their way to the light. He knew something beautiful could come out of something terrible. After all, diamonds were formed in the mantle of the earth, with horrendous heat and bone-crushing pressure.</p><p>He knew. But he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t White he longed to see. It wasn\u2019t White he yearned to scent.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t White his mind pictured and his treacherous body suddenly responded to, shimmering need flash-flooding him, riding on bolts of lightning. It was Tinker Bell. Sweet, sexy Tinker Bell, with her\u2014</p><p>Hands wandering...hot breath fanning over him...moans, groans...</p><p>Scowling, he tossed a handful of dirt into the fire. The flames sputtered and died. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. Like I said, I don\u2019t want to marry anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be lucky to win White!\u201d William huffed.</p><p>The words penetrated Kane\u2019s blooming rage and actually calmed him. One of his brows arched. \u201cNow you want me to make a play for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you should want me to want you to make a play for her. She\u2019s highly desirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want and I won\u2019t ever want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are your ovaries swollen?\u201d</p><p>A bead of amusement rose in his chest, surprising him. \u201cHow has no one ever killed you?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as William opened another stolen nutrition bar, stuffed half into his mouth and swallowed. \u201cLike anyone would want to see me dead. I\u2019m too pretty.\u201d</p><p>Pretty could only aid a person so long. \u201cHow many women have you been with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCountless. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so many I can\u2019t count them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you lack skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but at least I can control my desires. Your lust is too strong and your willpower too weak to allow you to resist anyone with a pulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019ve been with plenty of people without a pulse. More than that, I say no to Gilly every day.\u201d</p><p>Gilly, his best friend. A human girl Reyes, the keeper of Pain, had rescued. She was only seventeen years old, and for some reason, she\u2019d developed a crush on William. A crush that had deepened every time the warrior had come to visit the Lords, whom she lived with. She\u2019d doctored him every time he\u2019d gotten hurt in battle, and he\u2019d comforted her every time she\u2019d cried out from bad dreams, the horrors of an abusive stepfather rising to haunt her.</p><p>Now, she called the male every morning at 8:00 a.m. to make sure he was \u201call right.\u201d Translation: alone.</p><p>He always was.</p><p>William might take a new woman\u2014or ten\u2014whenever the mood stuck, but he never let the females stay the night with him. Not anymore. He didn\u2019t want to hurt his precious Little Gilly Gumdrop\u2019s feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane wasn\u2019t sure why William took such care with the girl, when he\u2019d never done anything sexual with her. At least, Kane didn\u2019t think he had.</p><p>He better not have.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, William threw the rest of the food into the ashes. \u201cJust remembered something. As I was packing, Danika showed up and asked me to give you the most important painting of your life.\u201d He dug through his pack and withdrew a small, wrapped canvas.</p> <p>Danika, Reyes\u2019s woman, possessed the ability to see into heaven and hell, past, present and future, and paint the images. Like the Moirai, her predictions had never been wrong\u2014that he could prove.</p><p>About ten yards away, a twig snapped.</p><p>The Phoenix had decided to close in, he realized.</p><p>Kane grabbed the canvas from William and stuffed it inside his own pack, then swung the whole thing over his back, using it as a shield, and lay flat on his belly. Closing one eye, he pressed the other against the night-vision scope on the rifle. In an instant, the world around him became painted with bright green.</p><p>The Phoenix was...there. She had climbed one of the taller trees and was currently walking across one of the thicker limbs...nope, she was hopping to another limb on another tree, coming closer and closer, clearly trying to sneak up on him.</p> <p>Mine, Disaster said with a possessive growl, and Kane frowned.</p><p>Another mine?</p><p>The female looked to be five foot nine and scantily dressed, considering the weather. She wore a bralike top and tiny shorts, and there were two daggers tied to her calves, two sheathed in her combat boots.</p><p>Kane tracked her for a moment, watched as she paused and reached for one of the hilts. Never bring a knife to a gun fight, sweetness. You\u2019ll lose every time. He squeezed the trigger.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He was a great shot and knew he\u2019d grazed her thigh before he even heard her shriek of pain. He leaped up and started running. By the time she hit the ground, gasping for breath, he was there, in her face. She was pretty. Blonde. Bold. Though he would have rather bathed in acid, he pressed his arm into her throat, making it even more difficult for her to take in any air, and patted her down to discard all of her weapons.</p> <p>There were more than he\u2019d realized. Eleven daggers. Two guns. Three throwing stars. Two vials of poison. A bag of pills. Detachable metal claws. And the makings of a bomb hidden in the soles of her shoes.</p><p>He tried not to be impressed.</p><p>Working quickly, he bound her wrists with a rope of chain he\u2019d been using as a belt and tied her to the base of the tree. The moment he finished, he jolted away from her, severing contact. Already his stomach was churning, sickness brewing. But at least he didn\u2019t experience the pain Tinker Bell caused.</p><p>A swarm of bees darted from the trees, circling Kane\u2019s head. Disaster laughed.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The girl kicked out her uninjured leg, swiped only at air. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s your name. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no plans to hurt you,\u201d she snarled, her struggles increasing. Heat radiated from her, such intense heat, and it was only getting stronger. Any moment now, she would catch fire with flames as hot as those in hell and melt the metal links. \u201cI only want to hurt Josephina. Now, I\u2019ll kill you and enslave the girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJosephina?\u201d A sting in his neck. He slapped at the wound, and a bee stung him on the wrist.</p><p>\u201cAs if you don\u2019t know the girl you\u2019re following. The Fae.\u201d</p><p>His rescuer\u2019s name was Josephina. Pretty. But he liked Tinker Bell better. \u201cYou want to enslave her, do you?\u201d Was that why the girl had a death wish? She feared what the Phoenix would do to her?</p><p>Buzz, buzz.</p><p>Sting. Sting.</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d Again she kicked out. Again she missed. \u201cI refuse to answer any more of your questions. Let me go or I\u2019ll make you regret it before I slay you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone mention a lay? For the right price, I\u2019m willing to make myself available.\u201d William strolled into the area, chewing another nutrition bar. \u201cAnd do you think she\u2019s talking about the Fae female who just raced through our camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Kane got in the warrior\u2019s face. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you let her go?\u201d he roared.</p><p>Buzz. Sting.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Our chase would have ended, and I\u2019m not ready to go home. She told me to tell you hi, though. Or maybe she said to tell you to do what you promised or leave her alone since you\u2019re drawing the wrong attention to her. It\u2019s so hard to tell when you\u2019re not really listening.\u201d</p><p>Battling an urge to slice the warrior to ribbons, and waste time, Kane gritted out, \u201cDon\u2019t let this one escape,\u201d and bolted into action.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>JOSEPHINA SPRINTED THROUGH the forest, twigs beating at her, leaves sticking to her. She pumped her arms and legs with all her might and began to pant, the night air burning her nose and throat. In one terrible swoop, all of her enemies had found her\u2014yet none of them wanted to kill her.</p><p>A Fae army was here, determined to escort her home.</p><p>The Phoenix was here, determined to enslave her.</p><p>Kane was here, determined to...finally do as he\u2019d promised? Or did he plan to hand her over to her family and collect a reward?</p><p>Probably the reward. Some of the Lords were wily like that.</p><p>What had she done wrong? How had she been spotted? She\u2019d been so careful, sneaking here, hiding there. Only twice had she spoken to a human, and only to ask the males to run her over with their cars.</p><p>Both men had looked at her as if she were insane.</p><p>Maybe she was.</p><p>All she knew was that death\u2014any death\u2014was preferable to life with her family. The pain and suffering that came with Synda\u2019s punishments was bad, but the agony of not knowing what the next punishment would be was far, far worse.</p><p>Her own father hated her, and rejected her at every turn. For centuries, she\u2019d just wanted someone to love her. To see value in her.</p><p>Of course, then there was Leopold. Her own half brother wanted her in his bed, and wouldn\u2019t stop pressing until he got her there.</p><p>Every day was a new stress. Josephina would wake up feeling as if she were standing on top of a mountain, screaming for help, but no one cared enough to listen. Tension never left her. And by the end of each day, her nerves were so frayed she feared she would have a nervous breakdown.</p><p>It was too much. She was tired, so very tired. She craved an end. Needed an end. Finally.</p><p>Sadly, she couldn\u2019t kill herself\u2014and how morbid was a thought like that? Other Fae could end their own lives, but not her. To purposely injure herself was to suffer with that injury, no matter how severe, for weeks, sometimes months. Eventually, she would heal. Even from a beheading. Yes, her body would grow back. Her father had made sure of it, using an ability she would love to steal, but couldn\u2019t. The guards protected him too diligently.</p><p>Something hard slammed into her back, tossing her down. She hit the dirt and twig-laden ground with a loud crash, her lungs momentarily deflating. As she struggled to breathe, she was flipped over. Panic overwhelmed her, heating and freezing her at the same time. Tiny black dots winked through her vision, yet she managed to make out the shape of a man looming over her.</p><p>\u201cJosephina,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>Kane. She recognized the low, gruff quality of his voice, and the panic receded. \u201cJerk! Just because you\u2019re a star doesn\u2019t mean you can act that way. A simple \u2018stop\u2019 would have sufficed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did say stop. You ignored me.\u201d The weight of him lifted from her, allowing her to pull herself into a sitting position. She drank in as much oxygen as possible, and her eyesight finally cleared.</p><p>The warrior crouched in front of her, slivers of moonlight dancing over him. His hair was disheveled, but that hardly mattered. The strands of flax glowed as if they\u2019d been sprinkled with stardust, reminding her of gorgeous ribbons of gold only the Opulens\u2014the Fae upper class\u2014could afford. The darker strands blended into the night. Red eyes watched her intently, angrily...with the barest glimpse of sizzle?</p><p>\u201cYour eyes,\u201d she said, unsure whether she shivered or shuddered. She recognized that bloodlike color, had seen it glowing from Synda\u2019s gaze too many times to count. But the princess had never caused her every pulse point to flutter wildly.</p><p>He looked away, as though shamed. \u201cThey\u2019re red. I know.\u201d</p><p>Poor Kane. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d What had caused the demon to become so strong?</p><p>Without thought, she reached out to brush her gloved fingers against the skin underneath. He caught the motion and stiffened, reminding her of his dislike of contact; his air of anger intensified. But he didn\u2019t flinch, as he\u2019d done with Sabin.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He gave a stiff nod.</p><p>Gulping, she continued reaching.</p><p>At contact, his pupils expanded, gobbling up every bit of color. Even the red. His breathing changed, from slow and even to deep and shallow. The very air around them seemed to charge with electrical impulses, little sparks dancing over every inch of her.</p><p>I...like him?</p><p>No. Surely not. She\u2019d had crushes before, but this was something else entirely. More intense. Almost overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d He grabbed her by the wrist, moving with lightning-fast reflexes, and she realized he was trembling. \u201cForget my eyes,\u201d he bit out, setting her hand away from him. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m near you, I hurt. Why?\u201d</p><p>Deep down, part of her mourned the separation with him. The other part of her wanted to cry over this brand-new rejection.</p><p>You\u2019re angry with him. This is silly.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? You\u2019re the first person ever to complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Now, how did you find me? How do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answers don\u2019t matter. I came to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me?\u201d Hope opened as sweetly as a rose in sunlight, bright and beautiful. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kane. Thank you!\u201d He planned to kill her, the darling man. No longer would fear be her constant companion. No longer would she have to endure her half sister\u2019s punishments. No longer would she have to avoid Leopold\u2019s advances. \u201cHow do you want to do it? A dagger? Your bare hands? Poison? My vote is quick and painless, but I\u2019ll be satisfied with whatever you choose. Really. You won\u2019t hear a single complaint out of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane flashed his perfect white teeth in a scowl. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you, Tinker Bell.\u201d</p><p>Wait. What? \u201cBut you just said you\u2019d help me.\u201d And had he really just called her freaking Tinker Bell? I\u2019m not a thumb-sized sprite, dang it!</p><p>\u201cI will. I\u2019ll take care of your problems. That way, you\u2019ll want to live.\u201d</p> <p>Every ounce of the hope withered. He had no idea what he was saying, or how impossible such a task would be.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked, ignoring his offer. Had he gone home to a girlfriend? The last story she\u2019d read about him had claimed he was single, but a year had passed since then. Or, in her case, a thousand and one years. Had he pampered this nameless, faceless female?</p><p>I\u2019m the one who saved him. I deserve to be pampered.</p><p>\u201cRespond to my promise,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhy do you want to help me, Kane?\u201d Beautiful Kane, with his rainbow of colors.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t not help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re min\u2014\u201d A muscle ticked below his eye. \u201cI owe you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d only get himself killed, and she didn\u2019t want that. \u201cWell, I release you from your debt. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m your new constant companion, Tinker Bell. It\u2019ll be better for both of us if you get used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>Kane...with her every second...</p> <p>A blessing and a curse, just like her strength-stealing ability. \u201cEither kill me, get me out of the forest, or get lost. Those are your three choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you out of the forest,\u201d he said, standing, circling her with all the predatory intent of a ravenous beast, \u201cand while I\u2019m doing it, you\u2019ll tell me how many people I need to kill to make you feel like your life is worth saving.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her middle lest she be tempted to reach out again. \u201cToo many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the problem is people.\u201d He stopped in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but did you hear me? There are too many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many is my specialty.\u201d Hesitant, he held out his hand to help her up.</p><p>More contact? Freely offered this time?</p><p>She licked her lips and stretched out her hand.</p> <p>He recoiled, as though startled, even though he\u2019d been the instigator, and his arm dropped to his side. He made a fist, a dark, frightening need springing to life in his eyes. But...a need for what?</p><p>Trembling, she labored to her feet under her own steam. Which, to be honest, wasn\u2019t much. Her adrenaline must have crashed. Her knees knocked together, struggling to hold her up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kane said, his voice low and quiet, yet somehow far more undisciplined than she knew him to be. \u201cI should have helped you.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, he hadn\u2019t gotten over his aversion to touch. Especially hers. \u201cYes, well, I\u2019m not going with you, and I don\u2019t want my problems murdered. An attempt would only create more problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your days of making your own decisions are over. I\u2019ve got problems of my own, and I can\u2019t see to them until I\u2019ve seen to yours.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare run, Tinker Bell. I\u2019m strong enough to chase, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll like the results.\u201d</p><p>Her stupid body tingled, a clear disagreement. Did he wield some strange ability she\u2019d never before encountered?</p><p>Stop thinking and move! She faked a pass to the right. He followed, and she darted to the left. Then, she ran at full steam.</p><p>He slammed into her, knocking her down. He wasn\u2019t even winded when he said, \u201cConsider this your final warning,\u201d his warm breath caressing the back of her neck.</p><p>Oh my.... His weight was as heavy as before, pressing her into the ground, but this time, because she knew the culprit, she didn\u2019t feel threatened. She felt...achy, her nerve endings sizzling with undeniable awareness.</p><p>\u201cLet me go. I\u2019ll hurt you if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stood, dragging her with him. He held on tightly, surprising her, his arms steel bands she couldn\u2019t break\u2014didn\u2019t want to break. But he was still shaking, as if touching her was somehow more painful to him than he\u2019d claimed her nearness was. It shouldn\u2019t be. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he replied, practically breaking her heart with the sudden thread of gentle kindness in his tone, \u201cthis is for your own good. I promise.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. He simply didn\u2019t understand. She tugged off one of her gloves. Her hands were her only weapons; he would hate her for what she was about to do to him, would never again come near her, but he\u2019d left her with no other option. \u201cLast chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d He hefted her over his shoulder and trudged forward, shouldering his way through tree limbs determined to slap him. \u201cI\u2019m saving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t save me.\u201d Fighting wave after wave of guilt, Josephina reached out and gripped his forearm. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what is it you think you\u2019re doing, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Leaving you helpless. Tears welled in her eyes. No other choice. She tightened her grip on him. Instantly, her pores became tiny vacuums, sucking the strength out of him and into her.</p><p>He stilled, gasping. \u201cWhat are you doing, Tinker Bell? Stop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Warmth flooded her; warmth and the fizz of energy...so much energy, lighting her up. No, not lighting, she realized a second later, but darkening. Then, utter blackness gobbled up the light, cloaking her, sending her tumbling straight into a spiraling pit of despair.</p><p>Kane set her on her feet.</p><p>A terrible scream cut its way through her throat. Her knees buckled, but he was no longer able to hold her up. She slammed into the ground, contact finally severed. What was happening? What was wrong with her? And the screams\u2014hers, and someone else\u2019s, someone sinister\u2014argh! Growing louder and louder.</p><p>And yet, through it all, a single whisper managed to claim her attention. I hate you. Hate you so much. Want to kill you. Will kill you. Soon, soon, so very soon.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand, she thought, panicked.</p><p>You deserve pain, and I\u2019ll make sure you get it if you go near him again. He\u2019s mine. Mine. I won\u2019t share him with you. Never you.</p><p>Nearing hysteria, she drew on every reservoir of strength she possessed, lumbered to her knees and crawled forward, away from Kane. Yes, she had to escape Kane. All of this had come from him. Belonged to him. The more distance, the better. Please.</p><p>Rocks sliced at her palms and knees, but she didn\u2019t care. In the distance, she heard the snap of breaking wood. The whoosh of air. Something hard slammed into her, knocking her feet out from under her and planting her face first in the dirt.</p><p>When the daze cleared, she realized the culprit wasn\u2019t Kane this time, but a tree.</p><p>She fought her way free, tears streaming down her cheeks, and continued her journey forward.</p><p>\u201cJosephina,\u201d Kane called. \u201cTinker Bell...what did...you do? To me?\u201d His voice was weak, rasping.</p><p>A spark of light dashed across her small line of vision, followed by another. Soon, colors formed, taking shape. Bushes, tree roots and trunks, piles of leaves, a coyote stalking past\u2014only to stop and bare its teeth, as if preparing to attack her. But another tree fell, slamming against her and scaring the animal away.</p><p>Hate you. Hate you, hate you, hate you.</p><p>Pain momentarily stunned her, her abused back threatening to shatter.</p><p>Before she could fight her way free, a pair of boots appeared in front of her. Boots she recognized.</p><p>Josephina swallowed a groan. No. No! Anyone but him.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d the owner of those boots said. \u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d</p><p>She recognized the voice, as well. Leopold, her half brother, had found her. He would ensure she returned home...back to her own personal hell.</p><p>KANE HEARD TINKER Bell screaming, and battled a rage unlike any other.</p><p>Mine, he thought. No one was allowed to hurt her, not even him, not even as angry as he was with her for what she\u2019d done to him.</p><p>What had she done to him?</p><p>He wanted to stand and help her, whatever was wrong with her. He did. Yet, his body was too weak.</p><p>He\u2019d vowed never to be weak again. Or, barring that, to kill the cause.</p><p>Tinker Bell was the cause, somehow, but he wouldn\u2019t be killing her. He would be...he wasn\u2019t sure, and didn\u2019t like that he couldn\u2019t decide.</p><p>One second he\u2019d been as normal as a man like him could be, carrying her over his shoulder. The next, he\u2019d felt warm silk pressed against his arm, and he\u2019d begun to weaken. He\u2019d set her down as his limbs began to tremble. Then, he\u2019d crumbled.</p><p>But then, so had she.</p><p>The darkness he\u2019d carried for so long had thinned, but instead of strength taking its place, he\u2019d experienced extreme fatigue.</p><p>He\u2019d watched, helpless, as Tinker Bell curled into herself. Her skin had gone pallid, and horror had consumed her features. She\u2019d looked...haunted. He\u2019d reached for her, but she\u2019d managed to crawl away. He hadn\u2019t managed to follow. Soon she\u2019d disappeared beyond the line of trees.</p><p>Must help her.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s safe to say this night isn\u2019t going according to plan.\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s voice hit him, and he struggled to sit up. \u201cThe girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaped. Burned me, too, the little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the Phoenix. The Fae. Go get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too hungry to run.\u201d</p><p>Rage gave him enough strength to hurl a rock at the warrior\u2019s fat, ugly head. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Footsteps echoed. \u201cBut you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d Swaying limbs, swishing leaves, then...nothing.</p><p>In and out Kane breathed. There was something else happening inside him, something stranger than the sudden weakness, and he needed to figure out what it was. And it should be easy. For the first time in centuries, his mind was silent. Thoughts were easy, without any kind of dark filter. Emotions were pure, without any kind of terrible guidance. He was\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alone, he realized.</p><p>Realization knocked him flat on his back. In that moment, there was no hint of the demon\u2019s presence. No sickness in the pit of his stomach. No icy fingers of dread crawling all over his skin. No terrible whispers in the back of his mind.</p><p>But...how could that be? Kane was alive. And if he was alive, the demon was with him. Right?</p> <p>Or, had the Greeks lied to him and his friends the first day of their possession, as he\u2019d hoped? Gideon had once survived several minutes without his demon. Of course, the creature had still been tethered to him, and had returned.</p><p>Kane thought back. He\u2019d never actually seen a possessed warrior killed simply because the demon had left his body. His friend Baden had died from a beheading. Cronus and Rhea, former king and queen of the Titans, had been demon possessed and had died from a beheading, too.</p><p>What if Disaster was gone? Permanently? But where could the demon have gone? With Tinker Bell?</p><p>Was Disaster the reason she\u2019d screamed?</p><p>Or had she somehow killed the creature?</p> <p>Had Kane finally experienced something good?</p><p>He rolled his shoulders, the muscles knotted and protesting as if he\u2019d never really used them. He and Tinker Bell were going to have a long talk. He would ask questions and she would supply answers. If she hesitated, he would spank her. Yes. That\u2019s what he\u2019d do to her, he decided.</p><p>Part of him wanted her to hesitate.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought to experience sexual desire again\u2014not true desire\u2014and yet, when he\u2019d tackled her, her softness beneath him, and he\u2019d had her scent in his nose, and her panting breaths in his ears, he\u2019d yearned to strip her, to see her, all of her, and take everything she had to give.</p><p>She might have let him. But just how would his body, and his mind, have reacted?</p><p>Now, the need for her was still there, a thorn in his side. He didn\u2019t like it, had to get rid of it.</p> <p>A frowning William returned\u2014without the girl.</p><p>Kane growled low in his throat. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no sign of her,\u201d the warrior said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get your panties in a twist, but, uh, there was evidence of a struggle.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>The Realm of Blood and Shadows</p><p>LONG AGO, CAMEO had been cursed to host the demon of Misery and oh, the creature\u2019s presence had never been more apparent than now. A deep sense of sorrow pressed heavily against her. Despair burned the center of her chest. Corrosive whispers drifted through her mind.</p><p>There\u2019s no hope...</p><p>Life will never get better.</p> <p>You\u2019ll never succeed at anything. Might as well give up now.</p><p>She hated the demon of Misery with every fiber of her being. He was the essence of evil, darkness without any hint of light, yet she couldn\u2019t survive without him. Problem was, she knew she couldn\u2019t survive with him, either.</p><p>But what could she do?</p><p>Nothing, that\u2019s what. Always nothing. Forever nothing.</p><p>And so, for the rest of her existence, tears would always burn at the backs of her eyes. If ever she laughed, she wouldn\u2019t remember it. Her friends claimed she had, upon occasion, smiled, but she couldn\u2019t recall a single instance\u2014and never would.</p><p>But. Yes, but. While she couldn\u2019t make her life better, she could make Kane\u2019s better. Surely. Hopefully.</p><p>A few days ago, she\u2019d visited him in his room. He\u2019d worn anguish like a second skin, though he\u2019d tried to mask it. He probably would have succeeded with anyone but Cameo. The misery of others delighted her demon.</p><p>For a moment, only a moment, she had felt better. Lighter. Finally free. Then, she had felt a thousand times worse as her own misery had merged with Kane\u2019s.</p><p>Kane hadn\u2019t seemed to notice. Distracted, he had played with the ends of her hair, the dark strands pretty against the bronze of his skin. \u201cSilver Eyes,\u201d he\u2019d said, using his favorite nickname for her. \u201cI missed you more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>Lovely words. True words. They always missed each other when they were parted. But then he\u2019d stood, not giving her a chance to reply, and padded to the bathroom, shutting himself inside. He hadn\u2019t looked back.</p><p>He always looked back when he walked away from her.</p><p>He always winked at her.</p><p>She always blew him a kiss. Sometimes, when she was mad at him, with bite. He always chuckled.</p><p>Then, he\u2019d left the fortress without saying goodbye to her. He always said goodbye.</p><p>They\u2019d fought together for centuries, and never once had they deviated from their traditions. Traditions that had started because, after they\u2019d first met, they had briefly dated. But his demon, Disaster, and her demon, Misery, had caused far too many problems and they\u2019d eventually broken up. He\u2019d become her best friend. Her confidant. Their traditions were all they had.</p><p>Since his return, something had changed.</p><p>He had changed.</p><p>She should have expected it. He\u2019d spent several weeks in hell, bound and chained and tortured. He hadn\u2019t spilled the details, and she hadn\u2019t needed them. She could guess\u2014and knew the worst of her imaginings wouldn\u2019t even come close to what he\u2019d suffered. She\u2019d wanted only to make him feel better, at least for a little while.</p><p>As if you can do anything to help anyone.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she blocked her mind to the demon\u2019s manipulations. I can help him, and I will.</p><p>Cameo stood in the center of a bedroom emptied of all furniture. The walls were made of crumbling stone, and peppered with cameras. Torin was fierce about security. The marble floor was cracked\u2014Kane had been here, and recently. The air was cool, but dry, and coated with dust.</p><p>She studied the four artifacts in front of her. Wars had been fought for them. People had killed to find them, to protect them, to steal them. She and her friends had done all of that and more to obtain them.</p><p>Somehow, some way, these seemingly useless things would lead the way to Pandora\u2019s box. To the Lords\u2019 freedom. And their ultimate doom.</p><p>The Cage of Compulsion was a rusted four-by-four cell. However, when trapped inside, a person was compelled to do whatever the owner commanded.</p><p>Then there was the Cloak of Invisibility. A simple piece of fabric. However, when a person draped the material over their shoulders, no one could see them.</p><p>Then there was the Paring Rod, a long, thin spear with a glittering crystal rounding out the top end. When touched, it could steal a spirit from a body, leaving only an empty shell.</p><p>Finally, there was a painting from the All-Seeing Eye, given to Cameo only this morning.</p><p>Danika, the Eye, could sometimes see into the skies and sometimes the abyss. Sometimes the past. Sometimes, as a gift from the Most High, the future. In this painting, Danika had obviously seen into a man\u2019s office\u2014in the present? At the far right wall, there were treasures locked inside a glass case, and one of those treasures was a small box made of bones.</p><p>Could it be Pandora\u2019s box? A container hidden for centuries. A dangerous weapon supposedly constructed from the bones of the female incarnation of oppression. When opened, the box would suck the demons from Cameo and the other Lords, trapping the evil inside.</p><p>Ending their lives.</p><p>Cameo had sensed Kane\u2019s hatred for Disaster. She had sensed his desire to rid himself of the creature\u2019s influence, in any way necessary\u2014she had sensed, because it was a mirror of her own yearnings. If he couldn\u2019t find a way, he might decide to hunt down the box and use it.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let him die.</p><p>So, she would just have to eliminate this method of deliverance. She nodded. Yes. That\u2019s how she would help him.</p><p>But...how was she supposed to put each of the artifacts to use at the same time? Because that was the key to finding the box. Should she climb into the cage while wearing the Cloak and holding the painting and the Rod?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019cha doing?\u201d</p><p>The voice came from beside her. Cameo cut off a groan as she turned to face Viola, the keeper of Narcissism and the newest bane of her existence. Seriously. Dealing with a pack of rabid wolves on a steady diet of dark-haired, silver-eyed females would have been way easier.</p><p>Curling blond hair cascaded over Viola\u2019s dainty shoulder, and eyes the color of cinnamon twinkled. She wore a skimpy, skintight dress with enough ruffles and bows to put Christmas morning to shame, and she held her pet Tasmanian devil in her arms. Princess Fluffy...something was his name.</p><p>Yes. The princess was a he.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m spending time alone,\u201d Cameo finally replied. Hint, hint.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hate being the bearer of bad news almost as much as I love it, but spending time alone isn\u2019t a good look for you. Your face is all scrunchy. It\u2019s quite frightening. You should try to be more like me and look good no matter who you\u2019re with. Or not with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019m so smart it should be criminal.\u201d</p><p>Gotta find that box. Cameo wouldn\u2019t destroy it right away. She would run a test, just one, and shove Viola near it. Then, she would find out exactly what happened when a demon-possessed immortal approached it. Maybe Viola would survive. Fingers crossed she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>As if he sensed the direction of her thoughts, Princess Fluffywhatever lunged out and sank his fangs into Cameo\u2019s wrist, a quick in-and-out job that left her bleeding. Viola continued chatting about nothing, unconcerned.</p><p>Cameo bent down, doing as Super Nanny had taught her, and as she\u2019d often had to do with the men in her life, looking the little cretin in the eye. \u201cIf you do that again, I\u2019m going to have he-princess for breakfast. I doubt you\u2019ll taste very good, you\u2019re too bitter, but that\u2019s what mustard is for.\u201d</p><p>The devil-dog yelped, jumped from his mistress\u2019s arms, and raced out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019s wrong with him,\u201d Viola said.</p><p>Talk about having a megawatt attention filter. If something didn\u2019t revolve around Viola, the female never noticed.</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize any of these artifacts?\u201d Cameo asked her. Might as well make use of her while she was here.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I can recognize anything. I\u2019m quite gifted.\u201d</p><p>Gotta find it real soon. \u201cTell me what you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Viola puffed up, saying, \u201cWell, the pieces are quite old.

How dire. \u201cIf you fail to use each artifact properly, you\u2019ll find yourself trapped. Forever.\u201d Then she traced her finger over the Cloak, grimaced, and returned to her old, annoying self. \u201cIt\u2019s not very soft, is it? I prefer soft. My skin is very delicate. And perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I use each artifact properly?\u201d Cameo insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? How should I know? I\u2019ve never used them. And besides, while I know everything, I sometimes like to be appreciated for more than my magnificent brain.\u201d As she spoke, she bent down to peer into the crystal at the end of the Rod. \u201cOh, a pretty,\u201d she breathed, appearing entranced by her own reflection.</p> <p>She reached out. Made contact.</p><p>One second she stood beside Cameo, the next she was gone.</p><p>Silence filled the room.</p><p>\u201cViola,\u201d Cameo said, spinning, but there was no sign of the girl.</p><p>Heartbeat picking up speed, Cameo focused on the camera in the far right corner. \u201cDid you see that? Did what I think just happened really happen?\u201d</p> <p>There was a crackle of static before Torin\u2019s voice flowed from strategically placed speakers. \u201cYeah. The moment she made contact with the Rod, she was adiosed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m going to do a search for info and see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>No. She wasn\u2019t content to do nothing. Besides, he\u2019d been searching for info since they\u2019d gotten the thing, and hadn\u2019t found anything.</p><p>Moving swiftly, Cameo unfolded the Cloak.</p><p>\u201cHey! What are you doing?\u201d Torin demanded. \u201cStop that right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake me.\u201d He was the keeper of Disease. One touch of his skin against another\u2019s and a plague would start. The poor guy spent most of his time alone in his bedroom, watching the world from a distance.</p><p>In a moment of weakness, they had begun a hands-off relationship, but just like with Kane, the sparks had quickly fizzled and they\u2019d realized they were better off as friends.</p><p>\u201cCameo. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He was concerned for her. She knew that. She also knew he liked to think before acting. To plan. To test. Most of the warriors living in the fortress were like that. Not Cameo. The longer she waited to do something, the more useless she became, the demon\u2019s misery filling her, consuming her.</p><p>More than that, Viola could be in pain. Cameo didn\u2019t like the girl, but she wasn\u2019t going to let her suffer\u2014no matter what she\u2019d planned to do to her. She had to try to extract her.</p><p>Cameo reached out with a shaky hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare do what she did,\u201d Torin shouted over the speakers.</p><p>She paused. Maybe there was another way. Maybe\u2014</p> <p>\u201cMaddox!\u201d Torin\u2019s voice boomed. \u201cYou\u2019re needed in the artifact room. Now! Reyes, you, too. Anyone. Cameo\u2019s about to make a huge and possibly fatal mistake.\u201d</p><p>No time to reason things out.</p><p>Trembling, Cameo set the painting in the cage, grabbed the Cloak, and entered. She shut the door, and the lock automatically engaged. The moment she heard the soft click, she felt as though a heavy ring of metal had wrapped around her neck, wrists and ankles. But when she looked, she saw only the tan of her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m commanding you to stop, Cameo,\u201d Torin said.</p><p>The Cage clearly didn\u2019t consider him its owner, because she felt no compulsion to obey him.</p><p>She wrapped the Cloak around her shoulders and reached through the bars, intending to latch onto the Rod. Just before contact, her gaze locked on the painting. She froze. In an instant, insignificant details were wiped away. She saw the box, and in the shadows behind it, a man. He was of average height, with a thin build.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t make out his features, could only see the red glow of his eyes. Who was he? What was he? Would he be friend or foe? Was he guarding Pandora\u2019s box? Trying to prevent her from destroying it?</p><p>With so little muscle mass, he\u2019d never stand a chance.</p><p>Find Viola. Find him.</p><p>Footsteps echoed inside the room. Hinges on the door creaked.</p><p>Maddox stormed inside, violent anger radiating from him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the Rod before he could finish his sentence, just in case, and felt the coldness of the crystal against her skin.</p><p>And then she knew nothing more.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>S\u00e9duire</p><p>CURRENTLY, JOSEPHINA WAS the ketchup in a beefcake sandwich. Two palace guards held her in a viselike grip, preventing her from running away. They were beautiful men, tall and strong\u2014though not as tall and strong as Kane\u2014with looks typical of the Fae. Each had white hair, blue eyes, pale skin and red lips. They wore fitted violet overcoats, and had several medals pinned along their shoulders. Their pants were white, without a speck of dirt, and practically painted on. Black boots stretched to their knees.</p><p>Oh, yes. They were beautiful men, but they were the proud owners of cold, dead hearts. They knew what would happen to her, but wouldn\u2019t let her go. They held her all the tighter.</p><p>So close to freedom, she thought, fighting a wave of despair. And yet here I am.</p><p>At least the hatred and evil she\u2019d borrowed from Kane had left her and returned to him.</p><p>The royal dais loomed in front of her. King Tiberius sat upon a lavish throne carved from a single block of the purest gold, his hand curled around the center of a bejeweled scepter. On his right was a smaller throne, and perched there was the elegant Queen Penelope. On his left was yet another throne, this one for the flawless Princess Synda.</p><p>Behind the trio was a higher tier. Higher, yet still it seemed the area was nothing more than an afterthought. There sat Prince Leopold. Even as much as he claimed to want her, he\u2019d wasted no time escorting Josephina to the guards and abandoning her to their \u201ccare.\u201d</p><p>The Opulens stood behind her. Dressed in their finest, they had gathered here to watch her newest chastisement. The women wore elaborate gowns with fitted bodices and wide, flaring skirts. Bold makeup decorated their faces, the colors dusted with diamond powder. Their hair was partially hidden by large, bejeweled headdresses that fanned out to form half-moons. Metal necklaces circled their throats and dripped beads down their shoulders and cleavage.</p><p>The men wore velvet jackets in every color imaginable, metal pieces sewn into the shoulders, elbows and hem. Their trousers were looser than what the guards wore, but still managed to mold to hard-won strength.</p><p>In S\u00e9duire, beauty mattered more than brains and clothing mattered more than food. Political intrigues were always in full swing. An open mouth was a lying mouth. Power was just as valuable as cash. Lust, greed and torture were always on the menu.</p><p>Josephina hated it here.</p><p>Every Fae wielded some type of extraordinary ability\u2014though she actually wielded two\u2014but some were better than others. The king was doubly gifted, like Josephina, able to bequeath abilities to others, as well as form a protective shield around his body. The queen had the power to touch an object and know its complete history. Leopold could cause pain in others with a single spoken word.</p><p>Any ability Synda possessed had been buried when she\u2019d obtained the demon. Josephina had heard stories, though, and thought her half sister had once been able to turn any inanimate object into gold.</p><p>The king looked Josephina over with those eyes of crystal blue. Oh, how she despised the color. She much preferred Kane\u2019s eyes, jade and amber\u2014and she had to stop thinking about him, didn\u2019t she? Their association was over. She wouldn\u2019t be seeing him again. He wouldn\u2019t want to see her. Not after what she\u2019d done to him.</p><p>Regret clawed at her. Already she mourned the loss of him. The strong, beautiful warrior who\u2019d come to save her.</p><p>A small cry parted her lips.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say for yourself, Servant Josephina?\u201d King Tiberius demanded. \u201cYou caused us all kinds of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should be on your knees right now,\u201d Queen Penelope said, flicking an invisible piece of lint from the skirt of her dress. \u201cBegging for our forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the burn of rejection accompanying those words, Josephina kept her gaze on her father. Though he was hundreds of years old, he looked almost as young as she was. He had silver-white hair, unblemished skin, and enough muscle to snap the bones of any man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry with you, girl. You didn\u2019t return on your own. You had to be hunted, wasting time, energy and resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being chased by demons.\u201d It was the truth.</p><p>He flicked his tongue over an incisor. \u201cExcuses aren\u2019t to be tolerated.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, and wisely kept her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I am feeling benevolent, and will not punish you. This time. But if you ever again try to deprive my precious daughter of her blood rights, whatever the reason, I\u2019ll be forced to hobble you for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m your precious daughter, too, her heart cried. The only difference was, the queen wasn\u2019t her mother.</p><p>Murmurs of excitement erupted behind her. The people wanted to see her hobbled.</p><p>The queen petted the ribbon of fur hanging from the collar of her gown. \u201cWe sent guards to await you at the exit to hell. Did you kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The demons must have done it, because there was no one waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Demons,\u201d said Princess Synda.</p><p>Josephina met her sister\u2019s gaze.</p><p>The girl blinked. All innocence. Zero remorse.</p><p>A quintessential Fae, Synda had her white curls twined with a wide, arching headdress of crystal spears. Her luminous eyes were framed by sharp sweeps of sapphire shadow, and currently without any hint of the red the demon caused when it acted up. Her cheeks were brushed with the dust of rubies, and her lips with the flakes of diamonds.</p><p>She displayed moments of utter sweetness, like now, followed by looong stretches of utter nastiness. She obeyed no rules, not even her own, and always acted without thought or concern for anything or anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Josephina was younger by several hundred years, and at the time of her birth, Synda already contained the demon. The stories she\u2019d heard about the princess\u2019s past, about what the female had been like before the possession, had shocked her. Apparently, there had been no one more kind, concerned and happy.</p><p>How much had Disaster changed Kane?</p><p>You\u2019re thinking about him again.</p> <p>Tiberius slammed the scepter into the floor, a loud boom shaking the entire room. \u201cYou will concentrate on the proceedings, Servant Josephina, or I\u2019ll have to make an example out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she likes it when you punish her,\u201d the queen said with an evil grin. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why she tempts you to give her more.\u201d</p><p>Josephina shuddered. \u201cJust...let me go. Please.\u201d</p><p>The king leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees. \u201cHave I not been good to you? Have I not given you a home? A worthy purpose?\u201d</p><p>The queen smirked.</p> <p>Synda selected a pastry from the tray beside her.</p><p>Leopold shook his head in regret.</p><p>I won\u2019t cry. Not again.</p><p>Tiberius sighed. \u201cTake her to the dungeon. I can see the desire to run in your eyes, girl. You will be locked away until you\u2019ve realized how well I\u2019ve treated you\u2014and how much worse it can be for you.\u201d</p><p>The Opulens cheered.</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, but closed it with a snap. Speaking after judgment had been handed down would only earn her further chastisement.</p> <p>As she was dragged away, she heard another guard say to the king, \u201cTwo immortal warriors were following Servant Josephina. We left them in the forest, but placed a tracker on their equipment. What would you have us do with them?\u201d</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t hear the king\u2019s answer, Josephina mewled with dismay.</p><p>THE WHOOSH OF a whip sounded, followed by screams of pain. Josephina flinched as every blow landed on the man on the other side of the crumbling stone wall.</p><p>Her poor arms were chained over her head, her fingers ice-cold from pitiable circulation. Once again she was sandwiched between two men. Only, these two weren\u2019t guards. They were prisoners, like her, and they\u2019d made the grievous mistake of owning land the king wanted for himself.</p><p>They, too, had their arms chained over their heads, but they were either unconscious or dead. They had been deprived of food for so long, their bodies were emaciated. And they had gone unwashed for years. Oh, the stench...</p><p>Footsteps pounded, and the dungeon master stalked around the corner. Prince Leopold smiled at her, genuine affection gleaming in his crystalline eyes. Like Princess Synda, he had curling white hair. Unlike Synda, he was tall, taller than their father, and leanly toned. Eligible Opulens were always drooling and panting for him.</p><p>He stopped in front of Josephina and pinched a lock of her hair between his blood-splattered fingers. \u201cDid you miss me, little flower?\u201d he asked, warm breath fanning over her face.</p><p>\u201cNot even a bit,\u201d she replied truthfully. \u201cIf you want the brutal truth of the matter, it was my hope we\u2019d never see each other again.\u201d</p> <p>A muscle ticked in his jaw, a testament of his anger. First point, Servant Josephina. \u201cGive yourself to me, and the king will no longer use you as Synda\u2019s substitute.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d rather die\u2014obviously. \u201cEven if that were true, which it\u2019s not, my answer would be the same\u2014never. Does that work for you?\u201d</p><p>His lashes fused together, leaving only tiny slits. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me? I\u2019m desirable.\u201d</p><p>Where to begin? Oh, yeah. \u201cYou\u2019re my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly by blood.\u201d</p><p>Was that all? \u201cWell, you disgust me. How about that?\u201d</p><p>He leaned in. \u201cI would be good to you. Very, very good.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, gritting out, \u201cStop. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>Josephina turned her head away. Her body ached in the worst way. Her mind was foggy from hunger. She couldn\u2019t deal with him right now.</p><p>He took her chin in a firm grip and returned her attention to him. \u201cI could force you. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d wanted her that way, he would have taken her years ago.</p><p>She remembered the first day they\u2019d come into contact outside the throne room. She\u2019d been walking through the royal garden, plucking the prettiest of the flowers for her mother. Back then, her mother had been the king\u2019s favored concubine and Josephina had been free to do as she pleased\u2014when she wasn\u2019t being punished for Synda\u2019s crimes, of course.</p><p>Yes, the king had used her that way even then, despite her mother\u2019s protests.</p><p>Leopold had just achieved his immortality, never to physically age again, and he had been celebrating in the garden with two female slaves. Josephina had stumbled upon the group, seen them doing things that still made her blush; he\u2019d heard her startled gasp and looked up. She\u2019d backed away, afraid he would tell his mother she was a spy, and the queen would have her whipped. Again.</p><p>But Leopold had smiled, commanded Josephina to stay where she was, then righted his clothing and sent the females on their way. He\u2019d gently teased her about her blush, picked up the flowers she\u2019d dropped and gallantly presented them to her, as if she were an Eligible and worthy of his attention.</p><p>For the next few years, he\u2019d met with her often, purposely, talking with her, laughing with her, and for the first time in her life, Josephina had felt a kinship with someone other than her mother.</p><p>But the day Josephina had achieved her own immortality, though so much more fragile than those of full blood, the focus of Leopold\u2019s attention had changed. He\u2019d gone from brotherly to amorous, charming to persistent, and had even tried to kiss her. At the time, she\u2019d run away from him.</p><p>He\u2019d been chasing her ever since.</p><p>Things had never been the same between them, and never would.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said, confident.</p><p>The prisoner across from her snickered over her continued rejection.</p><p>Leopold\u2019s cheeks reddened the slightest degree. He released her and stomped over to the offender. Rather than rain his fists in a fury of punishment, he tilted his head to the side and said, \u201cAgony.\u201d</p><p>The man screamed in sudden anguish, his entire body shaking. Blood soon leaked from his eyes, his nose, and the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Josephina cried. \u201cStop it, Leopold! Please.\u201d</p><p>He did. When the man was dead.</p><p>Bile burned her chest, and collected in her throat.</p><p>Leopold spun to eye every male in chains. \u201cAnyone else have anything to say?\u201d</p><p>Only the rattle of chains could be heard.</p><p>The scowling prince locked gazes with Josephina, spit on the ground at her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before Princess Synda commits another crime. You\u2019ll be whipped in her place. Or worse. Let me protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you could save me, I\u2019d never consider you the better choice,\u201d she replied raggedly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. I leave to capture the men hunting you. One of the imperial guards will be in charge of your care. I doubt he\u2019ll be as gentle.\u201d With that, he stalked from the dungeon.</p><p>A bitter laugh escaped her. Kane had wondered why she wanted to die. Kane had wanted to know what he could do to help her. Well, here was why. And clearly, there was nothing he could do. Just as she\u2019d known.</p><p>There was nothing anyone could do.</p><p>But I can help him, she thought. She could use the second ability she possessed and warn Kane about the tracker the guards had placed in his equipment. That way, when they found him, he wouldn\u2019t be caught unaware. He could fight. And he could win. Or run.</p><p>It was the least she could do, and had nothing to do with the fact that she wanted to see him again. Really.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Texas</p><p>The Teaze</p><p>ROCK MUSIC POUNDED through the nightclub, shaking the floor, rattling the walls. Strobe lights flashed all the colors of the rainbow and spun, creating a dizzying kaleidoscope that somehow lowered inhibitions. Immortal men and women flailed on the dance floor, walked the aisles in search of fresh prey, or sat at the tables, flirting in between throwing back shots of the beauty maker.</p><p>The world might be ugly before you drank a glass of ambrosia-laced whiskey, but it sure was beautiful afterwards. At least for a little while.</p><p>Kane wanted to leave, memories of the last time he\u2019d been inside a nightclub playing through his mind, sickening him, but he\u2019d texted Torin for information about Tinker Bell, and for some reason, the warrior had sent him here.</p><p>As usual, William was off trolling for women.</p><p>Kane pushed a vampire out of the chair he wanted, and claimed a place at the bar. The guy didn\u2019t protest, just took one look at him and rushed away. Kane ordered a shot of the beauty maker. Anything to dull his riotous emotions.</p><p>Where was Tinker Bell?</p><p>Was she okay? Safe?</p><p>She no longer had custody of Disaster\u2014if that\u2019s what had happened, and he suspected it was. There was no other explanation. The demon had come roaring back to Kane a few hours after he\u2019d left the forest. He\u2019d been disappointed for himself, but relieved for her. He didn\u2019t like the thought of such a delicate half immortal going against such evil.</p><p>But at least he had an answer to one of his questions now. The Greeks had indeed lied. The demon wasn\u2019t as much a part of him as his lungs and his heart. Kane couldn\u2019t survive a single moment without the organs, but he could survive a few hours without Disaster. Maybe more.</p><p>Hate you, Disaster growled.</p><p>Assure you, the feeling\u2019s mutual.</p><p>One of the legs on his chair snapped, and he nearly hit the floor. He brutally kicked the broken stool out of the way, and decided to stand.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you got here,\u201d a female said.</p><p>His gaze snapped to the left, where a tall, lithe blonde stood. She was exquisite, with long hair that tumbled to a perfectly curved waist and snow-white skin covered in makeup to mute its luminous power. Blue eyes held his stare without wavering or fear.</p><p>She\u2019s mine, Disaster shouted. All mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane ground his molars together. Just how many \u201cmines\u201d were they supposed to have?</p><p>\u201cTaliyah Skyhawk,\u201d he acknowledged. She was Sabin and Strider\u2019s sister-in-law, as well as a Harpy known for her cold-as-ice demeanor. \u201cYou knew I was coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorin gave me a heads-up.\u201d</p> <p>His focus sharpened on her. Well, okay, then. \u201cYou got info for me?\u201d</p><p>She motioned to the bartender, and waited, silent, for a bottle of vodka to be slid in front of her, as if Kane weren\u2019t suddenly vibrating with impatience. \u201cThis belongs to him,\u201d she said, hitching her thumb in his direction.</p><p>Knowing Harpies couldn\u2019t eat or drink anything without stealing or earning it, he threw a few bills on the counter without complaint. \u201cAnytime would be great, Tal.\u201d</p><p>She drank straight from the bottle, wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and faced him, her expression impassive. \u201cThere\u2019s a Phoenix chasing your Fae. Her name\u2019s Petra, and she\u2019s a vicious little troll.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly a news flash. \u201cSo, how did you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou remember when my friend Neeka the Unwanted was given to the Phoenix, even though she\u2019s a Harpy, to save my sister? Well, little Neeka keeps getting stolen from different clans\u2014everyone wants a piece of her, which is so wonderfully ironic, considering her name. She gets bored between travels and spies for me. I knew the stuff about Petra would be important to you because my sisters told me about your encounter with the Fae.\u201d</p><p>Sabin and Strider were such pansy blabbermouths.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Taliyah continued. \u201cThe rest of the information is going to cost you.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, saying, \u201cHow much?\u201d Whatever the price, he\u2019d pay it.</p><p>\u201cI want the fortress in the Realm of Blood and Shadows.\u201d</p><p>A thirty-thousand-square-foot monstrosity for a few words? A fair exchange, in his opinion. He wasn\u2019t sure his friends would agree. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. The place isn\u2019t mine to give.\u201d</p> <p>Taliyah drained the rest of the bottle with a grace matched by few. \u201cToo bad. It would have been nice doing business with you, Kane. See you.\u201d She walked away from him without another word.</p><p>Coldhearted. As always.</p><p>Kane leaped into action, dragging her back to the bar\u2014and she let him. She had more at stake than she wanted him to believe, then. \u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d he said to her. \u201cThe fortress is yours. When do you want it?\u201d</p><p>Winter-blue eyes sparkled triumphantly. \u201cThree months and two days from now. No sooner, no later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll kick my friends out myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven my sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, thinking that was what she\u2019d want to hear. \u201cThey can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal\u2019s off. Sorry.\u201d Once again she walked away, and once again he had to drag her back.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d he rushed out. \u201cI\u2019ll kick them out, too.\u201d They\u2019d want to stay with their husbands, anyway.</p><p>She nodded, satisfied.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you stay there with everyone else?\u201d he grumbled. She had before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell anyone I\u2019m there. You do, and I\u2019ll hunt you down. Immortal races will be talking about the things I did to your entrails for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Harpies, man. They actually had the strength and stomach to back up their threats, and that was a serious downer when the women weren\u2019t on your side. \u201cWhat do you need the fortress for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. Now, do you want the information I\u2019ve got or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, apparently, a Sent One\u2014Thane, I think his name is\u2014suddenly appeared in one of the Phoenix camps a few weeks ago. He threw a big fit, and killed lots of the warriors. One of them was the king. The Sent One was eventually subdued, and a new king took the throne. This new king was finally able to claim the woman he\u2019s been craving for centuries\u2014the dead king\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there. The new king took the widow as his concubine, but only a few days later, this Petra girl killed her. As punishment, she was cast into the Never-ending. And now that Petra\u2019s on the loose, the new king wants her back. Like, bad. The things he\u2019ll do to her when he finds her...it\u2019s going to be legend\u2014wait for it\u2014dary. Oh, and the concubine was Petra\u2019s sister. Meaning, there\u2019s no line this troll won\u2019t cross. If your Fae is on her radar, she\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>He would get to her first.</p><p>The glass shattered in his hand, cutting his skin.</p><p>Stupid demon.</p><p>He dabbed at the wounds with a napkin.</p><p>He waited, but Taliyah said nothing more. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if Neeka is that poor of a spy. I was just waiting for you to digest. So get this. Petra was seen buying a key to S\u00e9duire.\u201d</p><p>S\u00e9duire. The kingdom of the Fae, though many humans lived there, located in a realm between realms. Some immortals could flash there, moving from one space to another with only a thought. Most could not. Kane was among the could-nots, so, for people like him, a special key was needed to open one of the invisible doorways.</p><p>\u201cIf this Petra is following Tinker Bell\u2019s scent, and she bought a key, Tinker Bell must have returned to S\u00e9duire,\u201d Kane said, thinking out loud. Finally, he had a location.</p><p>\u201cTinker Bell?\u201d</p><p>Disaster growled.</p><p>William scooted into the seat beside him, saving him from having to answer. The warrior was without his usual random woman (or six) and scowling. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Ice Witch, and how did you find us? We\u2019re on a boys-only vacay.\u201d</p><p>Taliyah rolled her eyes. \u201cI just answered those questions for Kane and won\u2019t do it again for the likes of you. And what a way to say hello, Man Whore.\u201d</p><p>So. The two hated each other now. Interesting.</p><p>William looked at him, and Kane could see the excitement banked in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to let her talk to me like that? I should pack my bags and leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be so lucky.\u201d Kane signaled for another whiskey. The glass shattered as he downed the liquid inside it, and he choked on a shard. Coughing blood, he stood. \u201cI\u2019ve got to find a key. Don\u2019t call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>What are you doing? Disaster demanded. Don\u2019t leave the Harpy. She\u2019s mine. I want her.</p><p>Taliyah reached out and grabbed his wrist. He...felt no pain, he realized, and no desire, either. Apparently no one\u2019s touch affected him like Tinker Bell\u2019s. \u201cRemember what I told you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. He remembered. No one could know she wanted the fortress.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d William demanded. \u201cYou might as well confess. I\u2019ll just bug the answer out of him if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kane rolled his eyes, knowing he\u2019d be dodging William\u2019s annoying prods for weeks, but walked away before the Harpy could respond and never looked back.</p><p>THE MOMENT HE was outside, Kane whipped out his cell phone. Yesterday, he\u2019d taken a snapshot of Danika\u2019s painting and saved the image as wallpaper.</p><p>In it, he was on his knees, tears streaming down his face, hands lifted toward the heavens. A blonde female lay in front of him, a hole the size of his fist burned into her chest. Her face was turned away from him, so he had no idea who she was\u2014and wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know.</p><p>The painting was a problem that would have to wait.</p><p>He called every black market contact he had, looking to buy a key to S\u00e9duire. He would also need a guide, since he had no idea where to find a doorway. But one call after another proved unfruitful. No one was able to help him.</p><p>A sense of urgency drove him, and he paced toward the darkened alleys about a mile from the club. There, immortals would be peddling their wares. Drugs. Sex. Anything and everything. Even if he couldn\u2019t find a key, he could find someone who knew someone else with the contacts to help him.</p><p>A thick white fog suddenly rolled in, and he paused. Through the density, he could just make out the shape of a...woman? Oh, yes, definitely a woman. She glided toward him, and he could see she was wearing a glowing white dress. Long, dark hair fell over one delicate shoulder, reminding him of...</p><p>\u201cTinker Bell?\u201d he asked, shocked to his core.</p><p>Disaster banged against his skull.</p><p>Kane raced to her, tried to grab her despite the pain it might cause him, the unwanted desire, and whatever she\u2019d done to him in the forest, but his hands ghosted through her.</p><p>Her eyes were as white as the fog and as luminous as the most expensive diamonds. \u201cWould you please stop calling me that?\u201d she said, exasperated. As freaky as she looked, the normalcy of her voice surprised him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you...dead?\u201d Even uttering the question made him want to kill someone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead. I\u2019m simply projecting my image into your mind.\u201d</p><p>Relief was like a gentle rain, dousing the budding rage\u2014and the overwhelming sorrow he didn\u2019t want to explore. \u201cExactly how many abilities do you possess, woman? And what exactly did you do to me in that forest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time for that. I\u2019m weakening, and must hurry.\u201d</p><p>Weakening? In a snap, the rage returned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Listen, Lord Kane. I know I\u2019m not your favorite person right now, and you probably don\u2019t trust me, but please believe me when I say you\u2019re in grave danger.\u201d</p><p>Him. Not her. Better. \u201cMore danger than usual? And don\u2019t call me Lord Kane. I don\u2019t need a title.\u201d Not from her. \u201cI\u2019m just a man.\u201d Your man.</p><p>The thought hit him with the force of a tsunami, and he fisted his hands. His body was suddenly rock-hard, ready to prove the claim, to strip her and take her as he\u2019d longed to do in the forest. A temptation he found as exhilarating as it was frightening.</p><p>Can\u2019t touch her.</p><p>But if he could...</p><p>What would she do? How would she react? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How would he?</p><p>Would her skin be as soft as it appeared? Would her curves create the perfect cradle for him?</p><p>A few feet away, the lid to a trash bin flew open. As the wind picked up, debris propelled toward Kane, most assuredly courtesy of Disaster.</p> <p>Tinker Bell stomped her foot. \u201cI can\u2019t concentrate when you look at me like that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I don\u2019t know how to describe it. It\u2019s like you want to strangle me or something.\u201d</p><p>Or just wanted to get his hands on her. But he got what she was saying, knew his desire was tangled with darkness.</p><p>He nodded, ashamed of himself. \u201cI\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p> <p>She licked her lips, and said, \u201cMy people know you\u2019re looking for me, and now they\u2019re hunting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Fae family or your human one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s who you\u2019re with right now?\u201d he asked, wanting to verify the information Taliyah had given him.</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve heard about the race, but the Fae can be brutal, bloodthirsty and without a shred of compassion. They\u2019ll haul you before the king and he\u2019ll sentence you to death just for looking at me. No matter how star-struck he is by you!\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what the star-struck comment meant, and wasn\u2019t going to waste time finding out. \u201cWhy would he want to kill me?\u201d The only viable answer slammed into him, and the patent stillness of a predator came over him. \u201cAre you his lover?\u201d</p> <p>She gave another stomp of her foot. \u201cWould you be serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d The words were nothing more than a hiss.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not his lover! What a disgusting prospect!\u201d</p><p>He relaxed\u2014and he had no desire to ponder why he\u2019d reacted so fervently to the thought of her with another man when he wouldn\u2019t be taking her for himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been hunted by brutal, bloodthirsty people before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but the Fae are gifted with special abilities. Like, say, causing you pain with only a word.\u201d</p><p>Like the pain she caused him? But then, she\u2019d never needed to speak for him to feel it. \u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my brother can,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can project your image, as well as rip the demons out of people.\u201d</p> <p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cSo that\u2019s what happened. I took your demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>She hooked several tendrils of hair behind her ear, the action feminine and sweet and somehow more erotic than a striptease from another woman, and if he didn\u2019t get his thoughts and his body under control right now, he would self-destruct.</p><p>\u201cI take abilities and strength for a few hours, maybe a few days or weeks,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not...that. Never anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. You did. You must take weaknesses, too.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what the demon was. \u201cDon\u2019t do it again,\u201d he stated flatly. Already her life was so miserable she wanted to die. How much worse would it be for her with Disaster hanging around? And what if she got stuck with the creature forever, rather than temporarily? Was that possible?</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t want her to risk it. This girl, she was...he didn\u2019t know what she was to him. He only knew he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her suffering.</p><p>Her nose went into the air, making her look sullen and defiant and utterly adorable. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas about rescuing me. I\u2019ll do what I want, when I want.\u201d</p><p>Want me.</p><p>The ground cracked beneath his feet. He didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cCan you control the ability?\u201d The words croaked from him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted softly. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten to test my limits with people I didn\u2019t want to borrow from.\u201d Her gaze lowered to his lips, and she shifted from one foot to the other.</p><p>She\u2019s not thinking about kissing me. She can\u2019t be thinking about kissing me. \u201cYou need skin-to-skin contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you with that, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes brightened, the clouds rolling out to reveal endless oceans backed by glorious sunlight. The brightness didn\u2019t last long, however. She glowered, and the clouds returned. \u201cYou can\u2019t help me, Kane, not without putting yourself in danger. So will you listen to me and either prepare for battle or run for your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo to both. Why would the king of the Fae want to kill me for looking at you?\u201d</p><p>She was desperate to argue; he could see it in those narrowed eyes. But she must have realized he was stubborn enough to wait all night for the answers, and just messed up enough to get physical with her the next time they were truly together.</p><p>No telling what would happen then.</p><p>\u201cHe feels he must dispose of anyone who threatens to take me away from the kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he plan to have me brought into the kingdom or have me executed on sight wherever I\u2019m found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kingdom. He likes to watch.\u201d</p><p>Good. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re glad?\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll do the work for me.\u201d</p><p>She sputtered for a moment before finally deciding on a verbal path. \u201cWhat work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding you. I will, you know.\u201d A promise.</p><p>One that came with razor-sharp desire.</p><p>The crack in the ground widened, dropping Kane several feet.</p><p>\u201cI just told you not to\u2014argh! Kane, don\u2019t be foolish! Please.\u201d</p><p>The sound of pounding footsteps caught his attention. On alert, he palmed a dagger and looked around, but all he saw was more fog and trash. Then, three...no, five...no, eight bodies broke through, stopping a few feet away from him.</p><p>\u201cI found him,\u201d a hard male voice called.</p><p>If anyone could see Tinker Bell, they gave no indication.</p><p>\u201cBut...this is Lord Kane, a warrior of the Underworld,\u201d someone else gasped.</p><p>Murmurs of awe arose. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m standing in the presence of Lord Kane.\u201d</p><p>Questions were thrown at him.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell us about the battle that took place in the skies? Our men weren\u2019t able to attend, so details are sparse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really chop off a Hunter\u2019s foot and stuff it in his mouth, just because he called Cameo an abomination?\u201d</p><p>Tinker Bell paled, backed away. \u201cOh, Kane. They found you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She vanished.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>BRUTAL? KANE THOUGHT. Bloodthirsty? Hardly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the need for this, Lord Kane, but I must bind you, as ordered.\u201d The soldier appeared grief-stricken by the thought. \u201cI\u2019ll be slain if I refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, and don\u2019t even think about being gentle about it,\u201d snapped the tallest of the bunch. \u201cAnd you,\u201d he said to Kane. \u201cWhere\u2019s the other man? The one traveling with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance I killed him.\u201d</p><p>The guards nodded their agreement, as if they knew him and expected nothing less. All but the one who\u2019d asked the question. He had to be the leader. Nothing else would explain the great waves of entitlement bouncing off him. I\u2019ll call him Evil Overlord.</p><p>\u201cThe shackles!\u201d Evil Overlord proclaimed, and the soldier raced to obey.</p><p>Kane hated being bound, would rather die than endure it again. And yet he allowed the Fae to cuff his hands behind his back without protest.</p><p>Hands...all over him...</p><p>Mouths...biting at him...</p><p>Nails...scraping at him...</p><p>As the memories took center stage, he felt as if thousands of tiny needles were being injected into his skin. A loud ring erupted in his ears, and his heart kicked into a dangerously fast rhythm. His lungs constricted, the tissues burning.</p><p>Breathe. Nice and slow. In. Out. Good. That was good. And this was necessary. He had to get to Tinker Bell, and this was the fastest way.</p><p>Evil Overlord stepped to the side and waved a hand through the air.</p><p>That was it, a wave, and yet a doorway from one realm to another appeared. At the edges of the opening was the red brick of the club, the trash bin and cardboard boxes. Through the narrow opening, Kane saw a darkened landscape with multiple torches lining a cobbled pathway. That pathway led to a wide, towering palace comprised of gold-veined marble and bright, sparkly diamonds.</p><p>The soldiers formed a circle around Kane and urged him to march forward. One second he was in the city of cowboys, the next the land of the Fae. The night was crisp and damp, the torches giving off little heat. The scent of a thousand floral perfumes saturated the air, and he gagged. Sweat beaded over his skin. More fireflies than he\u2019d ever seen in one place twirled and danced through the sky, creating what appeared to be a shower of glowing raindrops.</p><p>Playing his part, he snapped, \u201cWhere am I? Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence, Lord Kane.\u201d Evil Overlord wasn\u2019t as tall as Kane, nor was he as muscled. None of them were. \u201cWhat were your plans toward Servant Josephina?\u201d</p><p>Servant? For some reason, that irritated him. \u201cWould you like me to be silent or give you the answer? I\u2019m happy to give both a try, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll like the results.\u201d</p><p>The male scowled at him.</p><p>Disaster growled inside his mind. Leave this place.</p><p>Screw you.</p><p>Hate the girl, Josephina. Want to kill her.</p><p>You touch her, and I\u2019ll...</p><p>What? One of his daggers fell from his boot, and the demon laughed. You want to stay here? Fine. But you\u2019ll do it without your weapons. Even as the creature spoke, another dagger fell away.</p><p>\u201cYou guys seem to know a lot about me, considering we\u2019ve never met,\u201d Kane said, ignoring the demon. His hands were weapons enough.</p><p>Evil Overlord smirked. \u201cWe do. You\u2019re Kane, a Lord of the Underworld. Disaster. Supposedly undefeatable. Wicked. The worst of the worst enemy to ever have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I touched him,\u201d said the guy behind him, his tone overjoyed. \u201cMy wife won\u2019t be able to get enough of me tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen your wife is a fool. This man is nothing. A no one. Look at how easily we were able to subdue him.\u201d</p><p>Evil Overlord thought he had Kane beat, and that\u2019s what Kane had wanted, but hearing that sneer really irked him. How many times had he been left behind during the war with the Hunters because his friends couldn\u2019t risk the damage Disaster would cause? Countless.</p><p>Kane had always felt like the weak link\u2014had always been the weak link\u2014and he was tired of it.</p> <p>He jumped up, swinging his feet through the circle his arms provided, placing his arms in front of him. The moment he landed, he elbowed the leader in the face, breaking the guy\u2019s nose. He threw the weight of his skull into the Fae next to him, knocking the warrior to the side. He kicked out a leg and nailed the male on his other side. As the soldiers stumbled for purchase, he reached out and grabbed the hair of the male in front of him, jerking backward.</p><p>The male hit the ground and Kane stomped on his face to get to the guy in front of the line, wrapping his bound hands around the guy\u2019s neck and choking. Everything had happened so quickly, no one had realized what was going on\u2014until then. The others sprang into action, leaping at Kane, but he kicked out one leg and then the other, sending two warriors rearing backward. He spun the guy in the chokehold, knocking his body into the others and sending them flying backward.</p><p>\u201cPain,\u201d he heard.</p><p>Just like that, the sharpest of pains tore through him. From the top of his head to the soles of his feet. His knees buckled, and he hit the ground with a heavy thud.</p><p>Tinker Bell\u2019s brother? he wondered, remembering what she\u2019d said.</p> <p>\u201cThat all you got?\u201d he gritted.</p><p>That earned him a meet-and-greet with the hilt of Evil Overlord\u2019s dagger.</p><p>Two soldiers grabbed him by the armpits and dragged him forward.</p><p>\u201cLord Kane beat me up,\u201d one said with a grin. There was blood on his teeth. \u201cDid you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest. Night. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Evil Overlord\u2014definitely Tinker Bell\u2019s brother\u2014glared at Kane through eyes a slightly darker shade of blue than his sister\u2019s. \u201cThe king will order your death, despite who you are, and I\u2019ll take great pleasure in delivering it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow why would your king want to kill me, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you dared lust after the princess\u2019s blood slave.\u201d</p><p>Tinker Bell was a blood slave on top of being a servant? What exactly did that mean?</p><p>Kane was hauled up a wide set of ivory steps, the railing shaped like a winged dragon. At the top, the guards passed through open double doors of dark wood and twisted iron. And then, Kane was inside the palace. The spacious foyer had a floor of mosaic tiles and was surrounded by life-size statues. Velvet-lined walls were covered by paintings of elaborately dressed Fae.</p><p>There was another staircase, and past it, a long, narrow hallway. Chamber after chamber whizzed by. The guards entered the last\u2014what had to be the throne room.</p><p>Other guards milled about, interspersed with young girls and older gentlemen. Every person present had white hair and blue eyes, and every one of those eyes landed on Kane. Jaws dropped. Both men and women gasped with a sound he hadn\u2019t heard since his weeks in hell. Rapture.</p><p>A few of the braver ladies approached him. Arms reached out. Fingers brushed against him.</p><p>Hands, roaming. Tongues, licking. Teeth, biting.</p> <p>His stomach lurched, and he barely bit back a grunt of distress.</p><p>Mine, the demon said.</p><p>Die.</p><p>Yet another blade fell from his body.</p><p>He snapped his teeth in warning at the women, and they twittered with excitement.</p><p>\u201cLord Kane almost bit me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s even more handsome than the scribes claimed.\u201d</p><p>Scribes?</p><p>Evil Overlord shoved past anyone foolish enough to get in his way and motioned for his comrades to do the same. They tugged Kane along for the ride, stopping in front of the crowd.</p><p>Kane studied the area, taking everything in. There were veins of gold running through the walls, the doors, and on the windows were fabrics that appeared to be woven from rose petals. The ceiling arched in the center, and vines teeming with golden flowers grew from the edges.</p><p>Below, there was a tiered dais covered in purple ivy, with the smallest throne situated on the highest level, and the three larger thrones centered on the next one down.</p><p>Evil Overlord abandoned his men to pound to the top of that dais. He turned with a graceful flourish and eased into the smallest throne, and it took a moment for Kane to compute the reason why the guy would be allowed to sit there.</p><p>He was the prince.</p><p>So...he couldn\u2019t be Tinker Bell\u2019s brother. Could he?</p><p>Dude. This doesn\u2019t change my feelings for you. Kane flipped him off.</p><p>The male displayed a smug smile. He thought he had Kane by the short hairs.</p><p>He was wrong.</p><p>Kane dismissed him, catching sight of a male and two females sweeping into the room from a side door. They eased into the remaining thrones, and it didn\u2019t take a Jenius to know the king, queen and princess had just arrived.</p><p>The king was a brute of a man, and surprisingly young. The queen was small and delicate, but appeared to be a few years older than her husband. The princess had the quintessential Fae hair, all-white, with no hint of color, and those endless eyes of blue. Her small, fragile body was squeezed into a bold red gown. The bodice dipped low enough to reveal the tattoo between her breasts, a\u2014he sucked in a breath.</p><p>A butterfly. A match to his.</p><p>She was...you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. How?</p><p>She was possessed by one of Pandora\u2019s demons. But which one? And how had she come to acquire it?</p><p>He had a very bad feeling.</p><p>Before his possession, Kane had been a soldier in King Zeus\u2019s army, and he\u2019d locked many of the inmates of Tartarus away; he\u2019d butted heads with the rest. There was no way the princess had been inside the prison when the demons of Pandora\u2019s box had been unleashed, and the leftovers distributed among the inmates. So, how had she come to be possessed? And which demon afflicted her?</p><p>The same door the royal family had used was opened again, and this time a dark-haired girl was escorted inside. Part of Kane wanted to continue staring at the princess, trying to unravel the mystery of her, but the scent of rosemary and mint wafted to him and his body reacted as if he\u2019d just been stripped and caressed.</p><p>Only one female had that scent\u2014and that effect.</p><p>He returned his attention to the newcomer with laser focus. She was dirty, bruised and worn down\u2014and his heart almost stopped. She was Tinker Bell.</p><p>The urge to go to her consumed him, and he stepped forward. A guard caught him, stopping him from going any farther. He could have broken free of the hold, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>She was here. She was alive. Fighting now, before he\u2019d gathered all the necessary information, could get her hurt far more severely.</p><p>He took in the rest of her. Her hair was tangled around her arms, all the way to her waist. Grime streaked her reddened cheeks. An apron hung around her neck, and it was in the same shape as her gown. She kept her eyes downcast, fear radiating from her.</p><p>Someone would pay for this.</p><p>He had to lock his knees to prevent another surge forward. Had to grip his pants to stop himself from throwing punches.</p><p>When the males released her, she tumbled to the ground, unable to sustain her own weight, slight though it was. Her knees hit the floor, and as she whimpered in pain, she braced herself with her hands, causing the fabric of her gown to rise, revealing her wrists. Angry red welts marred her skin. She\u2019d been chained.</p><p>Tinker Bell. Chained.</p><p>Someone would pay severely.</p><p>Forget information. He stepped toward the dais, going for the king. This time, he was whacked in the back of the head.</p><p>He heard a muttered, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lord Kane.\u201d</p><p>Growling, he spun and slammed his joined hands into the culprit\u2019s jaw. Bone snapped\u2014and not Kane\u2019s.</p><p>A yowl of agony split the air.</p><p>The rest of the regiment spurred into action. Bring it. He had enough violence pooling in his veins to take down a pack of rabid animals.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d a voice thundered.</p><p>Everyone stilled and quieted.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s gaze landed on the speaker. The king. Anger contorted features that promised to unleash death and destruction.</p><p>Whatever. Kane would get his information, after all.</p><p>The guard on his left bowed low. \u201cMy liege, this is Kane, a Lord of the Underworld, and the host to Disaster. He was the one chasing Servant Josephina.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, wild murmurings arose. Tinker Bell\u2019s gaze shot up, and landed on him. Her eyes widened, and she shook her head, mouthing, \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. I\u2019m here, honey, and I\u2019m not going anywhere without you. Get used to it.</p><p>Excitement danced in the king\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow we\u2019ve longed to meet you, Lord Kane.\u201d To the guard, he said, \u201cRelease our honored guest. Now.\u201d</p><p>The bonds were instantly cut away. Kane rubbed his wrists.</p><p>\u201cI must ask what you want with Servant Josephina, Lord Kane,\u201d the king continued more warily. \u201cShe is a...special charge of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I wish to buy her.\u201d If she was a slave, she was for sale, special or not. And if he had to go that route to get her out of here and started on her new life, well, he\u2019d consider it a blessing.</p><p>\u201cWe will give you anything you desire\u2014except her,\u201d the king said. \u201cI would never sell my own daughter.\u201d</p><p>The queen hmphed with disdain. \u201cOnly a fool would want such an ugly, wretched female.\u201d</p><p>Kane scowled at her.</p><p>Disaster was quick with an agreement.</p><p>Wait. Back up. Tinker Bell was the king\u2019s daughter? A princess? But why was she dressed like, treated like\u2014</p><p>Blood. Slave. The words rolled through his mind, and more pieces of the puzzle finally slid into place, little tidbits of information he\u2019d picked up over the centuries drawing together. Tinker Bell was of royal blood, but only partway. Therefore, she qualified to bear the punishment meted out to those in her family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anytime the \u201creal\u201d princess had committed a crime, Josephina had been the one punished for it. She would have endured whippings, beatings, stonings and probably a thousand other things he couldn\u2019t bring himself to consider. That\u2019s why she\u2019d ended up in hell.</p><p>Oh, Tinker Bell. Poor, sweet Tinker Bell. The very things he\u2019d endured during the worst weeks of his life, she had endured for a lifetime. No wonder she wanted to die.</p><p>Kane\u2019s jaw clenched, the only reason he was able to silence the spew of curses brewing at the back of his throat. No, the king would never let her go. Not for any price. Not for any reason.</p> <p>I won\u2019t let her go for any price or any reason, either.</p><p>Oh, really? asked Disaster.</p><p>The Fae next to Kane tripped, falling into him, knocking him to the side. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d the man babbled.</p><p>Kane straightened.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful. More so than I ever imagined. And he\u2019s just like me!\u201d The princess clapped her hands, exclaiming, \u201cI want him, Daddy. Please? Please! Give him to me.\u201d</p> <p>The king stiffened, only to relax a moment later. He eyed Kane with intrigue, the cogs in his brain clearly churning in a direction Kane wouldn\u2019t like. \u201cI do find the thought of our family being joined to that of Lord Kane\u2019s intriguing.\u201d</p><p>No. He didn\u2019t like it. In any other situation, the threat would have enraged him. A rampage would have ensued.</p><p>\u201cYou will do us the great honor of wedding our daughter, Princess Synda,\u201d the king said, a statement rather than a question.</p><p>He liked that even less.</p><p>But okay. All right. Kane needed to stay in this realm long enough to plan an escape for Tinker Bell. If he agreed to a wedding, he might be allowed free run of the palace. If he didn\u2019t, he would have to fight the army every second of his stay.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cFine. Whatever. I\u2019ll wed your daughter.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wedding anyone. \u201cBut Tink\u2014Josephina can\u2019t be harmed while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>More murmurs slithered through the room. He tried to make sense of the words, couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The king drummed his fingers against the shaft of his scepter. \u201cWe would love nothing more than to accommodate your request, Lord Kane, but a crime was committed last night, and a price must be paid. That\u2019s why Servant Josephina is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess Synda was caught with the butcher\u2019s son, a male far below her station. Worse, a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen punish Princess Synda.\u201d Problem? Meet solution.</p><p>A shake of the king\u2019s head, firm and sure. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we do things around here, Lord Kane. Since the spawning of our race, blood slaves have helped ensure the well-being of the royal family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The blood slaves had also helped ensure the maliciousness of the royal family. \u201cAnd what\u2019s to be Josephina\u2019s punishment for Synda\u2019s crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cServant Josephina will be shunned for one month. Anyone who speaks to her will be killed.\u201d</p> <p>Better than he could have hoped. Still, Kane squared his shoulders and braced his legs apart, preparing for battle. \u201cWell, then, we\u2019ve got our first real problem. I\u2019m going to talk to her, and that\u2019s non-negotiable.\u201d</p><p>Crystal eyes narrowed. \u201cVery well,\u201d the king said after a few moments of thought, \u201cbut you will be lashed for every word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d someone in the crowd gasped out.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not Lord Kane!\u201d another cried.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tinker Bell croaked.</p><p>Kane cut her a sharp glance. Silence.</p><p>She shook her head, dark hair wisping over her shoulders, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Still looking out for him, even after he\u2019d failed her so miserably. His determination intensified. To the king, he said, \u201cI will never willingly submit to such a punishment.\u201d It would weaken him, and he needed every bit of strength he could summon. \u201cI doubt you can force me\u2014\u201d except for Evil Overload, and his ability, but then, Kane could remove his tongue and that problem would be settled, too \u201c\u2014and the men that try will pay a very dear price.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, a female fainted.</p><p>The princess flattened her hand over her heart and grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s so wonderfully fierce. How soon can the wedding be planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent question. We\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s done by the end of the month. That gives us ten days.\u201d The king slammed his scepter into the marble floor so forcefully cracks formed in both. \u201cNow. Everyone will return to their duties. And you,\u201d he snarled at Kane. \u201cYou will join me in my chambers.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>JOSEPHINA SCRUBBED A rag back and forth over the already-clean upper staircase banister, surprised she hadn\u2019t dimmed...whatever the material was. It looked like starlight and clouds. A chandelier hovered just above her, the rotating streams of opals, sapphires and emeralds attached to nothing but air, casting rainbow flecks in every direction, even the floor many stories below.</p><p>I wish I could jump.</p><p>Stupid Kane. He should have killed her when he\u2019d had the chance. Now, she was going to make him wish he had. Yes. She liked that plan.</p><p>How dare he agree to wed Princess Synda?</p><p>Synda would lie to him, and cheat on him. The girl\u2019s desire always burned white-hot, but died quickly. She would chew Kane up and spit him out, and there would be nothing left of him but bones. Bones Josephina had risked her life to save.</p><p>How could he want that girl? How could he not see beyond her pretty face?</p><p>Stupid, stupid, stupid man! Josephina stomped her foot. Anger was easier than hurt over yet another rejection.</p><p>The moment he\u2019d agreed to the wedding, something inside her had cracked. Dark emotions had spilled out. She\u2019d nearly broken down and sobbed. She\u2019d nearly shouted, \u201cHe\u2019s mine! All mine!\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t hers, and he never would be.</p><p>She, however, might become his.</p><p>Would Tiberius give her to Kane, thinking the warrior would punish her rather than his beautiful new wife when she misbehaved? Would Kane actually punish her? If he did...her nails scraped against the rag.</p><p>I won\u2019t just make him wish I\u2019d died. I\u2019ll make him wish he had.</p><p>Her chin trembled, and she sniffled.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you, Tinker Bell,\u201d a masculine voice announced.</p><p>Jolting out of her wrathful thoughts, Josephina realized Kane stood just beside her. There were two guards behind him, careful to look away from her, shunning her properly, all while keeping watch over their charge and listening unabashedly.</p><p>Kane had just spoken eight words to her. Meaning, he\u2019d just bought himself eight lashes of the whip. Josephina wanted him to suffer, but not that way.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she said, wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand, just in case.</p><p>\u201cGive us some privacy,\u201d he said to the guards.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, Lord Kane.\u201d The pair raced to the other side of the hallway.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re not allowed to talk to me,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to waste a few words telling you I do what I want, when I want? Because I will. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-two lashes. All for nothing! \u201cShut up, you stupid man.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched at the corners, the bout of amusement confusing her. She\u2019d just insulted him, yet he was battling a laugh? I\u2019ll never understand him.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are back to normal, at least,\u201d she said.</p><p>He patted the skin underneath. \u201cThey are?\u201d</p><p>Thirty-four. She nodded, hoping her silence would encourage his own.</p><p>That hazel gaze raked the length of her body, burning her everywhere it touched. Whatever he saw must have angered him, because he ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cThe blood slave thing is the reason you want to die, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She gave up trying to count his words, and simply replied. It was his back, his agonizing pain; if he wasn\u2019t going to help himself, she wasn\u2019t going to try and do it for him. \u201cYeah. So? Why do you care?\u201d You\u2019re an engaged man!</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>And yet, in the past few hours, he\u2019d managed to hurt her worse than all of her whippings combined. \u201cJust leave me alone, all right? You\u2019re not the rock star I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I disappointed you, but everything I\u2019ve done since finding you in the forest, I\u2019ve done for you.\u201d</p><p>Pretty words, nothing more. He\u2019d seen Synda and wanted her, just like every other man, and it had had nothing to do with Josephina.</p><p>They stared at each other, quiet. He towered over her, as intense and savage as a man could be, and she felt small in comparison...surrounded by his utter maleness. Trapped.</p><p>But what a beautiful cage.</p><p>Her limbs began to tremble. Her breathing quickened, and she noticed he smelled of the forest he\u2019d found her in. Pine and dewdrops, clean and untainted by the cloying fragrances the Opulens preferred. There was no longer any hint of the roses she\u2019d scented in the motel room.</p><p>While on the run, she\u2019d done a little research. Apparently, when an immortal closed in on death, he began to smell like roses.</p><p>How close had Kane come?</p><p>And why did she long to reach out, to flatten her palms on his chest, to feel his warmth and his strength, to assure herself he was here and he was real and oh, sweet mercy, her blood was heating, and her lips tingling, as if preparing for his seduction. He wasn\u2019t her friend or her boyfriend or even a suitor.</p><p>Tensing, he crossed his arms over his chest, clearly expecting her to...what?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want from me, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d he replied darkly, anger firing up his eyes. Frustration tightened the skin underneath, and determination pulled at his lips. He stepped forward, and she stepped back, until the banister stopped any further retreat. \u201cDo you know what you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYour absence.\u201d Before I crack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I think you want something...I think you want me. The way you look at me sometimes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve talked about that look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between not wanting a man, and not wanting to want a man. Which is it for you, Tinker Bell?\u201d</p><p>She gulped. There was no way she would answer that.</p><p>Kane placed a hand at her left and a hand at her right, holding her captive. Tremors nearly rocked her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel...you make me feel,\u201d he said quietly, fiercely, \u201cand I don\u2019t like it. I want it to stop. Now.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time in their acquaintance, he frightened her. There was an intensity to him she\u2019d never noticed before, a vibe of uncontrolled danger. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>His gaze locked with hers, snaring her, drawing her in even while pushing her away. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d A thousand caresses in the dark waited in the softness of his voice.</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d</p><p>A second passed. Another and another. Neither of them moved. They didn\u2019t speak. Just stared. Somehow, those suspended seconds were more intimate than anything else she\u2019d ever experienced. More...electrically charged.</p><p>She flattened her hands on his rock-solid chest, marveled at the strength he contained. \u201cS-stay back.\u201d His heartbeat was a wild tumult, just like hers. It was a shock. A revelation.</p><p>A pleasure.</p> <p>He stumbled away from her, breaking the connection, destroying the electrical charge.</p><p>It was what she\u2019d wanted. But she hated being without it, she realized.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you and the king discuss?\u201d she asked, trying not to care\u2014but caring anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou mean your father?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders lifted in the most casual shrug she could manage. \u201cI am what he says I am.\u201d</p><p>Kane reached out, as if to caress her cheek. His hand fisted just before contact, and fell away. \u201cWe drank some whiskey, smoked some cigars and discussed a few details for an engagement ball to be held in my honor. We played some chess. I won. He pouted.\u201d</p><p>A ball. A ball Josephina would have to labor over. She would be forced to set up, then serve the guests food and drinks. The women would put their noses in the air and ignore her, and the men would forget their distaste for her, pat her on the bottom and maybe even try to pull her into shadowed corners. She would have to paste a grin on her face, and pretend all was well in her very dark world.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kane would be pampering the already pampered Princess Synda. The unfairness of it clogged her throat, making breathing difficult.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be alive,\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cTiberius is the worst loser of all time.\u201d</p><p>He waved her words away. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your sister.\u201d</p><p>Already he was obsessed. Jealousy hit her. Jealousy, and so much hurt she wasn\u2019t sure how she was still standing. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s possessed, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Her husband was the keeper of Irresponsibility and after he died\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s lips pulled back from his teeth and a hissing sound left him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, annoyed by an overwhelming surge of concern for him.</p><p>\u201cHer husband was possessed by...Irresponsibility, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. For several centuries, he was a prisoner of Tartarus. He died while...you-knowing Synda, and somehow she ended up with the demon. That\u2019s why our race has studied you and your friends so intently. Well, one of the reasons.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cThis couldn\u2019t get any worse. William tried to warn me, said I\u2019d have to make choices, but I thought...hoped...and she\u2019s blonde, just like the girl in the painting, and...well, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s happened. She is who she is. I\u2019ll deal. I\u2019ll figure things out. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>Babbling she had no idea how to decipher. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Again, he waved her words away. \u201cYou studied us, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs, meaning me and my friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFae spies have followed you guys for centuries. They report back and books are published and sold all over the realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpies,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cBooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPictures are drawn. Discussions take place. Fan clubs meet.\u201d</p><p>Though his gaze remained on her, his head dropped, his chin nearly hitting his sternum. \u201cAre you a member of a fan club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, a command for her to offer more details.</p><p>She did. Happily. \u201cI belong to Touch Me Torin.\u201d She sighed dreamily. \u201cHe\u2019s so kind and caring, always protecting those around him.\u201d</p><p>Kane grabbed her by the upper arms, jerking her into the hard line of his body. The moment he realized what he\u2019d done, he set her back in place, away from him, and lowered his hands, mumbling, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not. All that strength...</p><p>Stop enjoying his touch. Stop craving it. He\u2019s not for you.</p><p>\u201cYou will stay away from Torin,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut meeting him is the one and only thing I wanted to do before I died.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, as if praying for patience, and inhaled sharply.</p><p>One of the jewels hanging from the chandelier detached and plunged down, shattering on Kane\u2019s head. Cringing, he brushed the pieces out of his hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s never happened before. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>Feeling generous, she said, \u201cDo you want to know the name of your fan club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re not part of it,\u201d he said, an edge to his tone.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t an official member, no. \u201cJust so you know, Synda\u2019s hobbies include backstabbing, causing trouble and ruining lives. You\u2019ll never be happy with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got you sentenced to the Never-ending, didn\u2019t she?\u201d he said. \u201cYou. Not her, the keeper of Irresponsibility.\u201d He rubbed at his temples. \u201cThat\u2019s how you ended up in hell.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be talking to himself as much as he was talking to her. \u201cYes. There are many openings to the Never-ending, and one is actually in S\u00e9duire. I was pushed inside, fell down the pit for a thousand years, yet only a day passed here. The bottom is the center of hell, and I finally reached it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand years,\u201d he rasped. \u201cAnother reason you want to die. You don\u2019t want to endure such torture again.\u201d</p><p>Torture. Such a mild word for what had happened. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the stories about it, but none of them do it justice. In that pit, it\u2019s dark, with no hint of light. Soundless. You can\u2019t even hear yourself scream and beg for help. It\u2019s empty. There\u2019s nothing to anchor you.\u201d She shook her head to dislodge the memories. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to endure it again.\u201d</p><p>A strange vibration moved through him, as if he were barely holding himself back from an act of violence. He paled.</p><p>\u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he rasped. And then he shocked her, taking her hand, twining their fingers, holding on to her as if she were a lifeline. The contact only lasted a few seconds, but it was enough to make her reel.</p><p>To hide her confusion...and her sudden inability to breathe...she returned her attention to her rag, rubbing at the banister. \u201cI\u2019ve got tons of work to do, Kane. I\u2019m sorry, but I have to ask you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not kill yourself?\u201d he continued, ignoring her. \u201cNot that I\u2019m suggesting you do such a thing. I\u2019m not, and I\u2019ll make you regret it if you try. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhatever I do to myself brings only suffering, never death.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhat if you managed to remove your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy body would grow back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. One of my friends was beheaded, and there was nothing we could do to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019ll recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>Josephina peered over the edge of the railing, and gave another sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll prove it.\u201d And in the process, escape the sensations he awoke in her.</p><p>Trying to mask her fear, she climbed up the railing.</p><p>Behind her, she could hear the stomp of the guards.</p><p>Kane grabbed her by the arms, and forced her back to the ground. He was even warmer than before, his grip so deliciously firm. Her skin was suddenly more sensitive, tingling and aching. Her ears picked up every rasp of his breath, and heated. Her eyes drank in the purity of his features, and her nostrils became saturated with the decadence of his scent. Her mouth watered for a taste of...of...him?</p><p>\u201cStay back,\u201d he called. \u201cI\u2019ve got her.\u201d</p><p>The men retreated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a demonstration,\u201d he said to her, his voice tight. \u201cI\u2019ll believe you, whether it sounds far-fetched or not. Okay?\u201d</p><p>The crystals in the chandelier rattled powerfully\u2014a second later, the entire thing dropped from the top level and fell down, down, down, crashing into the floor at the bottom. Shards of glass shot in every direction. Screaming people raced out of the way.</p><p>Kane cursed under his breath. \u201cPay no attention to what just happened. Tell me about your problem.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, because she didn\u2019t want to think about the mess she would be forced to clean. \u201cHowever I try to kill myself, I suffer with the pain for weeks, months, even if my organs go splat on the ground. Everything eventually grows back or heals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>Easy. \u201cYou know how I can absorb the abilities of others with a simple touch? Well, Tiberius can impart abilities to others. He imparted this one to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what you absorb doesn\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he imparts does,\u201d she replied simply.</p><p>He tapped his temples. \u201cWhat about your ability to invade my head?\u201d</p> <p>Turning back to her rag so that he wouldn\u2019t see the sudden bead of tears in her eyes, she said softly, \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s ability, and she gave it to me right before she died. I guess it stayed with me because it had nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was human. How did she possess an ability of a Fae?\u201d</p><p>A pang in her heart as she said, \u201cI probably should have qualified my description of her. One of her ancestors was Fae, but the line had become so diluted she was considered human.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cYou have too much to live for, Tinker Bell, and I don\u2019t want you to seek a killer while I\u2019m here. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She would vow no such thing and told him so with her silence.</p> <p>He leaned down and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll kill anyone you ask, and I won\u2019t be nice about it. They\u2019ll hurt, and they\u2019ll beg, and they\u2019ll scream, just like you said you did in the Never-ending. Only, their suffering won\u2019t end as quickly as yours did. A thousand years? Try ten thousand.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, she gripped the railing. \u201cYou have to let me do what I think is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen what you think is right is actually wrong? No. You\u2019re mine, and I\u2019ll see to you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze jerked up.</p><p>His cheeks reddened. The cascade of his warm breath stopped abruptly as he straightened. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re my responsibility now. I want you alive and well.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re mine. Her body had come alive with those words. Her pulse had quickened. Her stomach had quivered. Every inch of her had heated. But the sensations had fled with his addition. She was a responsibility, nothing more.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He pinched a lock of her hair between his fingers, tickling her scalp.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She batted his arm away. One second he ran hot, the next cold. The next hot. He was twisting her into terrible knots, and she didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cTell me you won\u2019t do anything foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that. I consider this conversation foolish, and yet I\u2019m still participating.\u201d</p><p>He took no offense. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a few things you want to do before you die. Besides meeting Torin.\u201d With the dryness of his tone, he might as well have rolled his eyes.</p><p>There was something she wanted to do.... Her gaze fell to his lips. She wanted to kiss him. So bad. She gulped and croaked, \u201cLike what?\u201d Now who\u2019s running hot and cold?</p><p>\u201cLike...fall in love.\u201d</p><p>Love. Yes. Something she\u2019d craved, especially in the dark of the night, when men came knocking at the door of the room she shared with seven other servants. The women always giggled, thrilled to be summoned, to be kissed and touched and maybe even held afterward.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever fallen in love?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had sex, though. A lot.\u201d And she suddenly wasn\u2019t happy by the thought.</p><p>He nodded stiffly. \u201cYou heard stories about that, too, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d But the spies had only witnessed his public encounters. She wondered what happened when he was behind closed doors, and shivered.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last?\u201d</p><p>The sharpness of the question surprised her. \u201cStory?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cA year ago. We were told you had a one-night stand.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. \u201cIf you\u2019re hoping for an exclusive packed with details, you\u2019re not going to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. If you were Paris, though, I might beg for it.\u201d She smiled with fond remembrance. \u201cSweet, beautiful Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are really trying my patience, woman. Paris already has a female, one who is very powerful and would not find your yearning amusing.\u201d Kane leaned down, putting them nose-to-nose. \u201cEven if he didn\u2019t, you\u2019re mine. Don\u2019t ever forget.\u201d</p><p>This time, he offered no addition, and the warmth returned to her body, speeding through her veins, and oh, sweet heat, suddenly her heart was racing faster than ever before, her bones melting, the rest of her liquefying.</p><p>\u201cYour responsibility?\u201d she asked with a tremor.</p><p>He tapped her on the nose, irritating her, and said, \u201cI have a lot to think about. I\u2019ll find you later and let you know what I\u2019ve decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecided?\u201d She grabbed the sides of his shirt. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when I know.\u201d He tugged from her hold and walked away, never looking back.</p><p>The guards leaped into action, probably intending to escort him to the king for his whipping. She almost opened her mouth to say she would take the punishment for him. She\u2019d been whipped before, and she could survive being whipped again. But in the end, she let him go. He was Synda\u2019s fianc\u00e9 now, and Josephina couldn\u2019t allow herself to forget.</p><p>Not even when the words you\u2019re mine were echoing in her mind.</p><p>SO. MANY. PROBLEMS.</p><p>Kane\u2019s mind whirled. Synda was possessed by the demon of Irresponsibility, but Tinker Bell had spent time in the Never-ending. Synda was blonde, and could very well be the girl in Danika\u2019s painting. But, his pose seemed to suggest he cared about the girl, and it was Tinker Bell, a brunette, his mind and body craved.</p><p>Her sad crystalline gaze tore him up inside. Her lips were so lush and red and...lickable. Yeah, that was the perfect word to describe them. Her body was curved in all the right ways\u2014dangerous.</p><p>And she wanted Torin. Or Paris.</p><p>Once upon a time, he would have been fine with that. She wasn\u2019t the kind of woman he would have wanted. He would have considered her too sweet, too innocent, and no match for Disaster. But Kane would have been wrong. He would have missed out on a very good thing. Yes, Tinker Bell was sweet. Yes, she was innocent. But she was also strong. Resilient.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>What Kane felt for her was different than what he\u2019d ever felt for another. It was more intense. Intense enough to overshadow self-disgust and tainted memories, and utterly consume him. He was beginning to like touching her, despite the pain she elicited. But the thought of having sex with her...no.</p><p>He would only disappoint her. Memories would overtake him, and he would humiliate himself by vomiting. He wouldn\u2019t be able to please her, but he would have no problem disappointing her. She had lived with enough disappointment. Enough humiliation\u2014she didn\u2019t need his.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to treat her as he\u2019d treated the girls at the club, and just go through the motions. She deserved more. Better. But he wouldn\u2019t be able to give her more and better.</p><p>And what would Disaster do if Kane ever got her into bed?</p><p>Being so near her, putting his hands on her time and time again, and wanting so badly to kiss her, had finally driven the demon over the edge. Disaster had erupted, roaring with upset, banging against Kane\u2019s skull in an effort to drive him away from her. He\u2019d stayed put, desperate for one more second of her time, her scent, her gaze...the possibility of more contact. And that\u2019s when the chandelier had come crashing down.</p><p>Now, he stomped to the bedroom he\u2019d been given, and shut the door in his companions\u2019 faces. He halfway expected the pair to burst inside and ask for his autograph, but they opted to survive the rest of their day. They didn\u2019t know the king had changed his mind about the whipping. That Kane had won their chess game, and the prize had been the freedom to speak with Tinker Bell anytime, anywhere.</p><p>He could have told Tinker Bell the truth, but he had liked her concern for him too much. As mad as she\u2019d been at him, she hadn\u2019t wanted him to suffer.</p><p>Did she have any idea what that did to him?</p><p>No. Probably not.</p><p>What was he going to do with that girl?</p><p>What was he going to do about the princess?</p><p>And, curse it all, why was he even wondering about this? He wasn\u2019t here to find a mate, had even thought to avoid the one the Moirai predicted was his. He leaned against the door, and pushed out a heavy breath. He was here to save Tinker Bell. Afterward, he would kill Disaster. Then, and only then, would he figure out what to do about his future.</p><p>So. Just how was he going to save Tinker Bell? If he took her out of S\u00e9duire, she would be hunted for the rest of her life. If he killed her royal family, the Fae would strike back at him. They might try and return the favor by killing his family, the Lords. A long, bloody war could erupt, and his friends had enough to deal with.</p><p>Frustrated, he stalked forward and slammed his fist into the poster at the end of the bed. Solid gold met bone, and bone lost, splitting in several places. Pain radiated up his arm, and he grinned without humor. The wound would heal. His fury wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Too often lately he\u2019d been without answers, without direction, unsure of what to do or how to proceed. Confusion was a toxic sludge inside him, rising and rising, and he needed to get rid of it.</p><p>Hinges on the bathroom door creaked. Kane straightened, assuming a battle stance. Only, it wasn\u2019t an enemy here to attack. It was Synda\u2014utterly naked.</p><p>She leaned against the door frame and toyed with the ends of her hair. Short, delicate of bone structure and yet plump of flesh, she presented the perfect picture of feminine carnality. Add a little muscle tone to her, and she was the kind of woman he had once enjoyed.</p><p>Mine, Disaster purred.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded. This was to be his private room, and that\u2019s the way he wanted it to stay. Private.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seducing you, of course.\u201d A soft smile lifted the corners of her lips, inviting him to join in her amusement and arousal. There was no red in her eyes, no hint of her demon. \u201cI took one look at you, and knew we were destined to be together. You\u2019re everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a man.\u201d</p><p>Destined, she\u2019d said. \u201cHave you spoken to the Moirai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had the privilege, no.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what to think about that. \u201cAnd just what is it you\u2019ve wanted in a man, hmm?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStrength. Fierce ability. A streak of viciousness when needed. Someone possessed, like me. Someone beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but she had no idea the price she\u2019d have to pay to be with him, if ever he were interested in her.</p><p>He stalked toward her. Her smile grew wider. No question, she expected him to toss her on the bed and ravish her. Instead, he picked her up and unceremoniously hauled her to the door, surprised to find contact with her was not accompanied by pain.</p> <p>Surprised and irritated. Why couldn\u2019t contact with Tinker Bell be this easy?</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou just passed the bed.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind doing it in public, warrior, but I was hoping to have you all to myself for a while.\u201d</p><p>He twisted the knob and pushed at the seam in the wood with his shoulder. The guards were still there, probably commanded to remain all night. They snapped to attention.</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything we can get you, Lord Kane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything at all?\u201d</p><p>Tinker Bell stood in front of them, a fact that startled\u2014and delighted\u2014him. Her eyes locked on him, and relief bathed her expression. \u201cKane, I\u2014\u201d Her gaze fell to Synda, her lips pressing together. The relief faded, leaving the same resentment and hurt he\u2019d experienced himself. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>The princess was her enemy. He got that. But he couldn\u2019t explain himself, couldn\u2019t tell her that he was only using his promise to wed Synda to help her. If the princess learned of his plan, it would fail. She would tell her father, and the king would do as he\u2019d threatened during their game and target Kane for elimination.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Up went Tinker Bell\u2019s chin. \u201cNope. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t fine. He set Synda on her feet and pushed her forward. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to your room, Princess. And I\u2019m leaving you there. Alone.\u201d</p><p>She twisted to face him, flames of red erupting in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re rejecting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She beat at his chest. \u201cFetch me a robe, then. This instant!\u201d</p><p>And take his eyes off Tinker Bell? No. She would run.</p><p>Kane whipped off his shirt and tugged the material over the girl\u2019s head. \u201cThere. You\u2019re covered. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The red disappeared as Synda gaped at him, practically drooling. \u201cSo. Many. Muscles.\u201d She reached, intending to brush her fingertips over the ropes in his stomach, but he stepped backward, avoiding any further contact.</p><p>Tinker Bell peered down at the floor, refusing to look at him.</p> <p>\u201cYour room, Princess,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Synda turned with a flourish, ignoring Tinker Bell, and marched away. \u201cCome on. This way.\u201d</p><p>He followed, dragging Tinker Bell with him. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving my sight until I know why you came to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why. I\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d she snipped.</p><p>\u201cWell, change it back.\u201d</p><p>She hmphed. \u201cMake me\u201d</p><p>Dangerous words. He could already think of several ways to do it.</p><p>Synda led them to the top floor of the palace, to a suite of rooms with more riches than a sultan\u2019s treasury. Antique furniture, diamond vases, marble, onyx, every portrait framed in gold, Persian rugs, a table made only of rubies and a massive bed capable of sleeping twelve.</p><p>The princess stripped out of the shirt as she strolled to her bathroom. \u201cBath time,\u201d she called, stopping to look over her shoulder at Kane. \u201cThere\u2019s still time to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>The flickers of red returned to her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you save it for the wedding night instead?\u201d Kane stared down at Tinker Bell, who still wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze yet somehow managed to radiate animosity. \u201cWhere\u2019s your room? We\u2019ll talk there.\u201d</p><p>Pale, she muttered, \u201cI\u2019m not taking you to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find it with or without your help. It\u2019ll just be better for you if that happens sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she huffed out a breath. \u201cFine. This way,\u201d and tugged him out of the suite.</p><p>Synda called out. He didn\u2019t hear what she said, and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Tinker Bell ushered him down several flights of stairs, into a darker, dank area of the palace. The servants\u2019 quarters, he would bet, and the knowledge angered him. How could the daughter of a king be treated so shabbily?</p><p>She stopped in front of an open door, and he peeked inside. Through the darkness, he could see cot after cot, sleeping body after sleeping body, but that was all. There were no luxuries of any kind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying in there,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, I am.\u201d</p><p>And know she was uncomfortable while he slept on something as soft as clouds? Never. But he wasn\u2019t going to take the time to argue with her. Once again, he hefted a woman over his shoulder. Unlike the princess, Tinker Bell protested, beating her fists against his back, pounding her knees into his stomach.</p><p>\u201cIs that the best you\u2019ve got? If so, you don\u2019t deserve the name Tinker Bell. It\u2019s too masculine for you. From now on, all you\u2019re getting is Tink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTink! I\u2019m no Tink! I\u2019m more ferocious than a wild animal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA newborn kitten, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d She bit him on the butt.</p><p>For just a moment, the action dropped him straight into hell, and he tripped over his own feet. He caught himself before he hit the ground, and as he fought for breath, he managed to straighten. You\u2019re with Tinker Bell. Your Fae. You\u2019re safe.</p><p>\u201cScratch that,\u201d he said, picking up their conversation as if it had never lapsed, hoping she wouldn\u2019t notice the change in his tone. From teasing to tense. \u201cYou\u2019re as gentle as a little puppy. I\u2019ll call you Yappydoodle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you...slime! I\u2019ll call you Jackhole! Because that\u2019s what you are!\u201d</p><p>Jackhole?</p><p>He barked out a laugh and then blinked in surprise. How did she always pull him from the brink of despair so quickly? \u201cNow, now. No reason to dirty your tongue with name-calling. I\u2019ll just have to wash your mouth out with\u2014\u201d</p><p>My tongue, he silently finished. He was flirting with her, acting as if he was normal. As if he could do normal things.</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She remained quiet, and he remained in this sudden foul mood.</p><p>When he came to his chamber, he wasn\u2019t surprised to find the guards were still at their posts.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Lord Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything? It would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he shoved past them and shut the door. Then, he tossed Tink on the mattress. She bounced up and down, and when she stopped, glared over at him.</p><p>Leave her! Disaster commanded.</p><p>One by one, he discarded the weapons he\u2019d stolen from the king. As the floor cracked beneath his feet, he made sure the blades were within quick reach of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tink gasped out.</p><p>\u201cGetting ready for sleepy night-night time. You should try it.\u201d He was too stressed and tired to find her a room of her own. At least, that\u2019s what he told himself. He wouldn\u2019t consider his inability to part with the girl.</p><p>Her mouth formed a small O and, seeing it, he was struck by the desire to kiss it right off her face\u2014to taste her and learn her and brand her. The desires angered him. He was all emotion, no action, and he knew it.</p><p>He kicked off his boots, but left on his pants, and climbed onto the mattress.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t sleep together,\u201d she said with a tremor. \u201cIt\u2019s highly improper.\u201d</p><p>And probably dangerous. For both of them. \u201cWill you be punished?\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause before she said, \u201cFor spending private time with precious Princess Synda\u2019s betrothed? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cYou guys seem pretty accepting when it comes to sex. Why was Synda punished for sleeping with the butcher\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Fae. He was human. Such unions are prohibited, since they lead to a dilution of the bloodlines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Fae, yet the king will allow me to wed his precious daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Lord of the Underworld. You\u2019re a celebrity. Rules don\u2019t apply to you.\u201d</p><p>Good to know. \u201cYour mother was considered human, which means the king\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It does. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. Was he punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? He\u2019s the king.\u201d She ran her tongue over her lips, leaving a sheen of moisture behind. Gorgeous. Down, boy. \u201cAnd you, well, you can have anyone you want without worry, too. Tiberius never chastises upper-class males for their extracurricular activities. They can have who they want, when they want. They just have to be careful.\u201d</p><p>He caught the tinge of bitterness in her tone. \u201cHas anyone ever...\u201d Forced you. He couldn\u2019t ask her. He wasn\u2019t sure how he would react if the same question were presented to him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, anyway. \u201cI\u2019m only viewed as a sexual object at parties, when men have been drinking, but the most they ever do is pat my bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Sure. I\u2019m certain you\u2019re right. That it takes alcohol to find you attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing and curse, I know. But then, I\u2019m a blood slave, and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>So innocent. She hadn\u2019t even caught his sarcasm. \u201cWhat about being amazing and wonderful? I believe you once described yourself that way.\u201d</p><p>She flicked her hair over her shoulder, the picture of feminine pique. \u201cI\u2019m a person, too, you know. I deserve compliments every now and then, and since I\u2019m the only one willing to give them to myself, I do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That might have been one of the saddest things he\u2019d ever heard. \u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he admitted softly. \u201cAnd smart. And brave.\u201d And so sexy he would have killed a thousand men and thrown them at her feet just for the chance to woo her...if only he\u2019d been the man he used to be.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I in the habit of lying to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there you go.\u201d He forced himself to relax against the softness of the mattress.</p><p>She scooted away, as if she feared what would happen next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to force myself on you, you have my word.\u201d Gentle. Easy. \u201cYou stay on your side of the bed, and I\u2019ll stay on mine, and you\u2019ll leave in the same condition you entered.\u201d And she would be the first.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still improper,\u201d she grumbled.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that argument still isn\u2019t going to sway me. Good night, Tink.\u201d He reached over and extinguished the lamp. Darkness flooded the room.</p><p>At first, she did nothing. Then she fluffed her pillow and settled under the covers.</p><p>A breath he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been holding slipped free.</p><p>He peered up at the darkened ceiling, inhaling the sweetness of her scent, holding it, holding it as long as he could, unwilling to give it up until the last possible second. For the first time in weeks, his muscles began to unknot. He thought he might actually be able to fall asleep, to actually rest, and yet, he resisted. Tink would never be witness to his nightmares.</p><p>He could lash out. She could try to comfort him. In a dazed state, he could hurt her.</p><p>He would rather die than hurt her.</p> <p>Annnd...his muscles were knotting up again, though it had nothing to do with the past. Tink was here, in his bed. Within reach. All he had to do was stretch out his arm, and his hand could cup the fullness of her breast. Then, slide lower. Lower still. Surely he would not have an adverse reaction to such innocuous contact. She was dressed, after all.</p><p>Still. She might respond. Might encourage him.</p><p>Might actually ask for more.</p><p>He pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth.</p><p>Time for a distraction. \u201cSo...what\u2019s the name of my fan club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind. Apparently that\u2019s allowed in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>The sheets rustled as she turned. \u201cCataclysmic for Kane.\u201d</p> <p>He told himself to hush. He asked, \u201cYou ever been to one of the meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have stumbled into one...by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix...teen. Girls get lost very easily sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He fought a grin. \u201cSo, what were you going to tell me when you reached my room?\u201d</p><p>A weary sigh left her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. By the way, nothing happened between Synda and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA naked Synda,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He wanted to tell her the truth. But what would happen if he had to do something he didn\u2019t like in order to reach his goal? The truth would then become a lie. He\u2019d be better off keeping all his options open. But the nail in the coffin? A part of him needed to preserve some distance between them, and the engagement created it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, when I came to your room, I was going to tell you I\u2019ve never met anyone as dumb as you,\u201d she said, and he imagined her features scrunched up in what she probably hoped was a snobby expression. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt so bad when you\u2019re whipped for talking to me.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t laugh. \u201cI won\u2019t be whipped. The king and I came to an arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were having too much fun counting my words.\u201d</p><p>She muttered a few more choice names for him. \u201cYeah, well, Synda will be punishment enough, I suppose. She lives for the moment and nothing more. She forgets her every promise. In a few weeks, another man will catch her attention and you\u2019ll be left with a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>Resentment blasted from her, and he had to tighten his grip on the pillow to stop from reaching for her. \u201cI may be dumb, but my Spidey-senses are telling me she broke your heart, too.\u201d</p><p>She hmphed, as if he were crazy.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>She must have been tracing circles on the sheet, because her knuckles brushed against one of his nipples. The contact electrified him, and he nearly shot off the bed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she did,\u201d Tink said, unaware. \u201cLong ago she promised to protect me from our father. Then, the very next day, she was caught stealing horses from visiting Harpies. It started a war, and punishment was decreed, but she said nothing as I was dragged away to be whipped.\u201d</p><p>The story doused his lust. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he replied, hurting for her. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Did she look as sad and exhausted as she had sounded? \u201cI\u2019m going to make things better for you, Tink,\u201d he vowed. Somehow, some way.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo faith in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo faith in anyone.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>KANE STOOD BESIDE the bed and peered down at Tink. Sunlight streamed in from the window, and, as if drawn to her, enveloped her and her alone. Spotlighting her. Highlighting every luscious nuance. She exuded peace to an astonishing degree. A peace he craved for himself.</p><p>She was Sleeping Beauty. Or, more accurately, Cinderella, complete with an evil stepmother and half sister.</p><p>Too bad for her, Kane was to be her Prince Charming.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to, but at some point, he\u2019d fallen asleep. A nightmare had awoken him\u2014and he\u2019d found Tinker Bell asleep on his chest.</p><p>Had she rolled there on her own, or had he pulled her over?</p><p>The contact had hurt him in more ways than one. His lust had returned full force.</p><p>After he\u2019d eased her aside, he\u2019d been more diligent, and remained awake, listening to her every breath, waiting for her every movement, remembering the way she\u2019d made him smile, dying inside because he\u2019d still wanted to roll over, on top of her, and strip her, and touch her, and do things to her, even though the very thoughts had him fighting back an all-consuming panic.</p><p>He didn\u2019t deserve her. His moods were too mercurial. He was happy one minute, ticked off the next. He was decided on a course one minute, confused the next. She needed someone solid. Dependable. Like Torin.</p><p>She had no faith in anyone, she\u2019d said, and that was downright sad. Whether Kane deserved her or not, he wasn\u2019t going to let her down.</p><p>Kill her, Disaster said. It\u2019s what she wants.</p><p>What she wanted wasn\u2019t what she needed.</p><p>Tink\u2019s lips parted on a breathy sigh, and his chest constricted. How innocent she was.</p><p>Kill her!</p><p>Kane turned and stalked from the room, the demon cursing him with every step.</p><p>JOSEPHINA HAD MANY duties, and serving breakfast to the royal family was one of them. A decree straight from Queen Penelope, meant to humiliate her at the start of her day, every day.</p><p>Waiting to begin, Josephina pressed against the far wall in the dining room, holding a pitcher of freshly made pomegranate juice. She should have been finished already, should have returned to her housecleaning, but no one had arrived. Everyone was probably busy congratulating Kane and Synda on their upcoming nuptials and the happy couple was probably gorging on the compliments.</p><p>Oh, Kane. Everyone\u2019s right. We\u2019re so beautiful together, Synda was probably saying. So perfect together.</p><p>I\u2019m perfect for everyone, Kane was probably replying. But I\u2019m glad I ended up with you.</p><p>The pitcher shattered in Josephina\u2019s hands.</p><p>Cold liquid seeping through the fabric of her gloves and making her gasp, she rushed to the kitchen and gathered the rags she needed, trying to evade Cook\u2019s eye. He welcomed any chance to lash out at her.</p><p>Once, as a means of punishment for one of Synda\u2019s crimes, Josephina was starved for a week. Three days in, the hunger pangs had become so severe she\u2019d snuck into the kitchen and stolen a hunk of bread.</p><p>Cook had caught her, but had vowed to remain silent if she would spend the night in his bed. She\u2019d turned herself in instead, and he\u2019d never forgiven her.</p><p>So, maybe she hadn\u2019t been entirely honest with Kane. Maybe some of the men\u2014other than her brother\u2014did see her as more than a blood slave.</p><p>Annnd...Cook cleared his throat, and she glanced over.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do now? What new problem have you caused me?\u201d He stomped over to her. He grabbed her by the wrist, only to rear backward with a wheeze. \u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your cooking sucks. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! I don\u2019t care who you are, you will not insult my divine cuisine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>Okay. \u201cYour pies are flavorless, and your cakes are hard as rocks.\u201d</p><p>His palm flew up and out, swiping over her cheek. Her skin instantly flamed, stinging. Josephina slapped him back. As he gurgled his outrage, she blew him a kiss and flounced away.</p><p>Maintaining a brave face, she cleaned the mess in the dining room and donned a fresh pair of gloves. Only after she had made a new pitcher of juice, with Cook avoiding her, did she return to her post.</p><p>The royal family still hadn\u2019t arrived.</p><p>Inconsiderate toads!</p><p>She flinched at the uncharacteristic outburst. The ache in her cheek must be making her cranky. And, well, Kane had no business marrying Synda after he\u2019d forced Josephina to spend the night in his room. He should have called off the nuptials with the rising of the sun!</p><p>And I never should have gone to him. Never should have thought to take him up on his offer, hoping to get him away from Synda.</p><p>Josephina had been mad about his engagement before, but standing there, thinking about last night, she became enraged. Kane probably didn\u2019t remember, but he\u2019d suffered from terribly violent nightmares last night. He\u2019d cried out and he\u2019d thrashed, but she had managed to calm him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had. Not Synda.</p><p>He\u2019d held her for a long moment, his arms tight around her, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to let her go, then he\u2019d rolled her to her side of the bed. Obviously, he\u2019d gotten over his aversion to touch somewhat\u2014and yet, he hadn\u2019t tried to kiss or touch her.</p><p>He must be saving that kind of thing for the princess.</p> <p>Why did that tear her into so many ragged pieces?</p><p>An engaged man shouldn\u2019t share a bed with anyone but his intended, and anyone that did should be...should be...castrated!</p><p>I could help him with that, she thought. I have no experience with knives, but a quick slice and dice shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p>Contemplating mutilation? I don\u2019t know who you are anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m you, dummy.</p> <p>What if Kane was already in love with Synda?</p><p>Why do you care?</p><p>I don\u2019t. Okay, fine. I do.</p><p>She had lain awake for hours, trying not to enjoy her first taste of luxury, all the while hoping to sneak out of the bedroom the moment Kane fell asleep. But he\u2019d lain awake for hours, too, and her eyelids had eventually become too heavy to hold up. Then, his thrashing had woken her, and she\u2019d cuddled him, and she\u2019d liked it far more than she should have. Had even been tempted to ask for more.</p><p>If Synda found out...</p><p>She raised her chin and focused on the here and now. Four small chandeliers dripped with hundreds of opals and hung over a long, square table hewn from gold, diamonds and sapphires. The chairs were carved in the shape of dragons, with cobalt velvet lining the seats. Colorful murals of naked, frolicking Fae decorated the walls, and a soft white rug lined the floor.</p> <p>There were three windows, each overlooking the flower garden out back. She adored that garden, and allowed herself a peek outside\u2014wait. Armed guards were running toward the gate.</p><p>Something was happening. What\u2014</p><p>King Tiberius strolled inside the room at long last, his latest mistress on his arm. Josephina snapped to attention. The mistress was lovely, to be sure, but only seventeen years old. She\u2019d had a bright future before the king had taken notice of her, and most likely would have married the richest of the Opulens; she would have had a family and never would she have wanted for anything.</p><p>Except, perhaps, love and fidelity.</p><p>But now, no man would have her, not even the lowest of the servants. When the king discarded her, and he would, no one would want to risk his ire by pursuing what he suddenly deemed \u201cunworthy.\u201d</p><p>The king\u2019s expression was troubled as he claimed the seat at the head of the table. He motioned for the scantily clad female to take the seat at his left\u2014the queen\u2019s seat. Josephina groaned. Queen Penelope knew of the king\u2019s affairs, of course she did, everyone knew; in public, she simply pretended not to care. But in private, when only Josephina was around, she ranted and raged.</p><p>\u201c\u2014not sure why an army of Phoenix warriors are attacking us,\u201d the king was saying. \u201cDo they really want to start another war? They have brute force, but they haven\u2019t the numbers.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no, no, no. If the Phoenix were here, they were here for Josephina. And if her father found out she was the reason, he would unleash a torrent of wrath upon her.</p> <p>A tremor rocked her, and liquid sloshed over the sides of the pitcher.</p><p>Tiberius cast her a reproachful glance.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to fear, my darling,\u201d he continued, patting his mistress\u2019s delicate hand. \u201cThe soldiers will be dead by the end of the day, their heads sent back to their people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Majesty\u201d was the soft reply. The girl kept her gaze downcast. \u201cYou\u2019re so strong. Utterly undefeatable.\u201d</p><p>Kane strolled inside, and Josephina quivered with the memory of his embrace. His savage beauty had never been more apparent than at that moment, as morning light streamed over him. The two guards were stationed at his back. His gaze swept the area, and Josephina was certain he\u2019d somehow managed to catalog every detail at once, though she fought a wave of disappointment when he simply skimmed over her.</p><p>Good morning to you, too, she thought, trying to ignore a fresh tide of hurt and resentment.</p><p>\u201cLord Kane. We\u2019re pleased you\u2019ve joined us.\u201d The king motioned for Kane to take the chair at his right. Synda\u2019s chair.</p><p>Kane sat, putting his back to Josephina. He held up his arm and cocked two fingers. Was he...summoning her over?</p><p>Those fingers moved again, more adamantly this time.</p><p>He was. He really was. I\u2019m going to smash his face!</p><p>Teeth grinding, she moved forward and poured three drops of juice into his goblet.</p><p>When she tried to move away, Kane grabbed hold of her wrist. Startled, she almost dropped the pitcher. His grip was strong, his skin white-hot.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a mark on your cheek,\u201d he said with the stillness she\u2019d come to recognize as dangerous. He looked up at her, the thick shield of his lashes hiding whatever emotion gleamed in his eyes. His lips pressed into a thin, hard line.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cFrom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. Whose?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, and his gaze followed the motion. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I took care of it.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her wrist harder. \u201cWhose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can kill him\u2014or her.\u201d</p><p>She had no loyalty to Cook, but she wouldn\u2019t allow the man to be put to death for so minor an offense. So, she remained silent.</p><p>Kane released her and glared at the king. \u201cIf she\u2019s hurt again, I\u2019ll make sure everyone in this palace regrets it.\u201d</p><p>Unused to such irreverence, Tiberius blustered for a moment. \u201cMy admiration for you won\u2019t save you from my wrath, Lord Kane. Tread carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want an enemy you can\u2019t afford to have? Because you\u2019re walking the line with me,\u201d Kane snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Phoenix running wild out there, and your men will never be able to take them down. You\u2019ve allowed the army to become lazy, living off of the triumph of past conquests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! My men are as strong as ever.\u201d</p><p>Kane smiled, but it wasn\u2019t a nice one. \u201cIf I were to walk out there right now, I could slay every single male under your command and not break a sweat. Want me to prove it?\u201d</p><p>What was he doing? She wanted to jump in front of him and shield him from the curses and punishments about to start flying, but it was no longer her place to protect him. She returned to her spot against the wall.</p><p>Tiberius leaped to his feet, planted his palms on the tabletop and peered down at Kane with undiluted rage. \u201cA dead man can\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p><p>Kane stood, too, refusing to back down from the mighty king of the Fae\u2014something very few had tried and none had survived. His chair toppled over, one of the legs poking him in the back of the knee. He didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cI have some experience with the Phoenix, and I know they\u2019ll play with your men these next few weeks, testing their abilities. Then, the Phoenix will seem to vanish for a few weeks more and you\u2019ll relax. Then, the warriors will return with a vengeance and torch the palace and everyone in it.\u201d</p><p>Crystal eyes narrowed. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, the problem will be yours as much as mine. Your engagement ball is set for eight days from now, and your wedding nine days from now.\u201d</p><p>Just enough time to plan a feast but not so long the bulk of Synda\u2019s personality flaws couldn\u2019t be hidden.</p><p>I can\u2019t watch their courtship. I just can\u2019t. And she couldn\u2019t allow herself to be drawn in and spit out by Kane anymore. From now on, it would be better for her if she kept her distance from him.</p><p>Maybe she should run away. She\u2019d done it before. Of course, she\u2019d been captured swiftly and disciplined severely, and had later vowed never to take such a risk again.</p><p>A silly vow, she realized now.</p><p>Leopold strolled into the room, and Synda skipped in behind him, branching off to close in on Kane.</p><p>Tiberius sat. Kane righted his chair and settled down.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, warrior.\u201d The princess tried to kiss him on the cheek, but he reared back, stopping her.</p><p>Perhaps he hadn\u2019t gotten over his aversion, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he gritted.</p><p>\u201cMaking your morning even better, of course,\u201d she said, unperturbed as she smoothed her skirt around her chair.</p><p>Gag.</p><p>\u201cNext time wait for permission.\u201d</p><p>The queen was the last to enter. She spotted the king\u2019s mistress and stiffened.</p><p>Trembling, Josephina filled her goblet with juice.</p><p>The queen sipped\u2014and spit the liquid out on Josephina\u2019s shoes. \u201cThis is horrid swill. How dare you ruin the start of my day with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you something else,\u201d she muttered, her cheeks burning hotly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay here,\u201d Kane growled. \u201cThe juice is fine.\u201d</p><p>Penelope looked to the king, expecting him to side with her. Tiberius nodded to Josephina to continue with her duties.</p><p>Josephina\u2019s stomach threatened to rebel. The queen would make her suffer for this.</p><p>Her trembling increased as she moved to Leopold\u2019s side and poured his measure of juice. He pressed his hand against the small of her back, as if holding her steady. Meanwhile, he spread his fingers to cover as much ground as possible, even daring to delve between the cheeks of her bottom.</p><p>She tried to shift out of the way.</p><p>Kane unleashed a stream of dark curses, and all eyes swung to him.</p><p>His gaze was locked on Leopold, and slitted.</p><p>Her brother shifted uncomfortably, lowered his arm.</p><p>What had that been about? Kane hadn\u2019t been able to see her brother\u2019s hand, had he? And if he had, he hadn\u2019t cared about it. Had he? He\u2019d simply wanted to...what? Confused, she flittered away to the kitchen to gather the food.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, you lazy cow,\u201d Cook snipped.</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at him before returning to the dining room.</p><p>\u201c\u2014take me shopping tomorrow? Please!\u201d Synda was saying to Kane.</p><p>\u201cAn excellent idea,\u201d King Tiberius replied, as if the question had been directed at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJosephina will go with us,\u201d Kane said firmly.</p><p>Her birth name on his lips just seemed wrong. She wasn\u2019t fond of Tinker Bell or Tink, but she also kind of loved them. They were special, meant just for her. He\u2019d never used a nickname with Synda.</p><p>The king opened his mouth to reply\u2014probably a refusal, considering the glint of anger in his eyes. But Synda clapped happily, and said, \u201cOf course she can come. We\u2019re going to have the best time ever!\u201d so he remained quiet.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the Phoenix?\u201d Leopold asked tightly. \u201cA woman of royal blood shouldn\u2019t be wandering about town with such a threat on the loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king has assured me your men can contain the threat. Besides, the ladies will be with me,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be protected.\u201d</p><p>Tiberius thought for a moment, nodded. \u201cYou will accompany the pair, Prince Leopold, and ensure nothing happens to Warrior Kane and Princess Synda.\u201d</p><p>The pair, he\u2019d said, rather than the threesome. As if Josephina didn\u2019t count.</p><p>The truth was, she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>The prince looked ready to argue, but quickly thought better of it. \u201cAs you wish, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Kane grinned without humor. \u201cUntil tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>KANE SPENT THE rest of the day doing a bit of investigative work, questioning every servant he came across. The moment he learned the cook had been the one to put the mark on Tink\u2019s cheek, he locked the kitchen, preventing anyone from escaping, and beat the man senseless.</p><p>He whistled with satisfaction as he went in search of Tink.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>A HAZE OF early-morning sunlight filled Kane\u2019s bedroom, chasing away the shadows.</p> <p>As he shook off the horrors of another nightmare, a sense of excitement rose.</p><p>Last night, his attempts to talk to Tink had failed. He\u2019d spied her in the throne room\u2014but she\u2019d disappeared behind a door the moment he\u2019d approached her. He\u2019d found her in the weaving room\u2014but she\u2019d pulled another disappearing act. He\u2019d snuck up on her in the garden\u2014but she\u2019d wiggled from his hold and run away.</p><p>Today, though, she couldn\u2019t do any running. According to the king, she had to stay by her sister\u2019s side. Which meant she would be within Kane\u2019s reach at all times.</p><p>A lamp toppled from the nightstand and smashed into his skull.</p><p>He scowled.</p><p>A knock sounded at the bedroom door.</p><p>Kane rose from the bed, stalked over and, with a dagger in hand, opened the obstruction. Prince Leopold stood before him, relaxed, utterly confident Kane would behave himself.</p><p>Foolish prince. Kane had a serious beef with the male. Not because of his taunts the day they\u2019d met, but because he\u2019d flattened his hand against Tink\u2019s lower back while gazing at her with desire in his eyes. It had startled Kane. He\u2019d thought he was misreading. But Disaster had snickered, seeing something Kane could not, something in the spirit realm in which he existed, perhaps. A dark cloud of lust? Another demon, sitting on Leopold\u2019s shoulder, driving his actions? Kane had heard the Sent Ones talking about such an occurrence.</p> <p>In the end, the reason didn\u2019t matter. Results did.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kane snapped, fingers tightening on the hilt.</p><p>Regal features darkened. \u201cThe princess is ready for your excursion. I\u2019ll escort you to her, and accompany you into town, keeping everyone safe.\u201d</p><p>Kane knew the Phoenix had taken off for the forest; he\u2019d seen the little fires they\u2019d left here and there. So far, though, the Fae had had no luck catching one or even engaging in any kind of battle.</p><p>Petra had to be the leader. She wanted Tink, and would stop at nothing to have her.</p><p>Well, Kane would stop at nothing to protect her.</p><p>\u201cAnd the servant?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll ignore.\u201d</p><p>So not happening, dude.</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll suffer,\u201d the prince added. \u201cThe things I\u2019ll do to you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Kane forced a smile. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>The prince turned his back, just as confident as before, and Kane sheathed the blade. He stayed close to the male\u2019s heels, conscious of his every step.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need guards while you\u2019re with me?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>A smug laugh rolled from him\u2014the same one Kane had heard at their first meeting. \u201cHardly. One word, and I can have you on your knees.\u201d</p><p>They pounded down a winding flight of stairs, then another and another. When they reached the bottom floor, and neared a door leading into a storage closet, Kane forcibly bumped the man in the shoulder, sending him crashing into the wall.</p><p>Before the prince had time to react, Kane punched him in the throat, cutting off his airway, and pinched his carotid, stopping the flow of blood to his brain. In seconds, the prince was crumpled on the floor, unconscious.</p><p>\u201cGot anything to say now?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>A maid turned the corner, spotted them and ground to a halt. She gasped, her hand fluttering to her heart.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Just napping,\u201d Kane said. \u201cHe\u2019ll wake up.\u201d Eventually. \u201cDon\u2019t disturb him. You know how cranky he can get when he goes without his beauty Z\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, wide-eyed, and hurried away.</p><p>He opened the storage closet, and dragged the prince to the center. Then, he rigged the lock, ensuring no one would be able to enter without force.</p><p>Mission accomplished.</p><p>Kane kicked back into gear. He\u2019d memorized the layout of the entire palace, had secretly peeked through every door, and knew the front entrance was just around the corner. As promised, the princess and Tink were waiting.</p><p>Anger returned full force as he looked them over. Synda was decked out in a crimson-colored velvet ball gown, the material feminine and flattering. Tink was stuck wearing some kind of cheap, ill-fitting dress that left pink scratches on her beautiful skin.</p><p>A frilly hat with ribbons perched on Synda\u2019s head.</p><p>Tink was without a hat, her hair pulled into a severe bun at the back of her neck.</p><p>Synda smelled of floral perfume.</p><p>Tink smelled of pungent floor cleaner.</p><p>His hands fisted. He wanted to kill someone. He wanted to hug Tink and never let go.</p><p>Synda smiled when she spotted him, skipped over and planted a kiss directly on his lips. He stood still and stiff, not wanting to deal with another outburst. His gaze immediately sought Tink. Her eyes were downcast.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Prince Leopold?\u201d Synda asked, oblivious.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping. We should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping? Even though he was awake five minutes ago?\u201d Tink asked. Then she looked at Synda, and pressed her lips together.</p><p>What? She wasn\u2019t allowed to talk on this little excursion?</p><p>His knuckles nearly burst out of his skin, so tightly did he squeeze his fingers into a fist. \u201cYes. Sleeping.\u201d</p><p>A dog came racing around the corner. The creature made a beeline for Tink, and the demon laughed, assuring Kane he was responsible. Kane jolted forward, sticking his leg in the path of wrath. Sharp teeth sank into his ankle, stinging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d a servant said, chasing after the dog. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he got away from me.\u201d</p><p>With as gentle a tug as he could manage, Kane ripped the creature\u2019s canines from his bone and handed him over.</p><p>\u201cCome on, everyone,\u201d Synda said cheerfully, skipping through the double doors held open by two guards. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting days and days for this.\u201d</p><p>Days. When it had only been mentioned yesterday.</p><p>Tink followed after her, and Kane followed after Tink. The sun was shining, though it was a muted and murky version of the one he was used to, the sky gray with threads of black rather than blue, as if a storm brewed. There was a high, transparent wall surrounding the palace, glittering brightly, and behind it, a lush green forest. Much of the military forces were still out there, chasing the Phoenix.</p><p>A cobblestone path led to a horse-drawn carriage. And there were other carriages on the road, he saw. Three that he could see up-close, and two in the distance, slowly closing in. In the three up-close perched females dressed as fancily as Synda, each peering at him with abject longing.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he gorgeous?\u201d Synda called with pride. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Kane almost snapped a denial. He reached the carriage first, and hefted the princess inside. She braced her hands on his shoulders, and he had to grit his teeth against the horror of the contact.</p><p>Hands...all over him. Caressing him, scratching him.</p><p>Breathe. He had to breathe.</p><p>A punishment for his distaste of the girl, he supposed, the demon lashing out.</p><p>Next was Tink. He unfolded his fingers, revealing his palm. She hesitated a moment before placing her gloved fingers against his. As expected, there was a lance of pain, though it was lighter than usual, but...his mind was fine. The terrible memories retreated, Disaster unable to drudge them back up. Why?</p><p>Because, as Kane had realized in the forest, she was his light? Maybe. The memories were his darkness, and darkness had to flee in the presence of light.</p><p>Even after she\u2019d sat down, he maintained contact, lingering, marveling, once again fighting an inexplicable need only she was able to stir.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said, her voice taut, and he forced himself to release her. He climbed inside the carriage. One girl was on the left, one on the right. Embracing the chance to touch Tink again, he picked her up by the waist. So delicate. So feminine. Her gasp of surprise fanned over his skin as he set her beside her sister. Then, he settled into the other bench on his own, now able to watch both females.</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty today,\u201d Synda said to Tink. And astonishingly enough, she sounded sincere.</p><p>This must be one of her sweet moments. Never had he met a person who could change moods so quickly\u2014and he was counting himself. But then, Synda hadn\u2019t yet learned to fight the demon inside her. Darkness drove her. Urges came, and she gave in without stopping to analyze the wisdom of her actions. Emotions came, and she never tried to look past them to the reasons behind them.</p><p>She needed help, but she didn\u2019t want it\u2014last night, at dinner, he\u2019d offered and she\u2019d declined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want your body, Lord Kane, not your mind,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>He\u2019d shrugged. And yeah, he felt a little guilty about his lack of concern for her. She might just be his destined mate.</p><p>No. Impossible. Kane must have misunderstood what the Moirai had said. And what about the prediction William had mentioned? His daughter, White, wedding the man destined to start an apocalypse.</p> <p>Kane didn\u2019t even want a mate. He wanted...he needed...yeah, some part of him wanted and needed a mate.</p><p>For the first time in centuries, he had a reason to hope. He\u2019d watched his friends fall in love, and that love had strengthened them. They\u2019d overcome centuries-old rages and self-loathing simply to become the men their women needed. What if Kane\u2019s mate could help him defeat Disaster? What if she was the key?</p><p>The right girl could calm him, soothe him. The right girl mattered. But again, who was the right girl?</p><p>The princess, who carried Irresponsibility? Tink, who had spent time in the Never-ending? Or White? The wrong choice could torment him as much as the demon.</p><p>What he felt toward Synda was anger and pity.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t make him want to live, just to be with her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make him forget the trials of his past.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make him long for something better.</p><p>What he felt toward Tink was...powerful.</p><p>She made him eager to achieve his goals.</p><p>She made him ache, in body and in soul.</p> <p>She made him smile.</p><p>So, yeah, when he next had sex, it would be with Tink.</p><p>When? Whoa.</p><p>Had he seriously just thought the word when in conjunction with sex? He\u2019d promised himself he wouldn\u2019t go there with Tink. He would only disappoint her. He would ruin her innocence. Now, he considered her a foregone conclusion?</p><p>\u201cYou can speak,\u201d Synda was saying to her. \u201cI won\u2019t tell Daddy. Swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had better speak,\u201d Kane reiterated. He wouldn\u2019t be able to endure this little jaunt otherwise. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure no blame is cast your way.\u201d</p><p>The buggy jolted forward, but Tink remained quiet.</p><p>A few minutes later, Synda stood up and said, \u201cOh, look. There\u2019s the Twenty-fifth,\u201d nearly tumbling out the side of the vehicle. \u201cHey, Aos S\u00ed Caroline! Look at\u2014hmph.\u201d</p> <p>Kane grabbed her hand and forced her back into her seat. \u201cStay,\u201d he commanded. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>The princess crossed her arms over her middle and pouted. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m devastated you think so. Now, tell me why you called that woman by a number, and what ees-shee means.\u201d</p><p>Upset forgotten, Synda giggled like a schoolgirl. \u201cTwenty-five is her number, silly, and Aos S\u00ed is her title.\u201d</p><p>Vapid does not even begin to describe. He looked to Tink.</p><p>After a lengthy pause, she drew in a deep breath and said, \u201cEvery Opulen outside the royal family bears a number. Caroline is twenty-fifth in line for the throne, meaning, she\u2019s the twenty-fifth member of the high court. There are fifty members. All others are part of the lower court, and without a number.\u201d</p><p>Was nothing more important than status to the Fae? \u201cAnd the title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe literal translation of Aos S\u00ed is her people. Every female in the upper class bears such a title. The males are referred to as Daoine S\u00eddhe.\u201d</p><p>Good to know. \u201cWhat\u2019s your number and title?\u201d</p><p>Red stained her cheeks; she clamped her lips shut.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t an Opulen,\u201d Synda said matter-of-factly.</p><p>So...she didn\u2019t have a number or a title. He didn\u2019t like that.</p><p>He spent the rest of the fifteen-minute ride drilling the girls with questions. How often had the throne changed hands? Answer: eight times in the history of the Fae. How had the past kings died? Answer: murdered by their successors. Had the race ever been without a king? Answer: never.</p><p>The exchange ended when the carriage stopped in front of the first shop in a row of shops. The buildings were comprised of dark stone and some kind of glittery material, with crystal roofs and windows surrounded by ivy, reminding him of something out of a fairy tale.</p><p>And...was that William the Panty Melter entering the shop at the end of the street? The...Devil\u2019s Punchbowl, was the name, and it was clearly a tavern.</p><p>Kane popped to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve spotted our first stop,\u201d he said.</p><p>He helped the women exit the buggy, cringed against the memories Synda\u2019s touch caused, marveled anew at the mental peace Tink\u2019s wrought, and surged forward. When Synda tried to enter a shoe store, he dragged her away.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cThe tavern first,\u201d he said, and Synda stopped fighting.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so? I\u2019m always up for a good drink or twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, Kane,\u201d Tink said with a groan. \u201cIt\u2019s early morning and you want to get trashed? With the darling of the Fae? I\u2019m going to be blamed for this, I just know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be blamed,\u201d Kane said. He wouldn\u2019t allow it. Not ever again.</p><p>He shouldered the doors open, and scanned the area. He spotted a dark-haired warrior sliding into a seat, claiming a handful of cards, and knew beyond any doubt. Yes, that was indeed William the Ever Randy.</p><p>Had he talked to Taliyah and followed Kane here?</p><p>One female and three males formed a circle around William. Kane recognized each. White, the female, and her brothers, Red, Black and Green. In hell, Red and Black had rescued him from Disaster\u2019s minions, but rather than setting him free, they\u2019d bound him, hoping to learn his secrets\u2014whatever those were\u2014then kill him to prevent him from hooking up with their sister. As long as they\u2019d lived in hell, as many horrors as they\u2019d seen, they\u2019d come to hate demons with every fiber of their beings. It was a sentiment Kane shared. But they\u2019d made the mistake of lumping him in the same category as Disaster and that he resented.</p><p>Then, of course, Green and White had found him and walked away, leaving him to his agony until Tink had found him.</p><p>He owed all four a little payback. With knives.</p><p>The five-person gang smoked cigars and drained shots of whiskey as they studied their cards. Synda tugged from Kane\u2019s hold and skipped to the bar, where she ordered \u201cmy regular.\u201d Tink remained by his side, unsure.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Kane demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat else? You forced me!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cNot you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>William glanced up, grinned and waved him over, not the least surprised to see him. \u201cKane, my boy. We\u2019re playing hard. But not as hard as you, it seems. Two women? Really? I\u2019m shocked Kanie the Prude can manage so much estrogen at the same time.\u201d</p><p>White and her brothers looked over at him. In unison, the three guys pushed back their chairs and stood, glaring at him with murderous rage. White went back to studying her cards.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d William commanded easily. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time for a battle royale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Red insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhen I say so. I feel like finishing our game first.\u201d Though William wore a T-shirt that read DADD: Dudes Against Daughters Dating, and it was difficult to take him seriously, the three obeyed without protest. But even still, Kane was never taken out of their cross hairs.</p><p>Black cracked his knuckles. \u201cToday, demon, you die.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but grumble, \u201cI wish you had rotted in hell, I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the impression he doesn\u2019t like us,\u201d White said, blowing out a puff of smoke. She flipped her cascade of pale hair over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m very okay with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you playing?\u201d Synda asked, closing the distance and, without waiting for an invitation, plopping herself on Red\u2019s lap.</p><p>Uncharacteristically patient, the dark-haired male with eyes of the cruelest blue settled her more comfortably against him and began to explain the game.</p><p>In that moment, Kane knew she couldn\u2019t be the female for him, no matter that she was the keeper of Irresponsibility, and no matter what the Moirai had meant. He felt no sense of jealousy or possession.</p><p>Would there be consequences if she was the one and he blew her off? Maybe.</p><p>Did he care? No.</p><p>The woman in Danika\u2019s painting had been blonde. White was also blonde, but while William\u2019s daughter was lovely and strong, Kane absolutely despised her and that wasn\u2019t going to change.</p><p>Tink, however, continued to interest him greatly. But if she was the one for him, why did he continue to ache when he neared her? And who was the blonde in the painting? What did she mean to him?</p><p>Kane pulled up a chair beside William, and forced Tink to sit in his lap. He wanted her nearby, wanted his hands on her to prevent her from running, and wanted to ensure every man knew to keep his grubby paws off her. The action ensured Kane received all three at once. Screw the pain, he thought. Yeah, it had bothered him less today, but now, he just flat-out didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they get free of hell?\u201d he asked, even as Disaster screamed a protest about the seating arrangement.</p><p>William shrugged his massive shoulders before tossing his cards on the table. He faced Kane. \u201cI thought you could use a bit of help. You didn\u2019t want your friends knowing what you were up to, so my own brood of vipers was my only option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tells me nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor was it meant to. I sprang them early, and that\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But answer me this. Why are you playing cards with them instead of helping me?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug. \u201cWe heard about your engagement, and figured all was well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have checked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I could have, and I even thought about it. And it\u2019s the thought that counts, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>William claimed a cigar from White, and took a drag. Smoke puffed around him as he said, \u201cClearly I have more faith in you than you have in yourself. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ashes drifted from the cigar and should have fallen to the floor. Disaster ensured they fell on Kane\u2019s arm and leg, burning little holes in his clothing and singeing his skin.</p><p>Tink pressed a hand against her heart. \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet of you to say, sir. What a kind man you are.\u201d</p><p>Kane looked at her and did a double take. She was serious, he realized, and she was gazing at William as if he were everything she\u2019d ever wanted but had never really thought she could have. Razors of jealousy cut through Kane and calmed the demon.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear stories about him, too?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can just tell you\u2019re lucky to have a friend like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam\u2019s not sweet,\u201d he gritted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the bloody results of his temper tantrums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard of the bloody results of yours,\u201d she quipped.</p><p>William beamed up at her. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, because I have a proposition for you,\u201d she said to him.</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Kane squeezed her tight, silencing her.</p><p>\u201cGo on. I\u2019m listening,\u201d William prompted.</p><p>\u201cThe night I left you in that club, I went looking for a key into S\u00e9duire,\u201d Kane said before Tink could decide to talk over him. She was stubborn like that. \u201cAll the while, you clearly already had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I would have flashed here, but I had to buy one for my kiddies,\u201d the warrior said.</p><p>\u201cBy buy he means steal,\u201d Red said, not even bothering to look over at them. \u201cAnd by steal I mean kill for.\u201d</p> <p>Stated so simply, it was a testament to the hardness of the warrior\u2019s heart. To the savage lengths these men would go to get what they wanted. Bring it.</p><p>\u201cYour kids\u2014\u201d even saying the word in conjunction with the powerful warrior felt odd \u201c\u2014were okay with coming here and helping me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Grinning all over again, William waved the question away. \u201cYou heard the part about the battle royale, right? No, they weren\u2019t okay with helping you. I had to promise they could have a real down and dirty brawl with you, with blood and broken bones and maybe missing body parts. It\u2019s going to be great!\u201d</p><p>Tink melted against Kane, as if trying to use her body as a shield to protect him. The scratchy material of her uniform irritated his exposed skin. How could she stand wearing that thing?</p><p>Every glass on the table shattered, liquid spilling, warriors cursing.</p><p>\u201cWhen is this fight to take place?\u201d Kane asked, unperturbed.</p><p>\u201cHave you not been listening to anything I\u2019ve said?\u201d William dabbed at the wet stain on his leg. \u201cAfter the game.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cI would love nothing more than to engage your spawn in a showdown. Tink\u2014uh, I mean, Josephina\u2014and I will be back by the time your game is through.\u201d He actually wanted to take her shopping more than he wanted his revenge. She wasn\u2019t going to wear rags while everyone around her wore riches.</p> <p>Anyone who didn\u2019t know Kane might have thought he planned to run away. But William knew him better than that. \u201cAnd Tink is what you call her? Really? I would have chosen Ivanna B. Withwilly. What? It\u2019s a good, solid name.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t respond to that. Will just encourage him. \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d Kane gritted, \u201cthe princess is your responsibility. Don\u2019t let her get into any trouble.\u201d</p><p>William thought for a moment, nodded. \u201cYou do remember that I like to sleep with my responsibilities, right?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. He did. \u201cI also know you\u2019ll be tempted to throw her to the wolves once you get to know her, but don\u2019t harm her or let anyone else do so, either.\u201d The king would protest, and Tink would be liable.</p><p>\u201cSo...you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t mind if I seduce your future wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind, but I don\u2019t want you to go that far. She could get in trouble, and they\u2019ll try to make Tink bear the punishment. So, feel free to flirt with her, even make out a little, if she wants, but no more than that.\u201d Synda would be amused, and stay out of trouble.</p><p>Two birds, one kinky stone.</p><p>William placed a hand over his heart. \u201cI think you just moved to the top of my best-friend-forever list.\u201d</p><p>Kane rolled his eyes, stood, and held out his hand. \u201cYou got a revolver or semi I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorrow? No. Pay to use for a short time? Yes.\u201d The warrior slapped a .44 in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know the price tag later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Kane stashed the weapon at the back of his waist and ushered Tink out of the bar. Chairs scraped the ground, and he knew the three males, and maybe even White, had just stood, intending to come after him.</p><p>He heard William say, \u201cSettle down. He\u2019s coming back, and then he\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>JOSEPHINA HAD NO idea what was going on. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping? Without Synda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then the fight,\u201d he continued, as if she hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll be three against one,\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s hardly fair for William\u2019s kids, but they\u2019re insisting so what can I do?\u201d</p><p>They walked away from the black-haired devil with eyes so cold and Fae-like she\u2019d known he would deliver a deathblow to a female without pausing to ask questions. He was the answer to her problems. Now, however, she looked back at him with dismay.</p><p>He winked at her.</p><p>She scowled at him. He was okay with Kane getting hurt, and that made him unacceptable on every level.</p><p>Kane forced her to clear the door of the tavern and enter the daylight. The streets were a little more congested with horse-drawn carriages, and the pathways littered with chattering Opulens and the servants trailing a few feet behind them. The moment a gaze landed on Josephina, any gaze, it darted away. Voices tapered to quiet, and bodies inched out of reach, as if touching her would cause some kind of disease.</p><p>\u201cWhat is such a magnificent man doing with her?\u201d one of the Opulens said to her friend.</p><p>\u201cMales do like to slum it upon occasion.\u201d</p><p>Josephina tugged against Kane\u2019s grip, a puny motion, really, but one he allowed to slow him nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cShut your mouths before I do it for you,\u201d Kane snapped.</p><p>They shrieked at his vehemence and ran away.</p><p>Josephina blinked with surprise. \u201cWhy are we shopping without Synda?\u201d she asked, trying again.</p><p>Again he ignored the question. \u201cThey\u2019re treating you like a whore, and it\u2019s going to get them killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo them, I\u2019m a human servant without a mistress in sight. I have no business being in this part of town, alone with a man, unless I\u2019m getting boned by him on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>One of his brows arched. \u201cBoned. Who taught you to talk like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou! I studied you and your friends for years, remember, and picked up on your verbal cues.\u201d</p><p>He massaged the back of his neck, and she wasn\u2019t sure whether he was fighting a smile or a scowl. \u201cI hate the double standard here. Those same women would have stripped for me just last night, and I wouldn\u2019t have had to speak a word.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cUh, maybe we should get a bag for your ego. That might make it easier for you to carry it around.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched for several seconds\u2014definitely fighting a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of sight before I gouge out a few eyes and dangle them from a necklace I\u2019ll be presenting to you as a gift.\u201d</p><p>I would totally wear that.</p><p>They leaped back into motion. He bypassed the shoe shop, the ribbon store, the millinery and stopped in front of one of the dressmakers.</p><p>With his hand on the doorknob, he said, \u201cWhat do the Fae use as money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might find this hard to believe, but...money.\u201d</p><p>Another twitch, before his frown returned. \u201cWhat happens if someone touches the skin on your face or your shoulders?\u201d As he spoke, his gaze traced the areas in question\u2014and glinted with hunger. \u201cThe same thing that happens when they touch your hands?\u201d</p><p>Her ability to breathe abandoned her. Was he thinking about touching her here, now? Her blood heated, and her knees almost buckled. \u201cNo. My hands are the only problem.\u201d</p><p>Did that needy voice belong to her?</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had a mother, and she told me so. Back then, I couldn\u2019t control what happened with my hands\u2014\u201d and still might not be able to \u201c\u2014but nothing ever happened when she helped me dress.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand, his fingers closing in on her face. A tremor shook her. Any second now...</p><p>Two giggling girls walked past them.</p><p>Cursing, he dropped his arm to his side. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d He stalked into the small building, tugging her behind him. A bell tinkled overhead. The scent of floral perfume hit her first, the preferred fragrance of the Opulens and one she despised. Kane clearly felt the same. He wrinkled his nose and pursed his lips\u2014and he looked utterly adorable doing it.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to get this...whatever it is under control.</p><p>An older woman with silver hair and typical Fae eyes sauntered out from the back. She wore the current fashion, an elaborate gown of yellow silk, material twisted along the belled skirt to form a bouquet of roses. Her skin was lined from a life of hard work. Like Josephina, she was half Fae, half human, but unlike Josephina, she would age to her death. The human part of her was clearly stronger than the Fae.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rhoda, the owner,\u201d she said, the words slow and precise. Her expression brightened. \u201cAnd you\u2019re...you\u2019re...you. How may I help you, Lord Kane? Anything you desire is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her,\u201d Kane said, dragging Josephina forward and forcing her to stand in front of him. He placed his hands on her shoulders to ensure she wouldn\u2019t bolt, a tremble spilling from him and into her. \u201cBetter dressed.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was irrational, but once the initial shock wore off, she experienced a sudden urge to cry. She wasn\u2019t good enough as she was. Her father had told her. The queen had told her. Now, Kane\u2019s actions told her. The mighty Lord of the Underworld beloved by all didn\u2019t want to be seen with a servant wearing rags. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze met his in the mirror across the room, and he frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>I can hold it together. At least for a little while. Later, she would probably hide under her covers. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll walk behind you from now on. You won\u2019t have to be seen with me.\u201d</p> <p>His fingers dug into her. \u201cSweetheart, I don\u2019t like the way this material chafes your skin. It\u2019s too pretty to be streaked with red.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My.</p><p>KANE TIGHTENED HIS grip on Tink, and the trembling in his hands increased.</p><p>He wanted this woman. So bad.</p><p>He wished he were the man he used to be. He would have laughed and flirted with her, relaxing her. He would have charmed her, delighted her. She would have welcomed his attentions\u2014would have even begged for them. Instead, he\u2019d hurt her feelings in the worst way.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, let me do this for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She turned and faced him, peering up at him with those electric blues he should have found as unappealing as all the others, but...hers were different.</p><p>He liked that they changed colors with her moods. Liked that right now they were laced with multiple shades of blue. A mix of light blue, dark blue and something in between, creating a sort of poetry, a kaleidoscope of loveliness no one would ever be able to re-create.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful gesture, and I am beyond grateful, but you can\u2019t. I can\u2019t wear anything but my uniform. If I do, everyone will have permission to tear the clothing off me\u2014no matter where I am or who I\u2019m with.\u201d</p><p>And she would end up naked. As beautiful and naturally sensual as she was, the men around her would gawk, possibly reach out and touch her. Possibly even try to do more.</p><p>A bead of rage rolled through him, growing larger the deeper it reached.</p> <p>He looked to Rhoda. \u201cMake her a new uniform, just in softer, better quality material. And add pockets. Lots of pockets.\u201d He wanted her armed and at the ready at all times. Prepared\u2014as he hadn\u2019t been. \u201cCan you finish it within a couple hours? I want her to leave wearing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course, that\u2019s what I\u2019m known for\u201d was the reply. \u201cI hate to bring this up to so distinguished a customer, but...how will you pay, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this.\u201d He withdrew the wad of cash he\u2019d stuffed in his boot before beginning this journey.</p><p>Rhoda nodded. \u201cVery good. I\u2019ll take her back and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She stays within my sight at all times.\u201d</p><p>Tink flattened her gloved hands on his chest, and he responded instantly. His heart sped into a now familiar beat, and the increased flow of blood caused his body to ready for her. For all the things he wanted to do to her.</p><p>It was painful. Far more than before. It was pleasurable. Far more than he was willing to admit.</p><p>The need he felt for her...the edge of it sharpened daily, hourly, and if he wasn\u2019t careful, it would soon cut through him, severing the ties of his good sense, his better intentions, and his concern for the complications.</p> <p>Disaster roared with fury. Hate her! Leave her!</p><p>Kill you, Kane roared back.</p><p>Rolls of fabric tumbled from a table to the floor, the heavy spools hitting Kane\u2019s feet with a surprisingly harsh thud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Rhoda said, rushing to clean up the mess. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened.\u201d</p><p>Adamant, Josephina shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t disrobe in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d But he already knew the answer. They weren\u2019t lovers. They weren\u2019t even friends, not really. She would be vulnerable. He couldn\u2019t promise not to look. Like the men he\u2019d just disdained, he would look.</p><p>He should be ashamed. He\u2019d picked up on a bit of palace gossip and knew her mother, who\u2019d been considered a lowly human, had been the king\u2019s mistress. He knew her mother had been taunted, and suspected she had even been shunned. Any hint of impropriety had to remind Tink of her mother\u2019s anguish. Perhaps even make her feel she deserved the cruel words the two Opulens had uttered outside.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. That kind of thinking had to stop\u2014now.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou can. You will. Like I said, I don\u2019t want you out of my sight, even for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane...\u201d</p><p>A pleading tone. One he might have heeded if she had been underneath him\u2014have to get her underneath me. He gritted his teeth. \u201cKeep arguing with me. I\u2019ll find another way to change your mind. A far more intimate way.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down until his lips hovered just over hers. \u201cTry me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Red infused her cheeks and she glanced back at the shop owner.</p><p>How could he have forgotten about Rhoda?</p><p>Straightening, he met the older woman\u2019s shrewd stare. \u201cWhere she goes, I go, and that\u2019s non-negotiable.\u201d</p><p>A nod, and the woman turned away, saying, \u201cPlease, follow me.\u201d</p><p>Kane peered down at Tink. \u201cThis is for your own good, I promise you. I can\u2019t take the chance you\u2019ll leave, and I won\u2019t allow anyone to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, wonderful, but this is going to ruin my reputation,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWorse than it already has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d But it had to be done. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after men start seeing me as more than a blood slave?\u201d</p><p>A direct hit. Jealousy bloomed, hot and razor-sharp. \u201cThat happens, and men will start dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I need you to stop stalling.\u201d He gave her a little push, forcing her to move forward. He trailed behind her. They entered a small room in back, where another girl bustled about, moving drapes of fabric out of the way, revealing a chair for Kane and a stepstool for Josephina.</p><p>A stepstool perched in front of a three-sided mirror.</p><p>He eased into the cushioned seat. A pin stuck him in the back, and he grimaced.</p><p>In record time, Tink was stripped to bra and panties, and he noticed both garments were woven from plain white cotton. Molding to her. Hiding the details of her femininity from him...begging him to seek. He was unable to cloak his reaction, every inch of him hardening. Her body was a work of art, slender, yet so beautifully curved. Bronzed to perfection, without any kind of tan line. Toned from the amount of work she was forced to do every day.</p><p>He gripped the edges of his chair to keep from reaching for her.</p><p>He could help himself. He could.</p><p>The seamstress attempted to remove Tink\u2019s gloves, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThey stay.\u201d</p><p>Rhoda looked to him for confirmation.</p><p>He nodded. Maybe Tink could control her ability to absorb another person\u2019s strength and abilities, maybe she couldn\u2019t, but they wouldn\u2019t be taking any chances until he found out.</p><p>Tonight, he would find out.</p><p>She would have to put her hands on him. On his skin.</p><p>The arms of the chair cracked.</p><p>Tink was measured and fitted with different fabrics to discover which one felt the best to her. Once the decision was made, the two seamstresses began the arduous process of cutting and sewing the dress.</p><p>Toward the end, Tink\u2019s stomach began to growl.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked, with a tinge of guilt. He should have fed her before bringing her here. Being classified as a servant, she probably wasn\u2019t given proper meals.</p><p>Disaster chuckled with delight.</p><p>Never again, Kane thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d she replied, still not daring to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI have food,\u201d Rhoda said, and waved her assistant away.</p><p>The girl puttered from the room, returning several minutes later with a rolling cart piled with sandwiches, cookies and a pitcher of tea.</p><p>Tink appeared dazed. \u201cFor me? Really?\u201d</p><p>How eager she sounded, when such treatment should have been an everyday occurrence for her.</p><p>Should, should, should. He was already sick of the word. From now on, he was going to take such good care of her.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Holding the new, as yet unfinished dress to her chest with one hand, she reached out with the other and claimed a sandwich. He watched her as she ate, the way her eyes closed in surrender, the way a smile curled the corners of her lips, the way she chewed and savored.</p><p>So lovely. So sensual, even without meaning to be. So mine...</p><p>His skin prickled, and maybe he moved. Maybe he spoke. Her gaze lifted to meet his. Her lips parted on a startled exhalation. Could she see the rawness of his need?</p><p>\u201cKane.\u201d A breathy entreaty.</p><p>In that moment, the cry of the demon ceased to matter. The past faded, leaving only the present...the future, and the unstoppable tide of the pleasure to come. Every bone vibrated. He needed to get inside her. Here. Now.</p><p>It would be agony.</p><p>It would be ecstasy.</p><p>Tension coiled low in his gut, only to spring apart and jolt him into a stand. \u201cLeave us,\u201d he said, his voice a broken rasp.</p><p>No questions. No protests. The two seamstresses flittered from the room, shutting the door behind them.</p><p>The teapot shattered on the tray, dark liquid spilling everywhere.</p><p>Tink didn\u2019t seem to notice, was too busy watching him. \u201cI-is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Silent, he stalked toward her. A predator with a purpose. He was done resisting. Done thinking about all the reasons why not. Today, he was taking something.</p><p>Perhaps sensing the dark, greedy urges driving him, she straightened with a snap. Her breathing quickened. \u201cKane,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTell me to stop.\u201d He stood a mere heartbeat away, their gazes locked together, trapped. Nothing else would halt the madness.</p><p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He breathed her in. The scent of cleaning supplies had faded, and she smelled of rosemary and mint again, sweet and innocent. Perhaps she could finally wash away the taint inside him. Or burn it away with passion\u2014he could feel the intense heat radiating off her body. Perhaps she could melt the ice that had taken residence inside him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps she could save him.</p><p>She swallowed, licked her lips. \u201cWait.

It\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll hurt her, I swear I will.</p><p>Kane ignored the demon, pressing ever closer to Tink.</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d she said, a question when she\u2019d probably meant it to be a statement.</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d Unless... \u201cHave you ever been with a man?\u201d</p><p>She gave a slow shake of her head.</p> <p>That answer should have ended this.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>He should walk away.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Possessiveness clawed at him, so sharp, so deep, he knew he would feel the wounds for the rest of eternity and be glad for it. He brushed his fingertips along her jawbone, and oh, she was just as soft and electrifying as he\u2019d imagined. She nearly unmanned him when she leaned into the touch, seeking more intimate contact. He gave it to her, cupping the back of her neck, fisting her glorious hair, and forcing her gaze to stay with his.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let myself take you\u2014\u201d not here, not now \u201c\u2014but I want something from you. Need it.\u201d</p> <p>A tremor swept through her. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Disaster banged against the sides of Kane\u2019s skull. I\u2019ll hurt her. I will. Hate her so much.</p><p>He gnashed his teeth. Shut up! You hate her because she\u2019s the only relationship I can have that won\u2019t end in disaster, and that\u2014</p><p>There it was. The answer. The reason the demon hurt him whenever Tink neared. She was a blessing and not a curse. Of course the demon wanted to be rid of her.</p><p>She really was Kane\u2019s \u201cmine,\u201d just as his instincts had screamed.</p><p>His. And not the demon\u2019s.</p><p>He looked into her mesmerizing eyes, and felt a swell in his heart. His fingers hadn\u2019t abandoned the silkiness of her hair, and were now holding on to her as if she were a lifeline, causing her neck to arch. He should probably loosen his grip. He didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. He wanted to own her, even in the smallest way, whatever the future held, and this was how he\u2019d go about it.</p><p>\u201cLet me kiss you, Tinker Bell.\u201d</p> <p>She wet her lips, and whispered, \u201cWhat about Synda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Synda.\u201d</p><p>And now, he was done talking. He swooped in, not bothering with preliminaries or gentleness, but thrusting his tongue inside her mouth, then against hers, unleashing all the intensity of the need driving him. She softened against him despite the ferocity of his claiming, and welcomed him fully. The utter sweetness of her taste stoked the fire inside him from a blaze to an inferno.</p><p>She held nothing back, leaning into him, wrapping her arms around his neck and giving herself up to his total domination.</p><p>And dominate he did.</p><p>Taking. Giving. What he wanted was too powerful to contain. It was overwhelming. Shattering. A connection more binding than flesh and bone. Undeniable. Uncontrollable. He crackled with new life as he fed her one frantic kiss after the other.</p><p>And still he yearned to give her more. He jerked her so firmly against him, not even air separated them. His passion was insatiable, demanding her total acceptance, and an unending obsession. More than she was probably willing to give, more than she\u2019d probably ever expected to give. But he demanded without mercy, forcing her tongue to keep pace, and her body to grind against his.</p><p>He would meld her to his soul.</p><p>One of his hands slid down the bare skin of her upper arm, then down her side, to the sumptuous curve of her waist, then hooked beneath her thighs and lifted her. He spun her and strode forward, until her back pressed against the wall. Hands now free to roam, he jerked at the hem of her gown, untangling the material from her legs. Automatically she wound herself around him, his body becoming an anchor for hers.</p><p>It nearly slayed him.</p><p>He\u2019d never had more reason to despise intimacy, and yet he\u2019d never craved it more.</p><p>The harder he kissed her, the more she rubbed against him, his own little kitty, and the more she rubbed against him, the more he wanted their clothing out of his way. Every hated piece. Her skin was like heated silk, and he was desperate for more. All. Her taste and scent were his dream of home...his...yes, yes. His, and no one else\u2019s. He needed to put his mark on every inch of her.</p><p>She moaned, and he lifted his head long enough to peer down at her passion-hazed features. Her beauty was a fantasy he\u2019d never dared have. Her lips were swollen and red. Moist. Perfect.</p><p>Her eyelids slowly parted. \u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>She was panting just as forcefully as he was.</p><p>He had to have this woman. And he would. He dove back down for another taste. He would rip away her new dress, and the underclothing. He would toss her on the floor. He wouldn\u2019t bother removing all of his clothing. He would just undo his pants. He wanted her too badly to waste time stripping\u2014no matter how badly he craved the skin-to-skin contact. That would come later. After the burn of the first time had been extinguished.</p><p>Now, he would spread her legs, and bury himself so deep inside her.</p><p>\u2014no, no!</p><p>Disaster\u2019s piercing shriek claimed his attention for one poisoned second.</p><p>That was enough. He stilled, tried to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cKane.\u201d A moan escaped Tink as her glove-covered fingertips scraped against his back.</p><p>Hands...all over him...</p><p>Suddenly feeling like a caged animal, he straightened. He set her back on her feet, his head swimming. She had no idea how close she\u2019d come to losing her virginity in a dress shop.</p><p>The demon had somehow broken past whatever barriers Tink had built, intending to taunt Kane with the reminder. Instead, the creature had done him a favor.</p><p>Tink traced the seam of her lips with trembling fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to explain and have to deal with the humiliation, but he owed her, and he would pay. Whatever the cost. He tried to get his breathing under control. \u201cIn hell...the demons...forced me to...\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fused, but not before he caught a glimpse of her pity.</p><p>Pity.</p><p>He hated pity.</p><p>This was what he\u2019d feared, however. Making a fool of himself sexually. Dealing with the aftermath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened to you,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish such a fate on my worst enemy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to let her know he\u2019d heard her, but offered no more than that.</p><p>\u201cBut...about the kiss. We can\u2019t do that again,\u201d she said with a tremor. \u201cWhether you want Synda or not, you\u2019re engaged to her, and I won\u2019t be the other woman. Ever. Not for anyone, not even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Not because of his supposed engagement\u2014but because he had nothing to offer her. As he\u2019d known, but ignored. As he\u2019d just proven.</p><p>He hated this situation, too. Hated his mind, and his emotions, and yes, the weakness he would have denied with his dying breath.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, we have to\u2014wait. I\u2019m right?\u201d She shook her head, as if to dislodge the thoughts, dark locks of hair dancing over her shoulders. \u201cNever mind. I only ever want to kiss my man, and that\u2019s not you, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Cheeks reddening, she said, \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t want a man. We would...you know, and I would have children, and the king would want to use them the way he uses me, and I would never allow my own flesh and blood to suffer in such a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be a warrior, and cruel to my bones, but I understand.\u201d She was protective of what she considered hers. Fiercely so. It was admirable. But hope had been stolen from her, exactly as it had been stolen from him. She couldn\u2019t see herself in the future. Couldn\u2019t see herself happy or content\u2014or even safe.</p><p>Every day, she broke his heart a little more.</p><p>Disaster gave up screaming and began growling. Overhead, a light bulb shorted. The crack in the floor widened to such an astonishing degree it could no longer be ignored. The entire building shook. Kane stepped away from Tink and the temptation she presented.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she asked, glancing around.</p><p>\u201cA revolt.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled, creating even more distance between them, and the commotion died down. \u201cThat was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He could have lied. He wanted to lie. But he said, \u201cYeah. That was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen not really you,\u201d she said, baffling him. She understood the difference between the man and the evil. \u201cHe\u2019s acting up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kane repeated.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all he\u2019s got?\u201d She laughed, a sound as pure as Christmas bells. \u201cHow pathetic.\u201d</p><p>Disaster snarled inside his head, and Kane grinned. The woman dreaded the things her family could do to her, and yet she was fearless in the face of a demon.</p><p>Desire stormed through him all over again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have the seamstresses finish your dress so we can return to the bar,\u201d he said, turning away from her. \u201cI have a fight to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not on board with that fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotta happen eventually. The guys want to stop me from dating their sister.\u201d</p><p>All of her humor drained, leaving her features pinched. \u201cWell, by all means. Let\u2019s get you to that fight so you can date whoever you wish.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>THE NEW UNIFORM fit Josephina perfectly, the material soft against her skin, a divine caress rather than an irritating scratch. She loved it. But she had no idea what to think about the man responsible.</p><p>He was cold. But he was kind.</p><p>He was fierce. But he was tender.</p><p>He was cruel. But he was sweet.</p><p>If she weren\u2019t careful, she would become smitten with him\u2014and end up heartbroken. He couldn\u2019t be trusted. He\u2019d kissed her, but he had no plans to break his engagement to Synda. He\u2019d kissed her, but he was thinking about dating another woman, the blonde from the tavern.</p><p>How many females did he have dangling at the end of his beautiful rope? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too many. Obviously.</p><p>And Josephina had almost become one of them.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to erect a wall of ice against him.</p> <p>She\u2019d expected her first experience with passion to be gentle\u2014if ever she\u2019d weakened enough to succumb to a male\u2019s charm. She\u2019d expected a hesitant exploration, cool, a little tame, and yet there\u2019d been unbearable heat, necessary heat, and her every pulse point had turned into a wild drum. A frightening beat, but oh, so thrilling.</p><p>Kane had owned her mouth, had staked a claim and demanded a response, and she had been unable to deny him, unable to hold back, not wanting to hold back. He\u2019d tasted of whiskey she hadn\u2019t seen him drink, and he\u2019d intoxicated her. His hands...in her hair...on her arms...her waist...he\u2019d caressed and he\u2019d squeezed and he\u2019d left a white-hot trail of need in his wake.</p><p>For the first time in her life, she\u2019d felt alive. She\u2019d had something to look forward to, something worth the hardships she faced. But then he\u2019d pulled away, as if she had disgusted him, and yes, she\u2019d wanted to cry.</p><p>Knowing the disgust had nothing to do with her assuaged her. But it also made her want to cry. What he\u2019d endured in hell had left him scarred, and he needed to move slowly, to wrap his head around the things his body was feeling, but he didn\u2019t want to move more slowly with her. So, fine. Whatever. The other two women were welcome to him.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, Josephina kept pace beside him. He stopped in front of the Devil\u2019s Punchbowl and met her gaze. \u201cThe Fae can pretend they\u2019re better than you, but that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing. Pretending. There\u2019s no one better than you.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t wait for her response, but shoved his way inside the building.</p><p>Reeling, she followed after him. What had...why... Surely her translation from English to...uh, English had screwed with the essence of his meaning. He\u2019d just lavishly praised her, even though he didn\u2019t want her? Something had to be off with her thinking.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should forget the fight and we should go somewhere to talk about our\u2014\u201d My poor eyes. Wearing only her undergarments, Synda was dancing on top of a table, her gown swinging from her upraised hand. The men hoping to pummel Kane into blood and pulp circled her, cheering and clapping.</p><p>At least the rest of the patrons had cleared out, leaving no other witnesses to the princess\u2019s behavior. Still. Josephina would be penalized for this. Lewd acts among the Opulens were encouraged, often rewarded, but this was a common bar and these men were...she wasn\u2019t sure what they were.</p><p>The blonde\u2014the one Kane wasn\u2019t supposed to date\u2014sat in the back corner, eating grapes, unconcerned by the chaos around her.</p><p>Josephina disliked her immediately.</p> <p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Kane said, sounding calm.</p><p>All four males looked over at him. Three lost their smiles. The other\u2014William\u2014just grinned wider.</p><p>Silence reigned...until Synda spotted him and sighed. \u201cIs the fun over?\u201d she asked with a pout.</p><p>The grinning warrior stalked forward. He had dark hair and the electric blue eyes of the Fae, though he clearly wasn\u2019t Fae. The power humming from him was too...unique. It was also the strongest she\u2019d ever encountered. One touch, and she suspected the man\u2019s energy would cause her body to combust.</p><p>\u201cCandy Kane,\u201d William said. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded in greeting. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s Ivanna B.,\u201d William said to Josephina. He held out his hand, intending to clasp hers and perhaps bring it to his lips for a kiss.</p><p>What did that name even mean?</p> <p>Before she could reach out, Kane batted the man\u2019s arm away with enough force to crack bone. \u201cNo touching.\u201d The fierce warning in his tone echoed from the walls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing my gloves,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not him I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>Her?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll share your soon-to-be bride, but not her servant,\u201d the other man said good-naturedly. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird at all.\u201d To the others, he called, \u201cClear a space. The battle is about to begin.\u201d</p><p>The men rushed to obey. Soon the tables and chairs were pushed against the walls, leaving a circular clearing. Synda was escorted to the grape-eating female. Facing Kane, the man with pale hair cracked his knuckles. The bald one leaned his head left, right, aligning his spine. The dark-haired one withdrew two hooked blades.</p><p>Trembling, Josephina fisted the skirt of her soft new gown.</p><p>William paced in front of the eager combatants, saying, \u201cFirst rule of Teach Kane a Lesson: you don\u2019t talk about Teach Kane a Lesson. Second rule of Teach Kane a Lesson: you don\u2019t talk about Teach Kane a Lesson. Third rule of Teach Kane a Lesson: if someone taps out, you just keep fighting. Fourth rule of Teach Kane a Lesson: there are no rules. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Kane cleared his throat, gaining William\u2019s attention. \u201cIs it okay to kill them, or would you rather they survive?\u201d</p><p>The man tilted his head to the side, as if he were actually pondering the question.</p><p>\u201cAlive,\u201d finally came the response. \u201cBut close to dying wouldn\u2019t be a terrible thing.\u201d</p><p>Uh...hello, confusion. Whose side was he on?</p><p>The males were confused, too, and hurtled curses at William.</p><p>The warrior shrugged, unaffected, saying to Kane, \u201cI love them and I hate them. They\u2019re a joy and a pain. I can\u2019t ever decide if I want to hug them or choke them. Right now, they\u2019re in need of an attitude adjustment, and I think you\u2019re the man for the job.\u201d</p><p>Kane led Josephina to the table where the blonde woman and Synda waited. \u201cWhite,\u201d he said, a warning. He gently pushed Josephina into a chair. \u201cWhat I said to your dad goes for you. Don\u2019t touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d the woman\u2014White\u2014said. \u201cWho is this girl to you?\u201d</p><p>Josephina\u2019s ears twitched, as she waited to hear his answer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your concern,\u201d he finally replied, disappointing her. \u201cJust keep your hands to yourself or bad things will happen.\u201d</p><p>The woman shrugged. \u201cVery well. My problem is with you, not her.\u201d She traced a grape over her mouth, licked away the juice. \u201cI won\u2019t allow the supposed fates to dictate my future, and if that means getting rid of you, I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d</p><p>The fates\u2014the Moirai. Three women with an eternal case of verbal diarrhea. Josephina hated the hobags with every fiber of her being. Because of them, she had helped destroy her mother.</p><p>And they thought Kane and this White person would end up together?</p><p>Josephina pressed her tongue to the roof of her mouth. I won\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Hitting doesn\u2019t involve words.</p><p>\u201cSo kind of you, White,\u201d Kane finally said, his tone cutting. His gaze moved to Josephina and stayed. He leaned over and planted his hands on the arms of her chair, caging her, surrounding her. \u201cYou are to stay put. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cWhat reason do I have to do what you say? You and your hot-and-cold attitude are nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his nose against hers. \u201cI\u2019m something all right, but I respect your fight against it.\u201d</p><p>She...had no reply.</p><p>\u201cCandy Kane,\u201d William called, as she tried not to shiver. Kane\u2019s nearness was addling her brain. \u201cThe clock\u2019s ticking.\u201d</p><p>Kane stayed just where he was. \u201cYou were right before, you know. We do need to talk, iron some things out.\u201d</p><p>A lump grew in her throat, and she nodded. She found herself saying, \u201cBe careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve got something to look forward to?\u201d His gaze dropped to her lips, lingered. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d He straightened, ending the comfort\u2014and sensuality\u2014of the contact.</p><p>What did he have to look forward to? Their talk? Or, as that parting look had hinted at, another kiss?</p><p>Melting...</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Synda asked, squirming in her seat. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>Kane flicked her an impatient glance. \u201cYou\u2019ll behave for the first time in your life. After the fight, I might do the world a favor and put you over my knee to spank the poor judgment right out of you. I guess we\u2019ll find out together.\u201d</p><p>Red sprang into the princess\u2019s eyes, her expression hardening. \u201cSay something like that again, and I\u2019ll cut out your tongue while you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d</p><p>No longer peering at her, Kane reached out blindly and patted her on top of the head. \u201cI\u2019d probably be scared if you actually knew how to keep your promises.\u201d</p><p>A rumble rose from Synda\u2019s chest, and spewed out her mouth, the sound more animal than Fae. Josephina had heard the sound before\u2014right before the princess had set the stable on fire.</p><p>\u201cKane!\u201d William snapped. \u201cSometime today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d The moisture in Josephina\u2019s mouth dried as she held up her gloved hands and wiggled her fingers to gain his attention. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hasty to count me out. I could...you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned to her, adamant. \u201cNone of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Once again he got in her face. Only this time, he wasn\u2019t gentle about it. \u201cDon\u2019t push on this. I will never willingly put you in harm\u2019s way. Plus, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d end up with.\u201d</p><p>Their powers, he meant. \u201cWhatever I take, it\u2019ll be temporary.\u201d More than that, the men might do what Kane had refused to do: kill her.</p><p>She would die. Finally. Never again would she have to deal with her father or the queen or her brother or her sister. There would be no more whippings, no more shunnings, no more punishments of any kind. But...but...</p><p>I don\u2019t want to die.</p><p>The realization shocked her to her bones. Knowing the bliss of Kane\u2019s kiss, she only wanted more. Like, his hands on her bare skin next time, touching her...everywhere. Like, his voice in her ear, whispering all the things he planned to do to her. Like, his body delivering on every single promise. She wanted... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything he had to give.</p><p>\u201cI want you safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the cost.\u201d</p><p>Melting faster...</p> <p>He straightened and faced the men. \u201cEveryone clear on the rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear for hours now.\u201d From the blond.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d From the dark-haired one. \u201cYou should have stayed in hell. You would\u2019ve had an easier life\u2014and death.\u201d</p><p>A nod from the bald one.</p><p>Kane grinned without a shred of humor. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to prove you wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDing, ding,\u201d William said.</p><p>And just like that, the battle was on. The males converged on each other, becoming a tangle of fists and legs and weapons.</p><p>Synda cheered, \u201cGo, Kane, go!\u201d as if the two hadn\u2019t almost come to blows seconds before.</p><p>White snapped her teeth at the girl. \u201cYou should cheer for my brothers. You just had sex with two of them in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. It meant nothing.\u201d</p><p>Josephina cringed, knowing she would be punished for this transgression, as well. But okay, all right, she would deal. Right now, Kane was more important\u2014and he\u2019d just vanished from her sight, a black cloud appearing and surrounding the men. Her hand covered her mouth to silence her cry of dismay. Grunts and groans and the click of metal against metal filled the air. Her blood chilled. What was happening in there?</p> <p>She pushed to shaky legs, took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d William joined the women at the table. He grabbed one of White\u2019s grapes and tossed the little fruit in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Josephina croaked, unable to pull her attention away from the battle.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re planning. The boys will attack anyone inside their force field, and Kane will punish them for it. They may not survive, and like I told Kane, a part of me wants them to survive.\u201d</p><p>That \u201cforce field\u201d raised the fine hairs on the back of her neck. It possessed some sort of electrical charge, attempting to pull the energy out of her the way she often pulled the energy out of others.</p><p>Was it draining Kane?</p><p>\u201cLet her join,\u201d White said. \u201cShe\u2019ll die, and I\u2019ll have an open playing field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have an open playing field if you were the last woman on earth,\u201d Josephina snapped.</p> <p>\u201cAn open playing field?\u201d William growled. \u201cI thought you wanted Kane dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposedly Kane is my destined mate, and my destined mate has no business lusting after another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you cared nothing about destiny,\u201d William roared.</p><p>Josephina didn\u2019t hear White\u2019s reply, didn\u2019t care to; she was too busy marching forward. Whether Kane realized it or not, he needed her. He could take those men, but she doubted he could take the cloud. Look how easily he\u2019d fallen when pitted against her.</p><p>When she reached the darkened dome, she removed her gloves and reached out. Lightning jolted through her, startling her. Her bones throbbed, and her blood fizzed, but she pushed through. The darkness soon cleared, and she realized she was standing in the midst of a raging battle. Blood was splattered across the floor. And Kane\u2019s opponents...they\u2019d become monsters.</p><p>One had horns. Or rather, what should have been horns. They were shredded and bleeding.</p><p>One had wings. Or rather, what used to be wings. They were misshapen and bleeding.</p><p>One had scales. Or rather, what were probably scales. They were ripped out in patches and bleeding.</p><p>All had fangs and claws.</p><p>What...how...</p><p>Kane stood in place, wielding two daggers with perfect precision. He contorted his body left and right, forward and backward, avoiding impact with his enemies. He was...winning, despite the cloud and...and...despite the fact that the floor was cracking beneath his feet?</p><p>The demon was acting up again. Why? So he\u2019d lose?</p><p>Oh, yes. Defeat would be considered a disaster, after all.</p><p>Thank goodness Kane knew what he was doing. When his feet caught on one of the cracks, he tilted forward, going with it, rolling into the motion, allowing his weapons to slash against his opponents with more force.</p><p>Relief speared her. She backed away.</p><p>He must have sensed her, though, because his gaze found her across the distance. His eyes widened, and a roar split his lips. He gave up his offensive stance to stalk toward her. A mistake. One of the monsters nailed him in the chin, a brutal slash of claws, slicing his skin and leaving him bleeding.</p><p>Josephina didn\u2019t think about her next actions. She launched into motion, throwing herself into the monster closest to her. He went down with a moan the moment she touched him. A shocking amount of strength poured through her, more than her little body had ever had to hold, but she twisted to reach the second one...the third one...</p><p>On the heels of the strength came darkness, such terrible darkness. Worse than what had come with Kane. Then silence. Josephina stumbled. What\u2019s happening? She was falling...falling... No, no, no! I\u2019m back inside the Never-ending.</p><p>A sharp pain tore through her head before blackness took over.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>TORIN, KEEPER OF Disease, paced the floor of the room where he\u2019d last seen Cameo. Days had passed since she\u2019d vanished, leaving all of the artifacts behind, but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what had happened here. Her gaze had locked with Maddox\u2019s. She had reached out. Then, she had been gone, with no trace of her remaining. Where was she? What had happened?</p><p>The other warriors had come and gone, inspecting the room before stalking out to hunt down anyone who might know how to save a woman Torin loved with all of his heart. Not as a lover, though they had once tried to go that route, but as his best friend.</p><p>If he would die for his friends, he would kill for his best friend.</p><p>And yet, Torin was stuck here. He could do nothing but wait. He\u2019d already checked online, but the information he desired wasn\u2019t out there. Or, if it was, he hadn\u2019t yet found it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t leave the fortress, because he couldn\u2019t risk touching anyone. Were his skin to accidentally brush against the skin of another immortal, that immortal would then carry the taint of Torin\u2019s curse, infecting anyone they touched with disease. Were his skin to brush against the skin of a human, that human would sicken and die\u2014but not before passing the disease on to others. A plague would erupt. Again.</p><p>Yeah. He\u2019d once lusted after a woman he hadn\u2019t been meant to have. He\u2019d rescued her from the hands of his enemy\u2014they\u2019d noticed his interest in her. Then, he\u2019d removed his gloves and touched her, desperate for contact. Skin-to-skin. Warmth to warmth. He\u2019d thought she would be the exception, that his yearning for her would somehow overcome his handicap.</p><p>Her eyes had closed, and her lips had curled into a small grin, and pleasure had overwhelmed him. But then she\u2019d sickened. Then her family and friends had sickened. Then they had all died\u2014along with thousands of others.</p><p>Now, when Cameo needed him...</p><p>He was worse than useless. He was a failure. He hadn\u2019t gotten here soon enough to save her, and he couldn\u2019t race to her rescue. Frustration and fury burned in his chest, a toxic combination adding to the poison in his blood.</p><p>He stopped in front of the Cage of Compulsion. Two of the artifacts were inside, exactly where they\u2019d fallen when Cameo vanished. The Rod was propped outside, against the corner. If he did what Cameo had done, could he get to where she was? To where Viola was?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Probably.</p><p>Worth the risk, he thought.</p><p>He stepped forward and curled his fingers over the edge of the cage.</p><p>\u201cHey! What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d a voice said from behind him.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>Anya, the incarnation of Anarchy and girlfriend of the keeper of Death, leaned against the door frame, her arms crossed over her middle. She was tall and blonde and one of the most beautiful females ever created; she was also one of the most troublesome, preferring chaos over calm. Today she wore a skintight blue minidress that looked\u2014wait, it was painted on.</p><p>Sweet heaven.</p><p>\u201cBetter question. Are you going to tell Lucien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he took off this morning to escort a few souls to the hereafter, he failed to wake me with a kiss and tell me he loved me. Therefore, I\u2019m currently giving him the silent treatment.\u201d</p><p>And Lucien was probably loving it. Not that Torin would ever say such a thing aloud.</p><p>He changed the subject, saying, \u201cNew look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew form of torture for Lucien. He\u2019ll never not kiss me again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably thought you\u2019d demand more than a kiss from him, when he wouldn\u2019t have the time to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always time to give it to me.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to smile, and the thread of humor, even as small as it was, surprised him. But then, Anya had that effect on people. \u201cWant to try and talk me out of this?\u201d he said, motioning to the artifacts.</p><p>\u201cNah. I want Cameo brought back as much as you do. But if you die, well, I call dibs on your room. I\u2019m thinking about getting a pet that will eat Viola\u2019s devil, and my baby will need a place all her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, as if she\u2019d expected nothing less. \u201cJust know that I\u2019ve always enjoyed looking at you. I\u2019ll miss your sexy face.\u201d</p><p>The smile bloomed to full wattage, unstoppable. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed looking at you, too.\u201d</p><p>She blew him a kiss.</p><p>Because he carried the All-key inside his body, he was able to unlock anything with only a touch. The cage was no exception. He entered. The door slammed shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cI feel like this is the perfect time to admit I\u2019m the Cage\u2019s owner,\u201d Anya said, tapping her chin and eyeing him thoughtfully. \u201cCronus gave it to me. I could command you to strip and you\u2019d have to obey.\u201d</p><p>Torin ignored her, looking over the painting. A man\u2019s office. A glass display case. Artifacts. One of them was a small box made of bones. Pandora\u2019s box? Maybe. Why had he not noticed it before? He picked up the Cloak and draped the material over his shoulders, just as he\u2019d watched Cameo do. Then, he took off his glove, reached out and gripped the Rod. But... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t disappointing,\u201d Anya said drily. \u201cSee you later, Disease.\u201d</p><p>She left him alone in the room, and he cursed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want my disease inside you?\u201d he growled at the Rod. \u201cHuh? Is that it? Do you get to pick and choose the ones you accept?\u201d</p> <p>He tossed the artifact on the floor, exited the Cage, and, disgusted, followed the path Anya had taken.</p><p>CAMEO FELT AS though she was trapped inside a washing machine, being swirled and churned this way and that, round and round, never pausing. How many days...months...years...had passed since she\u2019d climbed inside the Cage of Compulsion and touched the Paring Rod? She wasn\u2019t sure. Time had ceased to exit.</p><p>\u201cViola!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>She bumped into something solid\u2014something that grunted and cursed. Definitely not Viola. Someone other than the goddess was with her in this dark, winding pit?</p><p>Hard bands shackled her waist, jerking her against a male...yes...and he had to be eight feet tall, and as wide as a building. He surrounded her with his heat and his scent...sandalwood and peat smoke...and even stopped her from spinning.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded in a deep, rumbling voice she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cCameo,\u201d she managed to grit out. She wished she could see him, but was kind of glad she couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t see her, either, so he couldn\u2019t know how close she was to vomiting. Her stomach hurt. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazarus.\u201d Warm breath caressed the top of her head, ruffling strands of her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He knew what she meant. \u201cThe Paring Rod. We\u2019re trapped inside it. You were hurtling through it\u2014and you\u2019re still being pulled toward something.\u201d His tone was strained, as if all of his strength was needed to hold on to her. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep you in place, and believe me, I\u2019m as tough as they come, but whatever\u2019s got you wants you desperately, because I\u2019m being dragged with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let go.\u201d Translation: save yourself.</p> <p>\u201cUh, that would be a no. If you\u2019re being pulled out, I\u2019d kill my own kin to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be...dangerous,\u201d she said. Breathe. Just breathe.</p><p>\u201cThere are hundreds of people trapped in here and no one has ever escaped. If there\u2019s a chance that is what\u2019s happening with you, I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d</p><p>No. Not yet. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to search. \u201cI can\u2019t leave without a little blonde who\u2019s in love with herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, female, but you don\u2019t get a choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold, practically flattening her lungs.</p><p>\u201cAir...need...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not me,\u201d he gritted, sounding just as winded as she was. \u201cWalls...closing in.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the pressure eased. Cameo slammed into something solid\u2014a floor, maybe...yes, a floor, she thought, patting the area around her. It was cold, solid.</p><p>\u201cThe bottom of the Rod?\u201d she panted. That would mean the Rod had shrunk her to thimble size, and she wasn\u2019t okay with that.</p><p>Lazarus released her and rolled away. \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the confines of the Rod, and this isn\u2019t part of it. I think we did the impossible and escaped.\u201d</p><p>His excitement was contagious. Maybe Viola had escaped, too.</p><p>Blinking to clear her line of vision, Cameo clambered to her hands and knees. With the action, the urge to vomit increased, the dizziness careened out of control annnd\u2014yes, she spewed the contents of her stomach all over the man\u2019s shoes.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she thought she heard him say.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t batted her away.</p><p>\u201cI need you to move now,\u201d he said. \u201cI want these shoes off.\u201d</p><p>Inhale. Good. Now exhale. Several minutes passed before she was able to lift her head enough to see what was around her. An office. The one from the painting, she realized. There was a desk piled high with papers. There was a glass display case brimming with artifacts. And there was Pandora\u2019s box.</p><p>So close.</p><p>For the moment, Viola was forgotten. Cameo pushed to a stand and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cHow did the Rod send us here?\u201d She took a step forward. And where was here, exactly?</p><p>Lazarus chucked his shoes. He moved beside her and latched onto her arm, his grip strong, unbreakable. She turned to face him\u2014and gaped. He wasn\u2019t as tall as she\u2019d imagined, but he was still a giant. He had a muscle mass even the biggest of her friends had yet to achieve. But it was his face that truly arrested her attention.</p><p>He. Was. Gorgeous. He wouldn\u2019t have to speak to a woman to gain her interest. He\u2019d just have to look at her. He had black hair, black eyes. Fathomless eyes, really. A proud nose, a stubbornly square chin. Lips the color of rubies, and the perfect contrast to all that dark. His skin was bronzed to perfection.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You\u2019re a warrior. Act like one. She tugged from his hold, and the only reason she succeeded was because he let her; she knew it. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you before.\u201d</p><p>Strider was dating, or whatever, Kaia the Wing Shredder, and Strider had beheaded Lazarus to protect her. He was the consort of another Harpy, one even more annoying than Kaia, who was desperate to avenge his death.</p><p>\u201cHow are you alive?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy body was destroyed, but not my spirit. It was trapped inside the Rod all this time.\u201d</p><p>Trapped. Past tense. They\u2019d really gotten out? \u201cIf your body was destroyed, why are you solid to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour body was destroyed as well, the moment you entered the Rod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can make us both another one, just as soon as I get home.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t panic. She would believe him. She didn\u2019t like the alternative.</p><p>\u201cYou have a weapon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Did she? She patted herself down and came up with...nothing. Silent, refusing to admit the lack, she raised her chin. \u201cYou want to fight me or something? Before you answer that, you should probably know I lack any sort of softer emotions and I\u2019ll do things to you that you wouldn\u2019t wish on your worst enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want to fight, but you\u2019re not the opponent I\u2019m jonesing for\u2014even though I\u2019m intrigued by the things you say you can do. I want to fight him.\u201d Lazarus nodded to a place behind her. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to work together to defeat him. I\u2019m good, probably the best and strongest warrior you\u2019ll never have the pleasure to meet, but we just happen to be in the same room as the only male ever to beat me.\u201d</p><p>Him, he\u2019d said. The skinny red-eyed male she\u2019d seen after draping the Cloak over her head and peering at the painting? And the guy had once beaten Lazarus? He must have powers the painting hadn\u2019t revealed. Dread washed through her as she turned, but...she couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see him?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, once again refusing to admit to a lack.</p><p>\u201cHe has the ability to reveal himself\u2014or not. He must have decided you\u2019re not worth playing with.\u201d He sighed angrily. \u201cI guess it\u2019s up to me to save the day, then.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>DISASTER LAUGHED WITH diabolical glee. Laughed harder than he\u2019d laughed when Kane had been tied down, raped, beaten and humiliated. All because Tink had collapsed to the floor, her body contorting into the most painful positions, her features screwing up tight. Moan after moan escaped her. The kind he\u2019d only ever heard in battle, after the last sword had been swung, the only enemy left standing finally defeated.</p><p>Red wheeled away from her, the horns on his head shrinking...vanishing. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to me? I\u2019m so weak, and yet...yet...\u201d</p><p>Black dropped to his knees, his wings snapping into his back and vanishing.</p><p>\u201cWeak yet...at peace.\u201d</p><p>Green stood frozen, his eyes wide with shock, the scales falling from his skin.</p><p>The cloak of mist surrounding them split at the sides, like a veil torn asunder. Suddenly Kane could see William, Synda and White, and when the three spotted the remnants of the battle scene, they stood in unison, chairs skidding backward.</p><p>\u201cI told her not to do it,\u201d William said, hands going up in a display of innocence.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave now?\u201d Synda asked, studying her nails. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting forever.\u201d</p><p>White nodded with satisfaction\u2014until she saw the state of her brothers. Angry eyes locked on Tink\u2019s writhing body. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring everyone, Kane rushed over to Tink and scooped her up in his arms. Her presence barely registered, she was so light, but her scent was there, sweet and strong, wonderfully familiar, and he found comfort in it. He had her close. She would be okay. He would make sure she was okay.</p><p>\u201cShe draws other people\u2019s abilities inside herself.\u201d The secret was out now. He needed answers. \u201cWhat\u2019d she get from your boys?\u201d he demanded of William. \u201cThey\u2019re not demons.\u201d</p><p>There was a heavy pause, then a shrug. \u201cNo, they\u2019re not, but as you know, they carry the essence of war, famine and death. She\u2019s probably swarming with all three.\u201d</p><p>His heart slammed against his ribs. \u201cGet the princess to the palace.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for a reply, but raced from the bar. The sun had dimmed, casting an eerie sort of darkness over the land. How long had he been fighting? The princess\u2019s carriage was gone, probably driving around the area to keep people from knowing exactly where the princess was and what she was doing. Taking the time to look for it wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>People now littered the sidewalks. Men in suits. Women in fancy dresses. Every eye found him and remained locked on him. Hands brushed against him, pulled at his clothing.</p><p>\u201cCome home with me,\u201d a woman said.</p><p>\u201cI want to have your baby,\u201d another intoned. \u201cPlease, Lord Kane!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shoved his way through the crowd. He had to get Tink to the palace as quickly as possible. Had to summon the best physician in the realm. And he wasn\u2019t moving fast enough, he thought, his jaw locked in irritation and frustration. He scanned the area. There was a carriage winding down the street at a slow pace\u2014slow, but unencumbered.</p><p>Kane picked up speed. Though Tink was cradled in his arms, her head tucked securely in the hollow of his neck, her arms and legs flopped with the force of his motions. Finally he caught up to the carriage and jumped through the opening in the side.</p><p>Two females were seated inside; they gasped at his sudden appearance. Both women wore the same type of ruffled, lacy gown as Synda, taking up too much space, so he knew they were part of the upper class.</p> <p>\u201cEither watch over the girl while I take over the driving, or get out of the vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you should know that if you harm her, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>The two leaned toward him, pressing against him. \u201cYou\u2019re Lord Kane! I\u2019ve been so desperate to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019ll come to my party tonight,\u201d the other pleaded.</p><p>They weren\u2019t going to cooperate. Fine. He grabbed the female closest to him and \u201chelped\u201d her out of the vehicle. She rolled on the ground, screaming in shock and anger, dust flying all around her.</p><p>He turned to the other girl and reached.</p> <p>She blew him a kiss and jumped.</p><p>Casting a final glance to Tink\u2014nothing had changed; she was in the same condition\u2014Kane swung out the door, holding on to the roof. He had to kick up his leg to crawl to the top of the vehicle, then slide down to the driver\u2019s seat. The scent of animal and sweat immediately assaulted him.</p><p>The driver jolted, startled by his sudden presence, and tried to seize a weapon. Kane kicked him off the ledge and confiscated the reins. He whipped at the horses, and the carriage picked up speed. Once Tink was healed, he would leave this land, he thought. From the beginning, she\u2019d been right. He couldn\u2019t help her. If not for him, she wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. He\u2019d only made things worse for her.</p><p>In fact, he\u2019d made things worse for everyone.</p><p>Once Disaster was taken care of, he would come back for her.</p><p>While he was gone, a man might come along and fall in love with her. A man worthy of her, good for her. That man would move heaven and earth to save her; he would do whatever she needed done. Wage war on her family. Yes. Romance her. Absolutely. Delight her, thrill her. Definitely. Sweep her away to another land, somewhere safe. The two would marry, and they would make love, have the children Tink was too afraid to have now, and she would be happy. Finally, blissfully happy.</p> <p>Yes, one day.</p><p>And then I\u2019ll kill the male for daring to take what\u2019s mine.</p><p>The horses suddenly whinnied and stopped, raising their front legs and kicking in protest.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa,\u201d Kane said. When they settled, he saw the blonde from the forest\u2014Petra\u2014standing in the road, her hands anchored on her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou shot me, and I assure you I\u2019ll have my vengeance. But we\u2019ll deal with that later,\u201d she announced. \u201cRight now, I want the girl.\u201d</p><p>Get in line, female. \u201cToo bad. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Little golden flames exploded in her eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we bargain? You give her to me now. I\u2019ll enslave her in the way of my people, and consider us even, then I\u2019ll give her back in a few thousand years. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Kane would die first. \u201cI hurt you once. Don\u2019t make me do it again.\u201d</p> <p>She chuckled with genuine amusement. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you try, warrior. You won\u2019t catch me by surprise a second time.\u201d</p><p>Mine, Disaster said.</p><p>Kane snapped the reins, forcing the horses to plow ahead. The girl had to jump out of the way to avoid impact, but she waited until the very last second, grabbing onto the back wheel to be dragged along. Dust sprayed the air, probably choking her.</p><p>Silly girl. What did she think she would accomplish\u2014</p><p>Tendrils of smoke wafted to his nose, and he coughed. Stiffening, he glanced back. The Phoenix had fallen away from the carriage, but she\u2019d left one of the wheels engulfed by flames. That. Quickly. He grabbed the dagger hidden in his boot and cut the horses loose. As the carriage teetered to one side, Kane scrambled toward the doorway...teetered more wildly...and fell through the center door as the entire vehicle slammed into the ground.</p><p>Impact was brutal, but he managed to wrap his arms around Tink and absorb most of the shock. And when the carriage finally settled, smoke forming an impenetrable cloud, he realized Tink had gone quiet. Too quiet.</p><p>Extreme heat licked at him as he pressed two fingers into the pulse at her neck. A faint thump, thump greeted him, and he could have wailed with relief. Coughing, he lifted her and draped her limp body through the door frame. He pulled himself out, gaze scanning as he hefted her over his shoulder. Through the thickening smoke he saw the Phoenix racing toward them, her body a living flame, fully engulfed, just like the wheel\u2014no, the whole bottom half of the carriage now\u2014and crackling with menace.</p><p>He expected to see her fellow warriors, but there were none. He made a split-second decision.</p><p>He had to kill her, if only for a little while. As with all Phoenix, she would die and her body would burn to ash. But there was a very real possibility she would rise again, more powerful than before.</p><p>Whatever. Kane threw the blade still clutched in his hand, and it soared toward her, flipping end over end. She jumped up and to the side, attempting to move out of harm\u2019s way, but the dagger he\u2019d taken from the Fae king possessed an ability she hadn\u2019t anticipated, switching course and following her, amazing him. As high as she was, the blade found a home in her belly, rather than her spinal cord.</p><p>She grunted, hit the ground without any grace.</p><p>He tossed a second dagger, but didn\u2019t stick around to make sure it succeeded where the first one had failed. He hopped to the ground, ran off the road and into the forest with Tink bouncing on his shoulder. He tried to be gentle, but gentle wasn\u2019t possible. Thick trees surrounded him, but he pushed through the leaves and limbs, determined and angry and already planning his next move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the Phoenix,\u201d he vowed to Tink. While he might not be able to do much for her before he left S\u00e9duire, he could do that.</p><p>He found tracks created by the palace guard, the imprint of their boots giving them away. They\u2019d clearly stopped and checked out all the singed places where the Phoenix had burned a bush or a plant or a patch of grass. But what he didn\u2019t see were imprints of more than one Phoenix. Only the girl.</p><p>Could she be on her own? Simply making it seem like others were with her?</p><p>That...made sense, he realized. She had to think an army of Phoenix would intimidate the Fae, make them more likely to give up Tink to save their land from war.</p><p>Not on my watch. He burst from the shield of the forest, turned a corner and made it to the cobbled path that led to the palace. Of course, the first person Kane spotted was Leopold, leading a contingent of armed guards out the front doors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay,\u201d the prince vowed.</p><p>\u201cYou can try to hurt me later,\u201d Kane replied, never slowing.</p><p>Blue eyes fell on Tink and flared with concern, the rage completely obliterated. \u201cWhat happened? What did you do to her?\u201d The prince waved the guards away. The moment Kane was within reach, he snapped, \u201cGive her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d There was enough crazed fury in Kane\u2019s tone to startle the man. Wisely, the prince backed off. Kane barreled past him, past the double doors, and shouted, \u201cI want a doctor sent to my room. Now!\u201d</p><p>Leopold rushed to his side, keeping pace. \u201cShe absorbed the abilities of someone, didn\u2019t she? No, no need to deny it. I know her. She did. I also know one of our doctors wouldn\u2019t be able to help her. Not with something like that. Take her to my room and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kane ignored him, stomping up the steps and into his own bedroom. He kicked the fancy, impractical cover away and eased her atop the mattress. She was still too quiet.</p><p>His hand trembled as he smoothed the hair from her face. Beads of sweat dotted her brow, causing several of the strands to stick. Her cheeks were fever-bright.</p><p>The prince approached the other side of the bed. \u201cI could have you arrested for what you did to me, and what you allowed to happen to the princess\u2019s blood slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to leave as soon as she\u2019s healed. If you want me to spend my remaining days here wedding Synda, killing your father, taking over the kingdom and ordering your torture, you\u2019ll threaten me again.\u201d Actually, that wasn\u2019t a bad plan. It was quick and easy and effective\u2014but it meant being with someone other than Tink. \u201cIf not, you\u2019ll shut your mouth.\u201d</p><p>The prince shut his mouth.</p><p>Kane hated that a doctor couldn\u2019t help her, hated that only time would heal this woman who\u2019d snuck past his defenses\u2014if there was even a cure. But he hated the feeling of helplessness more, of doing nothing but waiting for her to awaken...or die.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>JOSEPHINA TUMBLED THROUGH a world of darkness, every corner offering a new chamber of horrors. Screams of agony here. The worst kind of silence there. Big, fat insects everywhere, buzzing around her, biting at her. Pangs of the most intense, bone-deep hunger she\u2019d ever experienced, burning, gnawing at her insides. And rage, so much rage filled her; she wanted to fight someone, anyone. Wanted to conquer and destroy. But how could she do either? She was conquered herself, already destroyed.</p><p>Her blood was molten, liquid flame. Her throat hurt, as if it had been scraped raw with a blade. Did she have any skin left? She felt peeled...exposed to the world.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she tried to shout, but no sound emerged.</p><p>Where was he? Where was she? What had happened to her?</p><p>Memories of a life she hadn\u2019t lived bombarded her. She swung a sword, beheading a demon. She stood over the dying body of a human soul, laughing. She watched a winged female with desire building in her veins. Death...death...all around her. Pain, suffering, regret. More than even a legion could bear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something soft brushed against her cheek, trailed along her jaw. \u201cI\u2019m here, Tink. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>His voice. Soothing, beseeching. Pulling her out of the darkness, out of the horror, and into a light...a growing light...brighter and brighter. A moan left her as she struggled to rise.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way, beautiful girl. Come on, sweetheart. You can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyelids pried apart, and in the next instant she was peering into Kane\u2019s handsome face. I\u2019m safe now. He\u2019ll keep me safe.</p><p>Their gazes got tangled up, neither of them able to look away, and relief softened his expression. Yet, despite the relief, lines of tension bracketed his eyes and mouth. His skin was pallid, and his clothing wrinkled. His hair was spiked, as if he\u2019d stuck his finger into a light socket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d I go?\u201d Her voice was a mere croak. She tried to reach up to massage the soreness out of her throat, but her arm proved too heavy to lift. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>His lashes fused, hiding whatever emotion her words had elicited. \u201cI brought you to my bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze, the only thing she could currently move, swept around to find...yes, Kane\u2019s bedroom. She recognized it immediately\u2014while hers was small, plain and filled with eight cots and seven other females, his was total luxury. A gold-and-crystal chandelier hung overhead. The walls were splashed with gold-framed paintings by famous Fae artists who had died throughout the centuries.</p><p>Josephina sprawled across the huge, ultra-soft four-poster bed, wearing a T-shirt far too big for her, as well as her gloves, with a velvet blanket covering the lower half of her body.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the bar?\u201d Kane asked. \u201cThe fight? The three warriors you touched?\u201d</p><p>Remember...yes. She\u2019d touched one, then the other, and the other, and a surge of strength had overcome her, such beautiful strength. But then...oh, then, the darkness had enclosed her, dragging her down, down, down, into a cavern of despair and helplessness.</p><p>\u201cYou drew the evil out of them and into yourself. I carried you to the palace,\u201d Kane continued. He removed his hand from her face, becoming her anchor, the only thing holding her here. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in bed for four days.\u201d</p><p>Four days!</p> <p>The realization sickened her. Her father would be angry with her\u2014had probably even tried to force her out of bed at some point. She had duties, and she would be punished for failing them. But the real reason she panicked? Kane\u2019s wedding was now that much closer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI dealt with your father.\u201d</p><p>His gorgeous hazels were still glued to her, seeming to drink her in and memorize every feature. She could barely blink, caught up in the intensity of him, captivated by the majesty of him...confused by the number of injuries on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy father? Brother?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the angry cuts on his forehead. \u201cDisaster.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always hated Synda\u2019s demon, and she\u2019d always hated the Lords\u2019 demons. They wreaked havoc on their keepers and ruined...everything. But what she\u2019d felt then could not compare to what she felt now. She wanted Disaster dead. \u201cWell, thank you for taking care of me.\u201d Besides her mother, he was the first to ever do so.</p><p>He smiled softly...tenderly. \u201cI thought you\u2019d curse at me.\u201d</p><p>For a lot of things, yes. But that? Never. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten your desire to die, Tink,\u201d he said, his voice a low, menacing scrape.</p><p>\u201cNot that way,\u201d she whispered. Never that way. The evil she\u2019d housed would have dragged her straight into hell, condemning her to a worse fate than the one she now lived.</p><p>Kane toyed with the ends of her hair, and the contact, slight though it was, awakened the very pangs she\u2019d battled at the dressmaker\u2019s shop. Hunger\u2014for him. Need\u2014for his touch. Desire\u2014for so much more.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever spoken to the Moirai?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Even the name tainted the atmosphere around her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. They claim to weave the fates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaim?\u201d He released her to lift a cup of water from the nightstand. \u201cYou think it\u2019s a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Until that moment, Josephina hadn\u2019t realized how thirsty she was. Everything else was forgotten.</p><p>He placed a straw at her lips, and she sucked and sucked and sucked, the cool liquid soothing her throat.</p><p>Kane watched her mouth...her throat.</p><p>When the cup was empty, she leaned back, licked her lips.</p><p>He watched that, too.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d he asked, heat darkening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted\u2014more water, or more Kane.</p><p>He lifted a pitcher and poured more heavenly water into the cup. The moment the straw returned to her lips, the bottom of the cup broke. Cold liquid splashed over her, and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Kane mumbled, hopping up to gather something to help. He started to dry her off, cursed, then handed her the rags.</p><p>When she finished, he hesitantly offered her another cup.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably needed a bath.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched with the barest thread of amusement. \u201cI made sure you stayed clean.\u201d</p><p>Cheeks heating, she drained the water. At last, strength began to return to her, running through her veins, sparking her organs to life.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think the Moirai are liars?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, to start, people have free will. Fate doesn\u2019t decide what direction they ultimately go.\u201d</p><p>His fingers returned to her hair, as if drawn by an invisible string. \u201cWilliam said something similar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam is quite wise.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate says everything is meant to be. But I can\u2019t believe my mother was meant to endure such hardships. I can\u2019t believe I was meant to be a slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>One-word demands had never been so...sexy. Shivering, she said, \u201cMy father decided he wanted my mother, so, he took her. It was her decision to stay here. I was born and told I had a purpose, and it was my choice to believe it or reject it.\u201d</p><p>He peered at her, silent...thinking? \u201cWhat about marriages? Do you believe there\u2019s someone destined for everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, but not everyone follows that destiny.\u201d She hoped he heard what she wasn\u2019t saying\u2014he needed to be careful about Synda and White. \u201cHence, free will can get in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying choices and destiny shape the course of our lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes. It\u2019s just easier to blame fate for all of the mistakes.\u201d</p><p>He ghosted his thumb along the curve of her jaw, drawing goose bumps to the surface. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hurt by other people\u2019s choices.\u201d</p><p>Caught up in the intimacy of the moment, she leaned into the touch. \u201cSo have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A pause, as if he struggled with his next words. \u201cThe Moirai say I\u2019m destined to start an apocalypse.\u201d</p><p>On top of wedding the girl, White? Did he believe them?</p><p>The spell was broken. \u201cThose hobags aren\u2019t all-powerful, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHobags?\u201d He grinned.</p><p>How could she make him understand? \u201cThey simply thrive on chaos, planting their ideas into our heads. We think about it, we obsess about it, ultimately acting in a manner befitting what was said, thereby causing what was said to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d He arched a brow. \u201cYou know all of this, and yet you\u2019ve never spoken to them?\u201d</p><p>Touch me again. Gather me in your arms. Tell me you don\u2019t desire White. \u201cWell, I never said they hadn\u2019t spoken to me.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cSo you\u2019ve actually met with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And the meeting had enraged her.</p><p>Years ago, the three hags told her she was destined to cause her mother\u2019s death. All she\u2019d managed was a few gasps before they\u2019d shooed her away, but from that moment on, Josephina had begun to fear hurting her beloved mother in any way, and had overanalyzed her every word and action.</p><p>Josephina had stopped eating, stopped sleeping. She\u2019d stopped visiting her mother, too afraid of what damage she might cause. After a while, the fear had become infectious. Her mother had begun to worry over Josephina\u2019s health, and had mourned over Josephina\u2019s perceived defection. Glorika had lost weight, energy and vitality\u2014and soon, the king\u2019s favor. She was cast out of his bedroom and back to the servant quarters.</p><p>There, she was treated more shamefully than ever. She was shunned by the women and secretly harassed by many of the men. The queen had taken great pleasure in humiliating her at every turn.</p><p>In the end, Glorika had killed herself. All because Josephina had stayed away from her. So, yes. Josephina had helped destroy her. Had she never worried, nothing bad would have happened to either of them. Her mother would still be alive.</p><p>\u201cThe best decision you\u2019ll ever make is to forget what the Moirai told you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head, dark locks of hair falling over his brow. \u201cI carry the demon of Disaster. How could I not cause an apocalypse?\u201d</p><p>She heard the dread in his voice, the torment. \u201cThink about it. You\u2019re doing everything in your power to stop yourself from causing an apocalypse, aren\u2019t you? And yet everything you\u2019ve done has only exacerbated the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should do nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You should live. Truly live. Stop looking over your shoulder, expecting disaster. Stop planning your next step based on the demon\u2019s actions.\u201d</p><p>He pushed out an angry breath. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether you\u2019re wise, as I first assumed, or the dumbest woman on the planet.\u201d</p><p>Dumb? Dumb! \u201cWell, you\u2019re definitely not the sweetest man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never claimed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one would have believed you!\u201d Surely that wasn\u2019t her shrieking at him?</p><p>He massaged the back of his neck, not seeming to notice her outburst. \u201cThe Moirai told me something else. They said I\u2019m destined to marry the keeper of Irresponsibility...or White, the girl you met in the club.\u201d</p> <p>What he didn\u2019t say, but she heard: he was to stay away from a Fae blood slave. \u201cDon\u2019t let the hags decide your bride, Kane. You decide. Wed for love, or don\u2019t wed at all.\u201d</p><p>Kane leaned down, putting them nose-to-nose. He whispered, \u201cI used to be, you know.\u201d</p><p>He was so close, his clean, soapy scent thick in her nose. Heat radiated from him, enveloping her, and the tremors within her increased. \u201cUsed to be what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d</p><p>She reached up, shifted the strands of his hair through her gloved fingers. How badly she wanted skin-to-skin. \u201cYou still have your moments. But what changed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe. Everything.\u201d His gaze dropped to her lips, and lingered, his pupils expanding. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t want to kiss you again, but I do. I want it. Not because of the Moirai but because of you. What are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a treacherous beat. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re doing something.\u201d Slowly he lowered his head...coming closer...closer still. \u201cI already stole your first kiss, and I shouldn\u2019t steal the second.\u201d</p><p>What if I give it away? \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted a woman the way I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even Synda?\u201d she managed to respond, breathless.</p> <p>\u201cI understand why you\u2019re so insecure about her. Your family has always picked her over you. But that isn\u2019t the case with me. I have wanted you since moment one. I have never actually wanted Synda. She\u2019s a means to an end, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>A means to an end\u2014not a bride. He wouldn\u2019t wed the girl. And he\u2019d wanted Josephina since moment one.</p><p>Her.</p><p>Overcome, Josephina threw her arms around him, and pressed her lips against his. He moaned, his tongue thrusting into her mouth, demanding the very response she yearned to give. He was a master, sublimely skilled, every stroke propelling her need higher, and maybe she gave as good as she got, because his control seemed to be fraying at the edges, little growls rising from him, his tongue thrusting harder, faster.</p><p>Then he straightened, a funny look on his face as he traced a fingertip over lips now swollen and tingling from his possession. \u201cYou make me burn, Tinker Bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said, then gulped.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not me. You\u2019re actually on fire.\u201d</p> <p>Frowning, he glanced down at his shoulder. The ends of his hair were tipped with flames that had jumped from the lamp on the nightstand.</p><p>Josephina patted the strands, dousing the fire.</p><p>\u201cStupid Disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>He toyed with the collar of her shirt, making her skin tingle. \u201cStill want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything,\u201d she admitted softly.</p><p>Tentative, he licked the seam of her lips. When nothing terrible happened, he gave her a wicked grin.</p><p>\u201cGonna make you so happy you said that.\u201d</p><p>He tugged at the cover, pulling it down, down, down her body, baring her legs, his heated eyes never straying from hers...even as he reached for the hem of the shirt. He crawled onto the bed, graceful as a panther, and straddled her waist.</p><p>Breathing was impossible, her insides so keyed and ready for whatever he planned, she could only pant as he continued lifting her shirt, baring her breasts to his view.</p><p>He paused to look his fill, his pupils so large his irises were devoid of color.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She trembled as he reached out and cupped her, kneaded her.</p><p>\u201cSo perfect.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking too badly to reply.</p><p>His fingers slid down her belly, stopped at the top of her panties. He traced the band, and she quivered.</p><p>He stilled, frowned. His ears twitched. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>No! It was just getting good!</p><p>Kane jackknifed to his feet, and Josephina sat up, smoothing her clothes in place, trying not to huff her disappointment. No longer was her warrior vibrating with arousal. He was eerily still, a living blade, ready to slash.</p><p>Four guards burst into the room, Leopold at the helm.</p><p>The prince scowled when he spotted them. \u201cJosephina Aisling. The princess has been charged with baring her body to outsiders. Now that you\u2019re awake, you are to be taken to the throne room to hear your punishment.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>AS THE GUARDS approached the bed, Kane growled from deep within his chest. A feral sound. A primitive warning\u2014uncontrolled danger awaited. The males weren\u2019t getting near the girl. If they insisted, they would die. He\u2019d taken care of her all four days. He\u2019d left her side only once, to visit the king. He had bathed her. Had poured water down her throat. He and he alone had done everything that needed doing to ensure she survived.</p><p>She belonged to him, and he took care of what was his. Even though he\u2019d decided to leave her to save her from Disaster.</p><p>That was still the plan. Had to be the plan. But she\u2019d woken up, looked at him with those haunting crystal eyes, her cheeks hollowed, the fever-flush finally gone from her skin, that mass of dark hair tangled around her delicate shoulders, and all of his possessive instincts had risen with undeniable fury.</p><p>Mine, he\u2019d thought, even as Disaster had screamed in denial.</p><p>Kane withdrew a bloodstained dagger.</p><p>The guards stopped to eye the prince, silently asking for direction.</p><p>The prince watched him, daring him to act. With only a word, the man could have Kane on his knees, pain consuming him, leaving him helpless. Exactly what the male had to want. Kane could be carted to the dungeon, leaving Tink to face the punishment alone.</p><p>The only recourse was to take this matter to the king. Together.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d visited the king, he\u2019d requested permission to doctor Tink. Tiberius had reluctantly agreed, but in exchange, Kane had had to promise his friends would attend the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll escort her,\u201d Kane said as calmly as he was able. He would fix this situation, and then he would leave. The time had come. \u201cTell me, though. How did you know she had awakened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoices were heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Tink said, fear glazing eyes that had been filled with passion only a few minutes ago. \u201cI\u2019m staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosephina,\u201d the prince began, his features softening with a desire he had no right to feel. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am, but I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Kane offered Tink his hand. \u201cTrust me, sweetheart. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Her shudder rocked the entire bed. She closed her eyes, breathed in...held it, held it...then exhaled. When she faced him, he could tell she was battling tears. Yet still she bravely placed her hand in his, the thickness of her glove hiding the temperature of her skin.</p><p>\u201cI need to change into my uniform,\u201d she said.</p><p>He\u2019d had it cleaned. It was folded and waiting on the nightstand for her. He pulled the garment over her head, fitting it over the T-shirt he\u2019d dressed her in, never letting anyone see anything they shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He tugged her to her feet, and she hmphed as she tumbled into his side. He snaked his arm around her waist, holding her up.</p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Back ramrod-straight, Leopold turned on his heel and marched from the room. The guards were quick to pursue.</p><p>Kane practically had to carry the weakened Tink. He wondered where William had gone. Was he still in town? Kane could have used his help right now.</p><p>Synda had come to see Kane to ask his opinion about patterns and fabrics and other things he couldn\u2019t remember, and he\u2019d asked her how William had gotten her home, what the warrior had said, but she\u2019d claimed to have forgotten.</p><p>As he stalked down the hallway, he noticed the maids were pressed against the walls. They smiled and waved when they spotted him, some even coyly twirling the ends of their hair.</p><p>Drop the girl, and pick one of these, Disaster commanded.</p><p>Die, Kane shot back.</p><p>His boot untied, and he tripped.</p><p>He straightened, stopping in his tracks when he spotted a portrait of\u2014no way, just no way\u2014but it was of him and it was hanging next to one of Synda.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Tink\u2019s gaze followed the line of his and she nearly choked on a sudden giggle. \u201cOh, wow. You look so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that you look happy?\u201d</p><p>If the situation hadn\u2019t been so dire, Kane would have taken a moment to gouge out the eyes of everyone who\u2019d walked through this hallway. Apparently, William had stuck around the palace after dropping off the princess. There was no other way the Fae royal family could have gotten one of the monstrosities Anya had commissioned.</p><p>He bit the side of his cheek. He wanted the people of this realm to respect his strength; they would be less likely to act against him. But anyone peering at the canvas with him bent over a zebra-print lounge chair, wearing only a blue feather boa while holding a rose between his teeth, would assume he was...</p><p>Steam had to be curling from his nose.</p><p>No wonder Leopold hadn\u2019t minded the king\u2019s directive to leave Tink in Kane\u2019s care. No wonder the prince hadn\u2019t sought secret vengeance for being chopped in the throat and threatened. This was punishment enough.</p><p>I\u2019m gonna tear William a new one.</p><p>By the time the group reached the throne room, the air was thick with flowery scents and as cloying as usual. His nose wrinkled in disgust; he hadn\u2019t gotten used to the smell, and he doubted he ever would.</p><p>The king perched upon his golden throne, and just as before, Synda occupied the throne at his left. The queen was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cLord Kane,\u201d the princess said with a nod of greeting. \u201cServant Josephina. So good to see you\u2019re up and about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tink stiffened, remained quiet.</p><p>Synda never ceased to amaze Kane. Her grip on reality was nonexistent, as was her ability to pick up on emotional cues or comprehend why a person would be angry with her.</p><p>\u201cLord Kane,\u201d the king acknowledged. \u201cBefore the proceedings begin, we must say how thrilled we were to meet your PMS.\u201d</p> <p>Uh... \u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour personal male secretary. He escorted the princess home the day of your shopping trip. We gave him a room in the same hall as yours.\u201d</p><p>Well, that answered that. \u201cVery...generous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you happy here, Lord Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make a decree that Josephina isn\u2019t to be hurt.\u201d</p> <p>The king pressed his lips into a stubborn line. \u201cAs you know, you were granted custody of Servant Josephina for the duration of her illness. Since she has recovered, we must now see to her duties.\u201d</p><p>Tink trembled, and he tightened his hold. He cataloged the rest of the room and everyone in it, planning for every eventuality. Escape. A mob. Battle.</p><p>He found Red, Black and Green standing on the sidelines, in front of the growing crowd of Fae upper class. Ice chips crystallized in his veins, giving new meaning to cold-blooded. Were they here for revenge against Tink? Or Kane?</p><p>\u201cDo you know who those men are?\u201d he asked, motioning to the warriors.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the king replied. \u201cThey are your servants. They arrived this morning.\u201d</p><p>They did, did they? \u201cMy servants have a little problem with thieving. Make sure your guards accompany them wherever they go.\u201d</p> <p>The king snapped, and guards rushed to take up new posts behind the warriors.</p><p>None of the three seemed to notice or care. They kept their gazes on Tink, their expressions bright with fascination. Kane suddenly realized why\u2014and it had nothing to do with revenge. They wanted her to pull the darkness out of them once more and forever. They wanted to feel whole, untainted. Normal. She was the only way to accomplish such a feat.</p><p>Rage liquefied the ice. Rage directed at the warriors\u2014and himself. He\u2019d brought this on Tink. Him. No one else. Now, she had to face yet another disaster.</p><p>\u201cIt is time for Servant Josephina\u2019s sentence to be revealed,\u201d the king announced. Bang, bang, bang, he slammed his scepter on the ground.</p><p>Kane focused. One battle at a time, he thought.</p><p>\u201cBecause Princess Synda was caught undressing in public, Servant Josephina will be forced to undress here, to be branded on the chest with a mark of shame.\u201d</p><p>Tink cried out with alarm.</p><p>Kane roared a curse.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Leopold began, only to go silent when Tiberius shot him a narrowed look.</p><p>Four guards reached for her. Kane threw her behind him, using his body as a shield, and withdrew two daggers. The men paused, unsure how to proceed and survive.</p><p>William\u2019s boys stiffened, as if preparing to stomp to Kane\u2019s side and help him help Tink; but they remained in place, and he knew why. The three needed Tink alive and unharmed to get what they wanted from her and figured Kane wouldn\u2019t allow anything bad to happen to her. They expected him to fight for her, even though the outcome of that fight was unimportant to them. Amid the chaos, they could sweep Tink away. He wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if they\u2019d been the ones to tattle to the king about what Synda had done in the tavern, just to set up this little scenario.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the punishment,\u201d Kane called. A fight would be avoided, and he could force Tink to stay by his side.</p><p>The warriors would never try and take her so openly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to remove his shirt,\u201d a female twittered.</p><p>\u201cI know! It\u2019s going to be glorious!\u201d</p><p>Tink\u2019s hands flattened on his back. \u201cNo, Kane. You can\u2019t.\u201d Her voice trembled with fear and upset. Ignoring her, the king pondered the suggestion for a moment. \u201cYou aren\u2019t blood of Princess Synda\u2019s blood,\u201d he said to Kane. \u201cTherefore, the exchange would not be acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive Josephina to me, then. All of her. Now and forever. That kind of bond is as strong as blood, if not stronger.\u201d</p><p>Blue eyes lasered at him, direct and piercing. \u201cYou are to have my daughter and none other. She is the only female worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>One day, I\u2019ll cut out his tongue. \u201cIf the princess is my female, she is my responsibility. Therefore I am to decide her punishments, correct? I am to see them through.\u201d</p><p>The king stiffened. He knew he\u2019d been caught in the web of his own rules. \u201cVery well,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou may have the blood slave as well, and use her as she is meant.\u201d</p><p>Knowing Tink was being placed in his care filled him with the greatest satisfaction he\u2019d ever known. Enough to overshadow the only problem: he couldn\u2019t save Tink from further abuse without wedding Synda.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>A nod of agreement. \u201cI know better than most the power of an attraction for the wrong female\u2014and that\u2019s what you feel for Servant Josephina, isn\u2019t it? If I take the girl away from you, you will want her even more. If I harm her, you will blame me. But if I give her to you, the yearning will quickly die.\u201d</p><p>Kane held back a humorless laugh at the king\u2019s ignorance. A yearning this strong couldn\u2019t die.</p><p>\u201cHe wants a servant? A servant?\u201d Scowling, eyes glowing bright red, Synda removed one of her shoes and chucked the thing at Kane\u2019s head. He ducked just before contact. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, darling,\u201d the king soothed. \u201cDid you not hear me? The yearning will die.\u201d</p><p>He could stay long enough to wed the princess, Kane thought, then place Tink in the care of his friends. They would protect her as fiercely as he would, knowing what she meant to him. The Fae would leave her alone. The Phoenix would leave her alone just as soon as Kane took care of her\u2014which he still planned to do\u2014and all of Tink\u2019s problems would be solved now rather than later.</p><p>After the wedding, Tink would want nothing to do with him, of course, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to blame her. But she would be safe, he reminded himself.</p><p>She would also be in confined quarters with Torin. And Paris.</p><p>Dark fury scraped at his chest.</p><p>And what about Synda? What was he supposed to do with her? He loved his friends too much to make them responsible for such a mercurial brat. But he definitely had no desire to keep her with him, wherever he went.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Tink whispered to him. Her fingers clutched at his shirt in an effort to pull him down to her height. \u201cI don\u2019t want you harmed on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>Her concern touched him deeply, placed him that much further under her spell. \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t allow you to be hurt, and I meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said, sounding desperate now. \u201cIf you do this, I\u2019ll be angry with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll still kiss me better.\u201d He wasn\u2019t married yet.</p><p>Kane stepped forward, and tugged his shirt over his head. Feminine twitters rose throughout the room, and he rolled his eyes. He reached back and pulled Tink as close to him as possible. A portable fire pit was wheeled in from the side door and left in the center of the room. In strode a male holding a branding iron. He stuck the rod into the burning coals, allowing the metal to heat. Guards approached Kane\u2019s sides, intending to lock him in place. He shook them off and extended his arms.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t budge,\u201d he proclaimed.</p><p>A nod from the king had the males backing down. Tiberius, Synda and Leopold leaned forward, each watching him, perhaps curious to know if he would keep his word.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d Tink said, quivering palms pressing on his shoulder blades. Fear radiated from her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Silent, he reached behind and wrapped his arms around her, twining his fingers together, caging her against his hard back. She rested her forehead against him, and he thought he felt the wet warmth of a tear trickle down his spine.</p><p>The suspicion rocked him. Undid him. Because it meant she cared for him. A care that went deeper than desire.</p><p>Don\u2019t know if I can ever let her go.</p><p>The man lifted the rod, and steam curled from its end\u2014a very large end shaped like a dragon. He approached Kane with hesitant steps.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Kane commanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tink cried, violently shaking her head.</p><p>After a slight pause, the man jabbed the dragon into the center of Kane\u2019s chest and held it steady. Flesh instantly sizzled and melted away. Far more pain than he\u2019d expected slashed through him, the scent of overcooked meat overshadowed the fragrance of flowers. He wanted to gag. Instead, he seethed. These people had thought to do this to Tink\u2019s delicate, beautiful body. Would have done it to her.</p><p>Disaster laughed as the man tried to remove the poker\u2014and failed.</p><p>The metal had fused to Kane\u2019s sternum.</p><p>As hard as the man continued to pull, the dragon refused to budge,</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Kane gripped the shaft of the rod and jerked with all of his might. Separation was finally achieved\u2014but the rod took some of his bone with it. He dropped the thing with a thud. In and out he breathed, trying to regain his bearings. First thing he noticed\u2014utter silence filled the throne room. Everyone was waiting for his reaction.</p><p>Used to pain, he lifted his chin and said, \u201cNext order of business. I wish to spend time with the princess, getting to know my future...bride.\u201d He had to keep her out of trouble. Had to do something to ensure she was tucked into bed without any more punishments thrown Tink\u2019s\u2014or his\u2014way.</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy, you were right!\u201d A grinning Synda stood up before her father could reply, and skipped to Kane\u2019s side, as if she\u2019d never been angry, never tossed her shoe.</p><p>Tink ripped away from his hold.</p><p>He spun, tried to grab her. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes tangled in a heated clash. Hurt blazed from her, and he felt branded by the rod all over again.</p><p>\u201cTink...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. Excuse me, please,\u201d she said, pushing her way through the crowd, leaving the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved to follow her, but Synda clutched him by the wrist. \u201cLet her go. She\u2019s nothing to us.\u201d</p><p>Rage had him spinning toward her, his teeth bared. \u201cYou will not ever speak like that again. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>She blanched under the ferocity of his attention.</p> <p>King Tiberius pushed to his feet.</p><p>And Kane realized he had to play nice. He softened his voice, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want my...servants anywhere near Josephina.\u201d</p><p>The king\u2019s nod was stiff. He snapped his fingers and guards surrounded the three warriors, impeding any moves they might have made. \u201cYour turn, Lord Kane. I don\u2019t want my daughter upset.\u201d</p><p>To Synda, Kane gritted, \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk through the gardens. No...servant.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little pout. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go back to my room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He realized how insulting that probably sounded, considering everything else he\u2019d done and said this day. \u201cLike I said, I want to get to know you better first.\u201d</p><p>Synda beamed and Kane did his best not to grimace.</p><p>\u201cGo with them,\u201d the king said to one of the guards. \u201cSee to their protection.\u201d</p><p>The only one in need of protection was Synda. From Kane. She\u2019d unwittingly helped Tink get away. A killing offense.</p><p>Just get through the next few hours, and you can hunt your Fae down.</p><p>Once he found her, he wasn\u2019t going to let her out of his sight. He wasn\u2019t going to leave her, either, he realized. He couldn\u2019t. Not while William\u2019s kids were here.</p> <p>Besides, Kane might be a magnet for disaster, but to him, there was nothing more magnetic than Tink, and he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting her go.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>JOSEPHINA RACED DOWN the hall, tears burning the backs of her eyes. Kane wanted to spend more time with Synda, a supposed means to an end. What end, exactly? Allegedly, his goal for being here was saving Josephina from\u2014yes, okay, there was a good possibility he was catering to the princess for Josephina\u2019s sake.</p><p>Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have let a sudden burst of jealousy and hurt send her fleeing Kane\u2019s side. The man had just suffered horrendous pain on her behalf, taking a punishment meant for her. But...if he would suffer through something like that, just to keep his word and prevent Josephina from being injured, he would be willing to wed Synda to keep her safe, too.</p><p>Another blessing. Another curse.</p><p>He might even desire such an outcome, at least on some level. After all, the Moirai had told him Synda could very well be the girl for him.</p><p>A choked sound escaped her. Kane was hers. Hers! And she didn\u2019t want to share him. His dark, tantalizing kisses had done something to her. Changed her. Now, she craved the heat and ache and crazed need only he could bring forth. She craved...more.</p><p>A hard hand latched onto her upper arm, stopping her progress and swinging her around. She came face-to-face with Leopold and experienced a sharp pang of dread.</p> <p>When he noticed the wetness on her cheeks, he scowled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You just escaped punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, brother.\u201d A shaming reminder for him.</p><p>One he failed to heed. \u201cMe, you deny. Him, you cry for. Your demon-possessed beast is going to wed the princess and make you his mistress. You realize that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I will be no one\u2019s mistress. Not even Kane\u2019s. \u201cWho are you to cast stones?\u201d</p><p>The prince studied her for a long while, probing her features for any sign of weakness. \u201cNo matter what I say, you\u2019ll still want him. I can tell.\u201d He hauled her to the window and flicked the curtains apart. \u201cLook out there. See him for what he truly is.\u201d</p><p>Kane and Synda were in the garden Josephina and her mother had once tended. He was still shirtless, his gorgeous, muscled chest a mess, the wound in the center open and raw. He bent down and picked up a rock, then threw it a good distance away. Synda took off in a run, searching for the rock. When she found it, she picked it up and skipped back to Kane.</p><p>He threw it again.</p><p>She chased it again.</p><p>He was...playing fetch with her?</p><p>Oh, yes, she thought. He was definitely doing this for Josephina\u2019s benefit. A smile lifted the corners of her lips, only to fall a second later. The revelation didn\u2019t change the course he\u2019d set.</p><p>Leopold crowded behind her, pressing her against the glass\u2014pressing hardness to softness. She tried to squirm away from him, but he planted his hands beside her, caging her in, holding her captive. Fear sparked to sickening life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll treat you better than he ever could,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Leopold. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t want you,\u201d he continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cEveryone would be horrified if they knew. But I look at you, and I can\u2019t help myself. The desire is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResist it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve tried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep trying.\u201d</p><p>He laughed without humor, and it was a tortured sound. \u201cNo, I\u2019m done trying. I\u2019m done waiting. You\u2019re everything I need. I know you understand me in a way no one else can. You\u2019re lonely, admit it. You need someone to lean and rely on, just like I do. I know you\u2019ll finally be the one to satisfy me...the way I\u2019ll satisfy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d she said, intensifying her struggles.</p><p>\u201cBe still. I only plan to take a little, to show you how good it can be.\u201d</p><p>A little was far too much. Though she had no kind of training, instinct kicked in and she elbowed him in the stomach, stomped on his foot and head-butted his chin. As powerful as he was, he gave no reaction.</p><p>He kissed the side of her neck. \u201cSettle down and accept it. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t do this. Please, don\u2019t do this...</p><p>As if he\u2019d heard her silent plea from the garden, Kane stiffened and looked up. His gaze found the window and narrowed. Rage darkened his features, and he jolted into a dead sprint, blasting past the guard, knocking him to the ground. Synda tried to follow after him, but he was too fast for her. The princess stopped and hunched over, struggling for breath.</p><p>If Leopold had noticed the activities below, he gave no reaction. He nibbled on Josephina\u2019s earlobe. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like what I do to you. I promise,\u201d he said, then spun her around.</p><p>He tried to mesh his lips against hers. She turned her head away, tried to push him. He grabbed her wrists and pinned her arms at her sides.</p><p>Panic choked the air from her lungs, but she managed to jerk up her knee, aiming for his groin. But he\u2019d angled his lower body, as if he\u2019d expected such a move, and she ended up rubbing herself against him.</p><p>He moaned with pleasure, and she mewled with distress.</p><p>Kane flew around the corner and tackled the prince to the ground. Leopold was too stunned to fight or use his ability as Kane hammered fist after fist into his face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t touch her! Ever! Do you hear me?\u201d Kane spit the words between punches. Blood sprayed in every direction, raining over the walls. The sound of breaking bones echoed. A tooth skidded across the floor. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch her, and you don\u2019t touch me, you don\u2019t touch anyone. Understand? You don\u2019t touch!\u201d</p><p>Leopold\u2019s body began to flop with the force of the blows, but not once did he try and shield himself\u2014he couldn\u2019t. He was too busy being unconscious...maybe dying.</p><p>Shaking, Josephina drew her arms around her middle. \u201cKane!\u201d</p><p>As quickly as the one-sided battle had started, it stopped. Kane swung around, his narrowed gaze landing on her. His irises were bright red, glowing. He was panting. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, bit her lip. \u201cYou have to stop.\u201d As upset as she\u2019d been with him, she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of Kane bearing any further pain. \u201cAny wrongdoing against the prince will be punished, and your only blood slave is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>Me, she silently finished.</p><p>He straightened and closed the distance between them. His hands dripped with crimson as he reached up and cupped her cheeks. He flushed the moment he noticed the wet streaks he\u2019d left behind, and released her to lift the hem of her skirt and wipe her clean.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered, clearly shamed. Then he flushed again, and cursed. \u201cYour new dress is ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ruined it,\u201d he continued hollowly.</p><p>\u201cReally, Kane, it\u2019s no big deal. I don\u2019t care about the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m buying you a hundred more. Nicer ones, no more uniforms. You belong to me now. I get to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me. You have to leave the palace before anyone sees what you did. All right? Okay?\u201d</p><p>His gaze found hers, searched deeply. Whatever he saw caused the red to fade from his eyes, and his expression to soften. \u201cNeither of us will be punished. The prince isn\u2019t going to admit what happened. Are you?\u201d he shouted down at the now-writhing male, who was in the process of coming to. \u201cBecause you know this was only the appetizer. I\u2019m capable of worse.\u201d</p><p>An agonized moan was the only response.</p><p>Booted footsteps filled the little alcove, and the guard Kane had knocked down in the garden came racing around the corner. He spotted the prince on the ground and stopped to reach for a weapon.</p><p>Josephina threw a protective arm in front of Kane and rushed out, \u201cHe totally could have been like this when we got here,\u201d at the same time Kane said, \u201cHe fell.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of them had lied.</p><p>\u201cGet him to his room and call a doctor,\u201d Kane added. \u201cAnd tell Prince Leopold to be more careful from now on. The next incident might kill him.\u201d</p><p>The guard gulped, nodded.</p><p>Kane scooped Josephina into his arms and stomped off. She offered no protest.</p><p>\u201cLord Kane,\u201d the guard called. \u201cI think I\u2019m supposed to follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I\u2019m headed to my room.\u201d A few minutes later, they arrived at their destination. Kane stopped in the private bathroom and eased her onto the toilet lid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStay,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She raised a brow. \u201cTreating me like a dog now?\u201d</p><p>His smile was sweet and kind and even a little sad. \u201cThat\u2019s probably better than the alternative.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>He flicked her the barest of glances. \u201cA lover.\u201d</p><p>The very heat Leopold had tried\u2014and failed\u2014to attain now fanned to life. Just like that. With only two words.</p><p>\u201cI have to get this blood off me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I want you within reach. So. Like I told you, stay. Please.\u201d He messed with the knobs on the shower until water began to spew. Then he placed his fingers at the waist of his pants, paused, as if trying to decide what to do next. Finally, he exhaled heavily and unfastened the material.</p><p>The pants hit the floor and he stepped out of the pool of material.</p> <p>His beauty stole her breath. His legs were long, muscular and sinewy, with the lightest dusting of hair. Sexy...perfect.</p><p>He watched her as he hooked his thumb in the waist of his underwear.</p><p>Sweet mercy, I\u2019m finally going to die. I\u2019ll have a heart attack. Surely. \u201cSo, uh, how did you know to look at the window?\u201d Good. Keep it casual. Maybe he won\u2019t realize you\u2019re staring.</p><p>He paused, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s strange. I felt like there was a string attached to my gaze, tugging it up.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. Why was he stalling? \u201cHas anything like that ever happened to you before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Were they...connected somehow?</p><p>At last, he pushed the underwear down his legs.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>Kane, keeper of Disaster, was utterly magnificent. He was sun-worshipped, and chiseled with strength from head to toe. The wings of the butterfly tattoo appeared more jagged than before, stretching closer and closer to his...his...there.</p><p>Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.</p><p>The heat in her cheeks intensified, and her mouth went dry. He wasn\u2019t a man, but a warrior. Built for battle, honed by fire and steel. Powerful in a way so few would ever know or understand.</p><p>\u201cDo I want to know what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d he asked, his deep voice sounding hoarse.</p> <p>She forced her gaze to lift, and met his stare. The air around them instantly sizzled with the awareness she couldn\u2019t ever seem to escape. They were alone. He was naked.</p><p>Oh, the things I want to do to him...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, the huskiness of her voice surprising her. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>His heated stare bore into her. \u201cIt\u2019ll be safer for us both if I deny the truth.\u201d</p><p>Clang. Clang. Clang.</p><p>Weapon after weapon hit the floor. Soon there was a pile of daggers, guns and throwing stars at her feet.</p><p>\u201cGive me your dress. I\u2019m going to wash it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014hmph.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d closed the distance and forced her to stand, reaching around her to unzip the back of her dress. He had the material shoved down her arms, past her waist and to her feet before she realized what was happening.</p><p>As close as he was, as naked as he was, as aroused as she was...sweet mercy, her blood heated to a dangerous degree, and every inch of her skin tingled, craving more of him. Only, ever him. Her limbs began to tremble. And his...his...his tattoo was getting larger, because one of the butterfly\u2019s wings rode the length of his...</p><p>Seriously dying, she thought.</p><p>It grew, and it thickened, and it hardened, and it mesmerized her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d she said on a moan.</p><p>\u201cStep out of the gown, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>For balance, she put her hands on his shoulders before doing as he\u2019d commanded. Contact had her gasping. Even as warm as she already was, he was hot enough to burn her\u2014and she found that she liked being burned. His muscles were hard and intractable, yet covered by silk.</p><p>He straightened, but didn\u2019t move out of reach right away. He peered down at her, his breathing fast and shallow, a match to hers. The still-sizzling air thickened with steam from the tub...with desire...with a thousand other things she couldn\u2019t name.</p><p>\u201cI...you...\u201d she whispered. Do something.</p><p>He blinked, shook his head. Stiffening, he turned and entered the shower, then jerked the curtain across the rod, blocking her view. Within seconds, the rod was bending in the middle, nearly collapsing. She heard the whoosh of skin against porcelain, as if Kane had slipped. He cursed.</p><p>Her knees gave out, and she fell back onto the toilet lid. Soon, the scent of soap wafted to her. She breathed deeply, letting it wash through her, subdue her trembling. \u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>Only the slightest pause before he said, \u201cYes, Tink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d They weren\u2019t the words she\u2019d wanted to say, but for now, they would do. \u201cFor everything. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>There was a bang, as if he\u2019d just thrown his fist into the tile. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you alone.\u201d</p><p>She heard the self-castigation in his tone, and sighed. \u201cI ran away from you, remember? And besides, you can\u2019t be with me every second of every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t tempt me. \u201cSo...how many fights have you been in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your storybooks haven\u2019t given an exact tally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I wish they had. You\u2019re quite good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be, too. I\u2019m going to train you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut other men will make fun of you if they find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen aren\u2019t supposed to learn how to fight,\u201d she said, \u201cand anyone who dares to teach us is shunned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s dumb.\u201d</p><p>Agreed. In the Fae realm, men were supposed to be their protectors, but as Leopold had proven, protection was often overlooked in favor of lust and greed. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about being shunned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy these people? I\u2019d consider it a blessing.\u201d</p><p>She twirled a strand of hair around her finger. \u201cI have to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously going to marry Synda?\u201d She\u2019d meant to ask as matter-of-factly as she\u2019d asked everything else, but that hadn\u2019t exactly happened. She\u2019d whispered, instead, all of her hopes seeping from her voice.</p><p>And rather than answer, he began whistling.</p><p>Well, that was answer enough, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Disappointment, frustration and anger pooled in the pit of her stomach. She\u2019d been right. His feelings wouldn\u2019t change his course.</p><p>\u201cOn days like this, I wish I had Dear Heloise on speed dial. There\u2019s blood on my girl\u2019s dress,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShould I use club soda or vinegar?\u201d</p><p>My girl\u2019s dress, he\u2019d said. My girl. Josephina.</p><p>Argh! You can\u2019t have more than one, Kane, she nearly shouted.</p><p>The water shut off. \u201cThrow me a towel.\u201d</p><p>Josephina pulled a white cloth from the cabinet, then volleyed the material over the rod.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d she said with more sharpness than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>The curtain was brushed aside, and she had a brief realization that there was no steam\u2014why?\u2014before her mind...completely...derailed. Kane was still naked, of course he was, but now he was glistening. His hair was darker when it was wet, and dripping water down his face. The dragon brand on his chest was no longer red, but already scabbed and black. The towel was draped around his hips, hiding his butterfly tattoo\u2014and other things.</p><p>Breath caught in her throat as he hooked her dress to the bar. The soaked ends of the cotton smacked together.</p><p>\u201cI need something to wear. I need to leave the room,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cI have duties.\u201d And I need to get away from you. Before I forget I don\u2019t like to share.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to the duties. You\u2019re going to stay in here and rest.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened with bafflement. \u201cYou can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see you try and stop me. Or leave this room. Now make a list of what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>If he wanted to do her chores, fine. Opulens would see him and laugh. Even the servants would snicker. Josephina would finally have time away from him\u2014time of peace. The feelings he stirred...she was beginning to hate them. Their intensity.</p><p>Grinning with sugary sweetness, she stalked into the bedroom and dug a pen and pad of paper from the nightstand. Then she wrote. And wrote. And wrote. He used the silent minutes to strap on his weapons, rifle through the contents of the closet and dress in the clothes the king had provided for him. Her wrist was aching by the time she finished the list.</p><p>He approached her, wearing a black shirt and black pants, and looking absolutely edible despite having covered up his magnificent body. She handed over the paper.</p><p>He gazed at it, scowled. \u201cYou do all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost every day.\u201d</p><p>He read over the list a second time. \u201cI should just kill your father and brother right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd be hunted by the Fae for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry me,\u201d he said, and he sounded sincere.</p><p>\u201cIt should. I know Tiberius has allowed you many liberties, and you probably think my entire race is a joke\u2014otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be so cavalier\u2014but you haven\u2019t seen everyone revved up for a blood vendetta. I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not worried.\u201d</p><p>She anchored her hands on her hips. \u201cIf the Fae want you dead and fail to find you, they\u2019ll find your closest friends and torture them to force you out of hiding. Even the famed Lords of the Underworld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019m already dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll do it just for fun.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>IN SECONDS, KANE had the lock on his bedroom door rigged, keeping Tink in and everyone else out. Ropes of guilt threatened to jerk him under a river of shame, which was ridiculous. He was doing her a favor. She needed rest and he needed to make sure she was safe and, prisoner or not, this was the only way to ensure those things. Maybe one day she\u2019d even thank him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Battling a sense of urgency, he hustled together a handful of the servants and issued a round of orders. The humans rushed around to take care of the twenty-nine items on Tink\u2019s list\u2014and avoid the consequences of failure. Soon, the wrinkles were being steamed out of curtains, the floors were being scrubbed, the banisters were being polished, and the queen\u2019s bathroom was being cleaned.</p><p>The last was a chore meant to humiliate Tink, nothing more, he would bet. At breakfast, he\u2019d witnessed the way the queen watched her, with resentment in those royal blue eyes. And he didn\u2019t have to guess why. Tink was living proof the king had cheated, and Queen Penelope was lashing out in the only way she could. But that crap ended today. No longer would Tink serve a single member of the royal family.</p><p>She\u2019d been placed in Kane\u2019s care. She would serve him, and no one else.</p> <p>He smiled. Tink would have balked if she\u2019d heard his thoughts.</p><p>After speaking with one of the guards, he\u2019d learned that Synda, his other responsibility, had decided to go for another walk in the garden, without protection and despite the Phoenix infestation.</p><p>As he stomped outside, a brutal wind suddenly kicked up, causing a hoe to lift from the ground and slam into him. When Kane failed to find the girl in the garden, he prowled into the forest. One hour passed, then two, but he found no tracks to suggest Synda\u2014or even Petra\u2014was out there. He would bet Synda had met someone, had sex, and returned to the palace. Sounds about right. As for Petra...he wasn\u2019t sure. He only knew she wasn\u2019t the type to give up.</p><p>Frustrated, he returned to the palace.</p><p>What a mess.</p> <p>Disaster released a maniacal laugh.</p><p>Kane moved through the corridors, staying in the shadows, watching, listening. This had become his nightly ritual. He liked to make sure everyone was where they were supposed to be, staying out of trouble, and making no plans to come after Tink. The king snaked around the far corner, leading his new mistress toward his suite of rooms. The man was huffing and puffing with eagerness, his hands already roaming under the girl\u2019s dress. The girl muttered an encouragement, with zero inflection in her voice. She sounded dead.</p><p>They disappeared through the door, and Kane moved on. Synda was now in her bedroom, playing strip poker with Red, Green and Black. No surprises there, though Kane was relieved she was back at the palace at least. Where was White? In the billiards room, he discovered a surprisingly healthy Leopold playing with three human maids. All three had long, black hair.</p><p>Like Tink.</p><p>Kane pressed his heels more firmly into the floor. Can\u2019t kill him without causing Tink problems.</p><p>\u201cYou missed your shot,\u201d Leopold said to the one holding the cue. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay the penalty.\u201d</p> <p>The girl crooked her finger at him. \u201cI\u2019m more than willing.\u201d</p><p>Leopold advanced on her, bending her over the table as he smashed his lips into hers. The other females watched, giggling.</p><p>Kane had heard the gossip. He knew the king had despised his son since his birth, yet Synda, the eldest, the one with the freaking mental disorder, he adored. What Kane didn\u2019t know was why.</p><p>He backed out of the room. In the hallway he paused, booted footsteps claiming his attention.</p><p>\u201c\u2014must have chased the Phoenix horde out of the realm,\u201d a guard said as he marched past.</p><p>Neither he nor his companion noticed Kane in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cCowards,\u201d the other spat.</p><p>In the next room over, a group of servants were dusting and straightening a sitting room with a pink couch, pink loveseat, and multiple pink chairs.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014just like her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I hear she\u2019s sleeping in his room.\u201d</p><p>A dreamy sigh wafted through the air. \u201cI\u2019d love to sleep in his room.\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched below his eye. They were talking about Tink, insinuating she was a...that she was his... He couldn\u2019t even think the word anymore without wanting to kill someone. Painfully. He left the room\u2014and ran into White.</p><p>\u201cAre you following me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She shrugged, unabashed.</p><p>He stepped around her, but she grabbed onto his wrist. He jerked from the contact, while Disaster purred.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused about you, Kane, and I don\u2019t like being confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem.\u201d</p><p>A grinning William stumbled from the queen\u2019s bedroom, and White rushed away down the hall.</p><p>\u201cHurry back, my darkling,\u201d the queen called, oblivious to her audience.</p><p>\u201cAs if anything could keep me away for long, my pet,\u201d the warrior twittered.</p><p>Kane stopped, waiting, his hands fisted.</p><p>The moment William shut the door, Kane was in his face, demanding softly, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>The grin fell away, revealing a scowl of irritation. \u201cBesides fighting a gag reflex? I\u2019m getting answers. Why? You think I was betraying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like I\u2019d be crazy to think so, but we both know you once stabbed Lucien in the chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, memories,\u201d the warrior said with a grin. \u201cBut you aren\u2019t trying to steal from me the way Lucien was. And by the way, I never do cougars free of charge. You so owe me for this.\u201d</p><p>He eased off, but only slightly. \u201cWhat have you learned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m sure we\u2019re alone. Wouldn\u2019t want anyone to hear and think I actually enjoy helping my friends.\u201d William led him down the hall and around the corner, then shouldered a portion of the wall\u2014it opened, revealing a secret passage Kane hadn\u2019t yet discovered. They entered the torch-lit space and pounded up a flight of creaking steps.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the warrior began, as promised, \u201cthe king recently found out our good friend Paris is screwing Sienna, the new ruler of the Titans. He also learned Sabin and Strider are whipped by Harpies, and that Lucien had his balls removed by Anarchy. He fears your family and wants to be a part of it, whatever the cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, so informative. Thanks for the old news.\u201d</p><p>But, hearing the facts stated so plainly, he had to wonder how deeply the king\u2019s desire ran. Enough to finally claim a connection to Tink, allowing Kane to wed her rather than the princess?</p><p>Wed...Tink, he thought. Tink. His bride. His wife.</p><p>His. Forever.</p><p>Happiness bloomed, as warm and bright as a ray of sunshine.</p><p>No! Disaster screamed, and the floor beneath Kane\u2019s feet cracked. I\u2019ll kill her! Kill her so dead!</p><p>Kane tripped, hit his knees on one of the steps. Could he really subject Tink to the demon\u2019s rages forever?</p><p>No. He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>But could he really wed Synda?</p><p>Maybe he should call his friends. They would come. Sienna commanded a legion of immortal soldiers. Harpies could chew through an army with both hands tied behind their backs and their legs hobbled. Anarchy could destroy the world and laugh while doing it. War could be waged against the Fae, and Kane would be able to free Tink without having to wed anyone.</p><p>But what if someone he loved was hurt? How would he be able to live with himself? Worse, he would once again prove himself to be a failure, unable to achieve success on his own.</p><p>So, no. He had so little pride left. He wouldn\u2019t go that route unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve gone from turned on to pissed to dejected in three seconds. It\u2019s quite entertaining, and I\u2019m flattered\u2014I\u2019ve always known you were crushing on me\u2014but now I want in. What are you planning?\u201d William asked.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, figure it out. The sooner you do, the sooner we can leave. If I have to go down on the queen one more time...\u201d He shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s usually one of my favorite pastimes, but she\u2019s given my tongue frostbite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m not trying to figure this out?\u201d he snapped. Whatever road he chose came with terrible consequences, and he was getting whiplash from deciding on one route, then changing his mind, then changing his mind again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. If you aren\u2019t thinking about having sex, you\u2019re thinking about getting sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you know me so well. By the way, the queen and princess are playing some kind of game in the gardens tomorrow morning, and your Tinker Hell will be involved somehow. I suggest you make an appearance.\u201d</p><p>Another attempt to humiliate Servant Josephina\u2014and if he heard that title again he was going to erupt. \u201cI will. And you do me a solid and keep your kids out of my way. They claimed to be my assistants, just to get close to Tink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. It was my idea. They liked what she did for them and want more.\u201d</p><p>Kane shoved William against the wall, his hand wrapping around the male\u2019s windpipe and squeezing. \u201cYour idea?\u201d</p><p>Electric blues gleamed with amusement. \u201cYes, and this is the thanks I get? I did you a favor. You should appreciate having your enemy within reach. I would.\u201d</p><p>Bit by bit Kane eased his hold. \u201cThey can\u2019t have her. I\u2019ll kill them if they try.\u201d He might, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWere you hit in the head? Of course I know that. Which is why I warned the boys about Lords of Pussywhip Manor and their women.\u201d William motioned to the closed door in front. \u201cAnd now, our little convo is over. This is a door to your hallway. Off you go, Candy Kane.\u201d</p><p>Kane left him without another word. Thankfully, there were no guards in the area, saving him the complication of sneaking. Everyone assumed he was inside\u2014with his mistress.</p><p>As quietly as possible, he fixed his lock and entered his room. He wondered what Tink was doing, if she was mad at him. He didn\u2019t like the thought of her angry; he wanted her relaxed, happy.</p><p>He found her on the bed, buried under the covers. As he tiptoed forward, something in his chest softened. He reached the side of the mattress and gently pushed back the covers, desperate to see her face, perhaps brush his knuckles along her cheekbone. He saw...a bunched-up pillow?</p><p>As his mind sputtered to compute what this meant\u2014had Tink done this or had someone done it for her? Was she safe?\u2014he heard the rustle of clothing behind him. At his side, a shadow moved. Next, a quiet whistle caught his attention\u2014glass being brandished through the air. Kane spun, and grabbed his would-be assailant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A delicate bone structure registered first, followed by the heartwarming scent of rosemary and mint. Warm, soft skin. A feminine gasp. He realized it was Tink after he\u2019d thrown her on the bed. She bounced up and down, and when she stilled she scrambled to press against the headboard, disheveled hair tumbling down her shoulders.</p><p>The vase she\u2019d held shattered on the floor. Several pieces found their way into his shin.</p><p>He stood there, glaring down at her. \u201cI could have killed you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what do you know? You almost kept the first promise you ever made me.\u201d Eyes as dark as sapphires threw daggers at him.</p><p>Daggers that pierced him soul deep. He\u2019d always experienced some kind of ache around her, but this was different. This affected every cell in his body, tearing him apart. \u201cIs that what you still want? To die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I want you to die!\u201d she huffed.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>The anger drained from her, and her gaze fell to the floor. \u201cNo. Okay. No. I\u2019m sorry I said it. But I do think you need to learn a lesson. You trapped me in here, you...you...argh! I don\u2019t know a name terrible enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did you a favor. Seeing you in my clothes would have verified what everyone already thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does everyone think?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cI knew it! They don\u2019t just think I\u2019m your property, they think I\u2019m your slut!\u201d She beat her little fists against the covers. When calm, she said, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered. No one would have seen me. I could have snuck to my room and stayed there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly a girl who can be overlooked, Tink.\u201d And he would have utterly destroyed any man who had gotten a glimpse of her. Like, body parts and organs would have littered the floor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019ve been overlooked all my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot by Leopold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, he\u2019s out of commission right now, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no. He\u2019s already healed.\u201d Kane eased onto the side of the bed, trying not to allow her nearness to affect his body this time\u2014failing, as always. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re upset about what I did to your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m grateful. It\u2019s just that I had\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChores. I know. They\u2019ve been outsourced.\u201d</p><p>She blinked with incredulity. \u201cYou told the other servants to do them, and they obeyed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Drily, he added, \u201cSome people actually fear my wrath.\u201d</p><p>Her lips turned down at the corners. Such lush, pretty lips, even when she was frowning. \u201cAre you saying I should?\u201d</p> <p>Lord, save me. \u201cNo, Tink. You never should.\u201d He clasped her wrist and lifted her arm, knowing what he was about to do was dangerous, especially now, as the adrenaline of their clash burned the leash holding on to his desire. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve gotten the pleasantries out of the way, we\u2019re going to test out what you can do with your hands.\u201d</p><p>She tried to tug from his grip. \u201cNo way. I might hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should thrill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound so defeated about it.\u201d He removed one glove, then the other.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen her hands before, he realized. They should have been soft, but they were bruised and scarred. Despite the barrier she always wore, calluses littered her palm and her nails were chipped.</p><p>Again she tried to tug away.</p><p>Again he held firm.</p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d she said, shifting uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I like what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, because they\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. Actually, they\u2019re beyond beautiful.\u201d And that was the truth. Her hands spoke of hard work and a strength of character possessed by few. He placed a kiss on each of her knuckles, realized he should have waited until he knew whether or not she\u2019d drain him, then released her.</p><p>She watched him through widening eyes.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cYou...you trust me not to purposely take from you, just to escape your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? I just tried to bash your skull with a vase. And what if I take from you accidentally, huh? What then?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat happens will happen. We have to know what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Even more adamant, she shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to risk you.\u201d</p><p>Did she have any idea how telling those words were? \u201cEither touch me, or I\u2019ll leave you in this room and go find Synda. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a shriek of anger, Tink jumped to her knees and slapped her hands against his cheeks. \u201cYou are such a jerk, and you deserve whatever happens.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to laugh. But he couldn\u2019t. They were skin-to-skin, heat-to-heat, and all he had to do to get her underneath him was lean forward. She\u2019d fall back, unable to maintain her balance, and he\u2019d stretch out. It would take him two seconds to strip her. Two more to strip himself.</p><p>One more to get inside her.</p><p>The painting hanging over the headboard shook, fell. Its frame broke.</p><p>\u201cAre you good?\u201d Tink asked, too intent to notice the destruction.</p><p>Disaster spewed a stream of hateful curses, as loud as ever.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou can stop now.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, she lowered her arms\u2014but the relief didn\u2019t last long. He tore his shirt over his head. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded, her eyes instantly riveted to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s see what happens when you\u2019re distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Put your shirt back on. You\u2019re...you\u2019re...so sexy.\u201d The last ended with a dreamy sigh. \u201cUh, I mean...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo take-backs.\u201d He smirked as he took her hands and placed them on his pecs. The sensation was almost too much. He groaned. She moaned. \u201cReady for stage two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d So much more.</p><p>He should resist, but he wasn\u2019t going to. Every second in her presence was a torture with only one cure. Here, now, with her scent in his nose, an obvious hunger for him in her eyes, she could give it to him.</p><p>Mine. He lowered his head slowly, taking his time, savoring every moment, before pressing his lips into hers. Her mouth opened immediately, welcoming him, and he swept his tongue inside. Her intoxicating taste invaded his senses, and all thoughts of leisure were abandoned. Need he\u2019d denied far too long roared to the surface. He was a starving man, desperate to devour.</p><p>Driven by instinct, he leaned and she fell back on the mattress, just as he\u2019d imagined. He pressed his weight into the softness of her sweet little body, and pinned her down. In this position, no part of them remained disconnected from the other.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cTinker Bell.\u201d</p><p>He forced her head to tilt, taking more. Giving more. This time, bad memories were kept at bay. And there was no pain in the action\u2014no pain at all, he realized, not that he would have cared. This woman...she chased the darkness away, showed him pleasure and light. Beauty.</p><p>Mine. She\u2019s mine. I keep what\u2019s mine.</p><p>They\u2019d started this for a reason\u2014why had they started this?</p><p>Her fingertips glided down the length of his spine; her nails scraped back up, sending waves of pleasure through\u2014wait, yes, her hands. \u201cYou must have instinctively built mental barriers. You\u2019re not draining me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep checking. Just to be sure.\u201d Distracted words. She opened her legs to him, providing a cradle for his aching shaft\u2014want her, want her so bad\u2014and he fell into it, pressing intimately against her. Hissing at the utter pleasure. So perfect. He couldn\u2019t stay still, was already moving against her, rubbing, seeking.</p><p>She moaned with breathless excitement and clutched at him. Innocent, he reminded himself. She\u2019d never had this. He had to be careful with her.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t careful as he kneaded her breasts, or when he reached between their bodies to cup her between the legs and rub, hard, harder, because she didn\u2019t seem to want careful. The more demanding his touch, the louder her cries of abandon. He lost his finesse, was nothing more than an animal nipping and pawing at her.</p><p>He bit the cord at her neck, and she shuddered.</p><p>\u201cYes! Again,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He obeyed. Every nerve in his body cried for satisfaction\u2014to give her satisfaction. This woman...oh, this woman. She\u2019d been made for him, only him.</p><p>She arched against him. She scratched at his back all over again. She squeezed his hips with her knees. Then...she palmed his length.</p><p>Going to lose something else...</p><p>\u201cThis all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter than.\u201d</p><p>This should stop, before he pushed them both past the point of no return.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>No, he still couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted this for so long...too long. To walk away now...no, he would rather die.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she rasped. \u201cDo more to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His fingers trembled as he jerked at the hem of her shirt. He had to strip her. Had to taste every inch of her. Had to prove she belonged to him, that they belonged together, and no one and nothing could ever tear them apart.</p><p>The hollow of her stomach...perfection. Her breasts...exquisite, just as he remembered. He was utterly snared, couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away.</p><p>Then she moved her legs, planting her feet at his sides and bending her knees.</p><p>The panties had to go.</p><p>Disaster shook the walls of the bedroom, maybe the entire palace. Suddenly furniture was rattling, and a chair was toppling over. Kane was too lost to care. Such a lush, ripe female. Perfect in every way.</p><p>And if you take her, then marry her sister?</p><p>The thought swept through his mind, springing from a conscience he\u2019d thought had been murdered. He brushed it aside. He would make sure she liked everything that happened, that she never had any regrets, that she\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suffers with shame and guilt.</p><p>That thought was too shattering to ignore. He couldn\u2019t take her, he realized like a harsh slap in the face. Not here. Not now. Not like this, with things left unsaid and unplanned.</p><p>Frustrated, he smoothed down her shirt and jolted upright. His body screamed a protest, his every cell rejecting the separation from her. He punched the headboard. Wood shards rained.</p> <p>Tink gasped with surprise. \u201cK-Kane? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His shame rose. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>At least the shaking had stopped, Disaster calming.</p><p>\u201cDid I drain you and not realize?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Remaining on his side, facing her, he lay down. \u201cThe demon was acting up.\u201d Despite the pain of unsatisfied lust, there was no underlying ache\u2014but there was a surprising underlying wave of contentment.</p> <p>\u201cI want to go to my room now,\u201d she said hollowly.</p><p>Or maybe not. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here. You\u2019re sleeping here. That\u2019s not up for discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide what\u2019s up for discussion and what\u2019s not.\u201d Her voice had a bite to it.</p><p>\u201cI do get to tie you to the bed if you even think about leaving.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, hiding the anguish he\u2019d just glimpsed inside their depths. \u201cYou are so confusing! One second you\u2019re all over me, the next you\u2019re pulling away. I shouldn\u2019t have kissed you, I admit that. Ultimately, your circumstances haven\u2019t changed. In fact, they\u2019re worse. I asked if you planned to marry Synda and you refused to answer.\u201d</p><p>If the situation had been different\u2014if he planned to marry Synda for any reason other than to save Tink\u2014he would have agreed. \u201cI thought it might prove necessary.\u201d Yes, he\u2019d entertained the notion of going through with the marriage to Synda, and yes, it was still an option, but just then, with Tink\u2019s taste in his mouth and her warmth enveloping him, he knew it wasn\u2019t an option he would ever be able to take. \u201cI was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>He would think of something else. He would.</p><p>One of the wood shards had caught on the bed railing and now fell into his eye. He hissed.</p><p>Kane tilted back his head and poked around until he found and removed the tiny sliver.</p><p>Hatred for Disaster burned that much deeper.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you\u2019re sure of?\u201d Tink asked quietly.</p><p>He was sure he was tired of pretending. Tired of thoughts and memories and fears and indecision and...everything but this girl. \u201cI\u2019m sure we both need some rest.\u201d Before Disaster caused her harm. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>\u201cGUESS WHAT? IT\u2019S LATER.\u201d</p> <p>Kane looked around. Josephina stood at the side of the bed, surrounded by the same glittering white mist he\u2019d seen in the dark alley beside the club. \u201cDid you project yourself into my mind again? Even though you\u2019re right next to me?\u201d</p><p>Wait. She was next to him, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>He patted the space beside him, and sure enough, the heat of her caressed his hands.</p><p>She raised her chin, probably trying for haughty but only managing adorable. \u201cWould you be angry if I pleaded guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d already be over my knee if I were angry.\u201d</p><p>An amused gleam danced in her eyes. \u201cYou would not spank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to challenge me on this topic?\u201d</p><p>She held up her palms and backed away from him. \u201cNo, no. Not me. I\u2019d never do something like that.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and waved her back, the sense of being carefree astonishing him. \u201cWhy not just talk to me in person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree reasons. I\u2019m impatient. Our real bodies are clearly exhausted right now. And Disaster can\u2019t hurt me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to bury the lead,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cWho else have you invaded like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d She offered him a sad little smile. \u201cBefore she gave me the ability forever, I accidentally took it a few times.\u201d</p><p>Curious, he said, \u201cWhy not use it with others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one in this realm I want to talk to, and no one who wants to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Always breaking my heart. \u201cWell, don\u2019t invade anyone else.\u201d He didn\u2019t like the idea of her being this intimately involved with another.</p><p>She stuck out her tongue. \u201cWhatever you say, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He tsked, sitting up. \u201cCareful. That\u2019s an invitation to a guy like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is? The action or the insult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, and he suspected\u2014hoped\u2014she meant to issue a verbal invitation. But all she said was \u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his stomach jumped as if she\u2019d caressed him. \u201cYes.\u201d He threw his legs over the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you.\u201d She paced in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of personal.\u201d</p><p>Dread rolled through him. \u201cI told you, you can ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, motioned to his hip. \u201cWhy a butterfly?\u201d</p><p>Okay, that one was easy. He stood\u2014but somehow left his body behind.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I think you just projected your image. Like I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Were they bonded on some deep, primal level? Her abilities becoming his? Or, had she left a piece of herself behind when she\u2019d taken Disaster from him?</p><p>She reached out, tracing her fingers along the curve of the wing stretching above the waist of his pants. \u201cLike this, I can feeeel you.\u201d</p><p>Instant. Hard-on. \u201cAnd I can feel you,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cThe butterfly...\u201d she prompted with a shiver.</p><p>Right. \u201cMy friends and I have our theories, and none are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear yours.\u201d Her knuckles brushed against his navel, and he had to fight the urge to grab her hand...to force it to go lower.</p><p>\u201cInside a chrysalis, a caterpillar breaks down into imaginal cells. Those cells put themselves back together in a new shape and the creature emerges as a butterfly. Once, I was a warrior. Then the demon came, and I was broken down and reshaped into something else. Something dark and twisted.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze found his. \u201cBut you and the demon aren\u2019t one being. You\u2019re separate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but we will be,\u201d he said, unable to hide his determination. Before she could question him further, he offered his hand to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed before she twined their fingers.</p><p>He remained quiet, easing forward into a slow walk around the room. She kept pace beside him, the mist constantly swirling and dancing with their motions. He enjoyed the peace and tranquility. \u201cHow does this ability of yours work? You projected your image into my mind, but do you control everything I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>She cut him a look of determined delight. \u201cPrepare to be amazed by my amazingness.\u201d Rubbing her hands together, she closed her eyes. A moment later, a forest of lush green trees took the place of the room. A mutant dog-monkey hybrid materialized on one of the branches, swinging toward him and throwing an apple at his head.</p><p>He dodged, but not quickly enough. The red fruit hit his shoulder, causing Tink to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in trouble now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, oh, no. Are you going to give me that spanking?\u201d she gasped out with mock fear\u2014and another apple slammed into his shoulder. \u201cOr is the mean warrior going to give me a very stern lecture?\u201d</p><p>Kane released a low snarl, as fake as her fear. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a lecture all right.\u201d</p><p>She giggled as she raced forward, throwing over her shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to catch me first.\u201d</p><p>That giggle...as much as he wanted to kiss and touch her again, he wanted to hear that giggle more. He darted after her, chasing her around thick trunks and other mutant animals she\u2019d thought up. The cat-deer. The squirrel-wasp. The elephant-zebra. He almost caught her, and she giggled again; he laughed.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not they were ghosting through walls, or still inside his bedroom, and he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d never acted like a child. He\u2019d never been a child. He\u2019d come into this world fully formed, a vessel meant for war and vengeance. Then, after the Pandora\u2019s box debacle, he\u2019d become a container for evil\u2014and his weeks in hell had only increased the darkness inside him. Until Tink, he\u2019d never been anything more; he\u2019d never known light.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t catch me I\u2019m the muffin man,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cGingerbread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we saying random foods now? Cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>He was shaking with laughter when next he caught her, and she managed to slip away.</p><p>\u201cPoor Kane,\u201d she called, and he could tell she was struggling not to pant from exertion. \u201cToo old to keep up with such a young Fae?\u201d</p><p>Pumping his arms and legs faster, he increased his pace until he was practically breathing down her neck. She released a laughing scream when he grabbed her by the waist and spun her around.</p><p>\u201cThink I\u2019m too old now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thousands of years old. Of course you\u2019re too old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but am I too old for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have daddy issues. No one\u2019s too old for me.\u201d</p><p>He choked on another laugh. \u201cYou are the oddest mix of innocence and modern sass.\u201d</p><p>A pause as insecurity filled her eyes, then, \u201cToo odd for you?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely perfect for me,\u201d he admitted. A man could get used to this. A man could get addicted to this.</p><p>Too bad it wouldn\u2019t last. Not for Kane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He settled her on the ground and stretched out beside her, wondering if the pain would make another appearance. He knew Disaster hadn\u2019t given up, so why the lack?</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tinker Bell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...being you.\u201d</p> <p>KANE WOKE UP gradually, his mind coming to the slow realization that there was something soft and warm intertwined with his limbs\u2014and he hadn\u2019t been plagued by nightmares, but had actually slept. The scent of rosemary enveloped him. He blinked open his eyes, disrupting the haze, and spied the culprit. His mouth lifted in a leisurely grin.</p><p>This was the life he craved for himself. A beautiful woman he admired, respected\u2014hungered for\u2014wrapped around him, her head resting on his arm, her bare hands on his chest, and one of her legs propped on his hip.</p><p>Tink\u2019s features were stunningly relaxed, and there was a soft, pink color in her cheeks. He wasn\u2019t sure how she kept ending up in his arms, but he would have loved to know.</p><p>He smoothed the hair from her face. She leaned into the touch and smacked her lips. Lips he\u2019d tasted last night.</p><p>Lips he wanted to taste again...</p> <p>He leaned into her, preparing to do just that. The moment he realized where this was headed, he froze. Yesterday he\u2019d stopped, knowing Tink would hate herself if she had sex with a man currently engaged to another woman.</p><p>But he\u2019d since realized the truth. He couldn\u2019t marry Synda. Not for any reason.</p><p>He was going to have Tink.</p><p>He might regret it. She would definitely regret it. A sweet man would walk away now.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a sweet man.</p><p>He closed the rest of the distance. At the moment of contact, a moan escaped him. Her lips...so wonderfully soft. The women from the club had wanted his kisses, but he\u2019d refused. The thought had even disgusted him. But with Tink, things had always been different. He wanted more from her than he\u2019d ever wanted from another\u2014and he would have it.</p> <p>Her lashes fluttered open. Cobalt met his penetrating stare, and he waited for the confusion to evaporate\u2014and realization to take its place.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d he said, a question and a demand. Desire burned white-hot, sizzling through his veins.</p><p>She arched, rubbing her needy little body against him, creating the most delicious friction. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He dived down for another taste. His tongue licked into her mouth and she moaned, already as lost as he was, in a place where nothing mattered but the pleasure. He was tentative at first, as gentle as he was capable of being. She was hesitant, unsure this early in the morning, with the room teeming with sunlight, but the more time he took with her, the deeper she allowed him to take possession of her mouth. The deeper his possession, the more she melted against him. Soon, their tongues were meeting thrust for heated thrust.</p><p>The bed shook. A growl sounded in his head.</p><p>Kane slid his hand under her shirt and palmed her breast. Her back arched, and he began kneading. Such a delicious fit. She mewled, a decadent noise that drove him wild. \u201cYou like when I touch you this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do more.\u201d He slid his fingers down her stomach, to the apex of her thighs. \u201cAnd I can do it here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>One-word responses, as if she couldn\u2019t focus on his voice, only his touch.</p><p>\u201cI want your clothes out of the way. All of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesss.\u201d</p><p>He ripped the collar of her shirt, and put his mouth where his hands had been. While he sucked her, he worked at the zipper of his pants. Then, finally then\u2014</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, seeming to blink through a sensual fog. \u201cWait. Maybe we should think about this.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t curse. \u201cWe can think later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I\u2019m not sure...maybe this is a mistake...\u201d</p><p>He heard footsteps and a male\u2019s whistle beyond the door.</p><p>Not. Happening. Not again. Especially now, when he was desperate to find out why Tink thought they were making a mistake.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door. \u201cYo. Warrior. It\u2019s garden time,\u201d William called. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave her queenliness waiting. She\u2019s already sent a guard to hunt your Tinker Hell down.\u201d</p><p>He roared, \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>A pause was followed by a laugh. \u201cBad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tink said, breathless but unsure. \u201cIf the queen wants me in the garden, she has a game of cricket lined up. I need to go.\u201d</p><p>He. Hated. William.</p><p>At least the bed stopped shaking.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S SIMPLE,\u201d THE QUEEN explained, using her snobbiest tone. \u201cServant Josephina will tie her drab little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not her title anymore,\u201d Kane roared, making Josephina gasp.</p><p>The queen blanched. \u201cWell, she must stand with her hussy\u2019s legs apart...I mean her legs,\u201d she corrected when Kane took a menacing step toward her, \u201cand we will each take turns knocking our balls through the gap with our mallets.\u201d</p><p>Heat filled Josephina\u2019s cheeks as she latched onto Kane\u2019s wrist to hold him in place. As soon as she knew he wouldn\u2019t attack the woman, she released him with every intention of entering the clearing to assume her position.</p><p>He was the one to grab her by the arm this time, stopping her. He snapped, \u201cShe won\u2019t be doing that.\u201d</p><p>The queen huffed and puffed, and Josephina listened as the two sped into a heated argument about her purpose in the game.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get the king and allow him to settle this,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThe girl is mine, and I decide what she does and does not do.\u201d</p><p>Penelope\u2019s gaze strayed to William.</p><p>\u201cThe disagreement is a waste of time. Give him what he wants,\u201d the warrior said. \u201cAnd later, I\u2019ll do the same to you.\u201d</p><p>There was a strange mix of boredom and huskiness in his tone.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d the queen huffed, either too afraid to go against the king or too eager to have whatever William was offering. \u201cWe\u2019ll play without Servant\u2014I mean, the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d Kane patted Josephina on the butt before joining the group in the clearing. She had to press her lips together to keep from laughing.</p><p>Next time, I\u2019m going to stand up for myself. Kane had once called her brave, and he wasn\u2019t a liar, so, it was time to act the part. There would be consequences, consequences she\u2019d once feared more than anything. But she wasn\u2019t a slave, that wasn\u2019t her lot in life, wasn\u2019t something she would tolerate any longer, she thought.</p><p>Choices. They were hers to make. Hers to see through.</p><p>The sun was brighter than usual, casting golden rays over the rows of multicolored flowers and alabaster statues Tiberius had commissioned of himself, Synda, Queen Penelope and Leopold. Though the one of Leopold had been battered by weather, but never fixed. The air was warm, and it was a good thing, too. Her dress was still a little damp from the washing Kane had given it.</p><p>Synda skipped to her ball, looked to Kane and nibbled on her lower lip. \u201cWill you come help me, Lord Kane? I\u2019m far too weak to hit my ball very far.\u201d</p><p>Was that...flirting?</p><p>Kane paused only a moment before stomping over to her.</p><p>Yeah. That was flirting.</p><p>Synda fluttered her lashes at him and preened as he positioned her hands on her mallet. Rage stewed, bubbling up. Josephina hated seeing the warrior\u2014her warrior\u2014anywhere near the princess.</p><p>\u201cThis is still proving tedious,\u201d William said to the queen, in a stage whisper everyone could hear. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go upstairs and wait for me? In a few minutes, I\u2019ll follow, so no one will suspect we\u2019re together, and we\u2019ll play a game of a different sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Queen Penelope peered at her daughter, her mind clearly whirling. Then, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d</p><p>Off she raced, without a goodbye, heading toward the palace as if her feet were on fire.</p><p>They were lovers?</p><p>Josephina knew the queen had taken other men to her bed. Men the king had killed, though Tiberius had never admitted that was the reason why.</p><p>Poor William. He wouldn\u2019t survive, either.</p><p>He sidled up to her as if he hadn\u2019t a care.</p><p>\u201cYour friendship with Kane won\u2019t save you,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf the king finds out what you\u2019re doing with the queen, and he will, he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to save me, female?\u201d He flashed a perfect, white smile. \u201cHow adorable is that? But you\u2019re wasting your time. Your father is nothing more than a fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you challenge him, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd steal Kane\u2019s moment?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cExcuses, excuses.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBy the way, your step momma is a terrible lay. Seriously, I\u2019ve been with dead girls who have more life.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Too much information. She covered her ears.</p><p>William forced her hands to her sides. \u201cI\u2019m distracting her, and look, it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, why don\u2019t you distract the princess, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have one Big Willy, and he\u2019s currently on loan to the queen.\u201d</p><p>Synda gave a tinkling laugh, and Josephina looked over. The princess was now smashed against Kane, her arms wrapped around his neck. She was tiny and delicate in comparison, peering up at him with expectation of a kiss, and though he was stiff, he wasn\u2019t exactly fighting her off. Josephina\u2019s hands fisted tightly. If he did it, if he allowed his lips to meet the princess\u2019s, she would...she would...oh! There was no action violent enough.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of darkness inside him, you know,\u201d William said. \u201cYou\u2019re helping, I\u2019ll give you that, but if you can\u2019t stick around until it\u2019s all gone, back off. You\u2019ll both be better off.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders straightened in a snap. \u201cHow about you back off? I\u2019m dealing, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can do whatever he wants with whomever he wants anytime he wants.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were intelligent. He doesn\u2019t want that girl in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, he told me, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t marry her if he thinks that\u2019s the best course of action.\u201d And if he didn\u2019t? If he chose Josephina, as he\u2019d seemed to do this morning? What then?</p><p>The answer was simple: war.</p> <p>William reached over, plucked an ice-blue rose from the bushes, and tucked the bud behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he told you that much. You can\u2019t be mad at him for his plan, though. The only reason he\u2019d ever marry such a shrew would be to save you. Hopefully, though, it won\u2019t come to that.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully, he\u2019d said, as if there was a greater chance Kane would have to do it. \u201cAre you trying to help his chances with me or torch them?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, saying, \u201cListen up, and listen well. What Kane has gone through would have killed most people. He thinks I\u2019m staying with him to keep him away from White, but he\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m trying to help him heal. I can tell you being with him isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>Was he referring to Kane\u2019s time in hell? \u201cI know what he went through,\u201d she said.</p><p>William anchored two fingers under her chin and forced her to look up at him. \u201cHe told you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of it, yes. I also saw him right after it had happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprising. On both counts. He talked, and he let you live with the knowledge.\u201d He shrugged, and said, \u201cGive him time. He\u2019ll figure out the best course of action, it\u2019ll please you, things will smooth out, and you\u2019ll live happily ever after. I\u2019ll be quite disgusted, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Time? Was he serious? \u201cThe ball is tomorrow, and the wedding is the day after that. How much time do you think I should give him?\u201d And how selfish was she, to actually have put Kane in such a position? To marry her horrible sister, just to save her, or to marry her, and live with the ensuing bloodshed?</p><p>William smiled, and it wasn\u2019t a nice smile. \u201cAre you planning to run away if things don\u2019t go your way, little fairy? I\u2019d rethink that if I were you. He\u2019ll track you down. He may not punish you when he finds you, but I will. I\u2019ll do things to you you\u2019ve only read about in horror stories. I don\u2019t like to be inconvenienced, and I don\u2019t like to see my friends suffer. Combine the two, and I\u2019m afraid I get a little cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your threats. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d A waft of smoke sent her into a coughing fit. She searched the area, and found a raging fire spreading through the flowers.</p><p>She heard Kane curse under his breath. \u201cThe Phoenix is here,\u201d he threw at William before taking off in a run. Only, he stopped after just a few feet and turned. His narrowed gaze locked on the warrior, who still had his fingers under Josephina\u2019s chin, then he started running again\u2014in the opposite direction, flying straight toward the two of them.</p> <p>He launched himself at William, shouting, \u201cNo one touches her but me!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>HE HAD TO get himself under control.</p><p>Kane had tackled his only ally, just for touching his chosen female, allowing a mortal enemy to escape.</p><p>Now, that chosen female was nowhere to be found. She\u2019d run into the palace during his fight with William, and he hadn\u2019t been able to find her since. He was forced to sleep alone\u2014not that he did much sleeping. Without Tink in his bed, he couldn\u2019t relax.</p><p>By morning, the palace was a flurry of activity. Servants rushed here and there, cleaning and moving furniture around to accommodate three long buffet tables.</p><p>He caught one of those servants by the arm, stopping her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Josephina?\u201d</p><p>The female grinned up at him, delighted by his attention. \u201cI last saw her in the kitchen, Lord Kane. I\u2019ll fetch her, if you like. I\u2019ll do anything you ask.\u201d She stepped closer to him. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>Mine, Disaster said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll fetch her myself.\u201d He stalked to the kitchen\u2014and missed her by less than a handful of seconds.</p><p>He picked up a bowl, his grip so tight the crystal instantly shattered. He didn\u2019t want Tink working. He wanted her out of harm\u2019s way. He wanted to kiss her and finish what they\u2019d started yesterday morning. Then, when his body was calm\u2014finally, blissfully satiated\u2014he could figure out his next move.</p><p>He left the kitchen and ran into Synda. \u201cLord Kane!\u201d</p><p>Mine, Disaster shouted.</p><p>Her smile of greeting slowly faded. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not wearing those hideous clothes to the ball.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing the clothes he\u2019d come here in, but they were clean. \u201cWill you cancel if I do?\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek, and he stepped out of reach. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute when you expect the worst, but you\u2019re even cuter in the proper attire, so make sure you change, or I\u2019ll be very unhappy.\u201d With that, she skipped away.</p><p>Whatever. With Tink avoiding him, he might as well try to take care of her Phoenix problem. He slipped out of the palace and into the forest, pleased to find Petra had left tracks today. Ridiculously obvious tracks, he realized with a frown. Did she want to be captured?</p><p>Yeah, he thought a moment later. She did.</p><p>A long time ago, he\u2019d done something similar. He\u2019d planted tracks, allowing his enemy to find him and escort him into their camp. Once there, he\u2019d rained absolute and total destruction.</p><p>\u201c\u2014will suffer for what your people have done,\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>Kane pushed through a veil of bushes and found four Fae soldiers pinning Petra to the ground and tying her hands behind her back. She was struggling, but her efforts were puny at best.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, and stand back,\u201d Kane commanded, pulling the gun he hadn\u2019t given back to William and aiming at her head.</p><p>All eyes whipped to him.</p><p>The men frowned. Petra cursed.</p><p>\u201cBut Lord Kane, the other Phoenix have fled. When they return we can use this girl to threaten them,\u201d the shortest exclaimed.</p><p>Kane bared his teeth in a scowl. \u201cI said, let her go.\u201d</p><p>The four instantly stepped away from her. She popped to her feet, and the rope they\u2019d used fell away, the ends singed.</p><p>\u201cYou always ruin everything!\u201d she screeched with a stomp of her foot.</p><p>Mine, Disaster purred.</p><p>Shut it!</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have this out,\u201d Kane said. \u201cMe and you. Winner gets the girl.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, studied him with intrigue. \u201cYou\u2019d fight a female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do worse than that.\u201d Hadn\u2019t he proven it already?</p><p>She gloated, saying, \u201cKill me, and you\u2019ll only strengthen me. I\u2019ll rise from the ashes and enslave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not.\u201d</p><p>She paled at the reminder that no Phoenix was guaranteed an eternity. At some point they all died for good.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to kill you. I want to give you back to your people. After all, I was told your king would like to...speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Fear darkened her eyes, and she backed a step away. Kane smiled\u2014and squeezed the trigger once, twice. Screaming with pain and surprise, she collapsed. Blood leaked from both of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll do what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will I.\u201d Cringing, she reached for one of the gaping soldiers. The moment her fingers touched the male, he burst into flames, flailing about, screaming with agony. Kane lost sight of the girl as he patted the man down. By the time the flames had been doused, Petra was gone.</p><p>He hunted for one hour...two...six...determination driving his every movement. He found multiple trails of her blood, but no more than that. She remained expertly hidden.</p><p>His mood was black and stormy by the time he returned to the palace. He could hear the murmurings of the crowd, and remembered the party. Tink would be serving. Still in his \u201chideous\u201d clothes, he snuck in through one of the secret passageways and, after claiming a glass of whiskey, camped in a shadowed corner.</p><p>The ballroom had been decked out. The chandeliers dripped with diamonds as big as his fist, and dragon-shaped pillars had been wheeled inside. The heads moved, ruby eyes scanning the room, forked tongues darting from between blackened lips, and releasing smoke.</p><p>Fae males were dressed in weird, girly suits with lace and bows, and the women in big, puffy gowns, with their hair styled bizarrely, with knots and spikes shaped to look like animal heads. There was a lion. An eagle. An antelope. The atmosphere was very...Victorian era meets The Hunger Games in Wonderland, with an R rating. The men were feeding the women by hand, then going in for a taste themselves. On the dance floor, bodies gyrated together, hands roaming, clothing being shoved aside.</p><p>Kane watched as Synda fluttered from one group to another, sipping champagne and laughing gaily. The king had left his throne and now \u201cgraced\u201d the assembly with a dance. Leopold waited at the entrance, greeting guests as they arrived. The queen was perched on a settee in back, ten of her friends sitting at her feet, watching the proceedings with hawk eyes.</p><p>William\u2014my PMS\u2014had gotten his stupid kids an invitation, and the group had taken up residence in the corner across from Kane. They watched him watching them, trying to intimidate him. All they did was irritate him.</p><p>Ignoring them, he searched for Tink. She had to be here. She\u2014</p><p>Had just entered the room.</p><p>Breath caught in his throat. Her fall of black hair was tied in a simple bun at her nape, yet several tendrils had escaped confinement and framed the incomparable elegance of her face. She was captivating, and maddening, and utterly enchanting.</p><p>She was...everything.</p><p>He finished off his whiskey and dropped the glass in a potted plant. His blood heated, practically boiling in his veins as he pushed from the wall and stalked across the room. His gaze remained on her, studying her more intently. She wore the now-clean uniform he\u2019d bought for her, managing to outshine every other woman in the room.</p><p>She carried a tray and gathered empty glasses, stealthily looking this way and that, searching for someone. For him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A female stepped in his path and he ground to a halt to avoid plowing into her. \u201cYou\u2019re Lord Kane.\u201d A giggle filled the minute portion of air between them, overshadowing the soft hum of music in the background. She traced her fingertips along the center of his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been so eager to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He bit back an angry retort and set her aside.</p><p>Another girl moved into his path, and this one had brought a few of her friends. The females circled him, wolves intent on their prey, and rapid-fired comments at him.</p> <p>\u201cAsk me to dance, Lord Kane. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s adjourn to the balcony. I have a present I\u2019d love for you to unwrap. Hint\u2014it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband is spending the night with his mistress. I would love it if you kept me company tonight. I promise not to wear any clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I\u2019d be willing to do is spank the living hell out of you for accosting a stranger,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my engagement ball, and you think it\u2019s okay to come on to me?\u201d</p><p>Just like he thought it was okay to chase down Tink?</p> <p>Whatever.</p><p>He barreled past the floundering females. Finally he reached Tink and the tension inside him eased. \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>She gave him the swiftest of glances. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be talking to me.\u201d Her hands trembled as she gathered the glasses the guests had discarded in the oddest places\u2014and he cursed himself for what he\u2019d done with his own.</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever done what I\u2019m supposed to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. Now leave.\u201d</p><p>Disaster purred his approval.</p> <p>Anger sparked. \u201cWhy are you acting like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d</p><p>He gnashed his teeth. \u201cYou want me, Tink. Don\u2019t try to pretend otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so desperate for compliments?\u201d She tried to maneuver away from him, but he herded her in the other direction, away from the crowd and into the shadows. \u201cWhat are you doing? Stop. I\u2019m not giving you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a compliment I want from you, Tink. It\u2019s information. Why have you run from me today?\u201d</p><p>She wiped a few droplets of liquid from the wall before pressing her forehead into her hand. \u201cBecause! Whatever you want from me, Kane, I can\u2019t give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Because of Synda. Because he hadn\u2019t yet broken things off. Guilt had him looking away. He spotted Red\u2019s determined approach and realized it was just a matter of time before Green and Black decided to tag along. Kane latched onto Tink\u2019s arm and hauled her toward the secret doorway he\u2019d used.</p><p>He had her inside in less than a blink. Anyone watching would have had trouble tracking the movement.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI have a job to do.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand through his hair. A two-way mirror covered the wall, allowing them to peer inside the ballroom. \u201cDo you see the warriors standing where we just were?\u201d He pointed. \u201cThe ones from the bar?\u201d</p><p>She looked, groaned. \u201cYes. I see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want you for their own. They want to use your ability to remove the war, famine and death from their bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore enemies,\u201d she muttered. \u201cGreat. Just great!\u201d She whirled on him, eyes narrowed but no less ablaze. \u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m a disaster,\u201d he said hollowly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She peered at him for a long while, and whatever she saw in his expression calmed her down. Her shoulders stooped. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t what I was going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re trouble. Another threat against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d He stepped closer to her. She stepped back, widening the distance. He took another step, and another, and she did the same, until she had nowhere else to go. The wall behind her stopped her retreat.</p><p>He leaned down and rubbed his nose against hers. Contact with her was as necessary as breathing.</p><p>She closed her eyes, as if pained. \u201cHow do you do this to me, Kane?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me want you, despite everything.\u201d</p><p>He heard only two words\u2014want you. He moved swiftly, fitting his mouth over hers. Though she remained closed to him, he could already taste her, and desire rushed through him, drowning him.</p><p>Mine, he thought.</p><p>Never, Disaster spat.</p><p>\u201cLet me in,\u201d Kane said, ignoring the beast. This close, he could see each individual lash framing her crystalline eyes, and they were long and gorgeous, badges of innocence blended with wanton need.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>This time, when he dove in for a taste, her mouth was already open. He took full advantage, thrusting his tongue against hers.</p><p>Moaning, she gave up the pretense of resistance. Her arms wrapped around him as she kissed him back with the fervency of a starving woman.</p><p>He tried to slow things down, but she began to writhe against him, lost to the sensations, all inhibitions forgotten. He nipped at her mouth, and she nipped at his, and that was it. They became animals.</p><p>He growled, and she growled, and they ate at each other. He kneaded her breast with one hand, his grip strong, too strong, but just like before, she didn\u2019t seem to mind. He caged her wrists with the other and locked her arms above her head.</p><p>Her back arched, pressing her body more firmly against his.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cI like that word on your lips.\u201d Blood aflame, he lifted the hem of her dress. His knuckles brushed against the warm, tender skin on her inner thigh and he shuddered with the intensity of the pleasure. Then he hefted her up, anchored her, forcing her to wrap her legs around him, like she\u2019d done inside the dress shop, finding a measure of release and deeper need with his erection pressed against her.</p><p>His fingers curled around her backside, past the edge of her panties, seeking more intimate contact.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d she said, suddenly fighting to get away from him.</p><p>Concern instantly replaced desire as he set her on her feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She patted at the sleeve of her dress. Flames from one of the torches had showered over her.</p><p>Scowling, he backed away from her. As he tried to tamp down his raging need, he made sure to keep a safe distance. Disaster would flip his lid if Kane continued what he\u2019d started.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t always be this way, he reminded himself.</p><p>She sighed, gave him a pained look. \u201cJust proves we shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meant for each other, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She raised her arm with the charred sleeve. \u201cKane, did you see what just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think about me today?\u201d he interjected, needing her to affirm that there were feelings there, no matter what she was saying. \u201cDid you wish I was with you?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her arm. \u201cMore times than I liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about you, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered, her head down but her gaze remaining on him. \u201cWhy are we thinking about each other? It would be so much better for both of us if we walked away from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried. I can\u2019t.\u201d His gaze was piercing. \u201cI could marry you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment, looking as if she could burst into tears. Then, she closed the distance, expression more determined with every step. Before he could move away, she rested her hands on his shoulders. He stiffened, afraid for her, for what Disaster would do, but he didn\u2019t dissuade her. He yearned so badly for some kind of contact with her, even this.</p><p>\u201cI like your kisses,\u201d she said. \u201cI do. So much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike is too weak a word for how I feel about yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I like when you touch me. And I like you, snarly beast that you can sometimes be.\u201d Her chin trembled. \u201cThat\u2019s why it pains me to say...no. No, I...don\u2019t want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>He reared back as if she\u2019d nailed him with a hammer. \u201cBecause the demon burned you?\u201d he croaked. \u201cI won\u2019t always have him. I plan to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could lie and tell you that\u2019s why. I could tell you I want someone else and you\u2019re in the way. But the truth is, I don\u2019t think you can help me. Not without getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>He felt as if he\u2019d just been punched in the stomach. Like his friends, she doubted him. Had no faith in his abilities.</p><p>Disaster laughed with undiluted glee, at last appeased.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave this realm,\u201d she said with a tremor. \u201cTonight. Now.\u201d</p><p>Kane was a man well acquainted with pain. At least, he\u2019d thought so. Now, he learned the error of his ways. This was true pain. Rejection from the female he craved.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten good at building walls inside himself, and used the skill now. Expression even, giving nothing away, he said, \u201cVery well,\u201d with all the calm of a man discussing the weather. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you any longer.\u201d He turned from her and stalked out of the enclosure.</p><p>As he stormed down the hall, he ran into William.</p><p>\u201cThe problem?\u201d William asked after taking one look at him.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d he said. \u201cJust keep your boys away from Tink. I won\u2019t be around to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell-ooo. We\u2019ve talked about this. She\u2019s yours and I won\u2019t let them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mine,\u201d he interjected harshly. \u201cAnd keep your boys away from me, too. They come near me, and I won\u2019t be responsible for my actions.\u201d</p><p>He stalked away from William, grabbed the first drink he found, then another and another, and nearly drowned himself. He danced with Synda, twirling her across the floor. He danced with her friends. They put their hands all over him and he had to swallow back vomit time and time again. Then he danced with Synda again while the king nodded his approval.</p><p>\u201cI have to have you, Lord Kane,\u201d Synda whispered, warm breath fanning against his ear. \u201cLet me. Please. You won\u2019t regret it. I\u2019ll do anything you ask.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He opened his mouth to refuse her, locked gazes with Tink, who was watching him with guarded eyes as she cleaned a table, and said, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>The Realm of Blood and Shadows</p> <p>TORIN SAT AT his desk, fingers pounding at the computer keyboard with so much force he cracked the outer shell. Again. With a curse, he tossed the thing aside and grabbed a new one from his box of spare parts.</p><p>There were disturbances all over the world. People were fighting, rioting and looting. For no reason! Cameo and Viola were still missing, and he\u2019d failed to find a single trail to lead him to their whereabouts. They were out there, possibly hurt.</p><p>He had no idea what kind of defensive skills Viola possessed. Cameo, on the other hand, was a warrior to her soul and could take care of herself. He knew that. Had seen her fight. Girl had a wicked habit of slitting throats. But she wasn\u2019t infallible.</p><p>An unfamiliar sound caught his attention and he spun in his chair, cocking the gun he always kept in his lap.</p><p>A young girl stood there, holding her palms up, all innocence. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said in a strained whisper. Color drained from her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you and how did you get in here?\u201d he demanded, even as he looked her over.</p><p>She had dirty hair, at one time it might have been blond, the strands tangled and knotted and hanging limply to her elbows. A stained and ripped nightgown bagged over her too-thin body, the material falling all the way to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou are Torin, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Death, if you don\u2019t answer my questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not willing to share my name, and I flashed.\u201d Still she whispered. Why?</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll call you Crazy, because only a crazy person would come here without an invite.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, no inflection of emotion darkening her features. \u201cYou may call me whatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>Very accommodating, wasn\u2019t she? \u201cWhy are you here, female?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him, saying, \u201cPlease, may I lower my hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy arms are shaking, and I can\u2019t...I\u2019m not strong enough...\u201d Her arms lowered slowly, as if heavy weights had been tied to her wrists and pulled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Please don\u2019t shoot me. That\u2019s not the way I want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t like blood in my room.\u201d He lowered the gun as well, placing it on his thigh, making sure to keep the barrel aimed at her stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u2014but I\u2019ll deal with it. This is the last time I\u2019m going to ask. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Nervous, she twisted the fabric of her gown. \u201cCronus came to me several weeks ago and told me I was to grant you twenty-four hours of my time.\u201d</p><p>Still. Whispering. He didn\u2019t like it. He was reminded of all the nights he\u2019d spent with his friends, on the road, when they\u2019d found women and brought them back to the tent\u2014but he never had. The couples had tried to be quiet, but they\u2019d always failed.</p> <p>I want you, the females had whispered. I need you.</p><p>This girl\u2014</p><p>Her claim finally registered. Cronus was the former king of the Titans. Sienna, Paris\u2019s girl, had killed him, and taken over the Titan realm of the skies. But just before his death, Cronus had made a bargain with Torin. In exchange for guarding the All-key\u2014a spiritual relic capable of freeing the possessor from any lock\u2014Torin would be granted an entire day with a woman he would be able to touch without causing a plague.</p><p>Despite the king\u2019s death, the bargain must still stand.</p><p>And that might explain why the Paring Rod hadn\u2019t sucked him up. Because of the All-key, it couldn\u2019t hold him. A startling realization\u2014one that suddenly paled in comparison to the knowledge that he could...touch her...</p><p>The moisture in his mouth dried as he narrowed his study of her, taking in smaller details. Despite her disheveled state, she was pretty in a subtle, understated way. Her eyes were large and brown...and haunted. There were secrets inside her. Dark secrets. Her nose was small and rounded cutely at the end. Her upper lip was plumper than her bottom lip, and shaped into a heart.</p><p>Her hands were scabbed over and streaked with dirt. There was a bruise on the side of her neck\u2014and it wasn\u2019t a hickey. It was too long, too thin, and extended under the fabric of her gown.</p><p>She stood utterly still, quiet, allowing him to scrutinize her at his leisure. Her gaze remained averted, glued to the side of the wall. It had taken a warrior\u2019s courage to come, and yet she couldn\u2019t face him head-on while he looked his fill?</p><p>Touch her, he thought again.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Torin asked more gently. \u201cPlease. I have to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I won\u2019t offer my name.\u201d</p><p>Why? What reason could she have to deny him? \u201cWill you tell me why you\u2019re whispering?\u201d he asked\u2014in a whisper.</p><p>Bright red spots grew on her cheeks. \u201cThis is my voice. I can\u2019t talk with any other or any louder.\u201d</p><p>Why? And how many more times would he be forced to ask that question?</p><p>\u201cMay I...sit?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes roved over the bedroom so few people had ever entered. His dirty clothes were on the floor. His bed was unmade. Empty beer bottles littered the nightstand and desk.</p><p>He hopped to his feet and raced around the spacious enclosure, gathering clothes, tossing out bottles. He also made the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cSit. Are you hungry? Thirsty?\u201d</p><p>Hesitant, she eased onto the floor instead of any of the chairs or the bed. \u201cI... Yes,\u201d she replied. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave her, so, he did something he\u2019d never done before. He withdrew his cell and phoned Reyes, the keeper of Pain, saying, \u201cBring me a couple of sandwiches. And chips. And brownies. And sodas. And anything else we have. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called,\u201d the warrior said. \u201cDanika has\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hurry.\u201d He hung up before Reyes could reply.</p><p>\u201cYou have servants?\u201d the girl asked, finally meeting his gaze.</p><p>His hands began to sweat. Ugh. He couldn\u2019t touch her with sweaty hands. \u201cI have friends.\u201d He motioned to the bed, his arm trembling. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather sit somewhere more comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s fine. I\u2019m so dirty. And I know I must smell, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019re good just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>She peered down at her hands, once again wringing the fabric of her gown. \u201cYou are Disease, I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Disease. I just host him.\u201d And he wanted the demon out. So much so, he\u2019d even spent a little time with the angels. Or rather, the Sent Ones led by the cold-as-ice Zacharel. He\u2019d learned that demons could enter a body, create a stronghold and produce a terrible toxin that destroyed the possessor from the inside out. Fear strengthened the toxin\u2014and thereby the demon\u2014and joy weakened it.</p><p>But he\u2019d had no reason to entertain joy. Until now.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in this condition?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d...rather not discuss that, either.\u201d</p><p>So many secrets. \u201cHow did Cronus get you to agree to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I get it.\u201d No personal information was to be shared. He didn\u2019t like it, but he wasn\u2019t going to push. She could flash away, and he would be unable to chase her down. \u201cYou know my name, and you know about the demon, but do you know anything else about me?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment, shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you\u2019ve figured out by now that I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d Despite his threats.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the food.\u201d Torin rushed to open up and came face-to-face with a scowling Reyes. The warrior was tall and dark and intense, and holding a sack of goodies in one hand and a small painting in the other. \u201cThanks, man. I owe you. Just leave everything on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Reyes demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d He was in the process of straightening, his gaze sweeping through the room out of habit. A warrior knew to check his surroundings. He spotted the girl and did a double take. \u201cYou have a female in here?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his jaw tightened. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes found him and pleaded. \u201cTorin, man. Cameo and Viola are missing. We don\u2019t need a plague on our hands, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched her, but even if I had, you wouldn\u2019t need to worry. She\u2019s immune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s good, but she could still become a carrier, right? Let me escort her out of the fortress before any damage is done. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. She\u2019s fine.\u201d Could she become a carrier? Cronus hadn\u2019t said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at risk right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trust me, okay?\u201d Torin bent down, grabbed the bags.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Reyes thrust the painting at him, forcing him to take it.</p><p>He did. Reluctantly. He didn\u2019t want to know the future. He didn\u2019t want to know if only doom awaited him.</p><p>Reyes rubbed two fingers across his stubbled chin, and said, \u201cDanika painted the canvas last night, and I thought you\u2019d find the finished product interesting. You\u2019ll want to take a look. Trust me.\u201d The warrior turned on his booted heel and stomped away. No doubt to inform the rest of the gang what was going on.</p><p>Gossips!</p><p>Torin shouldered the door closed and faced the girl. Her gaze was latched on the bags.</p><p>How long since she\u2019d eaten?</p><p>He set the painting down and turned it around, facing the colored side toward the wall. One day, he\u2019d look. But not today. He\u2019d been waiting for this day forever it seemed.</p><p>He moved forward, crouched in front of the girl, and set a feast before her. She didn\u2019t react immediately, was too busy taking everything in. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s yours. Whatever you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached out with a trembling hand and took one of the sandwiches. Her eyes closed as she bit into the bread, and she chewed slowly, as if relishing the flavors. Then, driven by a need she couldn\u2019t control, she tore into the food with abandon.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get sick.\u201d</p><p>She acted as if she hadn\u2019t heard him, devouring every crumb, draining every drop of soda. He could only watch, fascinated. And spectacularly angry. Clearly, she had been starved.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d he asked. What he really wanted to know: Who was responsible for this?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me you\u2019re over the age of eighteen.\u201d She looked so young.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...not, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m seventeen.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment hit him, and hit him hard.</p> <p>She flattened her hand over her middle, those ocean blue eyes going wide. A moan of pain escaped her.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cToo much too fast?\u201d</p><p>She leaped to her feet, gasping out, \u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom is to the left.\u201d</p><p>She raced into the small enclosure, and Torin stayed right on her heels. When she hunched over the toilet, he did something he\u2019d never before done, even though, like now, he always wore gloves. He grabbed her hair and held it back. And just in time as she heaved the contents of her stomach.</p><p>When she finished, he released her and stepped back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a shower? Everything you need is in this room, even a change of clothes.\u201d He kept a few shirts and sweatpants in here. He kept shirts and sweatpants everywhere, actually, always wanting to be covered, never wanting to risk exposing his skin to another\u2019s touch.</p> <p>A female had never worn his clothing before, and he kind of liked the idea.</p><p>But she\u2019s only seventeen, and you aren\u2019t a cradle robber.</p><p>Stupid Cronus, finding him a girl too young to touch.</p><p>At least, for now.</p><p>She remained slumped on the floor and wouldn\u2019t look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better, and then you can try eating again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need my help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. No,\u201d she reiterated.</p><p>Thank the Most High. He wasn\u2019t sure how he would have reacted. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done, we\u2019ll talk, all right?\u201d He shut the door, sealing her inside.</p><p>Several minutes passed before he heard the water switch on. While she showered, he paced, waiting. Thinking. Twenty-four hours, she\u2019d said. That\u2019s how long he had with her. That wasn\u2019t long enough.</p><p>He wanted to ask when she would turn eighteen. He wanted to drop to his knees and pray it happened during their time together.</p><p>Creepy much?</p><p>Surely she would not become a carrier of his disease. Cronus wouldn\u2019t have sent him a carrier. The moment she was an adult, Torin could allow himself to touch her. It didn\u2019t have to be sexual, either. They could hold hands.</p><p>To experience the warmth of another\u2019s skin, the softness, the sense of connection, the tactile knowledge that he wasn\u2019t alone...</p><p>He moaned at the heady thought.</p><p>A long while later, she emerged, a cloud of steam following her. Wet, her hair was dark, almost brown. She\u2019d brushed it, but the strands had decided to curl. With the dirt scrubbed off her face, he could see the purity of her skin. Pale, like porcelain, with a slight tracery of veins. Flawless.</p><p>She wore his clothing, the material so loose it bagged on her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said in that whispery voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she shifted uncomfortably, still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI know I get twenty-four hours with you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather not take them consecutively. I\u2019d rather spread them out. One hour a day, for twenty-four days. Would you be okay with that?\u201d He could use the time to earn her trust, to get her talking and relaxed. Happy to see him. And maybe, if his luck was holding, she would want to keep seeing him.</p><p>Surprised baby blues landed on him. \u201cBut I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She bit her bottom lip, nodded. \u201cConditions allow for it, so, yes, I would prefer to come an hour a day for twenty-four days.\u201d</p><p>His knees almost buckled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, saying, \u201cUntil tomorrow.\u201d In a blink, she was gone.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>JOSEPHINA HURRIEDLY STUFFED her meager possessions in a bag. A wad of cash she\u2019d saved. A change of clothing. Her mother\u2019s locket\u2014one she never wore, too afraid someone would rip it from her neck.</p><p>Kane hadn\u2019t left. His wedding was today, and she wasn\u2019t going to stick around to watch. Maybe he\u2019d go through with it. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t. She had a feeling she would wonder for the rest of her life\u2014and cry.</p><p>As she tied the bag closed, her stomach clenched. Tears beaded in her eyes, and she sniffed with frustration. Stupid tears! They came so often now. Ever since she\u2019d met Kane.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have kissed him that last time.</p><p>But she\u2019d lost herself in the pleasure and the riotous sensations and the heat and the pressure and the need...everything. The past had fallen away. The desire to die, muted as it had become, had breathed its last. Kane had become her world, and she hadn\u2019t wanted to ever be found.</p><p>And he\u2019d wanted to stay with her, too. But...yeah. But: the word that had ruined everything. She\u2019d had a choice. Be with him, risking the wrath of the king, or be without him, protecting him.</p><p>Protecting him had seemed more important than her desire\u2014but only by the slightest degree.</p><p>One day, Kane might even thank her. Heck, he was already happy without her. He\u2019d left the ball with Synda and though Josephina had looked for him, she hadn\u2019t seen him since. She had no idea what had happened between the pair, but rumors were rampant. Kane had spent the night in her bedroom.</p><p>One of the tears spilled over, and she wiped it away with the back of her hand.</p><p>Whatever. Alone in the servant\u2019s wing, Josephina tiptoed down the hall and peeked out the window overlooking the driveway. A line of carriages stretched down the road; each contained an Opulen probably bursting with eagerness to reach the royal gate. The wedding was set to begin any minute.</p><p>There was no better time for escape. The servants were busy below. The king and queen were distracted. The guards had to watch the grounds to make sure the Phoenix stayed away.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d a voice said from behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re actually running from me?\u201d</p><p>She spun around and came face-to-face with a very angry Kane. He wasn\u2019t wearing wedding finery. In fact, he looked...slovenly. He wore a wrinkled T-shirt that read Honey Badger Don\u2019t Care, whatever that meant, and his pants were ripped in several places. His eyes were bloodshot, and thick lines of tension branched from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in the human realm, or better yet, downstairs preparing for your nuptials?\u201d she demanded, hating him, hating herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that eager to marry me off?\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin, refusing to reveal the turmoil inside her. \u201cYou bedded the princess, didn\u2019t you? I think you\u2019ve got enough eagerness for the both of us.\u201d</p><p>His features softened, making him appear boyish and hopeful and so lovely her chest hurt. \u201cDo I detect a note of jealousy, Tink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly don\u2019t! I don\u2019t care what you do or what skank you do it with.\u201d</p><p>A lie. She hated lies. What was wrong with her? Since meeting him, she\u2019d become more than a crybaby. She\u2019d become a shrew.</p><p>The softness vanished in a blink, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cAll right. Yeah. I slept with her. I also slept with a boatload of women before I even reached S\u00e9duire. But you know what? Synda was the best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>It was like a punch to the gut, a blow so low she wasn\u2019t sure she would ever recover. Humiliation burned in her cheeks, and maybe it was fused with disappointment and fury. How could he! How could he go from Josephina\u2019s kisses to Synda\u2019s bed, and then brag about it?</p><p>The fury suddenly overshadowed every other emotion.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said as drily as she was able. \u201cYou\u2019re officially like every other man in this realm.\u201d She had saved his life, and he had saved hers. Circumstances hadn\u2019t allowed them to be lovers, but they could have been friends. She\u2019d always wanted to be his friend. Yet he\u2019d just ruined any hope for such an outcome. \u201cI wish you\u2019d stayed away from me. I wish I\u2019d never met you.\u201d</p><p>His features didn\u2019t change, not this time, but his voice went low and quiet, dripping with disdain. \u201cToo bad. I didn\u2019t, and you did, and you have no one but yourself to blame. You should have left me in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m about to do just that.\u201d She tried to step around him.</p><p>He moved with her, blocking her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere. Synda got into trouble last night and she\u2019s earned another punishment.\u201d</p><p>Josephina froze. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>It had to do with him, didn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to be whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d That would mean the king was searching for Josephina. She knew him. Knew he would actually postpone the wedding ceremony to find her, wanting the situation dealt with before placing Synda\u2014and thereby Josephina\u2014into another man\u2019s care. And if he discovered she\u2019d planned an escape... How could Kane be so cavalier about it? Shaking her head, she backed away from him. \u201cHow could you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want any of this to happen, Tink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that! You don\u2019t get to call me by a cutesy nickname when you just ruined my only chance for freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want freedom?\u201d His volume increased with every word. \u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll get your freedom. Right now. Then, I\u2019ll be leaving the realm, and so will you. But don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t be with you, so you won\u2019t have to fear my inability to protect you.\u201d He extended his arm, intending to grab her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She jolted out of reach. \u201cI believe you can protect me, idiot, I just don\u2019t want you hurt doing it. And if you do this, you\u2019ll be hurt. They\u2019ll hunt you. Forever.\u201d</p><p>The sharpest edge of his intensity dulled. \u201cBeing hunted was something you were willing to risk, obviously. Do me a favor and allow me the same choice.\u201d</p><p>She...had no response to that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about this, and thought about this, and I\u2019ve nearly given myself a brain aneurism from thinking some more, and this morning I finally picked a plan and decided to stick with it. You\u2019re not going to like it, but honestly? I don\u2019t really care. I don\u2019t like you within these walls, and I can\u2019t deal with the demon any longer. I have to get out of here, and I have to kill him or I\u2019m going to start hurting people, maybe even you. Again.\u201d</p><p>He was rambling, without giving her any useful information. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d He lunged for her, latching onto her before she could get away, and draping her over his shoulder. A favorite position of his. At the moment of contact, breath exploded from her lungs. She kicked and hit at him, but he sped into motion without missing a beat. \u201cEvery woman I come across throws herself at me, but not you. You keep fighting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably wise.\u201d He took her through secret passages he shouldn\u2019t have known about, up several flights of stairs, and into the daylight. \u201cWhy are you still wearing gloves? You know you can control your ability now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause my hands are ugly.\u201d People had begun staring.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. Believe me. They\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She caught the scent of freshly cut grass and flowers, and the sound of murmuring voices...voices tapering to a quiet. Shock bombarded her, and she stilled. He wasn\u2019t sneaking out. He was walking through the crowd of wedding guests. How could he...the courage such an act required...the utter stupidity!</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d marry your daughter, and I will,\u201d Kane called to the king. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change. But I want this one.\u201d</p><p>What! Marry...Josephina? Despite their discord? No, that couldn\u2019t be right.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s two ways this can go down. You\u2019ll either gain a connection to my family by giving Josephina to me\u2014in marriage\u2014or I\u2019ll kill you here and now. Pick.\u201d</p> <p>Yes. Her. But...but...</p><p>I won\u2019t let him. I\u2019ll put a stop to it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leopold, standing behind the sputtering king, snarled. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with option two,\u201d a male said with a laugh, interrupting him. \u201cI\u2019ll finally get to put my pimp hand to good use.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and watched as William, Red, Black, White and Green stepped into the gazebo where the royal family awaited the bride and groom. All five warriors were armed for war. Swords peeked over their shoulders. Guns were sheathed at their waists. And there were more men behind them! Men she recognized from the picture books the scribes had commissioned.</p><p>Oh, sweet lightning. The Lords of the Underworld were here. The frightful males were loaded with even more weapons than William and his crew. There was the scarred Lucien, the dark Reyes, the scary Sabin and the irreverent Strider.</p><p>Her heart sped into a faster rhythm. \u201cHi,\u201d she called, and waved at Lucien. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening. I\u2019ve dreamed of this day all my life.\u201d</p><p>His scarred features were pale, and there were bruises under his eyes. He looked as if he\u2019d been without sleep for several centuries. \u201cYour wedding?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not getting married. I\u2019ve been waiting to meet you,\u201d she said, her voice fluttering.</p><p>\u201cAll right, calm yourself,\u201d Kane muttered. \u201cAnd yes, you\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane\u2014\u201d</p><p>He continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t want help, but I realized I needed it. There was no other way. But don\u2019t you ever trust the Rainbow Rejects. They\u2019re only aiding me now so they\u2019ll have an easier shot at you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam, my darkling,\u201d the queen gasped out. \u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019re to be my protector.\u201d</p><p>The king roared, \u201cDarkling? You\u2019re calling another male by my pet name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, both of you,\u201d William snapped, all humor gone. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard enough out of you.\u201d</p><p>The queen\u2019s mouth floundered open and closed, but she never made another sound.</p><p>Leopold stepped forward, but Red reached out and grabbed him by the neck, jerking him backward. In the next blink, a blade was poised at the prince\u2019s hammering pulse and he was gurgling in pain, a bead of blood leaking to the fluffy collar of his dress shirt. He tried to speak, but the weapon prevented any sound from forming.</p><p>\u201cBut what about me?\u201d Synda called, racing up behind Kane, her wedding dress not quite fastened. She had to hold up the beautiful Fae lace with her hands. And her veil was askew, about to fall out of her pale curls.</p><p>\u201cShut it, woman,\u201d Kane snapped, mimicking William. \u201cIf I have to listen to one more bit of cruel, inane chatter from you, I\u2019ll remove your tongue. I swear I will.\u201d</p><p>Synda stopped, just stopped. No one had ever rejected her before\u2014well, not for long. Bewilderment and hurt danced in her eyes, and Josephina almost felt sorry for her. Almost. She was too busy reeling. Kane had just put the girl in her place.</p><p>Red bloomed in the princess\u2019s eyes as she marched through the sea of guests, throwing people out of their chairs.</p><p>The king blustered, saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way of things, Lord Kane. We should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick,\u201d Kane shouted. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for commentary.\u201d</p><p>Silence rolled through the masses, every gaze on Tiberius. The king switched his attention between Kane and his friends.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he finally gritted.</p><p>\u201cGood choice.\u201d Kane placed Josephina on her feet and glared down at her.</p><p>\u201cShould I curtsy to your friends?\u201d she asked to hide her nervousness. \u201cI feel like I should curtsy.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in until they were nose-to-nose. \u201cYou\u2019ll accept this. Whatever you feel about me, whatever you believe about me, this is the best choice for you right now.\u201d</p><p>A wave of dizziness struck her. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do this.\u201d She needed to tell him something else, but...what? She couldn\u2019t recall.</p><p>\u201cUnlike your father, I\u2019m not giving you a choice.\u201d He turned to the male officiating the ceremony. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Begin.\u201d</p><p>The priest obeyed him, but she didn\u2019t hear a word he said. Her thoughts were too loud. Surely she couldn\u2019t marry the very warrior that had slept with her half sister only last night. Surely she couldn\u2019t allow him to welcome a lifelong war. Surely she wouldn\u2019t bind her life to his, giving herself to him, while wearing a maid\u2019s uniform, looking her worst.</p><p>Even if he was the most incredible man she\u2019d ever met...even if every inch of her body screamed, yes!</p><p>But would he ever be faithful?</p><p>Did he even want her or was he just trying to protect her, as he felt he owed her?</p><p>Her gaze strayed to Kane\u2019s friends. What had they thought of her at first glance? She\u2019d been slung over Kane\u2019s shoulder so...probably not much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really quite wonderful,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019ve told me,\u201d Kane said. \u201cNow answer the priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, just as soon as you tell me what he asked me.\u201d</p><p>The same murderous red she\u2019d just seen in Synda\u2019s eyes pulsed from Kane\u2019s. \u201cJust say yes,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>A beam in the canopy above them snapped and fell, and Kane had to drag her out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cI will if the question was, does Kane annoy you? Because yes, he does,\u201d she said, attention returning to the other lords.</p><p>\u201cTell me the answer to that question again,\u201d Kane demanded, but he didn\u2019t sound offended.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she threw at him.</p><p>He nodded, satisfied.</p><p>Lucien winked at her and she couldn\u2019t help but offer him as big of a smile as she could manage at the moment. Reyes nodded in acknowledgment. Strider gave her a thumbs-up. Sabin continued to glare. She wanted Kane\u2019s friends to like her\u2014even though she didn\u2019t currently like Kane.</p><p>\u201cThis is a mistake,\u201d she whispered. Yes! Those were the words she\u2019d wanted to give him. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do this. Let\u2019s stop before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand so tightly she whimpered, but even then, he didn\u2019t loosen his grip. He slid a ring on her finger, the metal heavy, with a huge stone glittering in the center. A stone she didn\u2019t recognize. The color hovered somewhere between ruby-red and sapphire-blue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already too late. Don\u2019t ever take this off, understand?\u201d Kane said.</p><p>Too late? They were...they were...no way.</p><p>Still. Eyes wide, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, and here\u2019s the big guy\u2019s ring,\u201d William said, handing her a plain, over-warm band that was vibrating.</p><p>Trembling, she slid the thing onto Kane\u2019s finger, and finally he released her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he said, and there was a wealth of satisfaction in his voice.</p><p>Josephina could only nod, dazed.</p><p>A scream nearly split the daylight. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking her away from me!\u201d</p><p>Not Synda. But...the Phoenix?</p><p>Definitely. The entire back end of the garden burst into flames.</p><p>Kane threw Josephina over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNot again,\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>Lucien held out his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll take her now. And I\u2019ll take good care of her, you have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange of plan,\u201d Kane said. \u201cShe\u2019s going with me. At least for now. Get the others to safety. And thanks for coming, my man.\u201d He took off in a dead run. Smoke wafted to her nose, making her cough. Shouts of fear erupted through the crowd. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow do you propose to leave the realm?\u201d she asked, trying not to panic. Only a select group of Fae possessed a key between the human realm and this one. Kane wasn\u2019t select, nor was he Fae. She had planned to steal Leopold\u2019s for her own escape, but that was now an impossibility.</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d Kane withdrew a flesh-colored glove from his pocket\u2014a key. \u201cBefore you ask, I stole it. And no, I\u2019m not ashamed and I won\u2019t return it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to chastise you, you silly man. I want to pat you on the back. Now, do you know how to use it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He quickened his pace.</p><p>She expected some of the guards to chase him, no matter what her father had said, and she expected guests to try and pass him, desperate to get away from the fires, but he was moving too fast for anyone to catch. Within seconds, he was at the front gate and he wasn\u2019t even winded.</p><p>He fit the glove over his hand and waved from high to low, side to side, in the shape of a door. A sheet of the landscape fell away from every place he touched, leaving a black hole.</p><p>\u201cThink about where you want to go, and step through,\u201d she hurried to explain, even though he\u2019d claimed to know what to do.</p><p>He stalked into the darkness, and then, suddenly, they were out of the realm of the Fae and in the realm of the humans. Tall buildings knifed on both of her sides. Harried people strode along narrow sidewalks. The scent of coffee and car exhaust and even urine filled her nose.</p> <p>\u201cClose the door,\u201d she said, and he obeyed, once again waving his hand through the air.</p><p>He set her on her feet, took her by the wrist, and tugged her forward. \u201cLet\u2019s go. The door might be closed, but I want you as far away from it as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York. I want you masked by the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Should have guessed, she thought. She\u2019d been here before, and there was no place like it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your friends?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to leave me in their keeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while, yes.\u201d</p><p>A while. How long was a while? Probably better not to know.</p><p>They walked for hours, and the more they walked, the busier the streets and sidewalks became. Any other time, the crowd would have bothered her, but just then her mind was too busy reeling. She was out of the Fae realm. She was with Kane. Maybe even married to him\u2014had they truly finished the ceremony? They\u2019d never kissed.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, she supposed. For a little while, she would be safe from her family. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being punished. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the king hunting her down for a few days, at the very least. He would need time to plan a strategy against a man like Kane.</p><p>For the first time in her life, she was free.</p><p>Joy burst through her, and with the joy came an unquenchable desire to truly live. To do all the things she\u2019d never dreamed possible. To fall in love, get married and\u2014wait. She was already married. Maybe. She would have to talk to Kane about that. He probably hadn\u2019t meant his vows. If he\u2019d spoken any vows, that is. She could have slapped herself for not paying attention. For all she knew, she\u2019d pledged to be his slave.</p> <p>Whatever. It still didn\u2019t matter. With this first taste of freedom, her entire world had changed. She\u2019d already decided she was done accepting the abuse thrown her way. But now, she was done allowing fear to hold her captive. The future was hers to embrace, and she would hold on as tightly as she could.</p><p>Kane flicked a glance in her direction, did a double take. He stopped, and his eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, nearly bumping into him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smiling.\u201d There was a reverent tone to his voice, one he\u2019d never used before.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d She reached up and patted her lips, and yes, she was smiling.</p><p>For the second time that day, his features softened. \u201cYou\u2019re happy, and you wear it well.\u201d But a second later, his cheeks blushed, and he turned away. \u201cCome on. I haven\u2019t slept in days and I\u2019m about to crash. We need a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>New York</p><p>WIFE.</p><p>The word echoed through Kane\u2019s mind all through the night. He toyed with the ring William had given him, a simple gold band that should have been cool to the touch but wasn\u2019t; the metal burned him and he wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>Wife.</p><p>He had a wife. A woman forever bound to his side. She was his, and he was hers. Not just instinctively, but legally. The knowledge did something to him. Something powerful. Before, he\u2019d only scratched the surface of possessive. Now, the sensation dominated. Tink. Was. His.</p><p>Want and need combined, creating a combustible fire. He burned. He ached. He yearned.</p><p>Finally, he would have.</p><p>His hand shook as he reached out and smoothed a lock of hair from her cheek. The long, thick length of her eyelashes fluttered open, and he found himself peering into beautiful baby blues.</p><p>After renting the room, he\u2019d climbed into bed and tucked her into the curve of his body. She hadn\u2019t protested. He\u2019d left the lamps on, and now, golden light cascaded over her. She was curled on her side, facing him. Locks of dark hair spilled over the pillow and sheets.</p><p>He should have given her to Lucien, as planned. The warrior would have taken her to the Realm of Blood and Shadows, and Kane would have gone about the business of finding a way to kill the demon. But the arrival of the Phoenix had changed everything. He\u2019d wanted\u2014needed\u2014Tink within his sights, his to protect from the flames.</p><p>Even though she hadn\u2019t wanted to marry him.</p><p>Now, it was done, and there was nothing she could do about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband,\u201d he said, almost angrily. He didn\u2019t pull his hand away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, maybe?\u201d</p><p>She traced a fingertip along the shape of her lips, as if remembering something\u2014or yearning for it. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t exactly remember what vows were exchanged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to be my wife, and I agreed to be your husband. That\u2019s enough. It\u2019s done. There\u2019s no changing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could, I don\u2019t know...get an annulment maybe. We\u2019ve both been prisoners, Kane, and I\u2019m not going to be your new cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a cage. You\u2019re my everything.\u201d Moving with a speed he usually reserved for the battlefield, he cupped the back of her neck and dragged her against him. The softness of her body collided with the hardness of his, and he had to grind his teeth to silence a hiss of pleasure. \u201cNo annulment. Later, no divorce. Death is the only thing that will part us.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared with hope, only to quickly narrow with suspicion. \u201cAre you going to be with other women while we\u2019re together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And that was the truth. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with Synda. I shouldn\u2019t have lied. I\u2019m not a liar, and I won\u2019t do it again. Not for any reason. I was hurt by what you said, and lashing out.\u201d</p><p>A pause, as if she didn\u2019t dare hope he\u2019d spoken honestly. \u201cReally?\u201d Her eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But not as low as actually sleeping with her would have been,\u201d he added, hoping she\u2019d agree.</p><p>Slowly, she nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been devastated by her rejection, and he\u2019d wanted out of that ballroom so badly he\u2019d leaped at the first opportunity. Sleeping with Synda had never been a consideration. \u201cI tucked her in to bed, then sat on the couch in the adjacent room most of the night, making sure she stayed put and out of trouble. At least, I thought I was making sure. She used a secret passage I didn\u2019t know about and snuck out to have sex with Red in the garden.\u201d</p><p>Tink slid her hand across the small space between them and traced her fingers over the center of his chest, where the dragon brand had been. The pleasure...it was too much, not enough. He hooked one of her legs over his waist, twining their bodies as much as possible while they were still clothed.</p><p>He could barely breathe, but he could do nothing until he\u2019d told her the truth about him. He\u2019d made too many mistakes with her to make another. She would think less of him, yes. How could she not? But he was going to be with her. Here. Tonight. He wanted this marriage cemented. And if he had a negative reaction to something she did, he didn\u2019t want her worried about the reason or thinking he didn\u2019t want her.</p><p>\u201cThe other women I mentioned...I told the truth. I was with them before I found you. I thought sex with them would make me forget what had happened in hell, that I\u2019d forget about being helpless, but it only made me feel worse. Memories taunted me and I...vomited after every encounter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kane,\u201d she said, shifting her fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>No judgment. Just compassion.</p><p>Once he had thought he hated compassion, the cousin to pity. Not today. \u201cYou make me crave things I never thought I\u2019d crave again.\u201d He nuzzled the side of her neck. \u201cI want to be with you, Tinker Bell.\u201d Wanted everything she had to give.</p><p>\u201cI...I...want to be with you, too. I want to smother your bad memories with good. I want to be all you know, all you see.\u201d So softly admitted. \u201cWhat I said at the ball, in the secret room...Kane, I believe in you. I really do. You are the strongest, bravest male I know, but I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being the reason your life was thrown into another war.\u201d</p><p>Any remaining hurt was soothed.</p><p>War. Disaster laughed. I\u2019ll give her war. I\u2019ll make sure you break her heart before I kill her.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t break her heart. He wouldn\u2019t let her be hurt...ever.</p><p>\u201cSome things are worth fighting for, Tink, and I\u2019ll prove it. Give me a minute.\u201d Kane left her in bed and prowled through the room, stacking all lamps and wall hangings in the bathroom, then shutting the door and rigging the lock. Soft moonlight drifted into the space as he crawled back into bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tink softened against him, warm and welcoming.</p><p>Now...now he was finally going to have her.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he said, the hunger gnawing at him now. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p> <p>A moment passed before she nodded.</p><p>\u201cRoll over.\u201d</p><p>This time, there was no hesitation. She obeyed.</p><p>\u201cI want to be everything you need,\u201d she said, \u201cthe way you\u2019re everything I need.\u201d</p><p>A heart he\u2019d thought hardened beyond redemption thrilled. \u201cYou already are.\u201d He rose on an elbow and unbuttoned the back of her uniform. As the material parted, his eyes adjusted to the dark and he was able to see the plain white undergarments she wore. Lovely. Pure.</p> <p>Every inch his.</p><p>\u201cAll right. On your back.\u201d</p><p>Again she obeyed.</p><p>As he eased the gown from her shoulders, down her waist, and over her feet, she shivered. The undergarments and then her ring and gloves received the same treatment, at last leaving her bare. Beautifully, exquisitely bare.</p><p>He looked her over more leisurely. She lay utterly still, allowing him to drink his fill. He could only marvel. Every inch of her had been made for his specific tastes. Lush, yet slender. Ripe for plucking, yet delightfully innocent. She undid him. Destroyed him. Ruined him for all other females.</p><p>My woman is perfect.</p> <p>\u201cWait, my ring,\u201d she said, trying to swipe it out of his hold.</p><p>He held it back, out of reach. \u201cNot until you promise the gloves are gone for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so important to you, but all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be what\u2019s known as a disgustingly lovey-dovey couple. I want skin, not leather.\u201d</p><p>As her features softened, she said, \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He slid the ring back on her finger.</p><p>Her lips lifted in a slooow grin. A vixen\u2019s grin. \u201cNow, it\u2019s time for you to take something off. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to be fair.\u201d A dark fever drove him as he ripped off his clothing. Tink\u2019s eyes devoured with the same greed he had displayed. He wished he had the patience to let her study as he had studied, but need could no longer be denied. He stretched on top of her, remembering at the last second to brace his weight on his elbows, and oh, the agony. The agony of being this close to her and not being inside her.</p> <p>Have to get inside her.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d he demanded, and she obeyed.</p><p>Suddenly he could feel her against him, the most intimate part of her, all barriers gone; the exquisite, moist heat nearly pushed him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kane. It\u2019s...it\u2019s...\u201d With her nails in his back, she arched against him.</p><p>As he swooped in to kiss her, the bed began to shake, stopping him even while grinding him against her with far more force.</p><p>He hissed. She cried out.</p><p>\u201cSilly demon,\u201d she said on a moan. \u201cThis is actually...oh...oh! Don\u2019t stop, Kane. Please, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Disaster cursed. The bed ceased moving.</p><p>Growling, Kane smashed his mouth into her. He\u2019d meant to proceed gently, but...screw gentleness. She hadn\u2019t wanted it any time before.</p><p>She opened for him immediately, welcoming him, moaning with her pleasure; he swallowed the sound. He kissed her, kissed her harder, kissed her deeper, every second wrought with more tension than the last. As his hands moved on her breasts, her stomach, between her legs, she came alive.</p><p>A crack echoed. He caught the scent of plaster in the air. The wall was taking the brunt of the demon\u2019s fury.</p><p>Tink started.</p><p>\u201cForget him,\u201d Kane said. He fit his hand between her lower back and the mattress, and lifted her, drawing her more firmly against him, fitting them together until not even a whisper separated them.</p><p>She gasped. Her fingers shifted through his hair, tugging the strands. \u201cAlready done. Now give me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d His lips returned to hers in a fierce meeting of mouths, dueling tongues, and nipping teeth. The passion...the utter rapture. The ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her hands roamed over him, exploring him, learning him, fisting his length, and that should have bothered him, but he was too relieved to be with her to entertain even a glimmer of reservation. The past fell away. There was only Tink and this moment and the pleasure and the light. Here, in her arms, surrounded by her, accepted by her, needed by her, the wounds inside his soul finally began to heal. Strength infused his bones, plumped his muscles. The blood in his veins became molten, his need for her too intense to ever again deny.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d she said on a groan.</p><p>\u201cGlad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want...the rest...\u201d The words ended on a groan. \u201cDo the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d He took over completely. Awed by her\u2014mine, she\u2019s mine, and I can have her, can have this, as many times as I desire\u2014he did everything in his power to prepare her for his invasion. His mouth, on her body. All over it, lingering. Her taste, down his throat. Like honey. His fingers, between her legs. Rubbing, playing. She moaned, again and again, and the sounds were like music.</p><p>He liiicked. Sucked. Kneaded. Played again. Worked his fingers in slllowly...picking up speed...faster and faster...all while he whispered to her, praising her sweetness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to...something\u2019s happening...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go, sweetheart. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>She erupted, the pleasure hitting her, making her spasm and gasp. And when she came back down to earth a few minutes later, he started up all over again.</p><p>Panting, she said, \u201cThat was...that was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019ll be in you, and it\u2019ll be even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, a plea, barely discernable. \u201cPlease. If you don\u2019t...I\u2019m going to...oh, I need that again...please.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Now. No more waiting. She was his. He needed to claim her. Brand her from the inside out.</p><p>He donned a condom and moved into position, settling between her eagerly opened thighs. Concern for her was the only power strong enough to stop him from immediately thrusting home. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt at first. There\u2019s nothing I can do about that, but it\u2019ll get better. I promise it\u2019ll get better. But I\u2019ll stay still until you\u2019re ready, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts now. Just. Do. Something.\u201d</p><p>He surged inside her, roaring, the reins of his control instantly shredded, the power of the joining utterly overwhelming him.</p><p>She cried out, the sound laced with pleasure and pain.</p><p>Mine. She\u2019s all mine now. Claimed. Possessed.</p><p>He remained still, as promised. Sweat poured from him. His heart thundered at the incredible pressure inside him. Pressure he resisted with all of his might.</p><p>Any second, he would break apart.</p><p>\u201cWant me to...pull out?\u201d he panted. Please, don\u2019t want me to pull out.</p><p>\u201cNo. Go! Finally doing...what I...need.\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed. Almost.</p><p>He slid backward, and she squeezed at him, trying to hold him inside. Then, he slammed forward, giving her more, giving her harder, all hope of regaining control gone. He utterly ravaged her. His need for her was too great, and she liked it, was still grasping at him, once again begging for more, and more, and more.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he moaned. He told her how much he wanted her, needed her, had to have her, and she responded with soft mewls. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTink, my Tink.\u201d</p><p>His already frenzied rhythm quickened, and when she gave another cry, this one high-pitched and broken, a testament of her release, the pleasure utterly consumed him. He roared with the sublime satisfaction of his.</p><p>When the last of his shudders subsided, he collapsed on top of her. Drained. Sated.</p><p>Awed.</p><p>Panting, she said, \u201cThat was...that was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome and wonderful.\u201d He rolled onto his side, freeing her from his weight. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p><p>She kissed the hammering pulse at the base of his neck. \u201cNo wonder you did it so many times before coming after me.\u201d</p><p>No condemnation. Still no judgment. Was there any woman like her? \u201cSweetheart, nothing has ever compared to this.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against him, a content little kitten, rubbing her cheek against his chest. \u201cHusband?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he liked the sound of that. \u201cYes. Wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201d</p><p>WHEN MORNING DAWNED, Josephina was once again snuggled against the warmth of Kane\u2019s body. She hadn\u2019t slept, had been too busy marveling. The man wanted by all others wanted her. The man who couldn\u2019t tolerate the touch of others had yearned for hers. Now, he held on to her as if he couldn\u2019t bear to let her go. As if she meant something to him.</p><p>What a wonderful life she suddenly lived.</p><p>And what a wonderful man at her side. He\u2019d experienced the worst life had to offer, was still hurting inside, might always carry the scars, but he\u2019d turned to her. He\u2019d found a measure of peace with her; she would cherish him all the days of her life.</p><p>A strange vibration tickled the skin of her cheek, and she frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from my ring,\u201d Kane said with a sleep-rich rumble. \u201cIt\u2019s been bugging me all night, shaking my arm, creating some kind of heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly normal ring behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Apparently, William is some kind of collector, and he was willing to trade this one for a bag of Skittles. Don\u2019t ask me where he found it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, Skittles,\u201d she said with a moan of longing.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou\u2019d trade your rock for the candy, wouldn\u2019t you? Never mind. Don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019ll only want to Super Glue the thing to your finger.\u201d</p><p>She held the ring to the light, the jewel sparkling majestically. \u201cEven though it\u2019s size giant, I won\u2019t take it off.\u201d It was a symbol of their commitment to each other.</p><p>He kissed her temple, gentle and sweet and almost boyish. \u201cAre you hungry, wife?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wife. Was there a more beautiful word? \u201cI\u2019m starved, actually. Husband.\u201d Oh, yes. That one. She might never get tired of saying it.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said, his voice going low, \u201cbut I doubt we\u2019re talking about the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, are we talking about sex?\u201d</p> <p>He gave a bark of laughter. \u201cYeah, but your body needs to heal before that particular appetite can be sated. A fourth time.\u201d He hugged her tight and rolled, then rose from the bed. \u201cCover those dangerous curves, woman, and I\u2019ll take you to the diner next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Long locks of hair tumbled down her shoulders as she sat up. Her body still ached, and her heart...well, her heart had yet to calm down. In all the futures she\u2019d imagined for herself, she\u2019d never seen one like this.</p><p>Muscles flexed as Kane gathered his weapons, his underwear, slacks, and a shirt. His hair was rumpled, his gaze heavy-lidded and sexy. Naked, barefoot, he padded into the bathroom and showered with the door open.</p><p>When he emerged on a cloud of steam, wearing the very clothing he\u2019d gathered, he crooked his finger at her. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>The tension he\u2019d sported all these weeks was completely gone.</p> <p>Smiling, Josephina walked past him\u2014naked. He moaned, his eyes locked on her, as if in pain. She brushed her teeth and showered, then dressed in the hated maid uniform. \u201cI\u2019d rather wear the curtains,\u201d she grumbled as she joined him by the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go shopping after we eat.\u201d</p><p>A short time later, she was sliding into a booth in the back of the diner, Kane across from her. The place was packed with old school charm, the tiled floor black and white, the walls covered with fifties memorabilia.</p><p>\u201cDo you have enough money to pay for your breakfast?\u201d Kane asked as he studied the menu.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d left her bag in S\u00e9duire.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to find a way to pay me back. Waffles aren\u2019t free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey. We\u2019re married. You insisted. That means whatever you have is mine.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched at the corners. \u201cSo you now agree that we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer a question for me first,\u201d she said, wanting to tease him the way he teased her. \u201cAre you loaded? I mean, the stories say you are, but I just want to be sure before I pledge my life to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than loaded. Torin could turn anyone into a billionaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew there was a reason I liked him. But to answer your question, yes, I agree. Your money and I are one.\u201d</p><p>He stopped trying to hide his grin and dazzled her with a display of pearly whites.</p><p>I\u2019m so falling for this man.</p><p>A waitress wearing a poodle skirt approached their table, making Josephina feel less conspicuous in her gown. The woman had a notepad and pen at the ready.</p> <p>\u201cCan I take your...uh...\u201d She locked eyes with Kane and her words tapered off. She fluffed her hair. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Claudia. My friends call me Claude.\u201d</p><p>Uncomfortable, he tugged at the collar of his shirt. \u201cWe\u2019d like\u2014\u201d</p><p>The building began to shake and the patrons to gasp. The ketchup bottle resting on the side of the table shattered, every glass shard arrowing toward Josephina, several even slicing into her arm. Blood beaded over the wounds.</p><p>Kane muttered a curse, threw down his menu and stood, pulling Josephina to her feet. \u201cCome on. We need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisaster?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d the waitress called.</p><p>He ignored her. The moment they stepped outside, a car slammed into another car directly in front of them. Impact tore a scrap of metal from the wreckage, tossing it at Josephina\u2019s head. Had Kane not jerked her to the ground, she would have been decapitated. But he did, and the piece cut through the diner window.</p><p>Glass shattered. Cars honked. People shouted obscenities. Footsteps pounded as bystanders raced away.</p><p>Forcing her to stand, Kane\u2019s grip tightened on her, the pressure almost enough to snap her bones.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Silent, he led her inside their hotel. The building was tall and well kept, with plush carpets and pretty paintings on the walls. There was a chandelier overhead, though nothing as grand as those in the Fae palace.</p><p>\u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>He remained silent as they stepped into the elevator, strode down the hall and finally entered their room.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Kane. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here.\u201d There was a grim quality to his voice, and he wouldn\u2019t meet her eyes. \u201cLeave and you\u2019ll regret it. And don\u2019t open the door to anyone. In fact,\u201d he said, withdrawing a gun from the waist of his pants, \u201cdo you know how to use one of these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fae women are forbidden from learning how to defend themselves.\u201d</p><p>His features darkened. \u201cI should have started training you, as promised, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t. But don\u2019t worry. The gun is ready to go, complete with silencer. All you have to do is point and squeeze the trigger.\u201d He set the weapon on the nightstand, his hand trembling.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence. \u201cI plan to feed the demon so he\u2019ll stop trying to hurt you. At least for a little while.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>JOSEPHINA PACED IN front of the massive bed she\u2019d shared with her husband only an hour ago, her hands wringing together. The change in Kane had startled her. In seconds, he\u2019d gone from affable and flirty to downright mean. And there\u2019d been guilt in his eyes...so much guilt, made all the worse because it had been ringed by a toxic mix of self-disgust and shame.</p><p>Just how did he plan to feed such a terrible demon? If he placed himself in danger...</p><p>Having trouble catching her breath, she eased onto the bed, propped against the pillows and closed her eyes. She had only ever projected her image into other people\u2019s minds; never had she attempted to see the world through another\u2019s eyes. Here, now, she had to try.</p><p>Kane needed her, whether he knew it or not. If she could figure out where he was, she could race to the rescue. No longer did he have to fight against the evil on his own, and she would prove it.</p><p>\u201cYOU WANT A disaster,\u201d Kane muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a disaster.\u201d</p><p>Want the girl dead was the demon\u2019s snarled reply. Dead, dead, dead.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not getting that one.\u201d He would die first. But then, that wouldn\u2019t help, either, would it.</p><p>He would distance himself from Tink, go so far away from her the demon wouldn\u2019t be able to reach her. After seeing those cuts on her arm...the drip of crimson...yeah, distance was what was needed.</p><p>Where could he go?</p><p>No. Not him, he realized. Her. She had to go. He would call Lucien. He would send the warrior to pick her up, and have her escorted to the fortress in the Realm of Blood and Shadows, as he\u2019d originally planned. Kane would stay away from her, and she would be safe.</p><p>The demon would be satisfied.</p><p>He pressed his thumb against his wedding ring, spun the metal. Soon, the band would be his only connection to Tink. He punched the building beside him, and the brick cracked. He never should have tried to create a normal life with her. Not until the demon was dead.</p><p>Disaster growled.</p><p>Kane turned the corner of the sidewalk. A window shattered as he passed. People shouted with fright and scrambled away from the sea of glass. \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d he gritted. \u201cI\u2019m giving you what you want.\u201d</p><p>You give, even while you plot my demise. Perhaps it\u2019s time I ended you, and freed myself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be crazed, mindless.\u201d</p><p>Aren\u2019t I already?</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t panic.</p><p>An SUV slammed into a lamppost. A biker swerved, hit a curb. The bike flipped end over end and crashed into Kane.</p><p>Teeth grinding, Kane kept going. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting innocents.\u201d</p><p>I know. Isn\u2019t it great?</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s bargain. I won\u2019t try to kill you, or others\u2014if.</p><p>\u201cIf?\u201d</p><p>See that woman over there? I want her. Give her to me.</p><p>Across the street, a pretty woman stood outside a shop, watching the chaos down the way.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kane snapped.</p><p>The water main broke, liquid suddenly shooting into the sky. Two cars collided.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, wiping cold droplets from his brow.</p><p>A black bird careened from the sky, slammed into Kane\u2019s chest before falling to the ground. There was a pained squawk as feathers rained in every direction. Struggling to breathe, he bent down to check the damage to the bird.</p><p>It died before contact was made.</p><p>The girl. Give me the girl.</p><p>Kane straightened, closed his eyes for a moment. He knew what Disaster really wanted\u2014for Kane to betray his wife, ruin the trust they\u2019d only just managed to build and destroy any hope for a future. Then, when Lucien carried Tink away, the distance between husband and wife would be more than physical. It would be mental, emotional. And it wouldn\u2019t matter if Disaster died or not. The damage would have been done, all hope torched, Kane\u2019s life ruined.</p><p>What better catastrophe was there than that?</p><p>I can\u2019t do it, Kane thought. I won\u2019t do it.</p><p>And yet, a second later, when a billboard fell from the side of the building, and humans rushed away to avoid being crushed, the word apocalypse reverberated in his head and he found himself crossing the street, approaching the woman.</p><p>Maybe your Fae will never find out, Disaster said, glee in his tone. It can be our little secret.</p><p>No. There were no secrets. Truth had ways of seeping out. More than that, he would never keep something like this secret from her.</p><p>In the back of his mind, he suddenly thought he felt another presence. Someone soft and gentle, sweet and innocent. Someone who smelled like fresh-baked bread.</p><p>Tink?</p><p>He frowned, searching the area for any sign of her, finding none. His guilt must be playing tricks on him. Either that, or Disaster was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do what you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kiss this woman, and I\u2019ll leave your Josephina alone.</p><p>Tink. Safe. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, acid burning a path up his throat.</p> <p>The woman looked up at him. Fear glazed her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whole lot of dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I escort you somewhere safe?\u201d</p><p>The window behind her shattered. Screaming, she threw herself into his arms.</p><p>A hand here...a mouth there...so helpless...</p><p>Memories hit him, swift and hard. As he fought the urge to jerk away from the woman, the past, to scrub himself from head to toe with steel wool, he gently detached himself from her grip.</p> <p>KISS HER!</p><p>Sweat beaded on his brow. Behind him, the roof of a building caved in.</p><p>The woman trembled. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Like...an apocalypse.</p><p>Urgency rushed through him, joining forces with fear and panic. \u201cSwear it,\u201d he said to Disaster. \u201cSwear you\u2019ll leave Tink alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d the woman asked.</p> <p>I swear it.</p><p>Before he could talk himself out of it, Kane leaned down and kissed her. She stiffened, but she didn\u2019t push him away; the urge to vomit hit him, and he straightened.</p><p>In a snap, the presence left him.</p><p>Disaster laughed. I was lying, of course. How foolish of you to trust me.</p><p>Kane punched the brick wall, uncaring when his knuckles broke upon impact. He should have known. The demon would do anything to ruin his most prized relationship\u2014and had probably succeeded. And I went along with it, all for a lie. He punched the wall again.</p><p>\u201cI-is everything okay?\u201d the woman stuttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d a male voice interjected from behind him.</p><p>The power that wafted from that voice startled him. Disaster, too. The demon yelped in sudden fear and hid in a far corner of his mind. Kane spun and met the gaze of a Sent One. The warrior wasn\u2019t anyone he knew personally, but he recognized the green fauxhawk, the Asian features, the gleaming white robe and oh, yeah, the impressive white-and-gold wings arching over wide, muscled shoulders, sweeping all the way to the floor.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you and why are you here?\u201d Kane liked the Sent Ones. He did. They\u2019d helped his friend Amun, the keeper of Secrets, at the worst hour of his life. They were training Paris\u2019s wife to lead the Titans out of darkness and into light. They hadn\u2019t killed Aeron\u2014not permanently, at least\u2014when he married into the family. But now wasn\u2019t a good time.</p><p>\u201cUh, who are you talking to?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Malcolm,\u201d the warrior said, acting as if she wasn\u2019t there. \u201cI\u2019m here to check on you. We knew you were in hell, but heard you had escaped. I was told to find you and verify that you were indeed alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive.\u201d But far from well. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you can save me from the end of the world or not. I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps sounded but Kane never diverted his eyes from the Sent One before him.</p><p>Malcolm crossed his arms over his massive chest. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not all. Six demons killed Deity, our king, and those demons are now living on earth, desperate to possess as many humans as possible. If you\u2019re well, you are to help us find them.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. He\u2019d heard about the king\u2019s death, and knew there\u2019d been a change of management in the skies. \u201cI can\u2019t help you right now. Sorry. Look around. You\u2019ll realize I\u2019ve got too many problems of my own.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cI just came from the realm of the Fae. Where you were married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Kane held up his left hand and wiggled his fingers, shamefully making light of a symbol he cherished. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the woman you were kissing was human.\u201d The warrior\u2019s gaze moved away\u2014only to return in a snap and latch onto the ring. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d The question was uttered quietly, yet lashed like a whip.</p><p>Nerve-endings raw, Kane snapped, \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d</p><p>Something dark crossed over the male\u2019s features. He ignored the question, demanding, \u201cWhat are you doing out here, without your woman?\u201d</p><p>Destroying my life. He closed his eyes for a moment, desperate to escape the harsh reality of those words. \u201cWatch me as I don\u2019t discuss that with you.\u201d</p><p>The warrior tapped two incisors together as he looked at the ring, then Kane, then the ring, then, finally, Kane. \u201cI can guess. You carry Disaster, and you\u2019re trying to feed the beast to keep him calm.\u201d</p><p>Hearing it stated so plainly irritated him. \u201cIf you knew, why\u2019d you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that we\u2019re clear, you can go.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm tilted his head to the side. \u201cDo you plan to kill the demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll die, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. Aeron used to be keeper of Wrath, but he\u2019s now demon-free and living large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeron was given a new body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll get a new body, too,\u201d Kane said. Maybe there was a store somewhere.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. The demon left me before\u2014\u201d when Tink had sucked him out \u201c\u2014and I did just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were only alone for a short period of time.\u201d</p><p>And he knew that, how? \u201cYeah. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the creature\u2019s departure emptied you out. Eventually you would have died.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief would have wasted time. Sent Ones couldn\u2019t lie. Frustrated, Kane scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of a cup filled with oil. When the cup is tipped over, the oil spills out. Soon there is nothing left but emptiness.\u201d</p><p>And Kane\u2019s body was the cup.</p><p>\u201cMan cannot live on empty.\u201d Malcolm paused, said, \u201cTell me. Do you hate your wife?\u201d</p><p>The moment of camaraderie was ruined. He stilled, preparing to attack. \u201cBack off, warrior. I won\u2019t hesitate to snuff you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no, you don\u2019t hate her. Then why were you kissing another woman to calm the demon? That wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Kane palmed a dagger. How dare this piece of\u2014 The words that wasn\u2019t necessary registered, and he stilled. \u201cWhat do you mean, that wasn\u2019t necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Lords of the Underworld,\u201d Malcolm said with a shake of his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dealing with the evil for so long, you\u2019ve simply accepted it. You\u2019ve stopped fighting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fight it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re on dangerous ground again, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Unaffected, Malcolm gazed down at the ring. \u201cWhat you feed grows stronger. What you starve eventually dies.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this obtuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this rude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Sent Ones and their honesty, man. \u201cI\u2019m feeding the demon to calm him. He\u2019s acting up and putting my woman in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, feeding the demon is what\u2019s putting your woman in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what you\u2019re saying. Help me understand.\u201d He would do anything to walk away from this day with Tink at his side. \u201cIf I starve the demon, he\u2019ll throw a tantrum.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm leaned back and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSo what. When you deprive your body of food, your stomach begins to hurt and grumble loudly in protest. The demon is the same. When it becomes hungry, it acts up. Deny him satisfaction, and his power to throw tantrums will weaken.\u201d</p><p>Feeding, and starving. Life, and death. \u201cI can kill the demon this way,\u201d Kane said, a light dawning in his mind. \u201cI can starve him to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmptying me out.\u201d</p><p>The Sent One shrugged. \u201cYes, that, too.\u201d</p><p>Killing Kane, as well.</p><p>Realization slammed hard, but true. To keep Tink safe, forever, he had to die. And if he died, he would never have his revenge against Disaster. How could he? They would meet the same fate.</p><p>There would be no happily ever after for him.</p><p>He wanted to protest. To fight this. There had to be another way. A way that would allow him to live with his wife for an eternity, to watch Disaster perish and finally have the last laugh. But just then, with the Sent One watching him with the barest measure of pity, he knew there wasn\u2019t. And in the end, he would rather die, knowing Tink was safe, than live, knowing he was putting her in danger.</p><p>She was more important to him than...anything. Even vengeance.</p><p>Heart racing, Kane said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d But he paused a few feet away, a memory sliding into place. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to help you with your demon problem, but I do know you have a friend that disappeared,\u201d he said, remembering what he\u2019d heard about the Sent One, Thane, from Taliyah. Malcolm stiffened. \u201cI heard he appeared in one of the Phoenix camps. The one with a new king. I believe they\u2019re holding him captive.\u201d</p><p>Hope flared in Malcolm\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Kane leaped back into motion. He would do this. He would starve and kill the demon, and then die himself. He wasn\u2019t sure how long it would take. It would be best to call Lucien, and have Tink whisked to a safe zone now, before Disaster began to act out from hunger pains, but he wanted to spend every one of his remaining seconds with her.</p><p>When the demon acted up again\u2014and he would\u2014Kane would just have to find a way to shield her. Because if he was going to die with a smile on his face, he needed her by his side.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>THE MOMENT KANE burst into the hotel room, Josephina launched a pillow at his head. He stopped in his tracks, and she launched another.</p><p>\u201cYou snake!\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou horrible, despicable snake!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door shut with a loud thud. He held up his hands, all innocence. As if he wasn\u2019t a lying, cheating scum who\u2019d betrayed her the day after their wedding.</p><p>\u201cTink, it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d She jerked the ring from her finger and threw it at him. The monstrosity slammed into his chest before thumping to the floor. Angry beyond measure, she picked up the gun he\u2019d given her and pointed the barrel at his chest. Her hands were shaking, her blood as hot as fire. \u201cI said no, just to save you, but you insisted I marry you.\u201d</p> <p>Darkness descended over his expression. \u201cYou plan to murder me to get free of me?\u201d So softly asked.</p><p>Tearing her up inside.</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. His hair was tangled, his eyes bloodshot, and his skin pallid. Obviously, too much pleasure with the blonde from the sidewalk had drained him. His clothing was wrinkled and torn\u2014had the female gotten rough with him? Her stomach heaved.</p><p>\u201cYes! I saw you with her,\u201d she croaked. \u201cSaw you kiss her. After you\u2019d had sex with me and promised to be faithful.\u201d A few hours ago, she would have called it making love.</p><p>But never again.</p> <p>A muscle ticked in his jaw, the catalyst to a deep, dark coldness that began to fall over his features. \u201cYou invaded my mind.\u201d</p><p>Planting her feet on the floor, she raised her chin. \u201cI sure did.\u201d At first, she\u2019d been so excited by her success. She was bound to Kane in a way she\u2019d never been bound to another, so, of course she could reach him the way she\u2019d never reached another. But then she\u2019d realized there was a pretty female standing in front of him, and he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her lips.</p><p>Josephina had wanted to die.</p><p>She\u2019d also wanted to kill!</p><p>\u201cTink,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Tink me! I\u2019m not your Tink. Not anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPut the gun down, and I\u2019ll explain everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the gory details.\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his hair, causing the strands to stand on end. \u201cGive me a chance. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did! And you betrayed me at the first opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated every moment of it, I promise you. Disaster wanted her, I didn\u2019t. He was destroying everything around me. I wanted to calm him down, that was all. He promised to leave you alone if I kissed her, and I wanted so badly for him to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been able to hear Disaster while in his mind, but she\u2019d certainly heard Kane. Swear it, she remembered him saying. Swear you\u2019ll leave Tink alone.</p><p>One of the tears escaped, slid down her cheek. \u201cWhat would you do if the situation were reversed, and I smashed my mouth against some strange man, just to save you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI would have ripped him to pieces, put him back together and then ripped him apart again.\u201d He approached her, aggression in every step. \u201cI made a terrible mistake. But I promise you, I wouldn\u2019t have done anything more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It still hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never do it again, you have my word.\u201d Another step closer. \u201cA Sent One came\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSent One? And stay where you are!\u201d</p><p>He froze, his mouth curved in a tortured frown. \u201cA Sent One is a winged warrior tasked with fighting evil, like an angel, only...not. He told me to starve the demon, no matter what Disaster does, and eventually you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be safe all right,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll be safe away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTink.\u201d He took another step toward her.</p><p>\u201cI said stay back!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He increased his speed. Instinct kicked in, and her finger flexed on the trigger. Pop. The gun recoiled, smoke curling from the barrel. Horror filled her.</p><p>Kane was in front of her a second later, swiping the gun out of her hand and tossing her on top of the bed. Before she finished bouncing, his weight slammed into her, pinning her down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work on your aim. Later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Josephina fought against him with all of her might, beating her fists into his face, his chest, trying to buck him off with her body. Not once did he try and deflect her blows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t want to do it. I hated myself. I hated being there. I hated the woman. I was sick about it. I just didn\u2019t see another way, but I should have done something, anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off me! Let me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t let you go. I don\u2019t know how much time we\u2019ll have together, and I want to savor every single second.\u201d</p><p>She stilled long enough to glare up at him and pant, \u201cDo you have any idea what it feels like to see your husband kissing another woman?\u201d</p><p>Silence drenched with shame.</p><p>Silence that drove her into a deeper madness. She erupted, beating at him until her hands were throbbing and her lungs were burning from the forcefulness of her pants...until all she could do was collapse on the mattress and sob for the precious trust he\u2019d torn to shreds.</p><p>Kane rolled onto his side and gathered her close. He cooed to her, smoothing the hair from her face. His breath fanned over her cheek, and she hated the sensation\u2014because she loved it.</p><p>Finally, the sobs quieted. Her eyes were nearly swollen shut, and her nose was stuffed up. Every ounce of energy she possessed had drained from her, and yet still she tried to sit up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me hold you,\u201d he beseeched. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed against him because she had no other choice. Dizziness had taken root, and refused to leave.</p><p>His hands lowered to her neck and massaged, and she thought he was...trembling? \u201cI hurt you, and I dishonored you, and I am so sorry, Tink. I\u2019m so sorry. I was stupid.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to respond. She wasn\u2019t. But the words, \u201cWhy did you pick her?\u201d slipped from her, and she cringed. The woman had been everything Josephina was not: blonde, as delicate as the Fae royal family, with smooth hands and pale skin.</p><p>He buried his face in the hollow of Josephina\u2019s neck, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t. Disaster did.\u201d</p><p>That shouldn\u2019t have made her feel better. Nothing should have made her feel better. But...it did, she realized.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re sorry, Kane. I do. I believe you weren\u2019t acting from a place of desire. But I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t live like this, always wondering what you\u2019ll have to do with other women to satisfy the demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to starve the demon. I won\u2019t do anything to satisfy him ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now. But what happens when his hunger becomes too much to bear? How can I trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>She steeled herself. \u201cI had no idea I was such a jealous person, but I am, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change, and I don\u2019t think I can forget what I witnessed. So...I\u2019m...leaving you, Kane. I don\u2019t want to be with you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Warm liquid trickled down her skin, as if...as if...Kane were crying. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave me. I need you. I\u2019ll make it up to you, I swear. I\u2019ll never even look at another woman, Tink. I\u2019ll cut out my eyes first. I\u2019ll never touch another woman. I\u2019ll cut off my hands first.\u201d His arms tightened around her. \u201cPlease. Please. I need you. I\u2019ll be in hell without you.\u201d</p><p>Right now, she was in hell with him.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to put up with me for long, I promise. Please, Tink. Please.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her nape. He kissed her jawline. He kissed her ear and her cheek and her brow, her eyes and the tip of her nose. Her mind tried to compute what he\u2019d just said. Something about his words bothered her. Something about not having to put up with him...for...oh, my... He licked the seam of her lips, and she opened automatically, her newly awakened body craving what only he could give. Their tongues brushed together, and she tasted...salt. He had been crying. Because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being without her.</p><p>Desire bloomed, urgent, insistent, traitorous. Her blood heated, and it had nothing to do with rage. She tried to remain quiet and still, but the more he kissed her, the deeper he kissed her, and the deeper he kissed her, the more she moaned and groaned and writhed against him, desperate for more.</p><p>As she tried to fight her body\u2019s response, he peeled her clothing away, then his own, but somehow his lips never left her, never gave her a moment to think past the pleasure. He stole the air from her lungs, provided her with air from his own. Without him, she couldn\u2019t breathe. Didn\u2019t want to breathe.</p><p>Skin against skin. Heat against heat. Softness against the most rigid steel. He surrounded her. He was hard, fully aroused, and hyper-focused on her. His gaze watched her, gauging her every reaction, his mind calculating his next play. His fingers moved on her, in her, stoking her need higher. His mouth followed.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you how much you mean to me,\u201d he pleaded as he rose up, placed himself at her core. \u201cLet me make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-all right,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cOne last time.\u201d</p><p>His gaze met hers, and oh, the hurt she saw was devastating. She wanted to snatch back her words, but her own hurt choked them before they could form.</p><p>\u201cI will win you back, Tink. I will earn your trust, and you\u2019ll want to stay with me.\u201d</p><p>He covered his massive length with a condom and sank inside her.</p><p>She cried out, arching to take him deeper.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move for a long while, just remained in her to the hilt, filling her, making her grow more desperate by the second. Her breasts ached, so needy. The crevice between her legs throbbed, practically weeping. Her skin burned, so feverish. Her body was the war zone, and he was the soldier determined to win it.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said on a moan. \u201cI want...I need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, Tink. You need me.\u201d He slid out...out...then back inside her, and this time, he slammed hard, making her see stars. \u201cI\u2019ll give you everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>JOSEPHINA CAME AWAKE gradually, slowly becoming aware of the warm pool surrounding her. Warm pool?</p><p>She blinked open her eyes, wallpapered walls coming into view. She was in the hotel room she shared with Kane, she realized, and in bed. Kane was behind her, his arms wrapped tightly around her as if he feared she would run away. After lovemak\u2014uh, having sex, they must have fallen asleep. How many hours had passed?</p><p>Gingerly she sat up, and, body aching from the passion of the night, turned to face her hus\u2014the guy she was sleeping with. Horror filled her. \u201cKane. You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d His poor shoulder...there was an open wound, exposing muscle, maybe even bone, and a flow of crimson raining to the sheet.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked sleepily, groggily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding. I shot you, and we both thought I missed, but we were wrong, because now you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Like her, he blinked open his eyes. A slow grin lifted the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou spent the entire night with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me. You\u2019re injured. I shot you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you did miss. Disaster somehow drew the bullet out of the wall and gave it another try. He succeeded. Thankfully, the thing went all the way through. Now, did you hear the part about spending the entire night with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were shot while I was sleeping, and you failed to wake me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed to rest. Like I was going to disturb you.\u201d</p><p>How could he act so casual while bleeding to death? She hopped from the bed and raced to the bathroom to gather a cup of water and clean rags. By the time she returned, he had rolled onto his back and lay propped against the pillows, the very picture of male satisfaction. She cleaned him up as best she could and applied pressure to stop the bleeding.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me,\u201d she chided.</p><p>\u201cI was content and didn\u2019t want anything to change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well. I\u2019m sorry I tried to kill you,\u201d she said on a sigh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d She cut up the clean end of the sheet and wrapped the material around his shoulder, using it as a bandage. \u201cWhat you did with that woman, Kane...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Tinky Dink,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Tinky Dink. A new nickname. Her heart constricted painfully. \u201cYou did it for me, and I get that, but it still hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will never happen again, I vow it, no matter what Disaster does or says. You\u2019re the only one I want, the only one I\u2019ll have.\u201d A heavy pause. \u201cWill you stay with me?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Would she? Hurt still swam through her veins. Kane had been hers. He\u2019d chosen her above all others. Finally, she\u2019d mattered to someone other than her mother. No longer had she been a nothing. A servant and blood slave had become the envy of every Fae female and probably even some of the men. But who would envy a cuckold?</p><p>He said he wasn\u2019t going to do it again, like thousands of men had said to thousands of women throughout the years.</p> <p>Maybe, last night, she could have walked away from him. But what the demon had meant as harmful\u2014the bullet\u2014had actually softened her. Seeing Kane in a small pool of blood, realizing how close she\u2019d come to losing him...</p><p>I\u2019m not ready to lose him.</p><p>If\u2014when\u2014the demon acted up again, they could revisit this topic. Until then...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>KANE ORDERED ROOM service. After he and Tink had eaten their weight in hamburgers and fries, he spent the rest of the day teaching her how to fight the biggest and the baddest of threats with her fists, blades and bullets. His shoulder gave him a little trouble, but he pushed through. She was an excellent student, a natural\u2014unsurprising, considering she fought her way out of hell with no training whatsoever. She listened intently, put her whole heart into practicing, and what she lacked in strength she made up for in speed and cunning.</p><p>He was glad. He wanted her prepared for life without him.</p><p>Just how long would it take to starve Disaster to death?</p><p>You\u2019ll change your mind, the demon said, but he was no longer laughing.</p><p>Disaster couldn\u2019t imagine starving because he\u2019d never experienced it; even now, his appetite was sated. Seeing the sharp edge of hurt still hanging in Tink\u2019s eyes...yeah, Disaster had feasted. But that wouldn\u2019t last. Kane wasn\u2019t going to let it.</p><p>Whatever the demon threw at him, whatever danger he encountered, he was done acting the fool and catering to the very nature he despised. Tink was getting his best, and nothing less.</p><p>When he felt like he\u2019d pushed her hard enough for one day, he gave her a gentle nudge forward. \u201cTake a shower. We need to leave. I don\u2019t want to stay in the same location much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Panting, damp with perspiration, she disappeared inside the bathroom.</p><p>He wanted to join her, but didn\u2019t dare. Not until she invited him.</p><p>She emerged a short while later, a towel wrapped around her luscious little body. Hair as black as night dripped at the ends. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He halfway expected her to be gone by the time he finished, which is why he rushed, and yet he found her standing in front of the bed, looking shockingly sweet in a black leather corset top with purple ties at the bottom and a long, puffy skirt with dark lace.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the clothes?\u201d He cursed himself for not yet taking her shopping, as promised.</p><p>She shifted uncomfortably. \u201cSome guy with wings and a spike of green hair down the middle of his head stepped into view, dropped a bag, winked at me and stepped back out of view.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm, the Sent One, he realized with a bead of annoyance. He\u2019d stepped from the spirit realm into the natural, clearly. \u201cYou should have called for me.\u201d The moment his snippy tone registered, he cringed. Dial back the anger. She was in a fragile state where he was concerned, and he had to tread carefully.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time.\u201d</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t yelled. Very gently he said, \u201cNext time, if someone appears, no matter who or what they are, no matter how fast they appear and disappear, or if you think they\u2019re my best friend, call for me. Okay? Please. Just in case I need to intervene.\u201d</p><p>She nodded stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He dug through the bag and found a plain T-shirt and pants, dropped his towel and dressed.</p><p>Tink turned away, and he had to brush flickers of sadness aside. Things wouldn\u2019t always be this strained.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long journey ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted to spend time with the Lords of the Underworld, and I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop me off?\u201d she interjected tersely.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m staying with you.\u201d</p><p>He got her outside, in the heat and light of the day, and scanned the crowds and buildings, searching for anything suspicious. This close to Times Square, there were flashing lights and stores everywhere, both offering great cover.</p><p>He dialed Lucien, but it went to voice mail. Next, he tried Torin. The warrior answered on the third ring with a curt, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>O-kay. A very un-Torin-like greeting. As Kane led Tink around a corner and up to a coffee cart, he said, \u201cI\u2019m in Manhattan. I need Lucien to pick me up.\u201d Lucien could flash from one location to another with only a thought, even between realms. \u201cMe and my wife.\u201d</p><p>At the counter, he held up two fingers.</p><p>Torin sputtered out a very undignified, \u201cWife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the boys tell you? Lucien, Reyes, Strider and Sabin were at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been a little busy thinking up ways to find Viola and Cameo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameo?\u201d He tensed. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same thing that happened to Viola. She touched the Paring Rod and vanished.\u201d</p><p>An instant flood of worry threatened to drown him. \u201cWhat\u2019s being done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya talked to some guy she met while in prison,\u201d Torin said. \u201cHe helped create the Rod, and he assured her the females were still alive. Just trapped.\u201d</p><p>He pushed out a relieved breath.</p><p>\u201cGive me the deets about your girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Tink\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosephina,\u201d she interjected loudly.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and she\u2019s half Fae. A royal, a daughter of their king. Wait till you see her. She\u2019s the most beautiful woman ever created. But she has as many enemies as us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have that many, and only one is my fault. Actually, no. The Phoenix is your fault, too. But thank you for saying I\u2019m beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Two steaming cups were set before him. He stepped aside to doctor both with cream and sugar, then gave one to Tink. He remembered the longing looks she\u2019d given the coffeepot during his breakfast with the royal family.</p><p>He watched as she sipped, closing her eyes to savor, and his chest constricted with a longing of his own.</p><p>\u201c\u2014time and place,\u201d Torin was saying.</p><p>\u201cWait. Sorry. What was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop lusting after the ball and chain and pick a time and place to meet,\u201d the warrior repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure Lucien is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours. Sabin\u2019s old apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>He severed the connection. Then, seizing any excuse to touch his woman, he slipped the phone into a pocket of her skirt. \u201cGuard this for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWill your friends like me, do you think?\u201d she asked, and nibbled on her bottom lip. \u201cThe few I\u2019ve actually met have only seen me at my worst.\u201d</p><p>He heard the uncertainty in her tone. \u201cThe wedding was your worst? Honey, your worst is most people\u2019s best. My friends will love you.\u201d If not, Kane would hand out some serious beatings. \u201cThey\u2019ll guard you with their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what if they think I\u2019m all wrong for you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cImpossible. You\u2019re perfect for me. Besides, wait till you meet their wives. Or have you already heard stories?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNew reports of your most recent exploits haven\u2019t yet come in to the masses.\u201d</p><p>It was humiliating to know they\u2019d never realized they were being spied on. \u201cWell, Sabin and Strider are consorts to bloodthirsty Harpies. Lucien is engaged to Anarchy. All three females are annoying, always stealing weapons out of my room, but as they would say, they\u2019re simply amazeballs\u2014and so are you.\u201d</p> <p>A smile\u2014small, but there. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He soared. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to purchase before I take you out of the city? Anything at all. I plan to get you some clothes, but we can also get shoes, purses, jewelry, whatever you\u2019d like.\u201d If he had to buy her affections, he would. He didn\u2019t care how pathetic that made him. He just wanted her happy.</p><p>\u201cNo. Really, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>The vibrations in his wedding ring intensified significantly, startling him. Frowning, he held the metal band to the light. In the center, as if the band were a movie screen, he watched Red shove his way through a crowd.</p><p>Kane glanced up\u2014and spotted Red, shoving his way through the crowd, closing in on him. The ring had known, had...warned him?</p> <p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Tink asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019ve picked up a tail.\u201d He trashed his coffee, did the same to Tink\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she grouched. \u201cI wasn\u2019t done with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Don\u2019t want you to burn yourself.\u201d He launched forward, barreling past oncoming humans, dragging Tink with him. With his free hand, he withdrew a dagger.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the tail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of William\u2019s kids.\u201d No. Scratch that. All of William\u2019s kids were probably here. Those four were like ants: never alone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are they, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble.\u201d And they weren\u2019t coming near Tink. He would kill them first.</p><p>Yeah. It was time to kill, he decided. He\u2019d warned the Rainbow Rejects about what would happen if they came after Tink. The warning had been a courtesy to William. His last courtesy. The boys hadn\u2019t listened. Now, Kane would follow through.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hide you in one of the shops, okay? I need to have a chat with the boys, and I don\u2019t want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane!\u201d Tink vanished.</p><p>No, not Tink. Kane. No longer was he racing down the sidewalk with his woman behind him. He was standing in a narrow hallway, white fog wafting all around him. A shout of denial split his lips as he turned left, right, searching for Tink.</p><p>He clawed through the mist, only to discover\u2014more mist. He checked his ring, but there was no longer a reflection. Panic set in. Where was he? What had happened? Not many beings had the power to flash another without contact. Only Greek and Titan royalty, and\u2014</p><p>The Moirai, he realized with sickening dread. They\u2019d used their powers to transport him from New York to their home in the lower level of the skies.</p> <p>He sped down the hall. He\u2019d been here before, knew the way, and didn\u2019t need to look to know the walls were comprised of thousands upon thousands of braided threads. Those threads vibrated, coming alive, playing scenes from his life\u2014past, present, and maybe even future\u2014but he didn\u2019t allow himself to stop and study.</p><p>He was careful to breathe as little as possible. The air was laced with some kind of drug, something to keep him pliant, and maybe even susceptible to suggestion. Tink thought the Moirai operated that way, that they weren\u2019t really controllers of fate, but rather massagers of it, pushing and kneading, tricking, until their victims were putty in their hands, blindly following wherever they led.</p><p>Not me. Not any longer.</p><p>He reached the end of the hall and entered the weaving room. The three hags sat on wooden stools, each female hunched over the loom, with her long, white hair frizzing over her shoulders.</p><p>Klotho had spotted hands and spun the threads.</p><p>Lachesis had gnarled fingers and wove those threads together.</p><p>Atropos had pupil-less eyes and snipped the ends of the locks.</p><p>\u201cSend me back. Now.\u201d The last time he was here, he\u2019d shown the utmost respect. He\u2019d kept his tone level, his gaze averted. This time he whipped out his demands, his gaze direct. The outcome was too important.</p><p>\u201cYou made a wrong turn.\u201d Klotho cackled.</p><p>\u201cSuch a bad wrong turn,\u201d Lachesis reiterated.</p><p>\u201cBad turns lead to bad ends,\u201d Atropos said without any inflection. \u201cYou should have married the other one. Or two.\u201d</p><p>No. No, he wouldn\u2019t believe it. Tink belonged to him, and he belonged to her. He wanted no one else\u2014would have no one else.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still time to change directions,\u201d Klotho added.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, there\u2019s still time,\u201d Lachesis reiterated.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll survive the pain,\u201d Atropos said.</p><p>Kane came forward, with every intention of shaking the females into submission. \u201cSend. Me. Back.\u201d</p><p>Klotho looked up and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining our tapestry, warrior. The scenes you\u2019re creating aren\u2019t as colorful as the ones we wish to create.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d predicted his future for the colors his actions would lend to their blanket? Inconceivable!</p><p>Roaring, Kane slashed his dagger through the threads closest to him. Moved forward, slashed through more. All three hags gasped with horror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to send me back to my wife, or your throats are next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d the one in the middle gasped.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve seen my past, and gotten a glimpse of my future, you know I\u2019ll do much worse than that.\u201d Determined, he stalked forward.</p><p>ONE SECOND JOSEPHINA was being dragged by Kane, the next she was on her own in the middle of a crowded sidewalk. Shock had her stumbling to a halt, but she quickly righted herself. Where had he gone?</p><p>She spun, searching the area, trying not to panic. People, people, so many people, each on a mission, marching in every direction. A building here, a building there. Birds on the sidewalk, pecking at trash.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>The lady next to her jolted back, as if she\u2019d gone insane.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she shouted again. There was no response.</p><p>He\u2019d...abandoned her? Decided she was too much trouble?</p><p>\u201cSomeone must have flashed him away,\u201d a voice said from behind her. \u201cHow perfect. We\u2019ve been looking for you, female.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to cry out, she whipped around and faced the male from her nightmares. The handsome Red, capable of morphing into the monster she\u2019d drawn into herself.</p><p>First rule of fighting, she thought, recalling Kane\u2019s rules. Act casual. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I want nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wish to spend time with you.\u201d</p><p>Anger burned through her. \u201cI advise you to reconsider. I\u2019m a biter.\u201d</p><p>His brothers stepped up beside him, flanking him, and all three stared at her with rapt fascination.</p><p>\u201cFor you, I won\u2019t mind teeth marks,\u201d Black replied.</p><p>Humans continued to walk around her, the females stopping to give the warriors a second and third glance, as if interested in exchanging numbers, before realizing the males weren\u2019t the type to be played with and hurrying away.</p><p>Refusing to back down, she said, \u201cI know what you really want, and my answer is no. My ability only works with my consent.\u201d</p><p>Red offered her a slow smile. \u201cGetting your consent won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d hoped to intimidate her, well, he\u2019d just done a great job. She was certain there had never been a colder smile.</p><p>Second rule of fighting. Don\u2019t be afraid to show off your weapons. Sometimes fear will drive people away. \u201cI\u2019m willing to fight for my freedom,\u201d she said, proud of her lack of quivering. She withdrew the blade Kane had given her. Where was he?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lose,\u201d Red replied matter-of-factly. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be careful with you.\u201d</p><p>Black and Green nodded.</p><p>Dread nearly knocked her off her feet.</p><p>They approached.</p><p>KANE APPEARED IN the exact spot he\u2019d left. Only, Tink wasn\u2019t there. He rushed to Sabin\u2019s apartment, gaze constantly scanning, searching for any sign of her. Every second was agony. When he reached his destination, he burst through the doors.</p><p>Lucien jumped up from the couch, frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d About to hyperventilate, Kane plowed a hand through his hair. \u201cI have to find her.\u201d</p><p>The Rainbow Rejects wouldn\u2019t kill her, he knew that much, but oh, she might want to die when they finished with her. She could be in pain, right that very moment, and the thought tortured him.</p><p>\u201cGet Torin on the phone,\u201d he croaked. \u201cI need to know what happened, and I don\u2019t care how many databases and security systems he has to hack into to find out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>The Realm of Blood and Shadows</p><p>IT DIDN\u2019T TAKE Torin long to dig up the video Lucien had requested for Kane. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Just one second longer,\u201d he said, then messaged the footage to the pair. That done, he swiveled his chair around.</p><p>First, his gaze hit the painting still resting beside his door. He hadn\u2019t peeked.</p><p>Second, the female sitting at the edge of his bed.</p><p>The mystery of her name had not yet been solved, even though she\u2019d come every day, as promised. In an effort to relax her, he hadn\u2019t pressed her for information, but had allowed her to watch him as he researched the Paring Rod, looking for answers about Cameo and Viola, all the while getting to know his mannerisms, his habits. He\u2019d fed her. He\u2019d allowed her to wander around the confines of the room.</p><p>What would crack her hard shell?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good to your friends,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very good to me right back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>She nibbled on the end of a strawberry he\u2019d given her, licked the juice from her fingers. \u201cI have a friend.\u201d A beat of silence. \u201cI miss her.\u201d</p><p>Finally. Personal information. Easy. Don\u2019t push too hard, too fast. \u201cShe\u2019s...gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I see her every day, and I speak to her, but there are always prying eyes and ears, so our conversations are limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho pries?\u201d he asked, treading lightly.</p><p>\u201cThe others.\u201d</p><p>That told him nothing\u2014but it was a start. \u201cThe others listen to you and your friend....\u201d He propped his elbows on his knees, trying to appear relaxed rather than foaming-at-the-mouth eager. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d probably be better if you didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut...I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he rushed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...Mari.\u201d</p><p>Excitement at learning this new detail nearly shot him out of his chair to fist bump the ceiling. \u201cWhere do you come from, Mari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe...past,\u201d she whispered, looking down at her bare feet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. The past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCronus plucked me from long ago and imprisoned me in one of his homes. I don\u2019t know how many years passed before my friend was placed in the cell across from mine. I can\u2019t visit her, and she can\u2019t visit me. We can only talk to each other through the bars.\u201d</p> <p>A prison? He withdrew the mental files he\u2019d kept on her, and compared those with what he saw now. Her pale hair was tangled each new day, her skin streaked with dirt, despite the showers she\u2019d taken here. But the fear had slowly faded from her eyes, and the food she\u2019d eaten had caused her cheeks to fill out.</p><p>\u201cCronus is dead,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to return. You can stay here without fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re stuck there, tethered somehow. We have no water, no food and have only managed to survive...I\u2019m not sure how. He must have done something to us.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. There were ways to keep prisoners nourished without actually feeding them. Ways that kept the prisoners docile and weak.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to dig our way free, but so far, we\u2019ve had no luck. I can flash in and out to meet with you, because Cronus made the allowance before he died, but no one else can leave, even through a flash.\u201d</p><p>Rage started little fires in his bloodstream. He still had no idea what \u201cfrom the past\u201d meant\u2014actual time travel? Or was she an immortal Cronus had found in, say, the Middle Ages, and the monarch had kept her imprisoned all these centuries?</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me sooner,\u201d he said, still trying for a gentle tone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you. I didn\u2019t know what I...wanted from this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can help you. Cronus\u2019s homes were given to one of my friends\u2014Sienna Blackstone. This friend also has the former Titan king\u2019s abilities and powers.\u201d Most of them, anyway. \u201cIf you\u2019ll tell her everything you know about the home, she\u2019ll find it and release you and your friend.\u201d</p><p>Hope glistened in eyes gone dark. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d And then you can stay with me.</p><p>Hand fluttering over her heart, she hopped to her feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay thank you.\u201d For now, that would be enough.</p><p>\u201cThank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you,\u201d she said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>He stood. \u201cI\u2019ll call Sienna.\u201d She split her time between training with the Sent Ones and hunting the Unspoken Ones, monsters now on the loose. \u201cShe\u2019ll come and meet you, and we can get started on our quest. Agreed?\u201d He held out his hand.</p><p>She looked at the glove, then his eyes, then the glove. Slowly she removed the material, and...he let her. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop her. Then, she studied the hand that hadn\u2019t seen the sun in decades and gulped.</p><p>\u201cMari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d She placed her palm against his, twined their fingers, and shook.</p><p>His response embarrassed him. His body instantly reacted, as if preparing for the dirtiest kind of sex. His skin tingled as if brushed by living flame, and his blood turned molten.</p><p>Must. Have. More.</p><p>CAMEO PACED THE confines of the office. It was weird. Visually, no part of the room was off-limits. She could see everything. The desk, the chair, the bookcases, the glass shelves. But she couldn\u2019t walk everywhere.</p><p>Anytime she approached the shelves, she would experience a moment of vertigo, blink and find her nose in the far corner of the room.</p><p>The same had happened to Lazarus, but only once. After that, he\u2019d given up. Now he reclined against the far wall, watching her with sardonic amusement.</p><p>\u201cIs the guy still there?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd you never told me who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s still there. But he\u2019s more of a monster than a guy. And his name? No. I won\u2019t give it.\u201d</p><p>Why not? \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching you.\u201d</p><p>The thought irritated her on every level. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I see him? Why can\u2019t I get to him?\u201d And where was Viola? What had happened to her? Was she still trapped inside the Rod? \u201cYou led me to believe I would be involved in a dangerous battle.\u201d</p><p>He waved her words away. \u201cI was wrong. It\u2019s happened once before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop lazing around, and help me figure out a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I understand why the monster is having so much fun. Watching you use the same methods every time, and failing the same way, just to try to reach him is highly amusing.\u201d</p><p>So. Irritating. \u201cI hope you choke on your own tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, so you can dig it out with your own?\u201d</p><p>Argh! \u201cAre you flirting with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow cute.\u201d He looked past her. \u201cPretty warrior woman doesn\u2019t know the difference between an informed question and flirting.\u201d</p><p>Was he speaking to the invisible beast? His supposed enemy?</p><p>She marched to the wall where he sat and sank beside him. \u201cI\u2019m done being the night\u2019s entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d His dark gaze swept over her at a leisurely pace. \u201cYou\u2019re quite attractive, female, but your voice needs work. A lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsults from you?\u201d She drummed her nails against her thighs. \u201cI remember you, you know. A few months back, you attended the Harpy Games with Strider and Sabin. You\u2019re the consort of the Harpy in charge.\u201d</p><p>Fire crackled in his eyes\u2014literal fire. \u201cI am no one\u2019s consort.\u201d</p><p>Hit a nerve, had she? \u201cI wonder what your consort would say about that. I met her. Juliette was her name, yes?\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared, a testament to the fury brewing inside him. \u201cWhen I get out of this office, and I will, she\u2019ll be too busy being dead to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you plan to kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Simply stated, leaving no doubt he meant what he said. \u201cI once chose death over her companionship. I will again, no problem\u2014only this time, I\u2019ll do it in reverse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll kill you and gift her with your head,\u201d she replied pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll cut out your tongue and do the world a favor.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll gut you just for giggles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll stab the life out of you and do myself a favor.\u201d</p><p>Enough! Cameo jumped to her feet and motioned him over. \u201cYou want to do this, warrior? Because I\u2019m ready. Anytime. Anyplace.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus unfolded his big body and straightened. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take me on, little girl. You\u2019ll lose.\u201d</p><p>She went chest to chest with him. \u201cI think differently. On both counts.\u201d</p><p>He squared the wide width of his shoulders, standing his ground, not the least bit intimidated. A mistake many men had made. \u201cDo your worst then. But have no doubts, I\u2019ll then do mine.\u201d</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t do her worst. That\u2019s what he expected, maybe even wanted. She\u2019d just have to go another route and surprise him.</p><p>Like a child, she shoved him with all her might. His startled expression was priceless as he stumbled backward and into the wall\u2014no, through the wall?</p><p>Gasping, Cameo rushed to the space he\u2019d last occupied. One second she stood inside the office, the next she was outside. Trees swayed in a gentle breeze. A river rushed and trickled over smooth rocks. Birds sang as they flew across the sunny skyline. White clouds drifted past, serene and flawless.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Lazarus demanded, striding from the shade of one of the trees to get in her face.</p><p>\u201cMe? You went through the wall, and I must have followed.\u201d</p><p>He spun, seeming to take everything in at once. He stiffened. \u201cI think we\u2019re moving between the dimensions,\u201d he muttered, clearly talking to himself. \u201cThat would mean the Rod spit us out in another dimension, the office was another, and this is yet another.\u201d</p><p>This was the first she\u2019d ever heard of different dimensions. \u201cCare to explain what you mean to the rest of the class?\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cThere are two realms. Natural and spiritual. Between the realms are dimensions\u2014pockets of life caught between the natural and the spiritual.\u201d</p><p>Dread wrapped hard fingers around her heart. \u201cWhat does that mean for us?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were dead as he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never go home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>New York</p><p>KANE\u2019S FURY PROVED limitless. Tink\u2019s abduction had been caught on a nearby security camera, allowing him to watch the way Red, Black and Green had cornered and grabbed her. She\u2019d put up a fight, the way Kane had taught her, and she\u2019d even managed to bust Red in the eye, but she\u2019d been no match for the strength of the immortals, and they\u2019d put her to sleep with pressure on her carotid and carried her away, soon disappearing from view. He\u2019d hunted as if his life depended on success\u2014worse, Tink\u2019s life\u2014but the three had covered their tracks too well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I should have killed those hellhounds when I had the chance.</p><p>Kane tossed and turned on the lumpy motel bed. He needed to relax, and concentrate. He planned to summon Tink, somehow, through their link, and force her to project her image into his mind. They would talk. She would tell him where she was.</p><p>He forced himself to close his eyes. Lucien had refused to leave his side, and was now resting comfortably on the other bed, Anya draped across his body. \u201cI\u2019m a living tramp stamp,\u201d she\u2019d said laughingly before drifting off.</p> <p>Lucien hadn\u2019t wanted to spend the night without her. Actually, Lucien couldn\u2019t function a few hours without her. It was disgusting. It was embarrassing.</p><p>That\u2019s what I feel with Tink.</p><p>Disaster chuckled. Too bad you\u2019ll never see her again.</p><p>The fiend was in the best mood of his existence. Though Kane had hoped to provide zero nourishment, he\u2019d unwittingly prepared another feast\u2014and was still serving seconds. The darkness of his emotions had become an internal IV for the demon, offering strength and contentedness, no matter what happened around him.</p><p>\u201cTink,\u201d Kane inwardly shouted. \u201cTink, I need you. Need you so much.\u201d Even when she\u2019d been ticked at him, she\u2019d never been able to resist aiding him.</p> <p>There was no response.</p><p>Time for another tactic... \u201cTinker Bell. Josephina. Wife! You have five seconds to appear or the next time I see you I will put you over my knee.\u201d</p><p>Still no response.</p><p>\u201cOne. Two. I\u2019m serious, I mean it. Three. Four. Last chance to save yourself from the humiliation of my wrath. Fi\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fog rolled in, surrounding his bed. Then Tink was standing over him. \u201cYou will not put me over your knee, you...you...caveman!\u201d</p><p>Every cell in his body cried out in relief. It had worked. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he demanded. \u201cHave the warriors hurt you?\u201d There were no bruises on her skin, and the clothes Malcolm had given her were still intact, without a single tear.</p> <p>If Lucien and Anya heard him, they ignored him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe guys have actually been kind of nice, doing their best to romance me so that I\u2019ll decide to live with them forever and, I\u2019m just guessing here, make them my brother husbands.\u201d She looked Kane over, and what remained of the ambivalence left her in a snap. \u201cWhat about you? You said you needed me. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course something\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re not at my side. And what do you mean you heard me? Why didn\u2019t you reply right away?\u201d he demanded, but he already knew the answer. He was still in the doghouse.</p><p>Chin trembling, as if she were suddenly fighting tears, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not helpless. Not anymore. I\u2019m handling things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Tinky Dink. I do. But I miss you. I want you with me for all the days of my life. I\u2019m not complete without you. Let me come for you.\u201d</p><p>JOSEPHINA PEERED AT Kane, his sweet words echoing in her mind. I\u2019m not complete without you. She had to forgive him for the kiss, didn\u2019t she? She had to torch the bitterness trying so diligently to grow roots deep in her heart, or she\u2019d be trapped in this state for the rest of her life. He\u2019d done what he\u2019d done out of desperation and a desire to protect her. He\u2019d promised never to do it again, and she believed him.</p><p>He wanted to make things right between them, but so far, she hadn\u2019t given him a chance. He\u2019d called for her, his voice whisking through a doorway they\u2019d somehow opened between their minds\u2014I need you\u2014and though her heart had sped into a wild beat of excitement, she\u2019d ignored the urge to respond to him. For a little while, at least.</p><p>She just...she hadn\u2019t wanted him to see her like this. Defeated. Not again. Unlike the Fae, he prized strength in a female. So, she\u2019d wanted to prove herself worthy and free herself, surprising him.</p> <p>She would be all, Ta da! Here I am. Look at what I did all by myself. Aren\u2019t I spectacular?</p><p>He would never again think to kiss another woman just to protect her.</p><p>But, at this rate, Josephina may not ever get free.</p><p>So, she had a few choices to make. Either she believed Kane would want her, no matter what, or she had to let him go. Either she forgave him completely, and stayed with him, or held on to her hurt and bitterness and remained alone. She couldn\u2019t have both. If she couldn\u2019t trust him, if she couldn\u2019t forgive, but stayed with him anyway, she would continue to lash out at him, and she knew very well what such cruel treatment could do to a person.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked away from her. \u201cYes, Tink.\u201d</p><p>He thought she meant to reject him, she realized. \u201cProject to me.\u201d</p><p>He knew what she meant, and a second later, he was standing before her, gazing at her with hope.</p><p>Her chest constricted as she wrapped her arms around his neck and held on tight. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you called me.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in the hollow of her neck. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d The tears returned, but this time, they sprang from a well of joy. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Anytime. Always.\u201d He straightened, brushed the corners of her eyes with his thumbs.</p><p>She gulped, almost unable to bear his tenderness. \u201cWould you have picked me above all women? If you hadn\u2019t been forced to marry me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. I do. And I was never forced, Tinker Bell. I wanted you, and I would have found a way to have you. Your father just made things easier for me.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved upward of its own accord. \u201cSo...you think I\u2019m special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe specialest.\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbled over. \u201cI know it didn\u2019t seem like it at the time, but I would have picked you above all men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven Torin and Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially Torin and Paris. You are, without a doubt, the sexiest man ever created. I just didn\u2019t want you to regret what we were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never regret my time with you.\u201d He kissed her, a sweet meeting of lips more about comfort than passion. But oh, the passion was there, too. Always it was there. \u201cWhat you said...thank you, Tink. I was always the warrior left behind. My friends didn\u2019t want to risk the trouble Disaster would cause and I couldn\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s nice to be wanted.\u201d</p><p>He understood her pain, she realized. Their circumstances might have been different, but the outcome had been the same: a deep sense of rejection. He\u2019d probably longed for acceptance all the days of his life. He\u2019d probably hoped and dreamed of helping his friends, only to be crushed time and time again when they overlooked his amazing battle skills.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather have fight for me,\u201d she said truthfully.</p><p>He graced her with another kiss. \u201cYou are a treasure. I hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him. A compliment she hadn\u2019t had to give to herself. Was there anything sweeter? \u201cWhere did you go when we were running from the Brother Husbands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Moirai summoned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Oh, no. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what was necessary, and it might take the witches a few years to recover,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cWhere are the Brother Husbands\u2014is that what we\u2019re calling them now? Where are they keeping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I remember being on the street, then engaging the boys, then...nothing until I woke up inside a tent. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s outside it\u2014I would have looked, but I\u2019m bound to a post.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou consider their binding you to a post doing their best to romance you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey only bound me after I threw Green\u2019s specially prepared food in his face\u2014a fourth time. Anyway. The air is hot and smells of patchouli. There are four fur beds on the ground, and I think I hear screams in the background.\u201d</p><p>A dark curtain fell over Kane\u2019s features. \u201cI know where you are. I\u2019ll be there before sunrise.\u201d</p><p>HE HAD TO return to hell.</p><p>The moment the fog disappeared, taking Tink with it, Kane stopped projecting his image and rose from the bed. His legs shook. His stomach twisted.</p><p>A hand here...a mouth there...so helpless...</p><p>A whip across his legs. A dagger along his ribs.</p><p>Hot breath on his wounded skin...kisses...</p><p>Panic threatened to fell him. He wouldn\u2019t let it. Whatever his body\u2019s reaction, he had to do this. He couldn\u2019t leave Tink in hell. Wouldn\u2019t leave her. He knew the things that happened there. Oh, yes, he knew, and now had to race to the bathroom to empty the contents of his stomach.</p><p>He rinsed out his mouth and stared at his haunted reflection. Tink could be stolen from the Rainbow Rejects and tortured by minions. If that happened, she would stop wanting to live and once again start wanting to die. She would never smile or laugh again. He couldn\u2019t fathom a life without her smile. She needed him, and he\u2019d vowed to protect her, no matter what, even if he had to face his worst nightmare to do it.</p><p>He forced himself to stalk to the side of Lucien\u2019s bed, and, with a trembling hand, shook the warrior awake. \u201cI need you to flash me to...hell.\u201d He described the camp Lucien was to find, doing his best not to vomit. This had to be done.</p><p>The pair asked no questions. They stood. Lucien tucked Anya in his right side, and wrapped his left arm around Kane\u2019s shoulders. Used to be, he could only flash one person at a time, but his power was increasing.</p><p>Kane fought the urge to jerk away. Ignored the thought that he\u2019d rather die than return. For Tink, he would suffer anything.</p><p>Lucien flashed to the rocky entrance. Then deeper inside. Screams of agony filled the hot, sulfur-scented air. Disaster hummed with approval, loving how close he was to his minions.</p><p>Kane almost fought his way out of his friend\u2019s hold. The worst of his memories played through his mind, picture stills, a flash of one, then another, images of pain and suffering, somehow all the worse because he now saw them in black-and-white\u2014except for the blood. Scarlet dripped from his many wounds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deeper inside the cave. Deeper still...</p><p>The next time Lucien paused, Kane hunched over and dry heaved. The warrior didn\u2019t release him\u2014perhaps he knew Kane would have bolted. When he finished, he straightened and wiped the moisture from his mouth with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cJust a little farther, I think,\u201d Lucien said, and flashed again.</p> <p>\u201cI can make it.\u201d Maybe.</p><p>At last the warrior stopped at the top of a smoky cliff.</p><p>Kane croaked out, \u201cHere.\u201d Patchouli saturated the air, a scent he knew far too well.</p><p>Still battling the urge to run, he crouched and peered down at a land littered with jagged rocks and black dirt. There were trees, but they were gnarled and without any sign of life. In the center was the tent Tink had mentioned, big and flesh-colored\u2014Kane knew the Rainbow Rejects had skinned people to make it.</p><p>Tink was inside. Bound to a post. Helpless.</p> <p>Fury overshadowed the worst of his revulsion. The men themselves sat around a fire pit, roasting marshmallows, utterly at ease. Probably strategizing the best way to \u201cromance\u201d Tink.</p><p>My Tink. No one romances her but me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d a familiar voice demanded from behind.</p><p>Kane twisted while palming a dagger. He came face-to-face with William.</p><p>\u201cWilly Willy Boo Bear!\u201d Anya said with a grin. Her beautiful face lit with delight. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you like crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t missed you, brat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave not.\u201d</p><p>A slap fight broke out.</p><p>Normally Kane would have been amused. Now? His nerves were too frayed.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Lucien said, and the ridiculous fight of the she-cats stopped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill your boys,\u201d Kane said. And fast. He wanted out of this place.</p><p>\u201cFunny, but I\u2019m going to kill my boys,\u201d William gritted, taking the spot beside him. \u201cThey actually left me for dead in S\u00e9duire. And good thing, too, because the Phoenix burned down the king\u2019s gardens, and someone has to face punishment. He\u2019s picked your Tinker Hell, because, apparently, she\u2019s to blame for everything. He\u2019ll be sending a contingent of soldiers after her.\u201d</p><p>Kane studied the area, plotting the best course of action against the Rainbow Rejects, saying distractedly, \u201cToo bad she belongs to me now, not him.\u201d If he climbed down the cliff, he would be easily spotted. The Rainbow Rejects would be distracted, would leave their posts to fight him. Lucien could flash into the tent, and whisk Tink to safety.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s certain you\u2019re tired of your Tink by now. He\u2019s expecting a thank-you hug.\u201d</p><p>That was because, to Tiberius, she had no worth.</p><p>The man needed to be taught better.</p><p>\u201cForget the Fae. Where\u2019s White?\u201d he asked. If necessary, he would fight her, too.</p><p>\u201cShe helped her brothers ambush me, but at least she came back to doctor me,\u201d William said. \u201cTherefore, I only put her in time-out.\u201d</p><p>William had once put a Hunter in time-out. The male had chewed through his own wrists in an attempt to escape the pain the warrior had unleashed.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d the warrior added. \u201cHave you noticed anything unusual about your wedding ring? I\u2019d always heard it had strange powers, but I never wanted to risk my precious life by putting it on.\u201d</p><p>Kane judged the distance from the bottom of the cliff to the campfire. \u201cSo you risked my precious life instead?\u201d If the Rainbow Rejects opted not to fight him, they might have enough time to get to Tink before Lucien could flash in and free her.</p><p>It was a chance he\u2019d have to take.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d William said. \u201cHello. I\u2019m smart like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ring shows me when an enemy is near.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Electric blues narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cGive it back.\u201d</p><p>Kane ignored him, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the Rainbow Rejects. Lucien, you\u2019ll take care of Tink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Anya demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou get to cheer us on.\u201d Lucien would never forgive him if something happened to his precious.</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d William said. \u201cIf I know my boys, and I do, they\u2019ve bound your Tinker Hell with special chains. Lucien won\u2019t be able to cut her loose, and if he can\u2019t cut her loose, he can\u2019t flash her. He\u2019ll need a key.\u201d</p><p>A complication, but not one that was insurmountable. \u201cDo you have a key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d William offered no more.</p><p>Kane massaged the back of his neck. \u201cGet the key and I\u2019ll give you the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that. This is gonna take me a while, so I\u2019ll see you when I see you.\u201d A grinning William vanished.</p><p>Kane wasn\u2019t waiting a while. Not here. Not with Tink so close. \u201cNew plan. You two stay here until William gets back, then swoop in and grab Tink. I\u2019ll get the Rainbow Rejects out of the area.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for their reply. And he wasn\u2019t going to waste time climbing. His sense of urgency rising, he stood and jumped, falling down...down...down and landing on his feet. Impact split the bones in his shins, but he didn\u2019t care, his adrenaline too high to let him feel such pain. A scowl marred his features as he straightened.</p><p>The boys glanced up. The moment they spotted him, they leaped to their feet. But they didn\u2019t run.</p><p>\u201cMust admit, I expected you sooner,\u201d Red said, unfazed.</p><p>\u201cThis is our territory,\u201d Black said. \u201cYou should have stayed away.\u201d</p><p>Green rubbed his hands together with glee.</p><p>\u201cTink is mine, and I will never share her.\u201d</p><p>Kane and the Rainbow Rejects launched toward each other, meeting in the middle. A black mist instantly puffed around them, locking the four of them in a circle of menace. He\u2019d expected it, and was ready to go with a dagger and an ax, hacking at his opponents. The males arched to elude impact, then, as they straightened, slashed at him with their growing claws. Maybe they made contact. Maybe they didn\u2019t. Still he felt only the fiery edges of his rage and determination.</p><p>He looked at Red, smiled\u2014but launched the ax at Black.</p><p>Black wasn\u2019t prepared, and had no time to react. The metal embedded in his throat, severing his windpipe. He hit the ground, and stayed down.</p><p>Red roared, a testament to his rage. Green bared his teeth in a fearsome scowl filled with fangs. Kane palmed a second dagger, and attacked with more vigor. He remained in constant motion, slashing, ducking, slashing again, cutting the pair to ribbons.</p><p>\u201cKill you,\u201d Red snarled, going low and knocking Kane\u2019s ankles together.</p><p>He hit the ground, but rolled back to a stand before either male could pin him.</p><p>Silent, he stalked forward and hit at them with renewed strength, driving the pair backward. But Green worked his way behind him, and struck, probably drilling a hole in the back of his skull with the slam of his fist.</p><p>Kane nearly blacked out, but didn\u2019t let it slow him. He went low, spinning, kicking out his leg, knocking Green down...rising, nailing Red in the shoulder.</p><p>The warriors quickly recovered, swiping at him. He had to crisscross his arms again and again, his body arcing one way then the other, to avoid being pummeled and land other blows.</p><p>Realizing this was getting them nowhere, he allowed Red to hit him, because he couldn\u2019t sidestep it and strike at Green. He pounded his fist into Green\u2019s chest, sending the warrior stumbling back. Kane followed. The moment Green righted, Kane performed a hard jab to his jaw, followed by a second kick. This time, the dazed warrior fell. Kane was there when he landed, twisting his neck\u2014breaking his spine.</p><p>Green stayed down, too.</p><p>Red jumped on Kane\u2019s back, wrapped his arms around his neck, and tried to do the same to him, exactly as Kane had hoped. He rolled into the movement and ended up face-to-face with the guy, as if they were hugging. He wasted no time sinking a dagger into Red\u2019s side, straight into a kidney.</p><p>Grunting, the warrior stumbled away from him. Kane threw the second dagger and cut into the male\u2019s thigh, forcing him to his knees. Then, determined to end this once and for all, Kane kicked him in the face, breaking his nose and sending him flying back. He grabbed two more daggers, and, when Red rolled over to push upright, shoved the blades into his shoulders, pinning him down.</p><p>Disaster shrieked inside his head, and a second later, a rock fell from the cliff and careened toward Kane. He darted out of the way a split second before contact. Red wasn\u2019t so lucky.</p><p>The black mist melted away as Kane stood. He felt...ragged, desperate, as he stumbled forward, searching the area, wishing he were anywhere but here, his panic returning now that the fighting was done. He needed to leave. Had to leave. Now. Where was Tink? He needed to grab her and get her out of this hellhole. First, though, he probably needed to breathe. Why couldn\u2019t he breathe?</p><p>As he patted at his throat, finding no external obstruction, he spotted Lucien, Anya, William and Tink sitting in front of the fire. He stopped. Tink\u2019s black hair was brushed to a glossy shine, her skin scrubbed clean, and her clothes in perfect condition. She was safe. Relief and joy intermingled, a potent combination that managed to chase away the worst of his panic, opening his lungs and allowing him to suck in a measure of oxygen.</p><p>William eyed his boys, who were still lying on the ground. \u201cThey\u2019re not dead. Only a beheading will kill them.\u201d</p><p>Kane moved forward, intending to deliver the final blow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d William said, stopping him. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. They\u2019ve learned their lesson. They\u2019ll never approach your woman again. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Very well. Kane didn\u2019t need to see them dead\u2014he just needed the reassurance that his mine was safe from them.</p><p>He faced Tink.</p><p>She stood, wiping her hands against her thighs. Nervous? Or frightened of him? He was covered in blood, after all.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re free. That was fast.\u201d</p><p>William shifted. \u201cYeah, so, I was mistaken about the chain and key. Anya got her out. Go figure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe was bound by rope, nothing more, and I somehow managed to cut her loose,\u201d Anya said drily. \u201cImagine my surprise.\u201d</p><p>William had tried to trick him, just to gain possession of the ring. Kane wanted to care. He didn\u2019t care. His gaze remained locked with Tink\u2019s. She approached him. A second later, they were running at each other. She threw herself in his arms, and he spun her around.</p><p>\u201cTold you I\u2019d be here by morning,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d Now, he could get her out of here. Couldn\u2019t tolerate another minute inside these jagged walls. \u201cWe need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisaster,\u201d a female screeched in the distance. \u201cDisaster is here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? Where is he? I must have him!\u201d</p><p>Every muscle Kane possessed knotted. The minions had sensed him. The minions...the minions who had...had...NO! Sickness returned to his stomach, churning viciously. The females wanted to bind him and cut away his clothing. They wanted to touch him and taste him and steal his seed.</p> <p>They\u2019ll have you, Disaster said with a laugh. Over and over again.</p><p>Going to vomit.</p><p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s time to bail.\u201d William unsheathed a Sig Sauer from the waist of his pants. \u201cI can only flash myself. Lucien, you take care of the others.\u201d</p><p>Lucien nodded and flashed a protesting Anya to safety. He reappeared a few seconds later, grabbed a now trembling Kane and Tink, and flashed them away, too. The last thing Kane saw was William running forward, grinning with delight. And when he next blinked, he was standing inside the walls of the fortress he\u2019d never thought to revisit, once again barely able to breathe.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>The Realm of Blood and Shadows</p> <p>JOSEPHINA TOOK IN as much of the fortress as possible as Kane dragged her down a hall and up a flight of stairs. \u201cI almost can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in your home. I mean, I\u2019m actually in your home. I\u2019m living every Fae woman\u2019s dream.\u201d</p><p>The portraits on the walls caught her attention. Each contained a Lord of the Underworld in the buff, his manhood shielded by something feminine. A ribbon. A teddy bear. A scrap of lace. Then there were the portraits of the delicate blonde, the epitome of what Fae males found attractive. In one, she wore a ball gown. In another, a negligee. In yet another, black leather.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty,\u201d Josephina said, trying not to compare herself to the beauty. \u201cDoes she belong to one of your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The sharpness of his tone startled her. She studied the stiffness of his back, the jerkiness of his stride. \u201cKane? Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. He even ignored the people they passed.</p><p>\u201cKane, is that really you?\u201d said a male with black hair and violet eyes. Josephina recognized the infamous keeper of Violence. He was close enough to touch.</p><p>A baby girl was cradled in his arms. Oh, sweet mercy, he had a child? Why had the scribes not delivered such a juicy tidbit?</p> <p>Silent, Kane dragged her past the pair.</p><p>\u201cSo wonderful to meet you,\u201d she called. \u201cI\u2019m Josephina, and I absolutely love\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kane jerked her around the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you were on your honeymoon,\u201d said Strider, coming out of a bedroom.</p><p>\u201cSo lovely to see you again,\u201d Josephina called.</p><p>A petite redheaded lovely moved to his side, and she elbowed him in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I do now, baby doll?\u201d Strider asked with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cHoneymoon?\u201d the redhead said with a stomp of her foot. \u201cHe got married and you didn\u2019t think to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Paris and Torin wouldn\u2019t happen to be here, would they?\u201d Josephina asked Strider. \u201cI might die of a heart attack, but it would be worth it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kane pulled her in front of him, and slapped his hand over her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped her in front of a door. A bedroom, she realized when he got her inside. He released her and shut them both in. Awed, she drank in every nook and cranny. The chamber was spacious, with distressed walls of stone and a cracked marble floor. The furniture was antique, worn but chic. There were no pictures, though, no personal touches of any kind.</p><p>\u201cI need to\u2014\u201d Kane scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cI...need to go,\u201d he said, his gaze anywhere but on her.</p><p>She spun to face him. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he rushed to add. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll introduce you to everyone. I\u2019ll give you a tour. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want...you.\u201d</p><p>She was no longer the passive girl he\u2019d first met. She\u2019d been through too much, had survived too much. They\u2019d survived. She\u2019d decided to stand up for her rights, and that hadn\u2019t changed. She would fight for what she wanted, would even fight Kane himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Kane? What\u2019s wrong with you? Tell me. Don\u2019t push me aside. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head\u2019s messed up,\u201d he said in a tortured voice. \u201cThe weeks in hell...the demons...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I should have realized.\u201d She closed the distance between them, placed her palms on his chest. His heart drummed fast and erratic. Being there had reminded him of all he\u2019d endured, and yet still he\u2019d come for her. Such a precious man. My man. \u201cLet me help you. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Yes. Okay.\u201d He picked her up, carried her to the bed, and laid her across the mattress, then snuggled up beside her.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me. Purge the poison.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. Then another.</p><p>Then, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cbut it\u2019s possible for a woman to arouse a man\u2019s body, even if he doesn\u2019t want the woman herself. That\u2019s how, when I was trapped in hell, countless minions were able to...do things to me. It was far worse than I led you to believe. It was one female after another, their hands and mouths everywhere, as they tried to steal my seed. They wanted to have my babies, and I was rarely left alone. All the while, Disaster laughed. He\u2019s laughing now. He loves every second of my pain and humiliation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kane.\u201d Her poor, poor Kane. \u201cIt\u2019s not your humiliation, darling. It\u2019s Disaster\u2019s. It\u2019s the minions\u2019. They alone carry the shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have fought harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you really?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhen you\u2019re already stronger than any man I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are, and today proves it. Despite everything you endured, you still came back for me.\u201d</p><p>Against her cheek, she felt his heart skip a beat. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I? But...when I heard the demons closing in, I felt sick and cowardly. I should have faced them. I should have destroyed them. And one day I will. But today, I only wanted to flee.\u201d</p><p>And it had embarrassed his warrior soul, she realized. \u201cOh, Kane. Cowardliness has nothing to do with feeling, and everything to do with action. You acted despite everything. You are brave and valiant and worthy, and you had more to think about than vengeance. You had a woman you were trying to protect. You knew what the minions were capable of, and I bet you wanted me as far away from them as you could get me. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Only the slightest hesitation before he admitted, \u201cYes.\u201d Then he rolled onto his side and buried his head into the hollow of her neck. Something warm dripped onto her skin. A...tear? His arms wrapped around her and held on tight, and another droplet splashed, and then another and another. Soon, Kane was sobbing, great, gut-wrenching sobs, tremors racking his entire body.</p><p>Her heart breaking for him, Josephina cooed at him and ran her fingers through the silk of his hair. How long had these tears been trapped inside? How long had his inner wounds festered?</p><p>A few moments after he quieted, he rolled to the side, removing his weight from her, and sagged against the mattress. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just acted like a wom\u2014uh, a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTears aren\u2019t childish, silly. And they\u2019re not reserved for women, thank you very much. You were wronged, you were hurt and you suffered greatly. You\u2019re allowed to react.\u201d</p><p>His fingers dusted along the line of her jaw. \u201cYour wisdom humbles me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am amazingly smart.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, only to go quiet a second later. \u201cThey didn\u2019t succeed, you know. I didn\u2019t leave any of the minions pregnant.\u201d</p><p>She was glad. He wouldn\u2019t have survived that kind of connection to the Underworld.</p><p>Josephina sat up without ever breaking contact, and peered down at him. Whatever she\u2019d meant to say was superseded by, \u201cNo fair. When I cry, I look like a hag who\u2019s just left a boxing match. You look as beautiful as always.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a slow, lazy smile. \u201cYou think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve told you I consider you the incarnation of beautiful.\u201d She tugged his shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, you told me I\u2019m sexy. There\u2019s a difference. And not that I\u2019m complaining, but...what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you I wanted to smother all your bad memories with good? Well, we\u2019re starting today. Now.\u201d His boots were the next to go, followed by his pants and underwear, leaving him totally and completely naked.</p><p>Josephina perused him unabashedly. Actually, beautiful and sexy were words too mild for him. He had muscle stacked upon muscle, and flawless bronze skin, all topped off by the butterfly tattoo on his hip.</p><p>She traced the jagged edges of the wings. \u201cThe artwork catches my attention every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil sometimes comes in a very pretty package.\u201d</p><p>Very true. \u201cYou want to be rid of it. Of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll find a way to make it happen.\u201d She pressed her lips against his, feeding him a soft, sweet kiss. \u201cTogether, we can do anything. Now, grip the headboard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTink...\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t like. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you do, trust me, I\u2019ll like.\u201d</p> <p>Trembling, he stretched out his arms and did as she\u2019d commanded, and when she next kissed him, he accepted her without reservation, meeting her thrust for gentle thrust, before pressing more firmly, taking more deeply, changing the tone of the kiss. There was passion, yes. There was always passion between them. But he also kissed her with something more heady than reverence, as if she were the most important part of his life. As if he would want and need her always. As if he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of ever being without her.</p><p>Josephina took her time tasting and laving every inch of his body, learning how to please him as he offered instructions, telling her what he liked, and she obeyed, worshipping him, watching his face for any sign of uncertainty or distress. He never flinched or paled. He appeared undone. He appeared on edge with the force of his desire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to...Tink, you have to stop. I want to touch you, do things to you,\u201d he croaked. \u201cWant to have you.\u201d</p><p>Not just want but needed, she realized. Before, he\u2019d been bound, had lost all sense of control. He might never be able to fully relinquish power to her, and that was okay. She loved the way he mastered her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she said, \u201cto do with as you please.\u201d</p> <p>He had a condom on in the next instant, and her waist gripped in the one after that. He lifted her, and filled her, and all she could do was dig her nails into his chest and hang on for the wildest ride of her life.</p><p>He was untamed, undisciplined. He was savage. He was also brutally sweet. Because, as much as he took, he gave back even more, touching her in all the right places, driving her need higher and higher. And when the pleasure hit its peak, she could only throw back her head, the tips of her hair brushing against his groin. He roared, arching his hips, surging that much deeper, propelling her to a whole new level of satisfaction.</p><p>Panting, she collapsed on his chest. His arms wrapped around her and held tightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever leave me,\u201d he said, kissing her sweat-damp temple.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she vowed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong of me, I know it is, but I need you to stay with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong of you how?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI...know a way.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to realize he\u2019d returned to their earlier conversation. \u201cThe starving thing?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThings might get rocky for a while, and you\u2019d probably be better off without me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ah. That\u2019s what he\u2019d meant about asking her to stay being wrong of him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere without you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He closed his eyes, as if savoring her words. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not going anywhere without me.\u201d</p><p>KANE LEANED AGAINST the door frame and grinned as he watched Tink interact with the other women in the fortress. He\u2019d introduced her to everyone just this morning, and she was already a part of the family.</p><p>She\u2019d only asked for three autographs.</p> <p>Everyone had been so busy hunting details about the Paring Rod, and what could have happened to Cameo and Viola, they\u2019d forgotten to rest or eat. They\u2019d needed a break, a distraction, and Tink was now providing both.</p><p>The women loved Tink and fawned over her, and sure, that could be because he\u2019d threatened to murder anyone who hurt her feelings, but he didn\u2019t think so. There was something so welcoming about her. She smiled, and amusement lit her entire face. She spoke, and the wisdom of multiple lifetimes poured from her lips. She included everyone in her conversation, and showed no partiality. They were all special to her.</p><p>\u201cTell us more about life in the Fae palace,\u201d Ashlyn said while rocking her daughter to sleep.</p><p>He should leave. He had to talk to his friends about his deal with Taliyah\u2014and they would probably want to wipe the floor with his face for offering up their fortress. It would be best to get that out of the way while Tink was distracted. He turned to walk away.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tink said. \u201cI\u2019m now the most envied woman in the land. I married the famed keeper of Disaster.\u201d</p><p>He heard the pride in her voice, and couldn\u2019t help but turn back to her. He saw it in her eyes, too, and his heart soared. His friends could wait.</p><p>Anya bounced Urban up and down and patted him on the back, struggling to get him to burp. \u201cI want to hear more about Kane beating up your lecherous half brother. I bet that rocked your panties off! It would have mine, if I ever wore any.\u201d</p><p>Haidee, Amun\u2019s wife, shook her head; a mix of blond and pink hair danced over her shoulders. \u201cYou have to forgive her. She\u2019s just a little crazy in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, try a lot crazy in the head,\u201d Anya retorted, as if she were complimenting herself. In her mind, she probably was. \u201cI should have been committed centuries ago. Oh, wait. I was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Anarchy. Josephina was just about to tell us if Kane\u2019s as much of an animal in bed as I think.\u201d Gwen, Sabin\u2019s wife, waved to Tink, a silent command to continue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I wasn\u2019t going to talk about that,\u201d Tink said, taken aback.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you totally were. And while you\u2019re at it,\u201d said Kaia, Strider\u2019s consort, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you one of my galaxies\u2019 famous makeovers. Strider told me your family treated you like a servant and I firmly believe the best way to get revenge\u2014besides killing the stupid jerks with a blade...or a hammer...or a saw\u2014is to kill the stupid jerks with jealousy.\u201d</p><p>Sienna, Paris\u2019s wife, snapped her fingers and a rack of dresses and a vanity piled high with makeup appeared. \u201cTa da! Let the makeover begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeat trick,\u201d Tink said, clapping.</p><p>Gilly, William\u2019s teenage charge, leaned toward Tink, her expression earnest. \u201cI hear you spent some time with William. Did you happen to notice the kind of women he...you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy poor ears,\u201d Anya said. \u201cThey do not need to hear about Willy you-knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are weird,\u201d Scarlet said. \u201cI should kill you all in your sleep. That way, I\u2019d stop stressing about missing friends\u2014because I wouldn\u2019t have any friends. It would be win/win.\u201d She was the keeper of Nightmares, the wife of Gideon, and there was no one scarier. Most people ran from her at the first opportunity.</p><p>But not Tink. Tink patted her on top of the head. \u201cDon\u2019t go near Kane, or I\u2019ll have to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about William?\u201d Gilly prompted.</p><p>\u201cShe can go near him if she wants,\u201d Tink said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gilly twisted the fabric of her T-shirt. \u201cHis women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go to my room now?\u201d Legion, Aeron\u2019s adopted daughter, interrupted. She was pale and withdrawn, and Kane hated the reason why. Like him, she\u2019d spent a little time in hell.</p><p>Earlier today, he\u2019d gone to her room to talk with her. She hadn\u2019t responded when he\u2019d knocked, so he\u2019d gone in thinking to leave her a note. He\u2019d found her huddled in the far corner, her knees drawn to her chest as she etched pictures on the wall. Pictures of Galen, once the second in command of the Hunters, now under Sienna\u2019s control.</p><p>Galen, who\u2019d once thought to enslave the girl.</p><p>\u201cLegion,\u201d he\u2019d said, and she\u2019d stiffened. She had the body of a porn star, and yet, at that moment, she appeared to be nothing more than a child.</p><p>With her back to him, she\u2019d said, \u201cI hate that name. I won\u2019t answer to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to call you?\u201d He\u2019d kept his tone gentle.</p><p>\u201cAnything but that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I\u2019ll call you Honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I want to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>His heart broke for her. \u201cI\u2019ll go. I just wanted you to know I\u2019ve been where you are, and I\u2019ve been through what you\u2019ve been through, and if you ever want to talk about it with someone who understands, come find me. It doesn\u2019t make you better, but...it helps.\u201d</p><p>Now, in the present, Olivia, Aeron\u2019s wife, wrapped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cStay with us a little longer. Please.\u201d</p><p>Legion\u2014Honey\u2014flinched at the contact, but nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Tink scanned each expectant face, a gleam of awe dawning in those baby blues, as if she couldn\u2019t quite believe they were talking to her\u2014and actually liked her. So wise in so many ways, yet so innocent in so many others. \u201cLet me tackle this one at a time. First, the Fae palace is huge and luxurious and filled with treasures, but the people kind of suck.\u201d</p><p>Gwen and Kaia smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI think a treasure hunt is in our future,\u201d Kaia said.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Gwen replied.</p><p>\u201cSecond,\u201d Tink continued, \u201cI won\u2019t divulge a single detail about what Kane and I do in the bedroom. Except to say that it\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m probably the most satisfied woman in the fortress, if not the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I am!\u201d Anya said.</p><p>\u201cNo, me!\u201d Kaia replied.</p><p>\u201cThird, a makeover would be nice. Thank you. Fourth, William...yes. He spent time with a beautiful but very cruel blonde. The queen, who is kind of like my stepmother. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gilly nodded, the twinkle fading from her eyes. \u201cA married woman,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the man I thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Tink reached over and squeezed her hand, a gesture of comfort and understanding. When she realized she wasn\u2019t wearing her gloves, she jerked her arm away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have touched\u2014no, wait. I can. Kane made sure.\u201d</p><p>He grinned\u2014the pride was back.</p><p>Hate her! Hate them! Disaster banged against his skull, roaring, growling, threatening.</p><p>Beside him, a light bulb shorted out. At his feet, a crack formed in the marble.</p><p>Here we go, he thought, fighting a spear of dread. The hunger pains had begun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Every eye darted to him. He ground his molars and nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>A hard hand on his shoulder drew his attention to the male behind him. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, he said, \u201cWilliam. What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the welcome I get after everything I\u2019ve done for you? Thanks a lot, dude.\u201d</p><p>Kane drew back a fist and let it fly, nailing the warrior in the nose. Blood instantly spurted. \u201cNo, that\u2019s the thanks you get.\u201d</p><p>William grinned, his warped sense of humor obviously coming out to play. \u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time you try and trick me, I won\u2019t stop with one punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>And now that that was settled... \u201cLast I saw you, you were headed into a fight with the minions. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA slaughter, that\u2019s what. Those females got what was coming to them, I assure you. And now, you owe me, like, big time.\u201d He blew the ladies a kiss and started toward the library. He only looked back at Gilly once.</p><p>Kane followed him, and, taking a page from his playbook, threw one last glance at Tink. She smiled at him, so sweet and pretty, and he smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI owe you nothing,\u201d he said to William. He wasn\u2019t sure whether to feel elated his enemy was dead, or ticked that vengeance would never be his.</p><p>He\u2019d go with ticked.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019d you get my ring?\u201d he asked, just to taunt the warrior.</p> <p>Those electric blues narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cYou mean my ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said. My ring.\u201d</p><p>A pause. A stiff shrug. \u201cFine. Keep it. I stole it from a woman I bedded and killed. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Anyway. The ring\u2019s probably cursed, luring you into a false sense of calm.\u201d</p><p>Another light bulb shorted out, a spray of flames seeking Kane as if he wore a bull\u2019s eye. He remained silent as he entered the room. William shut and locked the door, just in case the women decided to come looking for them. Kane swept his gaze over the men scattered throughout the room. Lucien, Sabin, Strider, Amun, Paris, Gideon, Aeron, Reyes, Maddox and Torin, who stood in the far corner. Weeks had passed since they\u2019d all been together like this.</p><p>Together, they were a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>\u201cSo your girl\u2019s in trouble, huh?\u201d Strider said. \u201cWilliam told us about her father\u2019s plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do to help?\u201d Sabin asked.</p><p>Help, he\u2019d said. He wasn\u2019t trying to take over, and didn\u2019t plan to leave Kane behind. He understood Kane\u2019s need to participate in his woman\u2019s liberation. Some of the tension left him\u2014</p> <p>Until another light bulb shorted out.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I have to be straight with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI need you out of the fortress, no questions asked, in a little less than three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. No questions asked, he thought with a roll of his eyes. Whatever. \u201cTo find Tink, I made a bargain with someone. That person gets the fortress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Sabin demanded.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>There was grumbling. Of course there was grumbling. But the warriors would have done the same thing for their women, and they knew it. There was no debate in the end\u2014they would leave.</p><p>Next, Kane outlined his plan for the Fae king, and all of his friends nodded encouragingly. It was dangerous, and it required a huge sacrifice from every person in the fortress, but it was the fastest way to prove Tink\u2019s worth to her father\u2014and all of the Fae.</p><p>Then, and only then, would Tiberius understand Kane would never let her go. Hunting her would do no good. She would never again be a blood slave.</p><p>When he finished, Sabin stroked his chin and pondered. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d the warrior asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kane replied.</p><p>\u201cCause any lasting damage?\u201d Reyes demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Lucien asked.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have my agreement,\u201d Strider said with a shrug. \u201cNow, you just have to get Kaia\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Kane nodded. He\u2019d expected that. \u201cI will.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t fail.</p><p>William placed his hand over his heart. \u201cThis plan is so devious, it\u2019s almost as if I thought of it. I\u2019m quite impressed.\u201d</p><p>Kane flipped him off, just because. And even as the wall beside him rumbled and shook, as if preparing to collapse on him, he felt lighter than he had in weeks. He felt...free. Free of the past and the pain, the memories and the hate.</p><p>Last night, Tink had done something to him. She had soothed the beast inside, perhaps. Or maybe she had cauterized what remained of his wounds.</p><p>Now, he would do the same for her.</p><p>\u201cWe leave in the morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>KANE LEFT TINK sleeping in their room, and knocked on Reyes and Danika\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Reyes shouted, sounding out of breath.</p><p>No need to wonder what was going on in there. \u201cI need to speak with Danika. I\u2019m staying put until I do.\u201d</p><p>Pounding footsteps. The hard twist of a knob. A scowling Reyes appeared. He was shirtless, his pants undone, his hair askew. \u201cYou\u2019re flirting with death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Lucien finds me adorable. The painting,\u201d he said, looking past his friend to the beautiful girl strolling toward him, tying a terrycloth robe around her waist. \u201cWhat can you tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, saying, \u201cI struggled with the appearance of the female. One second I saw a brunette that could have been Josephina, but I\u2019m not one hundred percent certain about that, and the next I saw the pale-haired female I ended up painting.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d first met her, Tink had changed facades, but the ability of the Phoenix had left her, so she wasn\u2019t the pale-haired one in disguise. \u201cThe Moirai told me I had two possible mates. William thought one was his daughter White, and I thought one was Tink\u2019s half sister, Synda. Both are blondes.\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment, sighed. \u201cYou should show the artwork to Josephina. If that\u2019s her body\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014she would recognize herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d seen and kissed and touched every inch of her. \u201cI know her body better than she does.\u201d</p><p>Danika gave another sigh. \u201cI can believe it. Anyway, there\u2019s something strange about that painting. I\u2019ve never had trouble locking onto an identity, and I\u2019ve never been wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTink\u2019s safe.\u201d The assurance was for him, not Danika. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to her.\u201d Even though his plan involved throwing her straight to the wolves. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more you can tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis meeting is over, then.\u201d Reyes shut the door in his face.</p><p>PANTING AND SWEATING, Josephina peered up at Kane. He hovered over her, panting just as hard, sweating just as badly. She watched a bead trickle from his forehead to his temple and catch in his hair, mesmerized.</p><p>\u201cHow was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely terrible.\u201d His lashes fused, hiding the brilliance of those angry hazel eyes. \u201cThe worst.\u201d</p><p>Brutal honesty sucked sometimes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d</p><p>Hey! \u201cYou\u2019re seconds away from being slapped!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a welcome change.\u201d</p><p>She shoved him off, and he rolled to a stand. They\u2019d been training for hours, and she was tired. She hadn\u2019t slept last night\u2014even after Kane had made love to her and exhausted her\u2014her mind too busy outlining every possible flaw to his crazy plan. The only real fight she\u2019d ever been in had happened in hell, but at the time she\u2019d had the abilities of the Phoenix and had simply burned everything that had approached her. She didn\u2019t have that luxury now.</p><p>He helped her stand, his calluses tickling her skin. \u201cYou have to use every weapon at your disposal. A rock on the ground. Your knees. Whatever. Don\u2019t be afraid to get down and dirty, and inflict major damage. If your attacker\u2019s face is within striking distance, like mine just was, poke out his eyes. Break his nose with the heel of your hand, sending cartilage into his brain.\u201d</p><p>Josephina anchored her hands on her hips. \u201cUntil now, I haven\u2019t wanted to do those things to you, and that\u2019s the only reason you\u2019ve been able to take me down so many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason?\u201d</p><p>Argh! She ripped off her tennis shoe and tossed it at him.</p><p>The heavy heel banged into his shoulder and toppled to the ground.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d He nodded with his first display of pride. \u201cThat\u2019s a habit that must run in your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to feel the sting of the other shoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know you can take down an opponent, Tink. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if something happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Okay. All right. That, she could understand. The plan hinged on her, and what she could do. She would be in the thick of danger, and he would be worried.</p><p>She would be worried, but she wasn\u2019t going to let it stop her. I\u2019m stronger than I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m determined. I know the stakes.</p><p>I deserve to live and love. And I will.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she said, stepping toward him. \u201cYou\u2019ve left me no choice. I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>She punched him in the mouth. Pain exploded through her knuckles and arm, and his head whipped to the side. Slowly he faced her. A cascade of crimson flowed from the corner of his lip, obscene against the bronze of his skin. He grinned, the blood even staining his teeth.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s my girl. Good job.\u201d</p><p>A knock reverberated through the room, saving her from an embarrassing display of self-congratulations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready for you,\u201d Sabin called.</p><p>Kane\u2019s grin disappeared. \u201cWe\u2019ll be down in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>He tugged Josephina into the bathroom, stripped her, stripped himself and turned on the water for a quick shower. Soapy hands wandered, and once again Josephina found herself panting from exertion. As much touching as they\u2019d done, her body was already primed.</p> <p>\u201cWe only have a few minutes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d But, every time before had taken hours. \u201cAre you sure I\u2019ll enjoy this? I mean, I want you, but I also want to reach the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider it a personal mission to ensure that you do.\u201d He donned a condom and pushed her against the wall. He was inside her a second later, and oh...oh! The way he moved...hard and fast, nothing held back...he wrung groan after groan from her. He kissed her, a tinge of desperation to every thrust of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI could drain the life out of you in seconds,\u201d she rasped. \u201cI could kill you.\u201d</p> <p>He moaned with pleasure-roughened arousal. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never know what happened. One moment you would be lucid, the next you would be dead.\u201d</p><p>He became a wild man, whatever tether he\u2019d had on his control broken. Her thoughts derailed as he hammered at her, the pleasure too much, not enough and...yes, yes, yes...</p><p>\u201cKane!\u201d she shouted, her body breaking apart, reforming, every inch of her branded by the man in her arms.</p><p>He bit the cord between her neck and shoulder as he shuddered against her, the pressure somehow propelling her into another level of rapture. For a minute...an eternity...black dots flashed behind her eyes and silence cloaked her ears. She was lost to the pleasure.</p><p>When she came down, Kane was grinning at her. \u201cTold you,\u201d he said, all masculine satisfaction.</p> <p>The tub shattered beneath their feet. He slipped and caught himself on the curtain rod above their heads. Her legs were still wrapped around Kane\u2019s waist, her feet protected from the shards. But not his. Blood welled from several incisions.</p><p>\u201cThis will pass,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Scowling now, Kane carried her out of the debris. He set her on her feet, and they dressed as swiftly as possible and rushed to the ballroom to meet with his friends.</p><p>The women formed a line in the center, their men behind them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d He gave her a swift kiss. \u201cYour family will never see you coming.\u201d</p><p>And she had to do whatever was necessary to defeat them. That way, they would never again think to use her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d she asked the women. She was to borrow the strength and power of everyone but Scarlet, who was demon-possessed, Ashlyn, a nursing mother, and Danika, whose visions of the future could distract her.</p> <p>Each female squared her shoulders, raised her chin.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Trembling, Josephina reached toward Gwen. She stopped just before contact. \u201cLast chance to back out. When I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll be weak. It could last a few hours or a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeak schmeak. I know the problems dirtbag dads can cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father is Galen, keeper of Hope and Jealousy,\u201d Kane explained, stepping up beside her to offer moral support. \u201cThough he doesn\u2019t carry the kind of hope you might think. It\u2019s false hope that Galen offers. Real hope is essential...miraculous.\u201d He looked at her, his hazels bright. \u201cThe kind that you gave me.\u201d</p><p>The kind he\u2019d given her.</p><p>She melted into him.</p><p>\u201cDo it. Drain me. You\u2019ll need what I\u2019ve got,\u201d Gwen added as Sabin came to stand behind her. \u201cI\u2019m amazingly strong and faster than light.\u201d</p><p>Sabin placed his hands on his wife\u2019s shoulders. \u201cJust don\u2019t hurt my favorite toy, and we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Gwen preened as she tapped her thumb against her chest. \u201cToday I\u2019m his toy.\u201d Next, she hitched that thumb in Sabin\u2019s direction. \u201cTomorrow he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Toy. Yes. The perfect word to describe such a delicate-looking female; Josephina wasn\u2019t sure how much strength she would be able to take without putting the girl into a coma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle,\u201d Josephina promised, wrapping her fingers around Gwen\u2019s wrist. \u201cAnd thank you for this. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever be able to repay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, flipped the mental switch that she now knew caused her pores to open and create suction...pulling...pulling on the strength the female possessed.</p><p>Energy fizzed in her veins, as potent as if she\u2019d stuck her finger into a light socket, and she reeled at the force, feeling shocked and giddy.</p><p>When she released Gwen, the poor girl sagged into her husband\u2019s arms. \u201cWow! That was amazing.\u201d</p><p>Kane urged her to turn to Kaia.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want what I\u2019ve got most of all,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cI\u2019m part Phoenix, and I start fires when I\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><p>The moment they touched, Josephina experienced the same crackling surge of energy, but also a flood of warmth. Heat...so much heat swept through her, and she felt as if her body would erupt into flames at any second. It was a familiar sensation, the same one she\u2019d encountered with the other Phoenix.</p><p>With Anya, she felt as if she had been invaded by a mighty wind.</p><p>With Haidee, there was freezing cold.</p><p>Gilly tried to step up to the line. \u201cMy turn,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>William appeared at her side and tugged her to the far corner of the room, saying, \u201cNot going to happen, Gum Drop.\u201d To Josephina, he called, \u201cShe\u2019s only human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing human isn\u2019t synonymous with weakness,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>\u201cSynonymous is a big word for such a small child,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m not a child. I\u2019m old enough to carry my weight around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I guess it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t weigh very much.\u201d</p><p>She pointed a finger in his face. \u201cOne day I\u2019m going to show you just how strong I actually am, William the Idiot.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as if he didn\u2019t care, but the hard gleam in his eyes said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can hold anything else,\u201d Josephina said. She could burst at any second. Never had she felt this strong. This...invincible. And...and...she couldn\u2019t just stand there. She had to move.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kane asked after she\u2019d leaped into motion.</p><p>\u201cRunning around the room.\u201d She was too hot....too cold...too everything. Could fight any enemy. Conquer the entire world. And she wouldn\u2019t even chip a nail, she thought with a maniacal laugh. \u201cAre the women okay? Do you think they\u2019re okay? I really hope they\u2019re okay.\u201d The words poured from her, coming faster and faster. Just like her steps. Soon she was sprinting\u2014and not even winded.</p><p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d Kane called, watching her. His lips twitched at the corners. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>The warrior glanced away from the teenage girl, and said, \u201cJust a sec,\u201d before turning back to the girl and getting in her face. \u201cGo to your room and wait for me. We\u2019re going to discuss the whole proving-yourself thing and put a stop to it now, before I\u2019m forced to clean up a mess I\u2019ll make you wish you hadn\u2019t made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop telling me what to do. You aren\u2019t my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you I\u2019ve never wanted to be your father?\u201d he yelled, raising his voice for the first time since Josephina had met him. \u201cI want you safe, and I\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to see to it, even hurt your feelings.\u201d</p><p>All of the Lords watched with unabashed shock.</p><p>Cheeks reddened from the force of her anger, Gilly marched from the room.</p><p>William watched her until he could watch her no more. Then he tangled a hand through his hair and faced the men, his expression devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d He strode to the center of the room and withdrew a few things from his pockets. Pieces of gum?</p><p>He held the\u2014no, not gum\u2014whatever up, and when he let go, the small, chewy-looking objects actually remained in midair.</p><p>\u201cIncoming,\u201d he shouted, and everyone in the room turned away.</p><p>Kane threw himself at Josephina, knocking her into the ground, absorbing most of the impact. What\u2014</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A hot gust of air licked over her, then Kane was rolling away from her and helping her to her feet. Or rather, trying to. She accidentally jerked him down beside her, and he hit with so much force he might have punctured a lung.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Actually laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, sweetheart.\u201d He stood and motioned for her to do the same.</p><p>She hopped to her feet and saw that William had somehow blasted through the realm to create a doorway into S\u00e9duire. Night had fallen\u2014the time for parties. The entire Fae court would be gathered in the throne room. The moon was out, a crimson sliver in the blackness of the sky. A walking path was lit by torches.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should think about this,\u201d she said, suddenly nervous.</p><p>\u201cNo more thinking.\u201d</p><p>What about stalling? \u201cWhat happened to the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, if you aren\u2019t a Fae, they break down and stop working,\u201d Kane replied. \u201cMine stopped working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Okay.\u201d If she didn\u2019t act now, she wasn\u2019t going to act at all. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d She raced forward.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d Kane called, stopping her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Oh, yeah. \u201cSorry.\u201d She backtracked and grabbed Kane\u2019s hand. He cringed, and she realized she had to keep her newfound strength in check or she would crush his bones. \u201cSorry again!\u201d</p><p>His grin returned, wide and toothy and full of good humor. \u201cI told you. Don\u2019t worry about it. Now do what needs doing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They marched toward the Fae realm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you thirty minutes, then I\u2019m coming in,\u201d William announced.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this,\u201d Kane replied without turning back.</p> <p>His friends were staying in the Realm of Blood and Shadows to protect their weakened women. William was their backup.</p><p>\u201cSee you in thirty,\u201d William said with a wave.</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustrating,\u201d Kane muttered.</p> <p>They passed through the doorway, entered the charred remains of her father\u2019s garden. Dark smoke still wafted through the air.</p><p>Josephina\u2019s heart thundered in her chest. What if she failed, like she\u2019d done during much of her training today? What if Kane got hurt? She would forever blame herself\u2014and rightly so.</p><p>Yeah, but what if you succeed?</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she thought she spotted the warrior with white-and-gold wings, the one who\u2019d brought her new clothing. But...surely not. That would mean he was following her.</p><p>She searched the darkness, but found no other sign of him.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Kane said.</p> <p>He led her toward the palace. Whenever a guard passed, he would shield her with his body, doing his best to hide them both. Finally, they reached the door to one of the secret passages.</p><p>Inside, Josephina took the lead. Down the hall. Up a flight of steps. Down a flight of steps. Around a corner. Around another corner. Trading one passage for another, moving at such a rapid pace, never giving herself time to think, until they reached their destination.</p><p>Her heart drummed as she stopped. Through the two-way mirror, she saw the throne room was as crowded as she\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>No. Yes. She had better be. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, sweetheart. I believe in you.\u201d</p><p>Now, to believe in herself. Josephina pushed open the door, and with her head held high, entered the throng.</p><p>Two girls spotted her and gasped. They told their friends, and their friends gasped. One set of eyes after another found her.</p> <p>Josephina walked forward, Kane behind her; the crowd parted, making way. Soon, the royal family came into view, each member perched on a throne.</p><p>Leopold spotted her and stood. Synda waved and smiled, as if Josephina hadn\u2019t ruined her wedding. The queen scowled.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d the king said, rubbing his jaw. \u201cYou have returned.\u201d His gaze slid to Kane and filled with satisfaction. \u201cTired of her already?\u201d</p><p>Kane wound his arm around her and kissed her temple. \u201cI\u2019ll never be tired of her. She\u2019s mine. I chose her then, and I choose her now. I\u2019ll choose her tomorrow and every day after.\u201d</p><p>Sweet heat. No one had ever... He\u2019d just said...</p><p>Murmurs swept through the crowd. Josephina turned in a circle, meeting the stunned gazes of the Fae. These people had ignored her and talked down to her and laughed at her pain. No one had ever offered to help her. Now, envy looked back at her.</p><p>In a single moment, Kane had undone years of rejection. He\u2019d given worth to the female no one had wanted. This man... He wasn\u2019t a disaster. He was a savior.</p><p>And he\u2019s mine.</p><p>King Tiberius frowned. \u201cThen why are you here, Lord Kane?\u201d</p><p>Do it. Finish this. \u201cHe heard you were looking for me, coming for me,\u201d Josephina said. \u201cI decided to save you the trouble and settle things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to settle things?\u201d The king perked up, motioning to the space at his feet. \u201cThen bow before me. Offer your apologies for the destruction of the garden and accept your sentence when it\u2019s pronounced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, exactly, did I do wrong?\u201d she asked, lifting her chin.</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cJust like your mother...everything.\u201d</p><p>Anger torched any remorse she might have entertained over this. Bludgeoned any sadness, strangled any guilt.</p><p>But then, realization struck her. He blamed her for her mother\u2019s decline and death, and always had. Always would.</p><p>Had he actually loved the woman, in his own warped way?</p><p>\u201cI would like to approach you, yes.\u201d Eyes narrowing, she moved away from Kane, and every ounce of her new, massive strength was required not to ghost her fingers through his hair, enjoying one last touch before S\u00e9duire forever changed. Before she changed.</p><p>At the dais, the guard backed away, allowing her to draw closer. In front of the king, she bowed her head, presenting the perfect picture of submission. \u201cMajesty,\u201d she said with a curtsy.</p><p>\u201cLower.\u201d</p><p>The command scraped against the piece of her heart that had hoped she would finally, at long last, find favor with him.</p><p>\u201cHow about this instead?\u201d Quick as a blink, she grabbed him by the throat, lifting him from his seat, startling him\u2014and crushing the pipes beneath her fingers. \u201cYou bow before me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>The Realm of Blood and Shadows</p><p>FRANTIC, TORIN PACED beside his bed. Mari had arrived a few minutes ago\u2014only to collapse. She was sick. So very sick.</p><p>And he was responsible.</p><p>He should never have touched her, should never have allowed her to shake his ungloved hand.</p><p>He was so worried for her he could barely see straight. She lay on the bed, coughing for the thousandth time. Blood gurgled from the corners of her mouth.</p><p>Fury blazed at the edges of Torin\u2019s worry, and he punched a hole in the wall, desperate for some type of release. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me I could make you sick with my touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had...to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to die?\u201d He stomped to her side. \u201cAnd you thought I\u2019d be okay with being the weapon responsible?\u201d How was he supposed to live with himself, knowing he\u2019d killed yet another innocent?</p><p>\u201cNo...worries. No plague. Only me. Never touch...anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he knew she was only ever allowed in her prison and his bedroom, but that didn\u2019t make this any better. He stalked to his door and locked it, ensuring none of his friends could burst inside for any reason. \u201cYou still should have told me,\u201d he croaked. \u201cIt should have been my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Not want...to die. Resisted. But. No other way. Cronus said...friend would be...freed.\u201d</p><p>Cronus had also said Torin wouldn\u2019t sicken the woman sent to him. Clearly Cronus had lied. \u201cThe king of the Titans is dead. Your friend won\u2019t be freed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVows last...even after death.\u201d</p><p>And Torin hadn\u2019t been smart enough to obtain a vow, had he.</p><p>She had coughed between every word. A hacking cough that had shaken her entire body. \u201cMoment I die...she has freedom.\u201d</p><p>Mari had given her life for her friend. He understood the desire. He did. But that didn\u2019t make this any easier. He returned to her side and peered down at her. Her skin was ghostly white, a blue tracery of veins apparent. There were bruises under her eyes, and her lips were split and scabbed from being chewed. The last time she\u2019d visited, she had looked healthy and whole. Now, twenty-four hours later, she was reduced to this.</p><p>Death was knocking on her door. Maybe she would answer today. Maybe tomorrow. Either way, she would answer. There would be no saving her.</p><p>No, he thought next. No. He had to try. Something. Anything. So far, he\u2019d failed to help Cameo and Viola, but he could help this woman.</p><p>In the bathroom, he wet a washrag with cold water. He raced back to the girl\u2019s side. Gloves covered his hands, so he didn\u2019t hesitate to drape the cloth over her forehead. He\u2019d never touched a human twice, and wasn\u2019t sure what would happen to Mari if his skin were to brush hers a second time. Would she get sicker faster? Probably.</p><p>At his computer, he printed the list he\u2019d recently created. The ones with medicines that might aid humans if ever his plague got out. Then, he called Lucien. \u201cFlash to the States, to a pharmacy. I need a few things.\u201d He tossed out the names.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave Anya, Tor. She needs me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put a camera on her. I\u2019ll make sure no one approaches her, I swear. Just do what I asked. Please.\u201d Torin hung up on him and stuffed the phone in his pocket. He peered down at the girl. \u201cNow you listen to me. You\u2019re going to fight this. You\u2019re not going to give up and allow yourself to die. You want your friend out, there\u2019s another way. I told you about Sienna. Well, she arrived at the fortress just this morning. Give her a chance.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed from Mari\u2019s eyes and tracked down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gave an almost imperceptible nod. But a nod was a nod.</p><p>\u201cPeople have survived this.\u201d Not many, but a few, and no one who\u2019d had direct contact with him. \u201cYou can, too.\u201d She had to. His heart couldn\u2019t take another death.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang.</p><p>\u201cLeave the stuff and go,\u201d Torin called, knowing Lucien was at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the warrior demanded.</p><p>\u201cJust...trust me,\u201d he replied as Mari coughed.</p><p>Tense silence filled the room.</p><p>\u201cReyes told me about the girl you had in there. Is she sick? Is she the one in need of the medicine?\u201d Lucien\u2019s voice was soft, quiet, and yet still managed to cut through the wood of the door.</p><p>\u201cLeave the stuff and go,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Movement at the corner of his eye. He turned\u2014and there was Lucien, dropping a bag on the floor. The warrior had flashed inside the room. His mismatched eyes scanned the area and landed on the girl.</p><p>Accusation tightened his features. \u201cYou said she was immune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. Now get out. I don\u2019t want you becoming a carrier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me about this.\u201d The accusation in Lucien\u2019s expression was like taking a knife to the back. \u201cI need to take everyone to a new location. Especially the women and children.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Of course. He should have thought of that. How foolish could Torin be?</p><p>\u201cI need Sienna\u2019s help with something. Freeing another girl. She\u2019s in a prison Cronus owned. Tell her to start looking for it. Please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Lucien asked. \u201cWhat about this girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about us.\u201d</p><p>Lucien pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this.

As he waited for any sign of recovery, an idea struck him. He didn\u2019t allow himself to consider the many ramifications or the danger to himself. He raced to his closet and grabbed a nylon bag. He stuffed it full of weapons and any other equipment he thought he might need. He covered his hair and forehead with a bandanna, pulled a ski mask over his face to ensure the rest of him was covered, as well. He added the medicine to the bag, wrote a note to his friends, and then did something he\u2019d hoped to circumvent forever.</p><p>He looked at Danika\u2019s painting, expecting to see this moment, this tragedy\u2014or, maybe, the outcome.</p> <p>In it, Torin reclined on a black leather couch. He had a glass in one hand, and a cigar in the other\u2014neither hand was gloved. He was grinning, an expression he hadn\u2019t donned in a very long time, he didn\u2019t think. There were people around him. So many people. Shock had him stumbling backward. Danika had never before shown him a happy ending.</p><p>Happy.</p><p>He could be happy.</p><p>The girl coughed, drawing his attention back to her. Hope spread wings and flew through him. Maybe she would survive.</p><p>He crouched beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhen you flash back to the prison, I want you to hold on to me and will me to go with you. Okay? Can you do that? I\u2019m covered. Your skin won\u2019t ever be in contact with mine, and your condition won\u2019t worsen.\u201d Please don\u2019t worsen.</p> <p>She licked her dry, cracked lips, but left no moisture behind. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone in that cell. I know you have to go back, and there\u2019s no way I can stop you, so I\u2019ll just have to go with you. I\u2019ll be there to doctor you, and maybe you\u2019ll get better.\u201d You have to get better.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t...be able...to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Sienna will find us and I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d</p><p>Between coughs, she replied, \u201cCan...try.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out beside her and pressed his mask-covered face against her chest. Her heart was beating too hard and too fast. Heat radiated through the material barriers between them. He draped his arm over her middle and twined his legs through hers.</p><p>The position was new to him. One he\u2019d never before experienced. One he was ashamed to admit he liked, despite the circumstances. He\u2019d never been so close to a female. Meanwhile, she was dying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he cooed. \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere we...go.\u201d</p><p>A second later, the world around him vanished and a new one took shape.</p><p>It had worked.</p><p>He saw a small cell with crumbling rock walls. There was no window, and barely any light. The only door was made of metal bars. There was no bed, no blankets. The air was cold and damp.</p><p>A soft, pained moan left her.</p><p>They were on the frigid, hard ground, and it had to be painful to her aching bones. Torin hopped to his feet and tugged the clothes from his bag to create a barrier, a makeshift mattress. Then he picked her up and eased her down.</p><p>\u201cMari?\u201d a pretty voice called from across the way. \u201cIs that you? Are you back?\u201d</p><p>In response, Mari coughed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the girl asked, concerned. \u201cAnd who\u2019s in there with you? The shadow I see is too large to be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Torin,\u201d he called. \u201cMari is sick, and I\u2019m here to help her.\u201d</p><p>The girl released a string of curses. \u201cYou touched her. You touched her, and now she\u2019s going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t let her.\u201d</p><p>Bars rattled. \u201cYou better hope she doesn\u2019t. She does, and I\u2019ll find a way out of here. I\u2019ll destroy you and everyone you love.\u201d</p><p>CAMEO\u2019S PATIENCE RAN out as she shoved past another tangle of thorn bushes. Her skin was sliced in too many places to count, her feet were throbbing, and she was pretty sure there were bugs in her hair.</p><p>She\u2019d been so close to Pandora\u2019s box, was now so far away.</p><p>\u201cI want out of this dimension, like, yesterday,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for the doorway into the next.\u201d Lazarus paused to move a branch out of her way. \u201cImpatient much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl I know could be trapped in another dimension, too, and I want to find her. So yes, I\u2019m impatient.\u201d She stomped past him. He released the branch and laughed when the thorns slapped her. Whirling around, she pointed a finger in his face. \u201cI\u2019m going to hang your balls in my trophy case if you do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Hold on to your anger. Your voice is unbearable when you\u2019re complaining.\u201d He stepped around her and resumed his journey.</p><p>\u201cI never complain,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019m a warrior. I\u2019m strong. Tough. Unbeatable.\u201d She\u2019d fought in wars, saved her friends. Battled her way out of enemy territory. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s impolite to point out my only flaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly?\u201d Lazarus pushed another limb out of his way\u2014only to let this one swing back and slap her in the face. \u201cOops. My bad.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her teeth at his back.</p><p>\u201cI saw that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I remove your balls, I\u2019ll strap you to a slab of concrete and force you to listen while I sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that actually scares me.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou amuse me, female.\u201d</p><p>She amused him? \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut true nonetheless. Unlike the woman who tried to enslave me\u2014a name you will not speak again or you will finally see my dark side\u2014you aren\u2019t the type to hurt an innocent man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I harmed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she grudgingly admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen with you, I\u2019m innocent.\u201d He flicked her a glance, lingered. \u201cYou are so tiny, and so sad, and yet you consider yourself fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fierce!\u201d And if she hadn\u2019t needed him so much, she would have shown him.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d he said, and if he\u2019d been facing her, she was certain he would have been patting her on top of the head.</p><p>Her gaze drilled into his back. His wide, muscular back. Because of the heat, he\u2019d removed his shirt. Sweat ran down in rivulets. His skin was gorgeously bronzed, inked with the most vibrant tattoos, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDo you ever laugh?\u201d he asked, tugging her from her inspection before her knees could start knocking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Joy isn\u2019t something that sticks.\u201d</p><p>A loud roar reverberated behind her.</p><p>Lazarus stopped and twisted, a strange amber light shining in his eyes. She bumped into him, and his arms wrapped around her, holding her steady. He was strong. Amazingly strong. And I shouldn\u2019t find that attractive, she thought. I should be immune. I\u2019ve spent centuries with men just like him.</p><p>\u201cBe still and quiet,\u201d he whispered, his gaze searching the trees.</p><p>Well, maybe not just like him. Her friends would have asked nicely.</p><p>Her ears twitched as she, too, listened. In the distance, she could hear the swish of tree limbs shaking through the air, the clap of leaves banging together.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d Lazarus said, and broke into top speed, dragging her along with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>A hideous creature broke through the line of trees behind them. The...whatever it was had the body of a wild hog and the face of a dragon. Gnarled wings stretched from its back, and long saber teeth extended from between its lips.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen anything like it. \u201cIt\u2019s closing in.\u201d And she was the closest target, so she would be the first meal.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d Lazarus picked up speed. \u201cI\u2019ve found the doorway.\u201d</p><p>After another few steps, he leaped through the air, dragging Cameo with him. They flew toward a wall of leaves. She expected to feel the brush of limbs against her skin, but there was only a rush of cold air. Then, the forest vanished, and a new scene took shape around her.</p><p>Cameo crashed into a cold metal ground. When she caught her breath and stood, she looked around\u2014and kind of wished they\u2019d remained in the forest and faced the beast.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>S\u00e9duire</p><p>AS LEOPOLD BACKED away, and Synda cheered, and the queen slid to the floor to crab-walk away from her, Josephina tossed her wheezing father over her shoulder. He was a big man, and yet, he felt as light as a feather. He skidded across the floor, slamming into Fae after Fae before hitting the back wall. He was the bowling ball; they were the pins.</p><p>Rage and fear darkened his eyes as he jumped to his feet. \u201cYou...you...\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cYes. Me.\u201d</p><p>Kane rushed through the room, shutting every door, rigging every lock, sealing everyone inside. He looked to Josephina, smiled proudly, then nodded to the area just behind her. \u201cIncoming.\u201d</p><p>She turned and saw a contingent of guards racing toward her. Adrenaline surged inside her, fizzing in her veins, amping her up. The moment the males reached her, she erupted into a flurry of movement, breaking noses with the heel of her hand, snapping arms in two, kneeing men in the groin, punching, punching, punching just as she\u2019d been taught. Impact should have stung, but she felt no pain.</p><p>No one could latch onto her. Her limbs and body simply moved too swiftly.</p><p>Moaning and groaning, the men dropped around her, and when there was no one left to challenge her, she maneuvered over the mound of bodies, triumphant, intending to face her father once and for all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While the queen and Leopold banged at the doors, trying to beat their way out of the room, and Synda cowered behind a throne, Tiberius watched her, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t win this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAgree to disagree.\u201d A violent wind shot from her, arching her back, lifting her off her feet, shoving the rest of the bodies out of her way and into the walls, clearing her path before setting her down.</p> <p>Gasps sounded from the Opulens. Kane was keeping them in the back of the room, but the ground was cracking under his feet, and little flames were being sucked from the wall torches and into his hair. He had to pat the fires out while keeping his attention on the crowd.</p><p>Must hurry, she thought. Eyes on her target: her father. Feet: moving forward.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing this?\u201d Tiberius demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one able to use your gifts to your advantage.\u201d</p><p>She threw a punch. The king ducked and her hand went through the door behind him. Wood shards rained. She jerked with all her might and took a chunk of wood with her, leaving a hole. But just before she gained her freedom, Tiberius kicked her in the stomach. She propelled backward, skidding across the floor.</p> <p>Kane\u2019s bellow of fury bounced off the walls.</p><p>She held out her injured hand, a silent command for him to stay back. She had this.</p><p>The king cracked his knuckles and grinned. Josephina stood, and returned his grin, her amusement wiping his away.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go easy on you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou never have.\u201d She raced forward, her feet carrying her across the room in less than a blink, the objects at her side blurring.</p><p>Grin widening, the king held out his hands as she threw another punch.</p> <p>Thud.</p><p>Her bones vibrated from the force of collision, but she never made contact with him. The king had used one of his abilities, erecting an invisible shield, protecting himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unbeatable,\u201d he said, smug.</p><p>No! She hadn\u2019t come this far to fail. There had to be a way to reach him.</p><p>Anger rising, she beat her fists against the barrier. It was solid. The king laughed. The anger inside her rose...and rose...burning through her veins, singeing muscle and bone. Sweat began to pour out of her, the heat unbearable. Surely she was melting.</p><p>\u201cPoor Josephina.\u201d Tiberius tsked. \u201cYou\u2019ve already lost, you\u2019re just unaware.\u201d</p><p>Strong arms banded around her, surprising her. The dank, musty scents of the dungeon enveloped her, and she knew the culprit was Leopold.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do this,\u201d he growled into her ear.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d She banged the back of her head into his nose. Yelping, he released her. She turned and punched him in the chest with so much force he flew back and slammed into the throne, where Synda was hiding.</p><p>The sound of cracking bone echoed. Leopold slumped to the floor, his eyes closed, his body limp. There was a ring in the center of his shirt, the material singed at the edges. He\u2019d been...burned?</p><p>Josephina whipped back to the king\u2014only to take a blow to the jaw. Sharp pain exploded through her head. The new abilities and strength must be fading, dang it. She hit the floor, her brain banging against her skull. Tiberius struck again, kicking her in the stomach.</p><p>Bye bye, oxygen. Even as she wheezed, she straightened, not wanting to give him another chance to launch a sneak attack.</p><p>\u201cReady to give up?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to bypass my defenses. No one will.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to wipe the warm trickle of blood from her face and realized one of the king\u2019s rings had left a jagged gash on her cheek.</p><p>She looked for Kane, and found him fending off the rest of the guards. Soldier after soldier attempted to evade him to get to her, determined to protect the king, but Kane remained in a constant state of motion, stopping them. Finally, the soldiers accepted they\u2019d have to take him out. Evasion became a full-fledged attack, daggers and swords swiping.</p><p>Hurry, hurry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than a no one.\u201d Ears ringing, she moved slowly, purposefully, and flattened her hands against the invisible barrier.</p><p>He kicked her, his leg penetrating the shield no problem, and she stumbled back\u2014but still she came back for more. \u201cGive up, Josephina. You can\u2019t win. I\u2019ve fought opponents far stronger than you. Far faster. Far smarter. And you...you\u2019re weak. Disposable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019m worth something.\u201d Fury stopped rising and simply exploded. She hit the shield, and flames shot from her, dancing together, growing stronger, hotter, until the air began to sizzle, creating a hole in the barrier big enough for her fist.</p><p>Tiberius paled. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Josephina punched through the opening once, twice, three times, moving so swiftly he couldn\u2019t dodge, breaking his nose, knocking out two of his teeth, dislocating his jaw. Blood sprayed against what remained of the shield, blending with the flames.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for my mother,\u201d she said, hitting him again. \u201cThat\u2019s for Kane. That\u2019s for me. That\u2019s for having a black heart. That\u2019s for...my mother again.\u201d</p><p>His knees buckled. By the time he hit the ground, he was out.</p><p>Panting, she peered down at him. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d defeated him.</p><p>She should have felt more triumphant, but the sadness she\u2019d denied had found new life, filling her, spilling out. But that wasn\u2019t going to stop her. She grabbed the king by the hair and dragged him to Leopold. Then, she searched the room for the queen...there! She was still prying at the seam in the doors, desperate to escape.</p><p>Josephina simply stepped up behind her, joined her fists, and struck. The woman fell to her side and stayed down.</p><p>William appeared just in front of the unconscious body. Red, Green, Black and White appeared just behind him, completely healed.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we arrived just in time, gang,\u201d William said with a grin.</p><p>The group rushed into the thick of battle, unsheathing swords along the way.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Josephina cried out.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t attack Kane; they attacked the people around him.</p><p>The black mist that usually accompanied the Rainbow Rejects remained at bay. Maybe it wasn\u2019t needed. The boys never mutated into their other forms, and with only a few minutes of hacking at the opposition, William and his children had the rest of the crowd backing away in fear.</p><p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d need us,\u201d William said with a pat on Kane\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>A winded, blood-splattered Kane snapped his teeth. \u201cI had the army right where I wanted it and was about to make my final move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. You were at the cliff, about to be kicked over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Kane stalked to Josephina\u2019s side. Gently he cupped her jaw and tilted her head to the left, allowing light to fall over her wound. \u201cThat\u2019s going to scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Unlike full-blooded immortals, she wore her injuries forever. \u201cI\u2019ll still be beautiful to you.\u201d After everything this man had done for her, she wasn\u2019t ever going to doubt his attraction to her.</p><p>\u201cMore than beautiful. Exquisite.\u201d He kissed her, soft and sweet. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Black hoisted the queen over his shoulder, then wrapped an arm under Synda\u2019s stomach and hung her at his side. \u201cI\u2019ll take these two.\u201d His gaze moved to William and narrowed. \u201cI deserve some sort of reward for vowing never to touch Kane or his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat vow saved you from my deathblow. That was reward enough. Now, you\u2019ll put the females in the dungeon, or else,\u201d William commanded.</p><p>Kane grinned. To Josephina, he said, \u201cI have a need to help take out the trash. There are a few words I\u2019d like to say to your father. You\u2019re good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Kane kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He flung the prince over his shoulder, then grabbed the king by the hair. He motioned to Black with a nod of his chin. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Black didn\u2019t bother trying to open a door but crashed through, using the queen as a battering ram.</p><p>Licking her lips, Josephina faced the crowd. Every eye was glued to her, wide, expectant and angry.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she called. \u201cYou saw my strength, my skill. You saw the strength and skill of my friends.\u201d As she spoke, she could feel the rest of the energy leaving her, and within a few seconds, a strange heaviness was settling over her limbs. To mask the oncoming weakness, she eased onto the king\u2019s throne and continued her speech. \u201cThere\u2019s more where that came from if\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shadow dropped from the ceiling, snagging her attention as it landed on White\u2019s shoulders. The girl had no time to react. One second she stood proud, the next her head was on the floor\u2014without her body.</p><p>Josephina screamed.</p><p>As the girl\u2019s body flopped to the floor lifelessly, blood pouring from her severed neck, the person responsible landed on her feet and straightened.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you\u2019d regret what you did to me,\u201d the Phoenix said with a grin.</p><p>Red realized what had happened to his sister and fell to his knees.</p><p>Green released an agonized \u201cNooo!\u201d The first word he\u2019d ever spoken in Josephina\u2019s presence.</p><p>A pallid William clutched his heart.</p><p>Shock slammed through Josephina. The horrific nature of what had just happened\u2014</p><p>Wasn\u2019t even the worst part.</p><p>As she reeled, White\u2019s entire body changed. Her skin darkened, blackened...cracked, leaving thousands of tiny round pieces. Those pieces sprouted legs and broke away from each other. Bugs, she thought with a wave of revulsion. The creepy crawlers sped into action, sweeping through the room, covering the floor, the walls, chasing the Fae and trying to burrow under their skin.</p><p>Shrieks and panicked footfalls erupted. Fists banged at the closed doors. People were stampeded as others struggled to push their way out of the only opening. Someone must have found a key to another realm, because a new doorway was created at the back of the room. A few of the Fae managed to race through it\u2014but so did some of the bugs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bugs. Oh, sweet mercy.</p><p>Where were they headed?</p><p>Amid the chaos, the Phoenix circled Josephina. \u201cYou have only yourself to blame for this. Well, yourself and your man. He crossed the Moirai. They said he changed their fate, and so, they changed his. They were only too happy to use me to punish him\u2014and what better way to punish him than to destroy his darling wife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave Kane out of this. It\u2019s between you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Moirai dropped me in your life at the perfect time. You\u2019re finally without your protector\u2014and I\u2019m without patience. This battle has been too long coming.\u201d</p><p>The Phoenix launched at her.</p><p>Josephina spun out of the way, and the girl soared past her, dang it. Instincts, she thought\u2014she needed to override them. She needed contact, even if it hurt.</p><p>The Phoenix quickly gained her footing and turned, swiping out a hand covered with metal claws. Josephina twisted to the side, taking the nails in her forearm, even while sucking a little of the girl\u2019s strength. The Phoenix didn\u2019t seem to notice\u2014yet. As warm blood trickled down Josephina\u2019s arm, the girl came at her again, and this time, her thigh took the brunt of the abuse. This injury proved worse, but she was able to suck in even more strength.</p> <p>A fist into her heart. Hissing, Josephina wrapped her fingers around the girl\u2019s wrists at the moment of contact. She was swept forward as the girl drew back for another strike, but managed to hold on, taking more and more energy.</p><p>Strengthening.</p><p>The Phoenix weakening.</p><p>Realizing what she was doing, the girl jerked away, out of reach. \u201cYou dare try to thieve from me again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry?\u201d She forced a laugh.</p><p>Growling, the Phoenix dove at her. Her arms crisscrossed as she attempted to slice Josephina into pieces, without allowing any prolonged contact. Josephina dodged, moving faster than she had a few minutes ago.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been practicing. So, how about we take this up a notch?\u201d Grinning now, the Phoenix walked a wide circle around her, flames shooting from her fingertips and onto the ground. Those flames grew, reaching toward the ceiling. Smoke billowed, making Josephina cough.</p><p>Beyond the circle, she could hear Red cursing. What William and Green were doing, she wasn\u2019t sure. The panicked murmurs and frantic footfalls of the Opulens had faded, but anyone remaining was still in danger. They were her people now, she thought. She\u2019d left them without a leader, and they needed her. They were hers to protect.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d she said with a nod. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this.\u201d</p><p>Ding, ding.</p><p>Josephina threw herself into round two, managing to land just as many blows as she took. When the Phoenix tripped over one of the cracks Kane had left behind, Josephina raced forward, dropped to her knees and skidded across the floor, stopping at the girl\u2019s feet. She grabbed her ankle and jerked her legs out from under her. As soon as the girl hit, she reached out to squeeze her arm, absorbing several more streams of energy.</p><p>The Phoenix pushed her away, and jumped to her feet\u2014only to stumble with weakness.</p><p>\u201cKill you,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Knowing she had to act now, even at the expense of her own life, Josephina barreled into her. They fell and smacked into the floor, the Phoenix taking the brunt of the impact\u2014but not all of it. Though dizziness swamped her, she crawled up the girl\u2019s body, straddled her waist and gripped her by the neck. Another stream of energy entered Josephina. Another and another. The Phoenix tried to bat her away, failed.</p> <p>\u201cTink!\u201d she heard Kane shout, just before he ran through the flames.</p><p>As he crouched beside her, blisters popped up on his face, arms and hands. The ends of his hair smoked. He didn\u2019t waste time asking questions, but slammed his fist into the girl\u2019s temple, knocking her out.</p><p>Buzzing with energy and heat, so much heat, Josephina scooted away.</p><p>He picked the girl up and tossed her out of the fiery circle, calling, \u201cShe\u2019s all yours, William.\u201d</p><p>Even though she was overcome by a deluge of emotions\u2014grief, relief, sadness, joy, fear, heartache\u2014Josephina pushed to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve got to put out the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s calling to me,\u201d she interjected, and it was. She felt...connected to it, its warmth her warmth. \u201cIt wants to be with me.\u201d She reached out and the flames instantly leaned in her direction. The moment the tips brushed against her skin, her pores opened up, as if she was drawing power from another person, and the flames were sucked into her body.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re okay,\u201d Kane said, gathering her in his arms. He hissed, as if she was burning him, but didn\u2019t release her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...uninjured. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d</p><p>She scanned the throne room. Bodies littered the floor. Most were dead, some were writhing in pain. William, Red, Green and Black were gone\u2014and so was the Phoenix.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kane croaked. \u201cI came in, and William and Red were nutcases, muttering about defeat and death and destruction. As I jumped through the flames, William demanded I give him the Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes, and she explained as best she could about White. Kane paled, released her and fell back on his haunches.</p><p>\u201cI did it. My actions, my decisions, killed her. Unleashed her destruction. In this realm. In another realm. An apocalypse has come. And it\u2019s my fault,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, the Moirai are at fault. They sent the Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me. Because I failed to heed their prediction. Because I attacked them in their home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane, no. The only reason the Phoenix came here in the first place was to get back at me. If you want to blame someone besides the Moirai, blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a shake of his head. \u201cNever you. Petra\u2019s hatred first brought her here. Her stubbornness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you see. You\u2019re not to blame.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not, either.\u201d</p><p>She patted his knee. \u201cOkay, then. We\u2019re agreed. The Moirai and Petra will carry this shame.\u201d</p><p>A pained look passed over his face, and she knew he wanted to agree with her, but was struggling with his acceptance. And she understood. The Moirai\u2019s predictions had haunted him for so long, he\u2019d just expected to carry the guilt.</p><p>\u201cSomething will have to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat will have to be contained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to know the Lords of the Underworld are up for the challenge.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d If anyone could fight this new threat, it was the Lords\u2014and one day, it would be contained.</p><p>Kane placed a swift kiss on her lips, and the pain was still there, deep in his eyes, but now, there was also a measure of resolve. \u201cI think you just manipulated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she said innocently. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t ever change.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>JOSEPHINA AND KANE spent the rest of the night seeing to the defenses of the palace. The bugs had spread throughout the land, and the people were in revolt, fighting each other over the silliest things even while they attempted to storm the outer wall to get to Josephina.</p><p>When the two of them finished, when they finally got everyone calm and the wounded tended, she was so exhausted she could barely hold up her head. So much blood...so much violence...</p><p>Kane swept her into his arms and carried her to his old bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what your father said to you. He was wrong, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never saw your worth, and that\u2019s his disgrace, not yours.\u201d</p><p>Similar to the words she\u2019d given him earlier. Smart man, using her methods against her, stopping her argument in its tracks.</p><p>He kissed her temple. \u201cYou need a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I need to clean up your wounds and I don\u2019t want you aware of the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you would still feel the pain. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to avoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d He set her on her feet and pinched the artery running up her neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d Glaring, she collapsed on a cushioned settee.</p><p>His determined face was the last thing she saw.</p><p>When she came to however long later, he was still with her. He had a phone pressed to his ear. \u201cNow you know as much as I do. And I\u2019m sorry, man. I\u2019m sorry this happened.\u201d A pause. \u201cI\u2019d still really like you to come. The circumstances are the same in both realms, so the women won\u2019t be in any more danger here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>He spun to face her. \u201cFor me,\u201d he said, and disconnected the call. Those hazel eyes filled with guilt. \u201cI was just talking to Lucien. William and his children are unreachable. The bugs reached the human realm. No one knows exactly what harm they\u2019ll cause.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he walked toward her and discarded his shirt. \u201cThe doors are locked. The soldiers I\u2019m willing to trust are doing patrol.\u201d He reached down to unbutton her shirt. \u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A little mad would never mask the intensity of her desire for him.</p><p>Pupils expanding, he eased on top of her. Warm skin and against warm skin, driving her wild.</p><p>\u201cKane, I have a confession to make. I think I...love you,\u201d she said, tangling her hands in his hair. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, a look of utter bliss consuming his beautiful features. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to express the pleasure the thought of your love gives me, but sweetheart, I want you sure. It\u2019s wrong of me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong of you how? We\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>A dark look shuttered over his features. Silent now, he bent his head and kissed the pulse hammering at the base of her neck, a strategic move meant to distract her from her question, but she...wouldn\u2019t...oh! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His tongue stroked over her collarbone, before delving lower and playing at her breasts. All the while, his hands expertly shucked the rest of her clothing, leaving her completely bare. And then, his hands were free to dabble elsewhere...everywhere.</p><p>Every silken touch and wanton caress, soft here, harder there, reminded her of his inexorable power over her. He could take her to heights she\u2019d never dreamed possible.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t show you any mercy,\u201d he vowed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Only you.\u201d</p><p>He was in the process of kissing her inner thigh. At her words, he looked up at her. Heat filled his eyes. \u201cYou have me.\u201d He swooped back up, meshing his mouth into hers, his tongue sweeping inside, claiming, dominating. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>After that, he lost his leisurely pace. He lost his gentleness, too.</p> <p>He fumbled with the waist of his pants; the very second the material gaped open, he was inside her, her back arching as pleasure speared her.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he commanded as he moved, lines of tension branching from his eyes.</p><p>She knew what he wanted. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>Her words were like fuel to an already raging fire. He became a man possessed by need, only need, rough and wonderful, driving her higher and higher, until all she could do was scream her pleasure.</p><p>He roared with his.</p><p>But even after he\u2019d collapsed on top of her, he still wasn\u2019t done with her. He rose up on his elbows and peered down at her. Need still blazed in his eyes. Panting, she watched as sweat trickled from his temples.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said, and stoked her desire all over again.</p><p>\u201cI FOUND YOU a dress,\u201d Kane said a long while later. He tugged on his pants. \u201cWill you wear it for me?\u201d</p><p>Josephina watched him, her sated body still humming with pleasure. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Meet me in the throne room in an hour.\u201d He blew her a kiss before leaving her alone.</p> <p>Only then did she realize he\u2019d never offered his own declaration of love. He loved her, though. She knew he did.</p><p>But she wanted his admission. I\u2019ll have to step up my game.</p><p>Draped over the corner chair, she found a beautiful ball gown made of the most delicate blue fabric. Not even Synda had ever worn anything so fine. Josephina showered and brushed her teeth, then trembled as she dressed. She took special care with her hair, pinning the sides at the crown of her head.</p><p>The only flaw to her appearance was the gash in her cheek. Kane had knocked her out and sewn it up himself, and though he\u2019d placed a flesh-colored bandage over it, it was noticeable.</p><p>Down the stairs she went, no guards or servants in sight. Only the leaders had been imprisoned in the dungeon with the royal family. The rest of the army and staff had sworn allegiance to Josephina last night.</p><p>She reached the throne room and found Kane waiting for her just outside the doors. He\u2019d changed his clothes, and now wore a clean, pressed white shirt and black slacks. His hair was brushed, the wounds he\u2019d received during battle already healing.</p><p>He smiled when he spotted her. A real smile, full of light and heat. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. But why\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pushed open the doors. \u201cYour coronation. And wedding. It\u2019s two-for-one day at Chez Fae.\u201d</p><p>The remaining members of the high and low court had been gathered together and bound at the wrists and ankles. Though many looked as if they wanted to shout at her, all remained silent. Had they been threatened by Kane?</p><p>Her gaze skidded back to him. \u201cWait. Did you say wedding? Because we\u2019re already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a ceremony you remember or even liked. So, I\u2019m giving you another.\u201d He offered her the hook of his elbow. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>This man had to love her. Trembling, she accepted, and he led her forward.</p><p>That\u2019s when she saw...oh, my, but I married a darling man. There was Maddox, with the beautiful Ashlyn. The babies were...nowhere that she could see. There was Lucien, with the vivacious Anya. Reyes, with the talented Danika. The young Gilly was at Danika\u2019s side. Sabin, with the pint-size Gwen. Aeron, with the angelic Olivia and bombshell Legion. There was Gideon, with the fierce Scarlet. Amun, with the glowing Haidee. Strider, with the fiery Kaia. Paris, though he was minus the powerful Sienna.</p><p>Each warrior nodded at her encouragingly. Each female smiled at her. Joy broke through a dam erected in her childhood, flooding her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the Opulens,\u201d Kane said. \u201cTheir knowledge of my past is actually quite handy. They fear what will happen if I\u2019m upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll grow to adore you. They won\u2019t be able to help themselves.\u201d</p><p>Kane stopped in front of the king\u2019s throne and faced Josephina. He cupped her cheeks. He wasted no time, saying, \u201cI, Kane, promise to take care of you for as long as I live. I promise to put your needs above my own, and compliment you every chance I get. I promise to make you smile at least once a day. And I promise to be yours. Only ever yours.\u201d</p><p>This is really happening. Light-headed, she managed to squeak out, \u201cI, Josephina\u2014Tink\u2014Aisling, promise to take care of you. I promise to weather any storms the demon causes, to always value your strength. Anytime I decide to go to war, you\u2019ll be the first person I call.\u201d She stuck her tongue out at his friends, and each of the warriors grinned. \u201cNow and forever, I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>Kane leaned down and kissed her, and it wasn\u2019t the sweet kiss she\u2019d been expecting. He gave her tongue and heat and passion, taking and giving, pouring desire into her, drinking desire from her.</p><p>The world faded away\u2014until the loud cheers of his friends jolted her back to awareness. Kane lifted his head, and grinned down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still sure about how you feel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He peered into her eyes. \u201cGood. Because you\u2019re it for me, Tinker Bell, Tink, Tinky Dink. My one. My only. My everything. My mine.\u201d He rubbed the tip of his nose against hers. \u201cAnd guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Any more goodness, and she would burst.</p><p>\u201cThe magnitude of what I feel for you has drained the fight right out of the demon. He\u2019s gone quiet.\u201d</p><p>Her heart soared at the thought\u2014Kane was finally free. They both were. \u201cOh, Kane. That\u2019s so wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said, though he smiled sadly. He stepped to the side before she could question him.</p><p>Someone moved in behind her and settled something heavy on her head. She almost looked up. Almost. But realization struck and she managed to remain perfectly still. The royal crown was now upon her head, a symbol of power and position. And now, now she was to be ruler of these people, the driving force of an entire race.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t strong enough on her own. She wasn\u2019t wise enough. What if she made the wrong decision? Lives could be lost. Sickness churned in her stomach, and she fought the urge to run away. She hadn\u2019t been made for this kind of responsibility. Wasn\u2019t sure she could carry it...</p><p>\u201cYour queen,\u201d Kane announced.</p><p>But she had to do it, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>KANE TOOK A moment to look past the negative he\u2019d caused and focus on the positive. He\u2019d fallen in love. He\u2019d married the finest woman in creation. He\u2019d helped her claim her rightful place.</p><p>He\u2019d finally defeated Disaster. Soon, the demon would die.</p><p>And soon after that, Kane would follow.</p><p>Danika had finally gotten something wrong. Her painting wasn\u2019t going to be an issue. White\u2014if White had been the blonde, and he thought now that she had been\u2014was dead.</p><p>That meant the Moirai had been wrong, too, just as Tink had predicted. White wasn\u2019t going to end up with the man who would start the apocalypse. She wasn\u2019t going to end up with anyone at all.</p><p>All of their choices had changed the course of their lives.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to think about any of that right now. Nothing mattered but Tink. Twice he\u2019d taken her without a condom. She could be pregnant, even now.</p><p>Longing made him ache\u2014the best kind of ache. He wanted to have children with her. He wanted to be around to raise them.</p><p>Another impossible dream.</p><p>He had to make sure she was prepared for anything. Everything.</p><p>The Opulens had been ushered outside the palace, promised death if they so much as thought to form another revolt. Tink sat on the center throne, her faux smile still frozen in place. He saw the terror in her eyes, and knew the weight of her new responsibilities was only beginning to become clear. She would triumph, however; he had no doubts. She was finally beginning to realize her worth.</p><p>Anya and the other women raced up to speak with her. His friends approached him, and formed a circle around him.</p><p>\u201cMy queen is better than your queen,\u201d Paris said, punching him in the arm good-naturedly.</p><p>Kane rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no queen better than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I do.\u201d Kane liked and respected Sienna\u2014she\u2019d done good things for the Titans since taking the throne, and she was helping Torin out of a bind as they spoke\u2014but she was no Tink.</p><p>\u201cLoser has to wear a dress to Anya\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll most likely be dead. Still he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d</p><p>Maddox nudged him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The group went quiet.</p><p>Kane nodded. \u201cI\u2019m staying. Tink\u2019s needed here, and I\u2019m going to help her settle in.\u201d It would be his last work on this earth.</p><p>He hated that he would be leaving her to deal with the war he\u2019d helped ignite. He hated that he would be leaving his friends all over again. He told himself they would all be better off without him\u2014but that didn\u2019t make the goodbyes any easier.</p><p>Reyes pushed out a heavy breath. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re helping her. Family comes first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane nodded in agreement. \u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, understanding is what the bro code is for,\u201d Strider said. \u201cJust keep a room ready for me. I\u2019ll be visiting. Count on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all might,\u201d Sabin said. \u201cWe\u2019re about to be homeless.\u201d</p> <p>He gave each warrior a hug, and wished Cameo and Torin were here. Even Viola.</p><p>The females would be found, alive and well. These men would make sure of it. And whatever was going on with Torin would be resolved. Kane wouldn\u2019t believe otherwise.</p><p>He glanced over at Tink, his gaze always drawn to her. He spotted Malcolm, the green-haired Sent One standing behind her, his arms crossed over his middle as he listened to her conversation with the other females. None of the women seemed to notice him.</p><p>Apparently, he\u2019d wanted Tink to see him in the hotel room, but Kane to see him now. What was his game?</p><p>Anger sprouted from roots that had yet to wither. \u201cYou,\u201d Kane shouted. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, hanging around here?\u201d</p> <p>Malcolm met his glare, and vanished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask who you were talking to,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go. Ashlyn and I must return to our babies. They are with the Sent One Lysander, and he had better be doing a good job or he will find himself without a head.\u201d</p><p>Lysander, one of the seven leaders of the seven armies of Sent Ones. Married to Bianka, Kaia\u2019s twin sister. Perhaps Zacharel, Lysander\u2019s friend, had sent Malcolm, Zacharel\u2019s soldier, to guard Tink?</p><p>Perhaps I should have been nicer.</p><p>Kane slapped Maddox on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf ever you need anything,\u201d Sabin said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re only a phone call away,\u201d Strider finished.</p><p>\u201cWhen we find Pandora\u2019s box, we\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Reyes said.</p><p>Kane had spent centuries of his life searching for that box. To know he wouldn\u2019t be alive when it was finally found and destroyed was a terrible blow. But whatever. He\u2019d rather take out Disaster now, while the creature was too weak to fight back.</p><p>The men gathered their women, and Lucien flashed them away two at a time.</p><p>Kane strode over to Tink. \u201cWell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re officially the most powerful person in this realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be you, the new king.\u201d</p> <p>King? Him? He was her man, and that was enough. \u201cThe kingdom is yours. The people are yours. You\u2019ll always be the final authority.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, the terror returned to her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cTell me those words didn\u2019t just spring from the girl who put the former king and queen in their place\u2014the dungeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I did it with help,\u201d she said. \u201cYours, the girls who fed me their strengths, William\u2019s. The Rainbow Rejects.\u201d Her chin trembled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it on my own.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her she would never be on her own. Yeah. He wanted to. \u201cYou can do this, Tink. I have faith in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have faith in myself\u2014sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll increase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you believe in me. And you love me,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you do, whether you\u2019ve said the actual words or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Tinker Bell, own me. There\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for you. No line I wouldn\u2019t cross. I love you so much I can barely see straight. I\u2019m obsessed with you, addicted to you. I respect you, and I revere you, and a thousand other words I\u2019m not eloquent enough to express.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cWell, you did a great job just now. I think that\u2019s the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen everyone else is foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kane...I shouldn\u2019t let you give up your home to stay with me. I should force you to leave. I\u2019m finally in control of my own destiny, and you should be in control of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in control.\u201d He planted his palms on the arms of the throne, and leaned into her face. \u201cMy place is with you. I choose you. I\u2019ll always choose you. But go ahead. Try to force me to leave. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him with luminous eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said. You\u2019ve got me, all the days of my life.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p><p>KANE STOOD BESIDE Tink\u2019s throne, and watched as she resolved disputes between the Opulens and poor alike. She had settled into her new role quite nicely, having taken charge of the palace staff and tasked the high and low court with the reconstruction of the garden. There had been several riots, and one male had even snuck into the palace and tried to assassinate the new queen.</p><p>Kane and the guard now under his command had quelled the riots, and killed the male. He had not died easily\u2014because Kane hadn\u2019t let him.</p><p>Word of Tink\u2019s feats the day she\u2019d fought her father had spread, gaining her more and more notoriety and support. These people had grown up on the exploits of Lords versus Hunters. They prized cunning, and she\u2019d displayed ample.</p><p>Now, only a few weeks into the new regime, the people were beginning to prize Tink.</p><p>\u201cNext,\u201d the guard manning the line shouted.</p><p>Two Opulens stepped to the bottom step of the dais.</p><p>Tink shifted uncomfortably in the throne. How beautiful she looked. She wore a new gown of pink silk, with pearls falling over her shoulders, and velvet rose vines hanging from her waist.</p><p>The same roses were woven through her dark hair, making her look as if she\u2019d just stepped from a magical forest. Even her makeup added to the illusion. Bold, glittery eye shadow formed catlike points at her temples. Her cheeks were bright with color, and her lips bloodred.</p><p>\u201cTell me your problem,\u201d she said to the pair.</p><p>The woman on the left raised her chin. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t do it. It\u2019s bad enough I was dragged here, but you\u2019re nothing more than a servant. I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re married to a Lord. There\u2019s no reason I should have to abide by your judgments.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time words like those had been spoken to her, but suddenly Kane was determined that it would be the last. He marched forward, only to stop when Tink held up her hand. She stood, a study of elegance, and glided down the marble steps until she stood in front of the fuming female.</p><p>He doubted anyone could see the slight tremor in her limbs, but he could. He knew her\u2014every luscious inch of her\u2014and watched her more intensely than most. She was nervous, but angry. Sad, but determined.</p><p>The guards stealthily closed in. They\u2019d been warned. If anything happened to Tink while they were near, they would die. Painfully. No questions would be asked. No excuses would be heard. And yet, Kane struggled to remain in place. He wanted to be down there, by her side, protecting her as instinct demanded. He was her man. But he\u2019d taught her to look after herself, and now she was queen of an entire nation. He couldn\u2019t swoop to the rescue without damaging her credibility.</p><p>Any other time, that might not have stopped him. He would have killed anyone who questioned her credibility, and that would have been that. But this time, he had to know. Could she survive without him?</p><p>Every day, Disaster weakened a little more.</p><p>Every day, a single fact became clearer. For Kane, the end was near.</p><p>Tink lifted her ungloved hands and cupped the offender\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>The woman gasped, tried to pull away, but failed. Her skin grew pale. Her mouth floundered open and closed. Then, her knees buckled and she hit the ground, unconscious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no servant,\u201d Tink called loudly. \u201cI\u2019m queen, and I will be obeyed.\u201d</p><p>Head held high, she strode from the room. Kane followed after her, the Opulen lucky he didn\u2019t stomp on her as he passed. He didn\u2019t say a word as he sidled up to her, and she didn\u2019t, either. They made it into their room, and Kane shut the door.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d she choked out. \u201cI was angry and I overreacted and I could have seriously hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left her alive, and taught her a valuable lesson in the process. That\u2019s more than she deserved.\u201d More than he would have done.</p><p>\u201cAll I taught her was to fear me. And that would be wonderful if I wanted her fear. I don\u2019t. That\u2019s what my father had.\u201d She wrung her hands together and paced in front of the bed. \u201cI should have done to her what I\u2019d done to the others. Sent her away without a verdict. One day she would have come back and she would have been willing to listen to anyone to settle the dispute. Even me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and peered over at him. \u201cWait. You\u2019re not going to defend my actions, no matter how foolish I was?\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t grin. \u201cCut yourself some slack. You\u2019re new to this. And you\u2019re doing better than I would have done. If I were queen, everyone would have received a death sentence at minute one.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhile you would make a very sexy queen, I know you\u2019re just saying that to be nice.\u201d</p><p>Her definition of \u201cnice\u201d was a bit skewed. Adorable, but skewed. \u201cSweetheart, when have you ever known me to be nice?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment, nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. You\u2019re the meanest man I know. I\u2019ll probably be known as the Mad\u2014but Wonderful\u2014Queen in all the history books, just for staying with you.\u201d</p><p>Won\u2019t laugh. \u201cWell, well. Someone has a smart mouth today,\u201d he said, stalking forward. \u201cAnd that someone is getting a spanking.\u201d</p><p>She yelped and darted around the bed. \u201cKane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly Fae. You can\u2019t get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can try.\u201d She quickened her pace, and the chase was on.</p><p>She ran around the dresser, the vanity, through the bathroom, the closet, and anytime he would get his hands on her, she\u2019d manage to wiggle free. Soon they were both laughing, out of breath, but he wasn\u2019t one to give up\u2014not when she was the prize. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He caught her, and they tumbled to the floor in a tangle of limbs. Her laughter died as he pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she breathed, melting against him.</p><p>\u201cMy Tinker Bell. I\u2019m going to have you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Hurry. I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to savor you.\u201d He took his time undressing her, every moment a new revelation of his feelings for her\u2014because he loved every inch of her. Every curve. Every hollow. Every scar.</p><p>He kissed his way down her body, treasuring her breathy sighs, her heated touches, the languorous way she moved, clutching at him, as if touching him was something she\u2019d been born to do.</p><p>He would never get enough of her.</p><p>And he would never forget her, not even in death.</p> <p>In a way, they\u2019d grown up together. When they\u2019d met, they\u2019d both been in a very dark place. They\u2019d lacked hope. Their fears had overwhelmed them. Together, they\u2019d climbed out of the depths of hell\u2014literally and figuratively. They\u2019d found reasons to laugh. They\u2019d let go of hate and embraced love. The weaknesses they\u2019d had had been blasted by fire and were now strengthened with steel. They hadn\u2019t broken. They wouldn\u2019t break.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even imagine what would have happened to him if he\u2019d never gone back for her. Disaster had tried to stop him, and maybe the Moirai had even tried to stop him, but there was something in him that was greater than both. Love. And love couldn\u2019t ever be stopped.</p><p>Kane parted her legs and slid inside her\u2014home, this was his home\u2014then set out to slowly drive them both insane. She writhed against him, losing herself to the pleasure, the passion, the moment, the inexorable connection.</p><p>He was the one to beg for more. He couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>His control began to fray. Always she had that effect on him. His motions came quicker, harder. And when he began to surge so forcefully her head banged into the wall, her lips parted on a scream of pleasure. She arched her back, taking him even deeper, and he found himself following her over the edge, growling and shuddering with the force of his release.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how much time passed before he recovered enough to pick her up and carry her to the bed. He only knew he didn\u2019t want to let her go. Touching her was a need, a requirement. And not knowing how much longer he would be with her made the thought of separation so much more difficult.</p> <p>But he had to go. She needed sleep, and if he stayed, he would take her again.</p><p>She snuggled under the covers and gazed up at him sleepily.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d He kissed her brow. \u201cSo much. You\u2019re my number one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber one,\u201d she said on a contented sigh. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always wanted to be.\u201d</p><p>By the time he straightened, she was already asleep. He dressed, stepped into the hall. When he stepped forward, intending to return to the throne room, Malcolm appeared just in front of him, stopping him.</p><p>Startled, he furrowed his brow. \u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s going on and why I keep seeing you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant? No. Will I?\u201d Malcolm shrugged. \u201cIn a moment. First, tell me why you\u2019re so unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnhappy? When I\u2019ve done everything I set out to do, giving Tink a new life, a reason to live?\u201d He tried to scoff. He failed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Sent One said.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will get to that, as well.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw, and admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever leave my wife. I\u2019d return to the way things were, with Disaster, but I also don\u2019t want the demon able to hurt her. Basically, I\u2019m damned if I do and damned if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is the crux of a curse such as yours. But perhaps I can soften the blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kane demanded.</p><p>You\u2019ll never be rid of me, Disaster said, his low, whispery voice wafting through Kane\u2019s mind. Determined as he was to survive, the demon had lost his fear of Malcolm.</p><p>Kane\u2019s hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cI will kill Disaster, once and for all,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cI will burn the evil out of you. No demon can withstand the sword of fire. The problem is, this will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill me, too,\u201d Kane said hollowly. Everything always came back to that. \u201cHow does that help me get what I want most? A demon-free future with my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. But at least your spirit will live on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what would happen without your sword of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but without the fire, the essence of the demon\u2019s evil will remain inside you, and when you die, your spirit will go down rather than up.\u201d</p><p>Meaning, if he died the way he\u2019d intended, his spirit would go to hell. For all eternity. Trapped with more demons. Suddenly Kane had to fight to breathe. He hadn\u2019t considered such a consequence. \u201cMy friend Baden was beheaded while he was possessed. He went to another realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that realm is located in a corridor of hell. The people there don\u2019t know it yet, but they will. Every day the walls thin a little more.\u201d</p><p>Kane tangled a hand in his hair. Poor Baden.</p><p>\u201cIf I do this,\u201d Malcolm continued, \u201cI could be kicked from the skies. Killing a man is against the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want in return?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cYour wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ring?\u201d</p><p>The Sent One gave a single, stiff nod. \u201cYou heard correctly. And keep in mind, Disaster is about to take a final stand. He\u2019s weak, but he won\u2019t die calmly. I have a feeling the chaos he caused in New York will seem like child\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>And Tink would be at the center of it.</p><p>\u201cSo do we have a deal?\u201d Malcolm asked. \u201cYou will give me the ring, and I will kill you and your demon before he has a chance to act out one last time.\u201d</p><p>If he said no, Tink could lose her kingdom amid the chaos Disaster caused. She could be hurt. Or worse.</p><p>Was there really a choice here?</p><p>\u201cGive me one more night with my wife. I\u2019ll meet you in the garden at dawn. So, yes, we have a deal.\u201d</p><p>JOSEPHINA LOST COUNT of the number of times Kane made love to her that night, before he fell into an exhausted sleep, but she never grew tired of his advances\u2014because she knew what he was planning to do. Connected to him as she was, she had been waking up inside his head. She didn\u2019t even have to try anymore. This time, she\u2019d overheard his conversation with the Sent One.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she\u2019d known just how badly her husband wanted Disaster killed. But she hadn\u2019t. He was willing to die himself.</p><p>Die.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes, and her chin trembled. Did he not understand she would be lost without him? That she would be right back where she\u2019d started\u2014praying for death?</p><p>I can\u2019t let him do it.</p><p>But...more than she yearned to have him at her side, she yearned to see him happy. To know he was living the life he\u2019d always dreamed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have both. Not as long as the demon was inside him. Because, the only way to keep him here, with the demon, was to guilt him, and that she wouldn\u2019t do. She wouldn\u2019t trap him with her emotions the way the minions had once trapped him with their chains.</p><p>She had to let him go, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Her heart drummed into a too-fast beat. No. She didn\u2019t have to let him go, she realized. Not when she could save him and finally set him free, giving a life for a life.</p><p>Her life for his.</p><p>Almost every day of her existence, she had been punished for other people\u2019s crimes. The past few weeks, she\u2019d done what she\u2019d done to stop that from ever happening again. She\u2019d planned and she\u2019d fought and she\u2019d conquered. But now, she had a chance to end Kane\u2019s pain once and for all.</p><p>If she took the demon inside herself...if she met with the Sent One...</p><p>She could receive the final blow, saving Kane.</p><p>She would die. Once, a part of her had been resigned to such a fate. Now? All of her rebelled. But for Kane, she would do it. She would act as a blood slave was meant, and willingly take the punishment of another.</p><p>He deserved a chance to be the man he\u2019d always dreamed of being. He could rule these people better than she ever could. And he would. He wouldn\u2019t shrink from the duty just because she wasn\u2019t here. He had too much honor.</p><p>I have to act now. What had her mother used to say? A horse had to be saddled before it could be ridden.</p><p>Knowing she only had a few hours until morning dawned and he would be expected in the garden, she slipped from the bed to quietly dress. Then, using the secret passageways her father had been so fond of, she made her way to the dungeon. Two guards stood sentry at the entrance. They nodded when they spotted her, and moved their crisscrossing swords out of the way. She soared past.</p><p>She had examined the cases of the men and women her father had kept down here, and had found out that most had done nothing more serious than annoy him...or have something he\u2019d wanted. So, she\u2019d released the \u201coffenders\u201d and given them bags of gold from the royal treasury. The money couldn\u2019t make up for the pain they\u2019d endured, and the years they\u2019d lost, but it was a start.</p><p>Rather than keep the remaining prisoners out front, their arms shackled above their heads for all to come and view, she\u2019d placed each individual in a cage, and she\u2019d made sure they were far enough away from each other that they couldn\u2019t talk and plan an escape.</p><p>The first cage belonged to her father.</p><p>She peered through the bars. He paced at the far wall, muttering to himself about the injustice of his circumstances. His clothes were ripped, dirty, and his hair tangled.</p><p>He spotted her and froze. \u201cYou,\u201d he said on a sizzle of breath. \u201cLet me out. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou earned your place down here. I\u2019m still trying to fix the messes you created for an entire race of people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPeople that belong to me. I can do whatever I choose with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cDid you come down here hoping to buy my love? To taunt me with what I lost, and promise to give it back if only I\u2019ll acknowledge you?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed without humor, and he blinked in confusion. \u201cThe time for that passed long ago. And no, I didn\u2019t come down here to taunt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever your reason, it was a mistake.\u201d He raced to the bars and reached through, wrapping his fingers around her neck. She could have avoided contact\u2014but she hadn\u2019t wanted to.</p><p>As he squeezed, she curled her ungloved hands around his wrist and drew from him. Strength. The abilities he possessed.</p><p>He tried to sever the connection, but the suction was simply too powerful.</p><p>When finally she released him, his knees collapsed and he toppled to the floor.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d she said. Her muscles buzzed with energy. Her blood crackled. \u201cIt\u2019s why I came. You see, I\u2019m not going to survive the morning, and I\u2019m hoping your abilities will die with me, leaving you as helpless as the people you\u2019ve hurt.\u201d</p><p>As he roared a denial, she moved on to the next hall of cells and came to the queen\u2019s personal quarters. The female was just as dirty as the king, but she turned her back on Josephina, as if she still couldn\u2019t bear to speak with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proof of his infidelity. You hate me. I get it.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Not even the rasp of breath.</p><p>\u201cI was an innocent party in all of this,\u201d Josephina added, determined to say her piece. \u201cI was a child. I was lonely and scared, and desperately wanted someone to love me. My mother was a woman trapped by circumstance. No one in this realm said no to the king, and you know that. She didn\u2019t want a married man, but rather than help her escape his notice, you shunned her.\u201d</p><p>Annnd, still nothing.</p> <p>In a secret place in her heart, she had wanted an apology. An acknowledgment. She would never get it, though, and wouldn\u2019t spend another second hoping for it, wasting this precious energy.</p><p>Sighing, she moved on to Synda\u2019s cell. The girl had heard her and was waiting for her, fingers twined around the bars.</p><p>\u201cLet me out,\u201d the princess begged. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Josephina opened her mouth to pour out every hurt this girl had caused, to voice every wrong she\u2019d had to endure, but she stopped herself. Synda would listen, but she wouldn\u2019t hear. She would nod, but she wouldn\u2019t truly understand. She would tell Josephina everything she longed to be told, Josephina would free her, and Synda would forget what she\u2019d promised. Unlike Kane, the girl had never fought the evil inside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Kane decide what to do with you.\u201d She reached through the bars and cupped her sister\u2019s cheeks. \u201cYou need help. I don\u2019t know who you are without the demon, and maybe you don\u2019t, either, but it is possible to fight the demon\u2019s whims.\u201d</p><p>Tears cascaded from the corners of Synda\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know. I just don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to Kane. He may not like you at first, but if you\u2019re honest with him, if you\u2019re sincere about wanting help, he\u2019ll come around. Goodbye, Synda.\u201d With that, Josephina released her and walked to her brother\u2019s cell.</p><p>He was sitting in the corner, close to the bars, and facing her. His knees were drawn up, and his head propped against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cYou look well,\u201d he said.</p><p>She ignored the compliment, saying, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to beg me to free you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? For the first time, I\u2019m not looking over my shoulder, expecting death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d He\u2019d had the pampered, privileged life she\u2019d always envied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Josephina. Every day I expected death to come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why...unless you treated other girls the way you treated me. You should have been my friend.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI wanted to be more. I still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOf course you are.\u201d</p><p>He laughed bitterly. \u201cYou think you were the only child born out of wedlock? You think the king was the only one to have affairs in the years of his marriage? He let me know in no uncertain terms that I wasn\u2019t his child, I was the queen\u2019s, but that he was keeping me because he needed an heir.\u201d</p><p>She...actually believed him, little facts sitting up in her mind. He looked nothing like Tiberius and never had. The king had always been distant with him. Had always chosen Synda over him. Why had she never suspected?</p><p>Shock rattled her knees. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad anyone found out, I would have been killed.\u201d Another bitter laugh. \u201cActually, if any of his women had ever had a boy, I would have been killed. I lived day by day. I knew you understood that, and thought it bonded us.\u201d</p><p>It would have. If she\u2019d known. \u201cI would have kept your secret, if only you\u2019d been my friend. I needed your support, not your lust.\u201d</p><p>He traced a symbol on the floor. \u201cDoes your...husband treat you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Sadness darkened his features. \u201cIf you ever want him killed, come see me. I\u2019ll take care of it for you.\u201d</p><p>She stood there for a moment, thinking about what could have been between them. Not romance. Never that, even without the blood tie. But companionship. Affection. Support. \u201cTell Kane what you told me. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll show you mercy. You forced your attentions on me, after all, but he might let you live. A part of me likes the thought of you finally finding peace.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cI never would have forced you, you know. I just wanted the chance to prove how good we could be, despite what you believed about us.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was naive of her, but she believed that, too. \u201cGoodbye, Leopold.\u201d</p><p>He shouted as she walked away, his voice dripping with concern\u2014that sounded like a permanent goodbye, Josephina\u2014but she kept going.</p><p>Back in her bedroom, she found Kane sleeping soundly on the bed. She reached out and removed the ring from his finger, the key to his future, then smoothed her hands over his brow, the need to touch him too strong to ignore. He leaned into her, his lips curling at the corners.</p><p>Goodbye, my love.</p><p>As if he\u2019d heard the heart-wrenching cry inside her, he cracked open his eyelids. \u201cTink. Get back in bed, sweetheart. Let me hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep, darling,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>To ensure he stayed down, she used the same move he\u2019d used on her, squeezing his carotid until he returned to his dreams.</p><p>Then, she wrapped her fingers around his wrist, closed her eyes and drew the darkness out of him and into her, just like she\u2019d done that night in the forest. Before, the demon had entered her with a vengeance. This time, he was too weak to scream obscenities. He was merely a heavy weight inside her, a presence in the back of her mind.</p><p>She released Kane the moment she knew the demon was with her, not wanting to take his strength, too.</p><p>His features smoothed out, and he smiled again, so peaceful her chest ached. He must have sensed, on some level, that he was now alone.</p><p>No question, she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, and kissed his temple. \u201cNever forget.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>KANE AWOKE AS sunlight poured through the open curtains. He sat up with a jolt.</p><p>Morning.</p><p>He jumped out of bed, then cringed, hoping his abruptness hadn\u2019t woken Tink. But she wasn\u2019t in the bed, he realized. He quickly dressed and left the room. She was probably in the breakfast nook.</p><p>It was better this way, he thought. He\u2019d already said goodbye the only way he could. If he were to see her now, he might change his mind. He might break down and cry. If he told her the truth\u2014and she would insist on the truth, and he would give it because he was unable to deny her anything\u2014she would try and stop him. He might let her. Anything for more time with her.</p><p>To avoid the guards and servants, he used the secret passageway to get to the garden, and why was his torso burning? He stopped long enough to look under his clothes, and blinked. The butterfly tattoo had faded significantly. Because the demon was dying?</p><p>In the warmth and light of the new day, he felt strangely calm and burden free, considering he was about to die. He felt...lighter.</p><p>When he turned the corner, he saw Malcolm and Tink standing several yards away. Shock stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201c\u2014the ring, just like you wanted,\u201d Tink said, placing something in the warrior\u2019s hand.</p><p>Malcolm looked down at her. \u201cAs thrilled as I am to have it, my deal was with Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s with me. I absorbed the demon and now carry him in my body.\u201d</p><p>The Sent One frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t look as if you carry the demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s too weak to cause any trouble.\u201d</p><p>The conversation confused Kane. He fingered the ring on his\u2014bare skin, he realized. The ring was gone.</p><p>Dread slithered through him.</p><p>\u201cWithout the demon, Kane is going to die, anyway,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cWhy should I help you achieve the same fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to... No! I won\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but....\u201d She went still, as if she couldn\u2019t even bare to breathe. \u201cHe never experienced the life he dreamed of...a life free of Disaster. He should know how it feels to be at peace before he dies, and I can give him that chance, even if only for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re willing to give your life for that chance? Take a moment. Think about this. Once it\u2019s done, it cannot be undone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have thought about it. I want to do it here, now.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm nodded. \u201cVery well. My bargain is now with you.\u201d He held out his hand and a sword of fire appeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In that moment, a sickening realization dawned. Tink had taken the ring, and she\u2019d taken the demon, and she now planned to take Kane\u2019s place.</p><p>She was going to die in his stead, simply to give him a few days, maybe a few weeks, without the demon.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kane screamed. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p> <p>But it was too late.</p><p>Malcolm had already been in the process of striking. The fire pierced her chest, and her scream of pain shattered every corridor of his heart.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he cried. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The sword slid out of her and Kane saw a gap the size of his fist.</p><p>Tink collapsed. And Malcolm vanished.</p> <p>Kane dropped to his knees and roared up at the sky.</p><p>IN A DAZE, when the shock of what he\u2019d witnessed had worn off, but not the horror, never the horror, Kane crawled to his wife, gathered her in his arms and cradled her precious body against his chest. He held her for what seemed an eternity, but it couldn\u2019t have been more than an hour.</p><p>There was no blood on her or him. The sword had cauterized the wound, and it wasn\u2019t right. He should be covered in her blood, should have tangible evidence of the pain she had endured. He should have to wear it, a constant reminder of the disaster he had allowed\u2014even without the demon living inside him. He needed to see his shame. His grief. His failure. Something, anything, but this...nothingness.</p><p>Nothingness. Yes. That\u2019s all he had now.</p><p>His wife, his love, was gone. For nothing! Didn\u2019t she know he could not have peace without her?</p><p>Tears must have been brewing at the back of his eyes because they suddenly spouted out, like rivers of anguish. He sobbed like a baby, and he didn\u2019t care who saw him. Guards and Opulens came up to him and tried to talk to him, to learn what had happened, but he snarled and sent them running away.</p> <p>\u201cHow could you do this?\u201d he demanded of Tink. But he already knew the answer, didn\u2019t he. She\u2019d loved his life more than her own. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He brushed his fingers through the softness of her hair\u2014her blond hair? Yes. Blond. Even her features had changed. She looked like Petra, and he had a moment of hope, thinking Petra had died and not his wife. But then her hair and features changed again, and he found himself peering down at someone he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>When she changed a third time, and the strange image remained for an hour, then another, realization hit him and all hope withered. This was Tink, the blonde in the painting, and she was dead.</p><p>She had drained the Phoenix, acquiring the girl\u2019s ability to shift identities, that was all. Because, now that the shifting had stopped, whatever spark had tried to ignite had been extinguished.</p><p>His Tink was dead, and she wasn\u2019t ever coming back.</p><p>He howled up at the sky.</p><p>He had his freedom now, but the price had been too high.</p><p>He wanted to lash out, to kill someone, destroy something, but he couldn\u2019t bear to release his Tink. So he sat there, even as the sun disappeared behind clouds and rain poured. He sat there as day turned to night.</p> <p>Malcolm appeared a few feet away, his skin pallid, his lips compressed into a hard line.</p><p>A growl rose in Kane\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m the last person you wish to see right now, but I must tell you what I\u2019ve learned. I...went to my leader, told him what I\u2019d done. He has assured me you will survive the removal of your demon, just as the girl wished.\u201d</p><p>Well, what do you know? Kane could release his wife, after all. He stood, his hands fisted. \u201cI might survive, but you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The Sent One raised his chin. \u201cHear me out, warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you kill her? You are forbidden from taking human life, and she was half human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moment she accepted your demon, I stopped seeing her that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change your rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nor does it change my circumstances. I was going to be punished either way.\u201d</p><p>Will...kill...</p><p>But the warrior wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cI was wrong when I told you that you would be emptied out. Your cup wasn\u2019t spilled over. Water was poured inside, slowly displacing the oil. Now, you\u2019re filled with the water...with love. I\u2019m...sorry for your wife\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d He withdrew two daggers.</p><p>The Sent One sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I want to murder you.\u201d He launched one of the daggers, aiming for Malcolm\u2019s neck, but he vanished, and the weapon soared past him, embedding in a tree. Then, he reappeared.</p><p>Kane threw the other dagger, and the Sent One performed the same move.</p><p>He advanced. They\u2019d settle this with their hands, then.</p><p>\u201cYour woman.\u201d Frowning, Malcolm tilted his head to the side as he looked beyond Kane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s on fire.\u201d</p><p>Kane spun, seeing flames dance at the end of her big toes. Once again, hope ignited as he realized what was happening. If she had retained Petra\u2019s abilities, she could rise from her own ashes.</p><p>But what if Petra had been close to the final death?</p><p>He watched, desperate, as the flame spread to Tink\u2019s other toes...to her ankles. Her knees. Her waist. Her shoulders...her head. Until she was engulfed.</p><p>She began to wither. A pile of ashes formed.</p><p>Then, nothing. The flames vanished.</p><p>Another hope destroyed.</p><p>Kane erupted.</p><p>He tore out hunks of earth. He kicked and punched trees. He\u2014</p><p>Was blown backward by an intense wave of heat. He rolled to a stop and jumped to his feet. Beside him, Malcolm did the same. Another fire now raged, this one crackling over the ashes, lifting them, swirling them together.</p><p>Please, he thought. Please.</p><p>A female form came into view, floating in the center of the flames. Tink\u2019s face took shape, then her hair, and body, and his heart nearly burst from his chest.</p><p>She opened her eyes, and the flames died in an instant. Her naked form fell to the ground, and she hmphed, losing her breath.</p><p>Breath. She had breath.</p><p>It had worked!</p><p>Kane dropped to his knees, the rush of relief too much for him.</p><p>She held up a trembling arm, twisted it in the light, then held up the other. \u201cI\u2019m really here.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cKane, I\u2019m really here!\u201d</p><p>He lumbered to his feet, staggered over to her. He needed to touch her. Like, now. Emotion clogged his throat as he fell at her feet and gathered her in his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so glad to watch someone catch fire,\u201d he said, squeezing her tight. \u201cYou reformed, sweetheart. You reformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only the Phoenix can do\u2014\u201d Realization dawned on her beautiful face. \u201cThe Phoenix! I took from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A miracle of perfect timing. A choice...and a destiny.</p><p>\u201cWilliam must have killed her,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way Josephina would have retained the ability. Which means, it hasn\u2019t faded and it won\u2019t. She\u2019s no longer half human. She\u2019s fully immortal, though it appears her ability is weaker than that of other Phoenix. They usually catch fire moments after the deathblow is struck.\u201d</p><p>Kane had thought his tear ducts had dried, and yet, droplets rained down his cheeks. Tink. Fully immortal. His forever. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, the words for Tink, for Malcolm and his leader. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm looked to the sky, paused and might even have smiled. \u201cI have been told to tell you the baby reformed with his mother. Though he is only a few days old, he is specially gifted, and very strong.\u201d After dropping that bombshell, he vanished.</p><p>A baby. A boy.</p><p>To know this soon...</p><p>Kane almost couldn\u2019t process the news. Reverently his hand moved to his wife\u2019s still-flat stomach.</p><p>Her eyes were wide and luminous. Then she laughed, joyous. \u201cA baby, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I ever thought possible. I always thought my gift and my circumstances were a blessing and a curse, but all along they\u2019ve been a blessing, never a curse. I\u2019m alive, and we\u2019re going to have a baby, a baby that will be free\u2014and you\u2019re free, Kane. You\u2019re free! The demon is dead. He\u2019s no longer a part of you or me.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in the hollow of her neck, breathed her in. \u201cWhat you did for me...I\u2019ll never be able to repay you. The price you paid...the pain you just endured...\u201d He shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do anything like that again. I need you. You\u2019re mine. We belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and forever.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to peer into her eyes. The stitches had burned from her cheek and the swelling had gone down, but even still, a jagged six-inch line stretched over her skin. The hole in her chest had been filled, but there was a big, puckered scar.</p><p>\u201cThe injuries happened before you were fully immortal, so the evidence of them will never go away, I bet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre they bad?\u201d she asked, rubbing the scar on her chest.</p><p>\u201cBad? They\u2019re amazing. Like you. Badges of courage\u2014of your love for me.\u201d He searched the rest of her, groaned. \u201cWe need to cover you up.\u201d He tore off his shirt and tugged it over her head, concealing her bare breasts. He removed his pants and handed the material to her, leaving him in his underwear.</p><p>She smiled, a big happy smile. \u201cThe women are going to be drooling over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can drool, but they can\u2019t touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re mine,\u201d she said, \u201cjust like I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>A forever that would be very busy. \u201cI want this kingdom at peace before our son arrives. I want Cameo and Viola found, and my debt to the Sent Ones paid. I\u2019ll have to help them find the demons that killed their king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether, we can do anything.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, soft and sweet. \u201cFor now, I\u2019m only interested in holding you, feeling your heart beat against mine, and proving you really are alive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cI think you want to remove my clothes,\u201d she replied huskily.</p><p>He kissed her again, this time strong and sure. \u201cYes, but the removal of clothing is only step one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd step two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.
