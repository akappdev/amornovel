My references are genuine, and I have the experience required for the position. So why am I here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you had nothing to hide, you wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d Jessa Bellamy murmured as she watched the disgruntled young woman through an observation panel.</p> <p>\u201cNorth and Company retains Phoenix, Inc., to perform standard background checks on all their new employees, Ms. Farley.\u201d Caleb Douglas, the intake interviewer who sat with his back to Jessa, kept a perfect blend of sympathy and authority in his tone. \u201cYou\u2019re here because they\u2019d like to hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She smiled, relaxing her shoulders. Her frosted pink fingernails, however, remained curled into the armrests. \u201cThen I\u2019ve got the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. I\u2019ll let you get started on these\u201d\u2014he handed Ellen a clipboard with a number of blank forms on it\u2014\u201cwhile I grab some coffee. Would you like a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d She took a slim gold pen from her oversize blue leather bag and began filling out the top form. Absently she crossed her ankles, showing off her metallic silver pumps.</p><p>As soon as Caleb left the room, however, Ellen Farley put the clipboard on his desk, stood, and came over to the panel. Jessa knew that on Ellen\u2019s side of the wall, the panel appeared to be nothing more than a mirror with an ornate frame hanging behind Caleb\u2019s desk.</p> <p>\u201cNicely handled,\u201d Jessa said as Caleb joined her at the panel and watched as Ellen fluffed and shook out her layered red hair. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems legit to me.\u201d The interviewer considered the preening woman. \u201cShe\u2019s not happy to be here, but North and Company gave her ten minutes\u2019 notice, so that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d He rubbed the end of his nose. \u201cShe smells like she was baptized with Chanel No. 5.\u201d</p><p>Jessa had already caught a whiff of the woman\u2019s French perfume, which seemed almost a clich\u00e9: Expensive is as expensive does. \u201cCredentials?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela says they\u2019re sterling. Ellen Farley is the perfect candidate for comptroller.\u201d Caleb studied her expression. \u201cOr not. What\u2019s setting off your bells, boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer shoes. They\u2019re knockoffs.\u201d</p><p>Cal glanced down. \u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>Jessa gestured at Ellen\u2019s tasteful floral sheath. \u201cSo you don\u2019t invest in a Michael Kors dress and a Balenciaga bag unless you can also afford five hundred bucks for the real Anya Hindmarch pumps.\u201d</p><p>The interviewer chuckled. \u201cYou should be a gay man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in my next life. Bring her to me after she finishes the busywork. And, Cal.\u201d Jessa nodded toward his empty hands. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the coffee before you go back in.\u201d</p><p>Walking up the back stairs to her office gave Jessa time to think. She often used small, seemingly insignificant details like Ellen Farley\u2019s designer-clone shoes as rationale for further assessment of the applicants sent to them by their clients. By doing so she\u2019d acquired a reputation for having a keen eye, and even Caleb, one of her most trusted employees, believed in it. Jessa had been very careful to cultivate that misconception.</p><p>Her ability to discover exactly what people hid from their employers had made Phoenix, Inc., one of the top personnel agencies in the South, but no one could ever know the truth of how she did it.</p><p>Angela Witt, her technical supervisor, intercepted her outside her office. Tall, rawboned, and a little awkward, Angela was barely out of her teens, and had originally come to the agency as a temp. Jessa had quickly discovered the very young secretary had a natural gift for computers, multitasking, and resource management, as well as a desperate need for permanence and a sense of purpose.</p><p>\u201cMs. Bellamy, Caleb said you flagged Ms. Farley.\u201d Angela sounded as stiff as she looked. \u201cI checked every one of her refs, but they all came back a hundred percent. What did I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jessa said. \u201cHer shoes are wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA fashion mistake? Oh, good.\u201d Her shoulders drooped as her chin lifted. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not good, not at all, but at least I didn\u2019t ...\u201d She stopped herself and released a sigh. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Angela.\u201d Accustomed to her office manager\u2019s mild but perpetual paranoia, Jessa suppressed a smile. \u201cI could be wrong about this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, Ms. B.\u201d Her office manager shook her head, almost dislodging the stubby pencil holding her topknot of hair in place. \u201cYou\u2019re never wrong. It\u2019s like you have liar radar. I\u2019ll run her name again and see what I can find.\u201d She turned and hurried down the hall to the data center.</p><p>Jessa stepped into her office and closed the door. She\u2019d personally designed her workspace to be quiet and uncluttered. Two clear Lucite columns supported the massive slab of polished black granite that served as her desk. Against one white wall, Asian black lacquer cabinets inlaid with delicate mother-of-pearl lotus flowers concealed her office equipment, and faced a four-by-five-foot print of Ansel Adams\u2019s Birds on a Beach over a modular black leather seating unit that surrounded a coffee table that was merely a smaller version of her desk. In the center of the table stood a crystal vase filled with fresh flowers. She\u2019d had the back wall replaced with a single panel of glass, which provided a wide view of Peachtree Street and the Armstrong building.</p><p>For the floor, she\u2019d commissioned and imported labradorite stone tiles from Sweden, which glowed with an ever-changing blue-green-amber light under the recessed incandescent fixtures in the white ceiling. At the corners of each tile were small, silver disks that to the naked eye appeared to be decorative touches. Each disk was hardwired to perform three different functions when activated by the remote: sealing the room, tripping the security alarms, and administering enough of an electrical charge to knock out whoever stood on them.</p><p>Her workspace appeared more like a room in a minimalist art gallery than an office, but it suited her tastes and kept anyone else who entered from getting too comfortable.</p><p>Jessa opened the doors to the cabinet nearest her desk to check her surveillance equipment. Six monitors showed six different-angled views of her office via the minicameras hidden all around the room. She picked up a small transceiver, switched it to take over her office line, and tucked it over her ear. She removed a slim remote sitting inside the cabinet and placed it in her jacket pocket.</p><p>A knock sounded, and Jessa went to stand behind her desk before she called for the person to come in.</p><p>Caleb entered with an unhappy Ellen Farley following him, but after performing introductions and handing Jessa a file, he excused himself and left.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down, Ms. Farley.\u201d Jessa waited until she had before she did the same and opened the file. \u201cI have a few more questions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d Ellen crossed her arms. \u201cI filled out all of your forms. What else do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Unhappy and defensive, Jessa thought.</p><p>\u201cYou were born in 1974, an only child, is that correct?\u201d She glanced up in time to catch Ellen\u2019s tight nod before returning to the file notes. \u201cVery good education, majored in economics at Brown, graduated with honors. You were recruited to work for CitiCom, where you were promoted to assistant comptroller, paid very well, and then resigned a year later.\u201d She met Ellen\u2019s resentful gaze again. \u201cWhy leave a good job like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no possibility for advancement,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cCiti doesn\u2019t place women in the top executive positions. It\u2019s one big old-boys\u2019 network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou relocated from New York to Atlanta before you found a new position.\u201d Jessa pretended to skim through the rest of the forms, letting the other woman stew for a moment before she asked, \u201cWhat brought you down here to look for work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the South.\u201d She moved her shoulders. \u201cThe weather is great and the country is beautiful, and the people are nice.\u201d</p><p>Jessa closed the file. \u201cEstablished corporations like North and Company are somewhat more conservative than their New York counterparts. I believe our old-boys\u2019 network is in its fifth generation.\u201d</p><p>Ellen\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d</p><p>She was as suspicious as she was defensive, which might mean she was everything she claimed to be, or not. \u201cMerely that your ambition may come up against yet another glass ceiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of this is your business, Ms. Bellamy,\u201d the other woman snapped.</p><p>\u201cI am certifying for my client that you are who you say you are and therefore are also suitable for employment with them.\u201d Jessa offered her a cool smile. \u201cAt present, everything about you is my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The faint lines around Ellen\u2019s mouth eased. \u201cIt was really a shock to find out I\u2019m being investigated, or whatever you call it. Then they told me I had to come over here right away, or I wouldn\u2019t be eligible for hire. It scared the heck out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be afraid. It\u2019s all over now.\u201d</p><p>Ellen smiled. \u201cReally? That\u2019s all I have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Jessa stood. \u201cI appreciate your taking the time to come in and fill out the paperwork.\u201d She held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ellen Farley\u2019s hand joined hers.</p><p>Shadowlight.</p><p>Jessa stood in the center of what appeared to be a cheap hotel room. The odors of cigarette smoke, sweat, and sex nearly choked her as she gazed down at the two bodies writhing together on the worn paisley carpeting. Neither had undressed completely, but the man\u2019s buttocks gleamed white beneath a low tan line, and shook as he thrust himself into Ellen Farley with eager, frantic movements.</p><p>She could feel their lust crawling inside her head, dragging with it everything they thought. While Ellen\u2019s mind focused on the need tightening in her pelvis, her lover Max\u2019s thoughts were at odds with his enthusiasm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be rich, baby,\u201d the man panted as he grabbed her bouncing breast through her damp silk blouse and dug his fingers into the mound. \u201cSo fucking rich. We\u2019ll never have to work another day of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Max Grodan was already rich, Jessa knew. Beyond rich. He could leave Ellen and never have to work another day for ten lifetimes\u2014and he had worked very hard to keep Ellen from discovering that.</p><p>Ellen groaned. \u201cWhat if I get caught? This time they\u2019ll know it was me. I\u2019ll go to prison, Max.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllen Farley will go to prison, if they bother to dig her up out of the ground.\u201d Max nuzzled her neck. \u201cJudy Tulliver is going to Rio with me and five-point-nine million bucks.\u201d</p><p>The image in Max\u2019s mind was of a shallow grave, but it was empty. At least until he shoved Ellen\u2019s limp body over the edge.</p><p>Sunlight.</p><p>Jessa released the other woman\u2019s hand, smiled, and watched her leave the office. As soon as the door closed, she dropped down into her chair and buried her face in her hands. She sat like that until the worst of the shakes from her vision stopped and she could think of something other than running after Ellen and pleading with her not to go anywhere near Max.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do this. Not here, not now.</p> <p>With a trembling hand she picked up her phone and dialed a two-digit extension. \u201cAngela, check the U.S. interment database and see if you can find a listing for an Ellen Ann Farley, date of birth February nineteenth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat year, Ms. Bellamy?\u201d</p><p>She flipped open the file and gazed at Ellen\u2019s date of birth. To use identity records belonging to another person, Ellen would have had to choose someone born prior to 1936\u2014the year the United States began issuing Social Security numbers\u2014with digits that could be easily doctored. The digit I could be easily changed to a 4\u2014or a 7. \u201cTry 1914.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearching.\u201d After a few moments, Angela took in a quick breath. \u201cOne hit. Holy Moses. Ellen Ann Farley, born 1914, died 1916. Interred in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Albany County, New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jessa put the phone on speaker so she could walk around the office and work out the last of the trembling weakness from being in the shadowlight. \u201cCall the Office of Vital Statistics in New York, and have them fax a copy of Ellen Ann Farley\u2019s actual birth certificate to us. If the certificate numbers match, we\u2019ll move on to Social Security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Angela hesitated before adding, \u201cSee what I mean? You\u2019re never wrong about people, Ms. Bellamy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jessa looked down at the vase of white roses on the coffee table, and touched one of them. \u201cThis time I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdele, standing there and breathing on it ain\u2019t gonna get that window clean,\u201d Maribeth Boden said as she finished rubbing the last streak from the glass in front of her.</p><p>Adele Watkins didn\u2019t reply, but swatted the air with her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on now.\u201d Maribeth walked over to help her friend, and studied the dusty inside of the pane. \u201cWe got three more offices to do before ... we\u2014\u201d She stopped and gulped. \u201cSweet baby Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Adele murmured.</p><p>The man on the other side of the window stood in the shade the recessed arch over it provided. While Maribeth saw a lot of men during her rounds of the office buildings she cleaned every day, she couldn\u2019t recall ever noticing one put together like this one.</p><p>He was too dark to be white, and too light to be black. She would have pegged him as Hispanic or Indian, if not for his dark blond hair and light eyes, but that wasn\u2019t right either. If someone had asked her, she would have said his skin reminded her of her mama\u2019s homemade pralines, all hot and smooth as they cooled on waxed paper in the kitchen.</p><p>His pretty skin covered broad, heavy muscles, the kind she\u2019d never seen on a white man, not even the ones at the gym around the corner. When he shifted position, they didn\u2019t ripple; they flowed.</p> <p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s gonna put that jacket back on?\u201d Adele murmured.</p><p>The white sleeveless shirt he wore clung to his chest and torso like body paint, and made it clear to Maribeth that everything it covered was just as fine as what it exposed. \u201cGod wouldn\u2019t be that hateful to me.\u201d</p><p>Adele sucked in a sharp breath as the man turned his head to look at the window. \u201cHe knows we\u2019re watching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he don\u2019t,\u201d Maribeth chided. \u201cIt\u2019s privacy glass; the outside\u2019s like a mirror, \u2019member? He\u2019s just looking at himself.\u201d But he didn\u2019t do much of that before he went back to watching the street. \u201cYou think he works here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does, we\u2019re blind.\u201d Adele pressed her dark hand to the dirty window. \u201cDamn, Mari, but if he ain\u2019t the finest man I\u2019ve seen in my whole life, I\u2019ll eat my mop.\u201d</p><p>Maribeth thought of her man, Darnell, who was still home in bed after a long night on the road. \u201cThink I\u2019m gonna go home for lunch today.\u201d</p><p>Adele sputtered a laugh. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d take my coffee break in the back of my husband\u2019s cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, ladies.\u201d Carter Burleigh, one of the young attorneys who worked on the floor, walked up behind them. \u201cHave either of you ... found\u2014\u201d He stopped speaking, but his jaw remained in its dropped position.</p><p>Adele glanced back at him. \u201cThat your boyfriend, Mr. Burleigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod wouldn\u2019t be that kind to me, Adele.\u201d Carter wedged himself between the two women to have a better look. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Maribeth said on her own sigh.</p><p>On the other side of the window, the man who had taken the name Gaven Matthias decided he\u2019d concealed himself long enough to dispel casual suspicion, and moved out of the shade to cross the street. As he did, he heard the groans of the two women and the one man who had been watching him, and smiled a little as he kept his jacket slung over his arm.</p><p>On the other side of the street, he walked down the block, went to a meter, took out a handful of coins, and counted them. Everyone who walked past him paid little attention to what he did; he was simply a man avoiding a parking ticket.</p><p>They were not aware that he\u2019d claimed the spot many hours before dawn, or that he had spent the time either watching the phone booth next to the parking space or feeding coins to it so he might eavesdrop on every woman who came to use the booth. Fortunately in this era of mobile phones few seemed to have need of it, and there had been only two since dawn.</p><p>The third came as he selected a quarter to add to the meter. He heard the click of her heels on the concrete sidewalk and smelled her scent as she passed. He didn\u2019t look directly at her, but from the corner of his eye he saw the gleaming twist of black hair at the back of her head and the smooth fit of her gray jacket over slim black trousers.</p><p>She dressed like a man but smelled like good clear water, crisp and cool. He closed his eyes briefly, taking her scent deep into his chest and letting it warm him. Few of his boyhood beliefs had withstood the passage of time and life, but he still kept faith in his senses. They whispered that she had come to him at last, the one he was meant to find. She smelled of tears and melting snow.</p><p>She smelled of rain.</p><p>Coins chimed as she fed them into the phone, and then her voice brushed against his ears, low and sweet, a taste of dark honey. She asked for an agent by name, waited, and said, \u201cI have important information for you. Please listen carefully.\u201d</p><p>Matthias pressed a button on his watch to switch it to its timing function before he fed another quarter into the meter and listened. The woman spoke rapidly, offering names, dates, monetary amounts, and the electronic method used to commit the crime. She gave the address of a hotel and the room number where the criminals responsible could be found. She finished the call with a polite refusal\u2014probably for a sizable reward\u2014and hung up the receiver.</p><p>She walked away without looking back once.</p><p>He checked his watch. She had related everything in one minute and thirty-eight seconds. As he watched her turn the corner, he saw her remove first one black leather glove and then the other.</p><p>He took out his own phone and pressed the number two before bringing it to his ear. \u201cWhom did she call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI headquarters in New York City,\u201d Drew told him. \u201cDid you get a clear shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no opportunity.\u201d Matthias went around and climbed into his rental car. As he pulled out and drove around the block, he repeated everything he had heard the woman say. \u201cYou can check what she reported to see if it is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on it.\u201d The sound of tapping keys came over the line. \u201cGot a hit. The details she gave the FBI match an unsolved case that happened two years ago. Electronic embezzlement. The company lost close to a million dollars. No suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon there will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Drew agreed. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she report them to the local office? They\u2019re there in Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>He considered that. \u201cToo close to where she lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were right. She lives in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLives, or perhaps works.\u201d Matthias searched the faces of the pedestrians walking on either side of the street before he spotted the woman standing at a corner and holding her hand in the air. \u201cShe came by taxi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart lady. No car, no license plate we can use to trace her identity. Do you think she suspects that someone is looking for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would not stay here if she did.\u201d Matthias kept one hand on the wheel and used the other to lift his camera to his face. He was able to snap three profile shots as the woman entered the taxi that had stopped for her. \u201cFind out what you can. I will call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood hunting, boss.\u201d</p><p>Matthias noted the number and license plate of the cab before he pressed the number one on his phone.</p><p>\u201cHit me,\u201d Rowan\u2019s cool young voice said.</p><p>He gave her the numbers along with the company name stenciled on the side of the taxi. \u201cThe driver took her from the street at one thirty-three.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe picked her up at one thirty-three,\u201d she corrected him. \u201cKidnappers like us take people.

You think she\u2019s the one who\u2019s been tipping off the feds?\u201d</p><p>Her scent still lingered in his head and chest, a silent waterfall. \u201cI know she is.\u201d</p><p>Rowan\u2019s tone changed. \u201cThen you should take her as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p> <p>Jonah Genaro rolled away from the thin, damp body of his mistress, left the bed they had shared for the last hour, and pulled on his trousers.</p><p>Lorraine propped her head on her arm and watched him take a clean, pressed black shirt from the supply he kept in the closet. \u201cI thought you were going to stay awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another appointment.\u201d He picked up his wallet and watch from her vanity table. Twenty years ago he would have left a handful of bills behind, but today he preferred the convenience of a rechargeable credit card. \u201cThe next few weeks will be busy for me. I won\u2019t have time to see you again until the end of November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave yet.\u201d Lorraine climbed out of bed, wrapping herself in a yellow silk robe before she shook out her hair. She\u2019d stopped bleaching six months ago, at Genaro\u2019s request, and now had it dyed to match the dark roots as they grew out. \u201cThere\u2019s something we need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Genaro knotted his tie. \u201cI\u2019ll call you next week and then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d She came around to stand in front of him, holding her hands together like a remorseful schoolgirl. \u201cJonah, I\u2019ve been to see my doctor. He did some tests, and, well, we\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p> <p>Genaro\u2019s hand went still for a second, and then slid the knot of his tie up under the edges of his collar. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize at first.\u201d She released a pretty, helpless laugh. \u201cI skip my periods all the time, and then I am on the pill, too, so it never occurred to me that I could be. I never miss them, but the doctor said sometimes in rare cases they don\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>The schoolgirl quality of her confession didn\u2019t diminish the relief Genaro felt. Lorraine had been enthusiastic, and even occasionally entertaining, but his desire for her had begun to fade. This extortion attempt would allow him to get rid of her without the usual tears, recriminations, and final lump-sum payoff. \u201cI presume you don\u2019t want to have an abortion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that, Jonah. I\u2019m Catholic, remember?\u201d She gave his arm a soft caress. \u201cBesides, I love you. This is our baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your pregnancy is genuine,\u201d he told her as he removed her hand, \u201cI\u2019m not the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d The hopeful, beseeching quality of her expression faded into something harder. \u201cI haven\u2019t been with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>As Genaro retrieved his jacket, he considered taking her to the lab to be tested. If she had become pregnant by another man, her fetus could still prove useful. But Lorraine had an active social life, and her father was a prominent Atlanta attorney who thought the sun rose and set on his only child. She would be missed.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cMy dear, you\u2019ve miscalculated. Your baby\u2014if one really exists\u2014isn\u2019t mine.\u201d He adjusted his sleeves. \u201cI\u2019m sterile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201d She stopped and stared before she began to bluster. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You never told me you couldn\u2019t have kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never asked.\u201d Genaro walked over to her. \u201cOur arrangement is over. You have until the end of the month to pack your things and move out.\u201d As she opened her mouth, he shut her up by backhanding her. The blow proved hard enough to knock her to the ground, but not enough to inflict permanent damage. He bent over her, caught her chin, and made her look at him. \u201cThe next time you resort to blackmail, first do the appropriate research.\u201d</p><p>He left Lorraine on the floor and walked out of the apartment.</p><p>Genaro directed his driver to take him downtown before he picked up the phone and called his chief of security. \u201cVoid the credit balance left on Miss Lamar\u2019s account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Genaro.\u201d Delaporte, who had been with him for thirty years and had taken many such calls, didn\u2019t ask why. \u201cThe overseas shipment arrived about ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>A great deal of money had changed hands over this particular shipment: much more than Genaro had originally wanted to invest. But he had been unable to resist the rarity and high quality of the product. Even if he had to store it for some time, he suspected that in a year or two he\u2019d be in a position to make an enormous profit.</p><p>\u201cSee that Dr. Kirchner attends to it,\u201d Genaro said.</p><p>He arrived on time for his two-o\u2019clock appointment, and spent the next several hours going over the specs for the new lab with the architect and the foreman before he left to attend a charity dinner to benefit a local foundation for the prevention of neural-tube defects.</p><p>\u201cJonah, we\u2019re so happy you could make it.\u201d The hostess, a forty-something, brassy-haired socialite whose younger, less fortunate brother had been born with spina bifida, took his hands in hers as she gave air kisses on each side of his face. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lorraine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d He scanned the crowded tables. \u201cIt looks like an excellent turnout this year, Jackie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased, although\u2014as usual\u2014we have a last-minute glitch. Bad weather grounded our guest speaker\u2019s flight.\u201d Jackie sidled closer. \u201cCan I do a terrible, presumptuous thing and impose on you to fill in?\u201d</p><p>As much as he begrudged the time he wasted engaging in the practices of a prosperous, influential businessman, there was no other way to maintain the respectable facade. He agreed with a smile, and thirty minutes later stood before the dinner guests and spoke about the tragedy of genetic defects and the cures made possible by biotech research.</p><p>\u201cEarlier this year researchers in Texas published their discovery of a link between variants in three genes that regulate glucose metabolism in children born with spina bifida,\u201d he told the guests. \u201cOur geneticists are now working with that data in order to create a specific gene therapy that will correct these variants in utero. Once we have the cure, we can develop treatments for the other neural-tube defects, like anencephaly and encephalocele. No more children will have to spend their lives in wheelchairs. No more infants will be stillborn or doomed to die within a few hours after their birth. We will avert these tragedies long before they ever happen.\u201d</p><p>As he continued, Jonah noted that Jackie had hung several tasteful pictures of bravely smiling, wheelchair-bound children on the walls surrounding the dinner tables. Not one showed an image of a newborn with a severe NTD.</p><p>When Genaro left the dinner and returned to GenHance, Delaporte met him in the lobby.</p><p>\u201cOur man reported in this afternoon,\u201d he said as he followed Jonah onto the elevator. When the doors closed, he reached up and switched off the small security camera in one corner. \u201cHe\u2019s finally identified the woman who\u2019s been tipping off the feds. This is everything we have on her.\u201d He handed over an envelope. \u201cShe fits the profile.\u201d</p><p>Genaro took out and skimmed the report. \u201cSo she does. Have Lawson meet me in the lab.\u201d</p><p>A short time later Bradford Lawson stood for a moment under the UV unit before he placed his palm on the print scanner. As another public face of GenHance, he cultivated the image of geniality and prosperity, from the immaculate styling of his fair hair to the supple gleam of his hand-stitched leather shoes. Genaro didn\u2019t care for the color or the trendy cut of Lawson\u2019s cobalt blue suit, but the younger man carried it off as if he\u2019d been born in a three-piece.</p><p>\u201cDelaporte said we have an ID for the federal tipster who\u2019s been catching the uncatchable,\u201d Lawson said as he joined Genaro at the viewing panel. \u201cIs this psychic informant anyone we know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Genaro handed him the photos and the report. \u201cClear your schedule. I want her verified and brought in by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Lawson read the top page. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Phoenix. Small company, but they have an excellent reputation.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d think if she wanted to hide what she was, she would have done something else for a living.\u201d</p><p>Genaro didn\u2019t answer. He watched as two lab techs wheeled in a long, sheet-draped box on a gurney, followed by Elliot Kirchner, his chief geneticist. He switched on the intercom. \u201cDr. Kirchner, did you perform the initial micro-cellular tests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as it arrived.\u201d Kirchner, a tall, cranelike man with iron gray hair, glanced at the viewer. \u201cLife support has sustained cellular integrity so far, but there is only negligible brain activity.\u201d He pulled the sheet away, revealing the body inside the glass coffin.</p><p>Genaro studied his investment. Bandages encased the head, but the rest of the specimen appeared to be in superb condition. \u201cIt looks better than it did in the photographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s close to physically perfect.\u201d The geneticist took some readings from the preservation unit\u2019s LED display. \u201cBP and heart rate are strong. Once I\u2019ve completed the physical and neurological exams, we can begin the preparation work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut off the bandages,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cI want to see the head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kirchner nodded to one of the techs, who produced a pair of scissors and cut through the layers of gauze. He peeled them away, exposing a battered, unrecognizable face and a gaping, horrific head wound.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone blew away about a quarter of the skull,\u201d Lawson commented.</p><p>\u201cSomeone did.\u201d Genaro studied the wound. \u201cYou\u2019re sure the injury will affect only higher brain function, Doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll verify it once I perform the necessary scans, but yes.\u201d Kirchner sounded confident. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, the body is mindless.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019d acquired a rare DNA sample from the biotech black market in Europe, it had taken Genaro another ten years to research and put into place the resources needed for GenHance\u2019s latest and most important phase of development. This final acquisition would initiate the last step toward his goal of creating, customizing, and selling the ultimate in human enhancement.</p><p>He turned to Lawson. \u201cWhere are we with the transerum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last series of human blood trials were quite promising,\u201d his director told him. \u201cNone of the primate test animals survived vaccination, of course, but you anticipated that.\u201d He glanced through the view panel at the shrouded body. \u201cOnce the subject is cleared by Dr. Kirchner, the lab is fully prepared to begin testing.\u201d</p><p>If the transerum developed by his microbiologists worked, it would bestow increased strength and enhanced senses, and make inviolate the immune system of the test subject. If it did not, and it killed humans as quickly as it did chimps and gorillas, they would still learn from it. The transerum had already undergone several hundred modifications; Genaro expected it would require many more before it was perfected enough to sell. Then nothing else would stop him from acquiring enough wealth and power to do whatever he pleased anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Genaro noticed that Kirchner was bent over the body and studying the head wound closely. He switched on the intercom and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw the eyelids moving,\u201d the geneticist said, and straightened. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d</p><p>Jessa checked in with Caleb before asking him to close the office for her. Normally she was the last one to leave, but after dealing with Ellen Farley, she needed time to think.</p><p>\u201cAnge said to tell you that the certificate numbers were a match,\u201d Cal said. \u201cThat would make Ellen Farley a very well-preserved ninety-four-year-old, or an identity thief. Do you want me to call Linda McMann?\u201d he asked, referring to North and Company\u2019s personnel director.</p><p>\u201cGive her a heads-up so Farley doesn\u2019t get back into the building, but tell her we\u2019ll verify the information before we turn over our official report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou sound upset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeadache. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d Jessa switched off her cell phone and leaned forward. \u201cWould you drop me off here, at the corner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The cabbie pulled over to the curb and accepted her fare before glancing out at the deserted park. \u201cYou meeting someone out here, lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend,\u201d she lied, smiled, and got out.</p><p>No one except Jessa knew who had bought the four acres of prime Atlanta real estate and turned it into a public park, or that it had been modeled on a more famous square in the northern part of the state. Jessa had arranged it all through a local city beautification group, and donated the property to the city under the condition that it be given the name she had chosen for it, and that the land never be used for any other purpose than a park. It was her small piece of home away from home, and walking along the cobbled brick paths lined with magnolias and azaleas, she could almost imagine herself there again.</p><p>The fountain, a masterpiece of copper alloy sculpted to resemble a phoenix rising from the flames of the basin, was so new it still gleamed rosy red in the sunlight, but in time the weather and air would turn the bright metal green. As Jessa sat down on the bench before the fountain, she felt the weight of old grief and the sharp twist of new fear.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t keep doing this; she knew that. No matter how careful she was, eventually someone in authority would come looking for her. Then there would be the inevitable questions: How did you know? Who told you? What evidence do you have?</p><p>If she lied, they would know. If she told them the truth, they would have her committed.</p><p>Jessa knew she could stop reporting what she discovered when she went into the shadowlight. At most Ellen Farley would have been turned in as an identity thief to the police by North and Company. On that charge she probably could have made bail, left the city with her partner, Max, and started a new con somewhere else. In this era of electronic everything, high-tech grifters like Ellen and her boyfriend were becoming a common class of criminal. Corporations wrote off their losses and tightened their security measures. No one really got hurt by embezzlement, and often the crimes resulted in better business practices.</p> <p>What no one but Max and now Jessa knew was that someone would die this time: Ellen.</p><p>Because Ellen had been having sex with Max when Jessa had looked into her soul through the shadowlight, the connection of their bodies had also allowed Jessa to see into his. As soon as Ellen finished this last job, her boyfriend planned to kill her, frame her for all the crimes they committed together, and then leave the country for the islands, just as he had seven times in the past. There he would transfer the stolen money into a fat numbered bank account, where he kept another $20 million from his past crimes before moving on to find and groom and teach the game to his next victim.</p><p>\u201cI can stop doing it,\u201d Jessa told the fountain as if it were listening. \u201cStep back and let my people do their jobs. They have the talent and the resources. They don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>The water splashed, merrily indifferent to her quandary. But there was something else there, an unseen presence, like a lost soul hovering somewhere just out of sight.</p><p>Imagining he was there brought Jessa\u2019s emotions out of the tight, small place where she kept them secreted away. They were mirror twins, the desperate regret and yearning grief, born in agony, nurtured in silence. She protected them from the world, and in return they had grown to become her oldest friends, her closest companions.</p><p>Jessa felt tired of it, all of it. She\u2019d done her best to save the Ellen Farleys of the world, and prevent the Max Grodans from hurting anyone else. If by now she hadn\u2019t paid for her mistakes, she never would. There would always be an endless supply of Ellens and Maxes in the world, and they would never stop, so maybe it was time she did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not spending the rest of my life in this park. I don\u2019t have the nightmares anymore. I was glad when they went away.\u201d She glanced down at her hands. \u201cThere has to be someone else. Someone I can touch. Someone you\u2019d like. If I\u2019d died that day, and you had lived, I know I\u2019d want the same for you.\u201d</p><p>Talking to a man who wasn\u2019t there, who could never be there, made little sense. Jessa didn\u2019t believe in an afterlife. She knew he was gone forever. A therapist would have told her she was talking to herself, nothing more. But if by slim chance she was wrong, and the souls of the dead lingered around the living, she wanted him to know. He had always been the love of her life\u2014and he would understand.</p><p>Her wireless chimed in her pocket, and she tasted something salty on her tongue. Jessa reached up to wipe away the tears that had trickled unnoticed down her cheeks before she checked the sender ID: Aphrodite.</p><p>The text, as always, was short and unsweetened: You fucking off in the park again, Jez?</p><p>Jessa popped out the tiny keyboard and thumbed a brief reply: Not now, Di.</p><p>Talk to me. The woman she knew only as Aphrodite sent a small graphic of a smiley face brandishing a bouquet of virtual roses between the lines she typed. Or I\u2019ll start texting you about the last episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. Scene by scene.</p><p>The joke threat tugged a smile out of her. Oh, God, anything but that. Bad day here, but I won\u2019t whine. What\u2019s up?</p><p>She forwarded an e-mail from Vulcan, tagged with the words, Vulcan thinks he\u2019s found another Takyn. Wants to sched a group chat.</p><p>The man they knew as Vulcan served as their chief scout. In the three years since Jessa, Aphrodite, and the other members had formed the Takyn, their very private online support group, he had been searching for others like them. Vulcan wouldn\u2019t kid about something like this; the unique problem they all shared was too dangerous.</p><p>I told you, Aphrodite wrote when Jessa didn\u2019t reply. There are more out there. A LOT more. At least forty or fifty.</p><p>I\u2019ll read the e-mail. That was as far as Jessa was willing to commit herself. Don\u2019t get crazy about this.</p><p>I\u2019ve been crazy, Aphrodite wrote back. Now it\u2019s starting to make sense.</p><p>Jessa felt a pang of shame. Di had been through all seven levels of hell, and Jessa had no business spitting on her friend\u2019s hopes. Your lips, God\u2019s ears. Got to go.</p><p>Immel8tr.</p><p>Jessa ended the connection, switched off the power to her phone, and popped out the rechargeable battery pack and the SIM card. Vulcan had taught her to do that; anyone trying to trace their wireless communications would lose the signal.</p><p>Who would want to find us? she\u2019d asked him once.</p><p>With what we can do? he wrote back. Who wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>In the very beginning, when Jessa had formed the private network with Aphrodite, the others they had found online had treated them and one another with guarded, suspicious reluctance. It had taken more than a year of cautious communications before they\u2019d opened up to one another. That had been an enormous comfort to the entire group, but it had made them even more paranoid. To protect everyone, they\u2019d agreed to remain anonymous to one another. No one used their real names, ages, addresses, or referred to any detail that might be used to identify them, even within the group.</p><p>To Aphrodite and the others, Jessa was the founder of the Takyn, a woman they knew only as Jezebel.</p><p>Vulcan wouldn\u2019t have made a mistake about this prospect; the criteria for joining the Takyn were too exact. The person would have to be between the ages of twenty-six and thirty-four, adopted from a specific list of placement agencies run by the Catholic church in only a handful of cities. There would be no records of the person\u2019s birth parents, and few official documents filed with state welfare agencies. The adoptive parents would have to be wealthy or well-to-do orthodox Catholics with no biological children of their own or other adopted children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, the person being considered would have had to miraculously survive a fatal accident or illness, and come out of it with a very specific side effect, one they were subsequently compelled by necessity to hide from everyone in their life.</p><p>Aphrodite had been the first Takyn Jessa had ever encountered. They\u2019d met on a discussion board for adult adoptees seeking their biological parents, and then had begun exchanging e-mails. What Di had told her had at first enraged Jessa, but then they had begun comparing personal histories and discovering just how alike they were.</p><p>Jessa had set up and named The Adopted Kids of Yesterday Network Web site, but it had been Aphrodite who dubbed their private group with the site\u2019s acronym.</p> <p>We were taken from our real parents and families. We all remember bits and pieces of the rest in our nightmares. The doctors. The treatments. The pain. The goddamn tattoos. Whatever they did to us, they took away our chance of a normal life. Why not call us what we are?</p><p>Jessa knew her friend had every right to be bitter. Aphrodite had terrible memories of what had been done to her, and when a nearly fatal illness had caused her ability to manifest, she had been forced to leave home and live in hiding. Virtually the same thing had happened to her when a brush with death had transformed what had been a pleasant, helpful ability into something much darker, uncontrollable and ultimately inescapable. Still, Jessa refused to believe as Di did that they had been used as lab rats when they were children and then simply abandoned.</p><p>There had to be more reasons for what they were, and why they had been experimented on in the first place. If Vulcan was right and he had found another one like them, then the new member of the group might know more than they did. Every childhood memory, every ability, and even their individual theories illuminated another shadow of the past.</p><p>She would have sat there by the fountain until dark, but the park\u2019s sprinklers came on and the breeze rolled over the automatic sprayers, stealing some of the water and surrounding her in a fine mist. She stood and went to the edge of the basin, where she dug a penny out of her pocket and dropped it in. It sank and settled atop the hundreds of others at the bottom of the basin. A penny for her thoughts, which she paid every time she came to Price Park.</p><p>Her last thought before leaving was usually, I miss you. I love you. But tonight she was ready to say something else.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Jessa looked around the beautiful place she\u2019d created. \u201cGood-bye, Allen.\u201d</p><p>She walked through the square to the small lot beside it where she had left her car. As the sweet perfume of the flowers grew distant, she breathed in and noticed another, almost familiar scent. She felt sure she\u2019d smelled the same thing earlier today, downtown. As before it frustrated her; she couldn\u2019t identify it as anything except something very warm, nearly hot. It had been easy to dismiss it this afternoon as a trick played by the last of the summer heat, but now ...</p><p>Jessa glanced over at the darkening horizon, and felt the coolness of twilight on her skin. The temperature had probably dropped fifteen degrees in the last hour.</p><p>Someone was here. Someone who had heard her.</p><p>She made a sharp turn and faced the park. It appeared as empty as when she\u2019d arrived, but it didn\u2019t feel the same. Tiny nerves under her skin flared, sending confusing signals to the rest of her senses. She couldn\u2019t see or hear anyone, but someone was there. Someone who stood just out of sight.</p><p>Someone who had been watching her.</p> <p>Running to the car and driving off would have been the safest option, but this was her place, her personal haven. Whoever had been eavesdropping on her had violated her most private moment.</p><p>She took out the illegal Taser she carried in her purse as anger propelled her forward toward the fountain and then around the base of every tree. She didn\u2019t find anyone, but wherever she picked up a trace of the scent, she stopped and scanned the area. The sprinklers had left the ground wet and soft, but she found no footprints or any signs that she\u2019d been followed or observed.</p><p>If someone had come into the park after her, they\u2019d left before she\u2019d discovered the scent.</p><p>Slowly she put away the weapon and scanned the park one final time before she went to her car. She didn\u2019t make the mistake of going near it or unlocking it until she had checked the space beneath the undercarriage and looked into the windows to ensure that no one had broken in and hidden himself in the backseat.</p><p>Jessa glanced back at the park a final time, waited, and then disengaged the car alarm before getting in. She sat for another minute and watched the rearview mirror before she started the engine and backed out of the space.</p><p>She never took the same route home from the park twice, but now she drove in circles and made a half-dozen U-turns while she watched for a tail. No cars followed her, and after an hour of aimless driving she admitted to herself that she might have overreacted.</p><p>\u201cNo one cares who you are,\u201d she muttered as she took the final turn toward home. \u201cThey\u2019re all dead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>Matthias stood looking down from his perch for some time after the woman had left the park and driven off into the night. He\u2019d been right to assume that her senses were as acute as his, and after dealing with the only car parked in the immediate vicinity, he\u2019d looked for cover. Concealing himself by climbing up into the twisted heavy branches and dense leaves of the oak tree across from the fountain was an old ambush tactic, but his vantage point had permitted him to watch her face nearly the entire time she had spent in the park.</p><p>Sorrow had brought her here, he guessed, as much as the need to change vehicles.</p><p>She took no joy from the solitude or the sound of spilling water, but sat like a new widow beside a fresh grave, alone and still. Listening to her whisper and watching her weep had made him restless. A part of him, the part that would never bow its head to the demands of his work, had wanted to go to her. No woman should have to bare her soul as she had, all alone in this lovely, quiet place. She needed to be shown that life had not forgotten her, that the emptiness could be filled again.</p><p>What Matthias first thought was sympathy for the sad beauty shifted inside him, impatient and demanding, growing hard and hot. His outcast state had left him cold to the feelings of others; he had drawn on that to make his way in this world. So had she. Of all the women who had come to him over the course of time, she would know what it was to be an exile. It was as if she had been fashioned for him, shaped and tempered to fit him, the lock only he could open, the armor only he could wear.</p><p>In another time and place he could have simply taken her for himself. Despite all her precautions, she had few true defenses. She would struggle like the wild thing she was, but in time he would gentle her. She would come to know him, and he would show her the truth of what they could be to each other.</p><p>There would be pleasure. She had a strong, young body and sensitive skin. Matthias\u2019s hands curled as he imagined stripping her down and laying her out. She would not be passive or accepting; she would demand as much as she gave. Her mouth would taste like her scent, as sweet as water from a hidden spring. He could feel his seed rising, eager to flood her hidden chambers and give her a child to put to her lovely breasts. He could see a small dark head resting on the graceful curve of her arm, the tiny mouth like a flower as the babe suckled. He could see himself holding them both and watching.</p><p>It bemused him when he realized that, in his mind, he already made her his bed partner and mother of his firstborn. He, who had never given any woman more than a few sultry hours to ride out her pleasure on him before he deliberately spilled his seed on her belly. He\u2019d never liked it, but unlike the other men he had served with, he had no intention of scattering a horde of fatherless children in the wake of his travels. He would not allow them to grow up as he had, unaware of what lay slumbering inside them.</p><p>Yet try as he might, he could not rid himself of the fancy\u2014the woman at his side, naked and willing in his bed, his son at her breast.</p><p>He had not been able to read the messages she had received and sent on her wireless, but they had disturbed her, and destroyed his idyllic dreams. The change that had come over her expression had made him wish he could drop down, take the electronic device from her, and toss it into the fountain.</p><p>No matter how much he wanted to go to her, Matthias knew that revealing himself now would be what Rowan called foolish and Drew counterproductive. Taking her too soon would jeopardize endless hours of surveillance and months of meticulous investigative work\u2014and knowing that, still the temptation had come close to overwhelming him.</p><p>He climbed down and went to sit on the bench she had occupied. The wooden slats retained the warmth of her body heat, the air the faintest trace of her scent. He let both sink into him as he used his phone.</p><p>\u201cSignal\u2019s strong, but I think she\u2019s suspicious,\u201d Drew told him. \u201cShe drives like she\u2019s trying to shake a tail.\u201d Before Matthias could ask what that meant, he added, \u201cA tail is a car that is following hers. Shaking it means evading it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cannot shake off our tail.\u201d The GPS transmitter Matthias had planted on her car would send a signal for the next two weeks before it drained its batteries. \u201cWhy does she come here, to this Price Park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she likes to meditate. Let\u2019s see.\u201d Drew tapped on his keyboard. \u201cIt\u2019s a public park, built five years ago. Nothing really special about it, except the property and the landscaping. Both were paid for by a private party and then donated to the city.\u201d</p><p>He recalled the sadness on her face. \u201cShe did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find any records available other than some permits filed by a downtown beautification committee,\u201d Drew told him. \u201cConsidering what prime city real estate went for five years ago, I doubt it was her land. She could have made millions selling it to a developer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this woman.\u201d He glanced at the modest sign bearing the name of the park. \u201cThe name Price\u2014see what you can learn from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I have nothing to do for the next ten years. Why don\u2019t I look up Smith and Jones while I\u2019m at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was another name. Allen.\u201d Matthias glanced up at the sky. The moon had crossed the spangled celestial dome and peered back at him through a veil of charcoal clouds. \u201cMy receiver is in the car. Where is her vehicle now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSignal says it\u2019s parked in a nice neighborhood three-point-three miles from your position.\u201d Drew gave him the street address. \u201cCity maps show that to be a pretty exclusive condominium complex. You\u2019ll need to find her specific apartment.\u201d</p><p>Three miles, so she could walk to this park, Matthias thought. \u201cI will track her. You will monitor, and call me if she moves again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan called me,\u201d Drew told him. \u201cShe\u2019s getting everything ready, but she\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p> <p>Rowan forever worried about him. Matthias found it alternately amusing and disconcerting. His mother had died in childbirth when he was a boy, and by that time his older sisters had married and gone off with their husbands. Growing up as he had, he was not accustomed to such attention.</p><p>Matthias left the park and drove to the address Drew had given him, a large network of buildings with several signs proclaiming them to be Falcon\u2019s Ridge Condominiums. An armed guard sitting in a shack before the gated entrance prevented him from accessing the complex. He didn\u2019t attempt to talk his way in, but scouted the boundaries of the entire property before parking his car beneath some trees in an empty adjacent lot and taking his pack from the trunk.</p><p>The seven-foot-high brick wall surrounding Falcon\u2019s Ridge appeared solid enough to discourage any trespassers, but the wide spacing of the street lamps allowed him to find a darkened area that would conceal his movements. Fortunately the decorative bird statuettes interspaced along the top of the wall had been cemented into place, and one held the loop of rope he tossed over it securely.</p><p>He climbed up the wall hand over hand, bracing his feet against the brick before removing the loop around the base of the stone falcon and dropping it over the side. He jumped down to a clear spot before rolling behind a row of hedges that had been trimmed into a neat rectangle.</p><p>After waiting for any sound warning that he had been seen, he coiled the rope and crawled twenty feet to a small grove of trees, where he stood and scanned the area. The two buildings before him appeared newly built and empty; beyond them was a walk that followed the circular drive to the other buildings around the complex.</p> <p>Each building had its own parking lot, and he was obliged to check five before he found the woman\u2019s car. From the vehicle he followed her scent, which led him up five flights of stairs to the very top floor of the building, which was occupied by four separate apartments.</p><p>The woman\u2019s scent ended at the door to the back right corner of the level, and when he stood in front of it he could hear music and water.</p><p>He went to the landing and studied the back of the building. No balconies or windows offered him a simple way in, but a sixth, narrow set of stairs led up to the roof. He climbed up and saw rows of dome-shaped transparent bubbles. He had to think for a moment before he remembered the word in English for it that Rowan had taught him.</p><p>Skylights.</p><p>Matthias eyed the domes, determined which had been placed over the woman\u2019s apartment, and took some tools from his pack. He took his time as he went to work on the bolts securing it, removing them one by one until he was able to lift the dome away.</p><p>Music drifted up to him, the clear notes soft and sweet, like lark song on a fair morning. They brought with them the woman\u2019s scent, and the need returned, so strong and impatient that he had to hold back for a moment and wrestle desire for control.</p> <p>Below the skylight lay a bed draped with a shiny blue and green coverlet. Ribbons of dark violet wound through the fabric and gathered it in places. He saw only one pillow, clad in a violet cover and, on the wooden stand beside the bed, a cordless telephone unit and a small remote device. The rug beneath the bed, which covered the floor of the room, was a dark green, like thick grass. At the end of the bed lay draped an old, thick blue robe fashioned for a man.</p><p>The robe made his gut tighten, for he had not considered the possibility that she lived with a lover.</p><p>He slowly replaced the dome and sat, thinking.</p><p>Movement drew his eye to the skylight. The woman walked naked to the bed, her head swaddled in a green towel, and picked up the robe. She pulled it over her body and belted it before walking out of sight.</p><p>Matthias rolled onto his back and stared up at the stars. Even through the distortion of the Plexiglas, he had seen the healthy gleam of her alabaster skin and the full globes of her naked breasts. Her limbs and torso had been all long, full curves, ripe and wanton, like a fertility goddess in the flesh. His hands shook slightly as he rubbed them over his face.</p><p>He had to stop this. She was a woman to be taken, and not in the manner his body craved.</p><p>The light showing through the bubble disappeared, and he heard the sounds of silk moving and the gentle give of a mattress. He turned over to look through the bubble, but the curved surface showed only a dark space.</p><p>Now that he knew exactly where she lived and could follow the vehicle she drove anywhere it went, the time had come for him to retreat and observe again from a prudent distance. He kept peering down until his eyes adjusted to the darkness inside the apartment and he could clearly see her form on the bed. She lay on her side, the coverlet pushed to the foot of the bed, her back toward him. Soundlessly he lifted the dome and set it to one side.</p> <p>She had discarded the robe and wore nothing but a pair of light-colored panties that barely covered her bottom. The long line of her back showed the stretch of her spine and the nip of her trim waist. She had broad shoulders for a woman, but they curved from neck to arm in a beautiful shape, like the polished frame of an ivory harp. The subtle indentations of her ribs showed each time she took a breath, and while her eyes were closed, he sensed she remained awake.</p><p>For a time she remained still, and then she began shifting, first to one side and then the other. She took the lone pillow from beneath her head and put her arms around it, holding it against her torso. She pulled it over her face, and then flung it away.</p><p>Matthias had spent enough sleepless nights to know her thoughts were not allowing her to leave this world for the river of dreams. Unless she found some peace within herself, she could not forge her way through the dark waters of the night.</p><p>The woman\u2019s left hand lifted from her side and came to her face, where she pressed three fingers against her lips. She used the tip of her tongue to lick at her fingertips, and then rubbed the pad of her third finger back and forth against her full bottom lip. The kissed hand curved down, over and under her chin, into the hollows of her throat. The stroking fingers lingered there, tracing the fine bones at the base of her neck as if she hesitated to do more.</p><p>Matthias\u2019s mouth dried as he watched, unable to breathe, unwilling to move.</p><p>She took a deeper breath, releasing it as she turned onto her back. If she opened her eyes now, she would see him looking down at her through the skylight. Matthias found he didn\u2019t care in the slightest. If she saw him, he would drop himself through and be on top of her before she could get out of the bed. The ache in his crotch began to beat like a drum.</p><p>Open your eyes, lovely one. Give me this reason to come down to you.</p><p>Her dark eyelashes remained where they were, but her fine brows drew together as her left hand glided down again. She traced the contours of one breast and then the other with light, unhurried touches, circling around each stiff nipple, pressing in and smoothing over the delicate flesh.</p><p>He watched her pinch and tug gently at the peaks, and smelled the change in her scent as her arousal swelled. She wanted a strong mouth there, kissing and suckling at her pretty breasts; he could tell from her manner of toying with them.</p><p>The fine edge of her teeth appeared, worrying at her bottom lip as the muscles in her legs stretched and her thighs clenched. Still she played, teasing herself until her breath quickened and tiny beads of sweat appeared on her brow.</p><p>Anticipating her, Matthias reached for the front of his trousers, easing them open until he could work his hand inside. As her fingertips stroked the dent of her navel, he grasped his shaft. The stiff heat against his palm and fingers ached from the hidden tip to the tight cusp of his stones. When her legs parted for her questing hand, he tugged back his foreskin, letting the night air kiss the slick head.</p><p>The air rising from the apartment brought to him another gift: the damp scent of her sex, surely the loveliest aroma to ever fill his head. His chest swelled as he tightened his fist, and the steady, pounding surf of his need turned his shaft to inflexible iron and squeezed a single pearl from its blind, seeking eye.</p><p>She tended to her sweet place with loving gentleness, cupping and holding at first and then parting the folds beneath the triangle of dark curls to stroke her third finger in the silky moisture gathered between. The wet sounds made his teeth grind together; they called to him with wordless hunger, begging for him to bury himself in her snug little well and fill it over and over until she overflowed.</p><p>In she pressed her fingers, petting her pearl before reaching and penetrating herself as she mimicked a man\u2019s thrust. As her fingers danced, he stroked in time, his eyes hot and dry, the sight and smell and sound of her tangling inside his head. It had been too long for him since last he lay between a woman\u2019s legs; he knew he could not last as long as she could. As he pumped, he prayed he would.</p><p>She took in a startled breath and held it as her hips lifted high, and pressed her mound against the heel of her palm. Matthias bit back a groan as his own pleasure broke and he jerked his foreskin up, closing the end over the spurting head. The heat of his seed backwashed, bathing his shaft as he heard the wordless sounds she made, and he watched the change come over her damp face. She held nothing back, lips parted, neck arched, her breasts thrust up as if in a final offering. It took every ounce of control he possessed to watch her peak and do nothing more.</p><p>She turned over, slowly pulling the pillow to her face as her body became boneless with satisfaction. It gave Matthias time to cover himself and reach for the dome. He went still as he heard a wrenching sound, and glanced down to see the woman\u2019s fists tighten in the pillow as her shoulders trembled with the force of her sobs.</p><p>She gave herself pleasure, and then she wept after taking it? He had known women who shed tears in his arms, but they had been joyful\u2014especially if the woman had never before known what a man and woman could give each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She has no man to take her in his arms and soothe her to sleep. She takes her pleasure in solitude, just as she weeps.</p><p>Matthias carefully replaced the dome. He could not offer her the comfort she needed; he had no place in her home or her bed. With what he had learned this night, he decided he would have to go slowly and carefully. He would have to consider how to initiate contact and cultivate an association. Friendship seemed unlikely; he might have to resort to a business relationship. His friends Rowan and Drew would have ideas on how best to do that without alarming her. When she accepted him\u2014when she understood that she could trust him\u2014he would have her. She would come to him openly and give herself to him.</p><p>Only then could he destroy her life.</p> <p>Six hundred miles to the south of Jessa Bellamy\u2019s apartment, a tall brunette entered the penthouse suite of a beachfront building that served as her lover\u2019s home, business, and base of operations.</p><p>Samantha Brown shrugged out of her jacket and unfastened her shoulder holster, and sent a longing glance in the direction of the sinfully large master bath before booting up her computer terminal. As a Fort Lauderdale homicide detective she had spent most of her nights chasing after killers, and the paperwork involved with her cases never seemed to end. Not that she minded; she was a cop and that was part of the job. Nothing would change that, and nothing had. Not even when she had been fatally shot by a fellow officer who had been stalking her.</p><p>Lucan, a retired assassin and possibly the most lethal living thing on the earth, had killed her stalker and saved her life by changing her into what he was: a blood-dependent immortal who could heal instantly, possessed incredible strength, and yet who tried to coexist with humans peacefully.</p><p>Aside from the lousy diet, and the fact that she\u2019d fallen in love with one of the deadliest men on the planet, Samantha really couldn\u2019t complain.</p><p>\u201cYou coldhearted bastard,\u201d Samantha muttered as she read the e-mail sent to her from a contact in the Atlanta FBI field office.</p> <p>The reflection of a tall, long-limbed man appeared on her computer screen, and two large, lethal hands gloved in black velvet rested on her shoulders. \u201cYou called for me, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d Sam rubbed her cheek absently against the back of Lucan\u2019s glove.</p><p>Ignoring a six-foot-five, two-hundred-and-thirty-pound vampire, especially one who looked like Lucan, was next to impossible. Even if Sam had been blind, she would have smelled him from a mile away. Tuned to the seductive scent of his immortal body, like dark fields of night-blooming jasmine, she\u2019d known the moment he\u2019d entered the suite. When he touched her, her own body responded with annoying immediacy.</p><p>But the information sent to her from Atlanta held her riveted.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t sleep until dawn, and she usually spent the last hours of the night in her lover\u2019s arms. But when she had arrived home from work, Lucan had been busy downstairs clearing out and closing the club. She\u2019d come up to the penthouse suite they shared to take a shower and catch up on some e-mail while she waited for him. She liked to stay busy when she was alone in the penthouse, the uppermost two floors of Lucan\u2019s building, which he had extensively remodeled before they\u2019d met to serve as his private domain.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she felt uncomfortable in their suite. Anyone would appreciate the spectacular, three-hundred-and-sixty-degree views from the wraparound impact-glass windows recently installed; standing in the center of the great room, she could turn around and see the Atlantic Ocean, the Intracoastal Waterway, Port Everglades, and Fort Lauderdale\u2019s sleek modern skyline all at once. Comfortable lounges had been placed on the outer terraces so she could recline under the stars and watch the dark surge of the tide roll in over the pristine amber sands of their private beach. If she wanted anything, she just had to pick up a telephone and ask; no matter what it was, the serving staff, which worked three shifts around the clock, would deliver it within minutes.</p> <p>All the splendor, elegance, and luxury of the suite had been designed to pamper the occupants. If she wanted to, she could sleep in either of the two master suites or any of three guest rooms, or take a long, hot shower in one of the four bathrooms. The library held close to five thousand books on every subject and in every genre, and had a wood-burning fireplace and armchairs made to nap in, while the media room offered every form of electronic entertainment, from the latest CDs and DVDs to the newest video gaming systems. There was even a workout room where she could use free weights, Nautilus, or run on a high-tech treadmill toward a screen that could be preprogrammed to show the view of a jogger running through parks and nature areas in the world, or sweat out her troubles in the adjoining wet/dry sauna.</p><p>None of that mattered to Sam in the slightest as she reread the report. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. They\u2019ve nailed Max Grodan, this con artist who always killed his partners after framing them for his crimes. After all these years, they caught him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous news.\u201d Lucan\u2019s hands shifted to turn her computer chair around one hundred and eighty degrees. \u201cSurely that brings a happy end to your police work for this night.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at the indecently handsome face framed by a mane of corn-silk hair, and the glittering of chrome around the edges of his ghost-gray eyes. Lucan, the former assassin turned benevolent dictator, didn\u2019t like being ignored. He also remained mostly oblivious to the work she did, something that often annoyed her more than his looks. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has been nailed. You are pleased. Justice doubtless has been served.\u201d He knelt before her and leaned in to nuzzle her throat. Against her ear he whispered, \u201cNow, would you be so kind as to forget about being a cop until tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She linked her hands behind his neck and kissed his cheek. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I have to fly up to Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Lucan pulled her into his arms and stood. \u201cYou are coming to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be much easier to have a conversation with you,\u201d she mentioned, \u201cif you\u2019d get your mind off hopping in the sack with me for, say, thirty seconds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He set her down on her feet and regarded her through narrowed eyes. \u201cTwenty-nine. Twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feds in Atlanta busted a pair of grifters,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cOne of them turned out to be Max Grodan. He was the primary suspect in an old open murder case of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty,\u201d he said, looking bored as he folded his arms. \u201cNineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe uses lonely young men and women to run his games,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe seduces them, trains them, and sends them in under fake or farmed identities. They take all the risk; he gets all the money. Then he frames them, kills them, and walks away. I know there were at least three others besides my victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen. Twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod damn it,\u201d she said, suddenly furious with him. \u201cYou don\u2019t own me. This is my job. This is what I do.\u201d</p><p>The scent of jasmine grew thick and hot, and the empty wineglasses they had left by the window shattered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a bloody damn about your job. You belong to me.\u201d He backed her up against a wall. \u201cI keep what is mine close. Here. Certainly not in another colony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been colonies for over two hundred years, and I\u2019m going to Georgia only to extradite a prisoner.\u201d She threw out a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re acting as if I\u2019m running off to Aruba with one of the boys in the garrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not be that foolish.\u201d Popping sounds came from inside her computer, and the monitor screen went dark. \u201cThere is something you are not telling me about this. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She pressed her hands against his chest, trying to push him away. She would have had better luck moving a brick wall. \u201cJust stop. Have it your way. I\u2019ll let someone else go in my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the first one I ever saw with my talent,\u201d she shouted. \u201cI put my hand down and accidentally touched the victim\u2019s blood and the vision hit me. One minute I was there looking at the body and the next I was watching the last hours of his life. I thought it was real, that somehow I\u2019d been thrown back in time to be a witness. I saw every moment he suffered, Lucan. I watched that kid crying and pleading with him. Max beat him, and he sodomized him, and then he strangled him. He took his time. He fucking enjoyed it. It\u2019s his favorite part. Not even the money makes him feel that good. After he ran I had nightmares about Bobby. For years.\u201d She struck her fist into his chest. \u201cAre you happy now? Satisfied?\u201d</p><p>Lucan caught her hands and brought her scarred palm to his lips. \u201cI did not realize.\u201d He kissed her hand, and then her brow, her eyelids, and the bridge of her nose before enfolding her in his strong arms. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>Sam held on to him, standing docile and quiet as he stroked her hair. He knew the old wounds she still carried from her human life were as deep and painful as his own. Because of the suffering they had both seen and experienced, Lucan understood her as no one else could. Sometimes when she was angry, she forgot just how well he understood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a jerk,\u201d she said into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou are distraught.\u201d He lifted her face, urging her to look at him. \u201cI will allow you to go, Samantha, but not alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t do anything to me.\u201d She sounded so tired, even to her own ears. \u201cHe\u2019s only human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFangs do not make the monster, my love.\u201d Lucan tucked her head under his chin. \u201cBut while I am your lord and master, which will be until eternity comes to an end, I will not let you face such nightmares alone. Now stop sniveling. You promised me no more weeping.\u201d</p><p>Sam knew she was supposed to adhere to the customs and laws of the Darkyn, which dated back to the Dark Ages. Which also meant she had to do what Lucan told her. But her lover gave her more leeway than another Kyn lord might, mainly because he did understand her calling. For six centuries he had done the same for the Darkyn, although none of the killers he had pursued and captured ever lived long enough to be tried for their crimes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d she promised. \u201cThree at the most, I swear.\u201d</p><p>She knew what she was asking of him. Aside from his possessiveness, there was a more pressing need for her to stay in Fort Lauderdale: their bond. Since Lucan had saved her life by changing her from human to Darkyn, they had never been apart from each other for more than eight hours. The bond between them, which had made them life companions, was enduring and demanding. Sam still wasn\u2019t sure she understood everything about being his sygkenis, but over time she had come to understand that they physically needed to be with each other in order to survive, as much as normal humans needed warmth and shelter and food.</p> <p>Sam had also been warned by other Kyn women what would happen if she left Lucan. An extended separation would cause both of them to go through withdrawal, first spiritually and then physically. If they were kept apart too long, one or both of them would lose control and descend into madness. In that mindless state, they would kill anything that came near them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to make it back in two days,\u201d she said. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need to make a vow.\u201d He went to the phone. \u201cI will arrange it so that I can accompany you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She went after him. \u201cYou\u2019re the suzerain\u2014the ruling lord here. You can\u2019t leave your territory.\u201d</p><p>One of his golden brows arched. \u201cDo you imagine anyone could stop me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but ...\u201d She paused, groping for an excuse. \u201cIt\u2019s not standard departmental procedure.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a thin smile. \u201cNeither is your being Kyn. When do you plan to reveal that to your police commissioner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He stopped her from saying any more by resting a finger against her lips. \u201cRafael can see to the jardin while we are away, and as you say, it will be for only two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me,\u201d she muttered, and then the room flipped and she found herself on her back beneath his big frame, her arms stretched out on either side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d Lucan said just before he lowered his head to kiss her. \u201cI do not trust myself.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 4</p><p>In the morning Angela greeted Jessa as soon as she came through the office doors. Almost hopping with nerves, the young woman informed her that Ellen Farley had been arrested.</p><p>\u201cLinda McMann called for you thirty seconds after Cal and I came in, and then when I said you weren\u2019t in yet she told me,\u201d Angela told her, so agitated that she tripped over her own feet and righted herself without pausing for breath. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a lot of the details, but the detective who talked to her said Ellen and this guy she was with are wanted for running this scam and swindling a big New York corporation. Linda says her boss wants a sit-down so he can do a personal thank-you and all that.\u201d Out of breath, she gulped air. \u201cI think she\u2019s sending you flowers, too.\u201d</p><p>Jessa saw Cal standing in the doorway of his office and watching them. He didn\u2019t look unhappy or disturbed, but something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cMs. B?\u201d</p><p>She focused on Angela. \u201cEveryone is innocent until they\u2019re proven guilty, so let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. Finish up the file and make sure all the reports are complete. Then whatever happens with the charges against Ms. Farley, she won\u2019t be able to sue North and Company for discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d She turned to Cal. \u201cGot a minute?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and followed her upstairs. Jessa stopped along the way at their small employee lounge to start the coffee, only to find it already made.</p><p>\u201cAngela needed something to do besides squeal and bounce off the walls,\u201d Cal explained as he filled and handed her a cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t supervise, so it\u2019s probably undrinkable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot, which is all that matters at this hour.\u201d Jessa led him into her office and closed the door before skimming through the messages left on her desk. \u201cYou have something on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllen Farley, what else?\u201d Cal took his coffee to the window to watch the downtown traffic streaming below them. \u201cShe didn\u2019t look like the con artist type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood ones never do.\u201d She separated the callbacks she needed to make from the message slips. \u201cThe FBI will likely want copies of everything we have on her. Give them whatever they want, including the original forms she filled out if they ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem surprised to hear the news,\u201d Cal said, his tone casual.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dug up a lot of dirty little secrets since I began this company,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI guess it\u2019s harder to shock me.\u201d She glanced over and found he was watching her intently. She set down the message slips. \u201cSomething else bothering you, Cal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since Linda called, I\u2019ve been thinking about some things. For example\u201d\u2014he held up one finger\u2014\u201cyou pegged Farley as a fake because she was wearing cheap shoes.\u201d He raised another. \u201cYou saw through her phony identity, which was good enough to fool North and Company and the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI notice little details, put things together.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one detail you forgot.\u201d He lifted a third finger. \u201cYou know that the FBI will be calling on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they will. They\u2019ll be investigating everything she\u2019s done recently\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela didn\u2019t say anything about the FBI being involved,\u201d he finished gently. \u201cShe said only that Farley had been arrested.\u201d</p><p>Jessa waited a beat too long before she said, \u201cThe woman just moved from New York to Atlanta. It\u2019s only logical to assume that she was wanted by the FBI for out-of-state crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice comeback.\u201d He nodded his approval. \u201cOnly I\u2019m not buying it this time. You knew about this yesterday.\u201d He gave her a measuring look. \u201cYou knew, and I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re the one who called and reported her to the feds.\u201d</p><p>No one knew what Jessa could do, and as much as she liked people who worked for her, neither could they.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Cal.\u201d She waited until he did. \u201cI\u2019m aware Angela and some of the younger staff believe that I\u2019m some sort of psychic. It\u2019s flattering, I suppose, but I\u2019m not and this has to stop now. I\u2019ve built Phoenix on solid, ethical investigative work. If people spread rumors that I can see the future or the past or whatever, it will get around, and soon every quack in Atlanta will flood through our doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be so bad?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo let people know just how good you are at spotting fakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they think mystical mental powers are involved? Yes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be very bad for business. That kind of thing chases away the legitimate clients. Once the quacks find out that I can\u2019t actually tell them which stocks to buy or investments to make, they\u2019ll go, too. Things like this\u2014Farley getting arrested the day after I flag her\u2014are merely coincidences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right.\u201d He stroked his jaw with his thumb and forefinger. \u201cI wonder how many of the people Phoenix has investigated have\u2014by coincidence\u2014been arrested a short time after for crimes they thought they\u2019d gotten away with.\u201d</p><p>He was too damn smart. Jessa had known that from the moment she\u2019d met him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say. But you and Angela and the rest of the staff work for me. I can\u2019t have this kind of talk going around about me, Cal. Not even in fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better make some changes from here on out,\u201d he told her. \u201cDelegate. Use me to initiate some of the searches. If you have to report something to the authorities, wait a week or two before you make the call.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe her, and she was running out of lies and patience. \u201cMaybe I should just fire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut I\u2019m on your side, and I don\u2019t have to know everything. You\u2019re the best goddamn boss I\u2019ve ever worked for, and that includes my father when he gave me a summer job teaching tennis to the nubile young rich things at the country club he managed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb.\u201d She rested her cheek against her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how we feel about you,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou hired me after I\u2019d been blackballed by every decent company in this town. You persuaded the girls in accounting to leave that bookie they worked for only a week before he got busted.\u201d</p><p>She made a dismissive gesture. \u201cA friend told me about them. I just gave them a chance to get legal jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren told me you cornered her in a grocery store and offered her a job she had no training for, and then you gave her an advance on her first paycheck. She said it\u2019s as if God knew she\u2019d gone there to steal some food for her kids and sent you like a guardian angel to stop her. And then there\u2019s poor Angie.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cAfter her mom died, which roof was she planning to jump from downtown? Bank of America?\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cAngela didn\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone made a joke about that gorgeous twenty-year-old supermodel who jumped in New York last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAngie blew a fuse. Later I asked her about it, and she said no one can understand how miserable and desperate that girl must have been. Ange made it pretty obvious that she does know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to help people, especially when someone is in trouble,\u201d she said in her firmest tone. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me a psychic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why hire me? No one believed that female sales director who accused me of groping her was actually the one harassing me.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cNo one but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an attractive young man with good taste. She was a desperate older woman with bad teeth.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cWorkplace sexual predators don\u2019t happen spontaneously. You had no history of harassing other women. She insisted on hiring only male assistants. I did the math, Cal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEinstein couldn\u2019t do this math,\u201d he assured her. \u201cJessa, if you asked, I think I\u2019d set myself on fire for you. So would Angie and everyone else.\u201d He reached across the desk.</p><p>Jessa flinched, jerking out of reach before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cWhy does a warmhearted woman like you avoid being touched?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Her temper wanted to answer him, because a month after hiring him she had accidentally touched him. A brush of her fingers against him when exchanging a form had pushed her into the shadowlight, where she\u2019d discovered his secret lust for Angela. She\u2019d seen into his most private fantasies, most of which revolved around scenarios where he seduced and dominated the girl into adoring submission. Caleb\u2019s secret bondage fetish was not the only shadow on his soul. When he had sex with other women, he always turned out the lights. His partners never knew it was so he could better pretend they were Angela.</p><p>\u201cShit. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she heard him say. \u201cTouching them. You always shake hands with the ones you don\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>The intercom light flashed, and with relief she answered it.</p><p>\u201cJessa, a Mr. Bradford Lawson from GenHance, Inc., is on line three for you,\u201d her switchboard operator said.</p><p>She had no idea who Bradford Lawson was, but she\u2019d heard of his company. Everyone who did business in Atlanta had.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Karen, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d She looked at Caleb. He smiled. \u201cAm I fired now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019d come very close to revealing something she\u2019d guarded for ten years, and while she thought she could trust Cal, she needed to regroup. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this again another time.\u201d As he rose to leave, she added, \u201cCaleb, I do appreciate your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. But you have it anyway.\u201d Still grinning, he left.</p><p>She let out the breath she\u2019d been holding before she picked up the phone. \u201cGood morning, this is Jessa Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Bellamy, Bradford Lawson from GenHance,\u201d a pleasant tenor voice said. \u201cTim Baker from Nolan, Hill, and Suskin referred me to your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was very kind of him.\u201d Jessa recalled the work she\u2019d done for Tim Baker on three different paralegals he\u2019d been interviewing for hire; one had turned out to be a plant from a rival law firm. \u201cHow can I help you, Mr. Lawson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGenHance is expanding its research operations in the Southeast,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will create about forty new biotech-related jobs here in the city, and another two hundred support positions in our satellite operations over the next three months. The nature of our business has always required thorough background checks and credential verifications on all new hires, which until now was handled in-house. This new phase of our operations, however, is quite sensitive. To keep from having our research compromised, our CEO has decided to hire an independent firm like Phoenix, Inc., to screen our applicants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted to have the business, but I have to be realistic,\u201d Jessa advised him. \u201cWe\u2019re a small company, and two hundred and forty screenings can\u2019t be done overnight. My people will need at least two weeks, maybe three, depending on the availability of the applicants for interviews as well as the specific information you\u2019d like verified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour candor is appreciated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re looking for is a more permanent arrangement. If we can agree on terms, GenHance will contract Phoenix to screen all of our new hires. I have the projected figures here ...\u201d</p><p>Paper rustled in the background. \u201cAbout five thousand or so new positions over the next two years. Would you and your people be up to that kind of challenge?\u201d</p><p>Jessa thought quickly. She would have to hire more investigators, at least ten, to handle that much work. But this was what she had been working toward, and with the right contract, GenHance\u2019s business would enable hers to grow exponentially. \u201cI believe we are, Mr. Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019d like to get together with you to discuss more of the details in person. What are you doing for lunch tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her calendar, but the day remained blessedly free of midday appointments. \u201cIt looks like I\u2019m meeting with you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHow does one o\u2019clock at Cecile\u2019s suit you?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d picked the best French restaurant in the city, where reservations were usually required months in advance. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you there tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Rowan Dietrich took off her headset as soon as Jessa Bellamy ended her latest call, uttered the filthiest words she knew, and then dialed Drew\u2019s private number.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d he answered in a mocking, childish whine, \u201cI told you not to call me at work anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait till your father comes home,\u201d she said, keeping up the joke with her best stern-parent tone. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d A brief crackle of static came over the line as Drew switched on his encryption unit. \u201cWe\u2019re clear, little mama. Is it her?\u201d</p><p>She could have lied and said no, and Drew would have believed her. She wanted to. But the thing was out of her hands now. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s her. She\u2019s scheduled to be taken at Cecile\u2019s tomorrow afternoon. One o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat soon?\u201d He sucked in a breath. \u201cMaybe we should reconsider this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t up for a vote, Andrew,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThey want her, we take her. It\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s what you do, when you\u2019re not jerking off.\u201d</p><p>His tone flattened. \u201cAnything else for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides a spot right next to me when we burn in hell for this? Not really.\u201d She slammed down the phone.</p><p>She went upstairs, more to get away from the communications center than anything, and wandered through the dark corridors On a good day she could spend hours going through the rooms, looking at all the beautiful old stuff in them, and imagining what it must have been like to live in the place. When Matthias was out of town, she sometimes dressed in one of the old gowns she\u2019d found in the attic, and served herself tea in the Dove Room.</p><p>There, with the sunlight streaming through the blue, white, and green bits of stained glass framing the windows, she could forget who she was. There she played the lady, one who didn\u2019t know what it was to sleep on a park bench, or wash in the sink of a public restroom, or beg for handouts at the back door of a restaurant kitchen. No one looking at her could see the tats under the long, fragile satin sleeves, or the scars everywhere else. They\u2019d never guess she was trash.</p><p>Rowan checked the windows and doors out of habit before walking out into the garage. She wasn\u2019t supposed to leave when she manned the fort by herself, but she couldn\u2019t stand the silence, and she knew she wouldn\u2019t sleep, not after making that call. She got into her Jeep and drove out onto the narrow back road behind the house. From there it was fifteen minutes to her favorite watering hole, Weeping William\u2019s, where she sat in the shadows and watched some tubby tourists shoot lousy pool.</p><p>The bartender, an old stretch of skinny bones and dark coffee-colored skin, brought her Cherry Coke and a small bowl of pretzels. He had a long, thin birthmark on his left cheek that looked as if he were crying black tears. \u201cWhere you been, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking.\u201d She took a sip of the soda to ease her dry throat before glancing over at the football game being shown on the small color TV above the bar. \u201cHow\u2019s the team look this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcons? Shit.\u201d He drew out the last word with much-relished disgust. \u201cI can\u2019t even bring myself to bet against \u2019em, though I\u2019d likely clean up nicely. Where\u2019s your man tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of town.\u201d She felt a twinge of guilt. \u201cYou know he\u2019s my boss, not my man.\u201d</p><p>He leaned on his elbow. \u201cHoney, I seen you looking at him. That\u2019s not the way my waitresses look at me.\u201d</p><p>She moved her shoulders. \u201cThey\u2019re just afraid of your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, everyone is.\u201d He gave the framed picture of his wife, hung strategically over the cash register, a respectful nod. \u201cThat reminds me, Sally\u2019s been chewing my ear about having you over for supper again. She wants you to show her how to make that chocolate silk pie you brought for our Fourth of July barbecue.\u201d</p><p>Rowan loved visiting William and Sally. Their comfortable old house, set back on twenty-two acres of pine trees and marsh, was always filled with kids, grandkids, dogs, cats, and any other critter the boys could smuggle in. Sally would drag her into the kitchen the minute she arrived, and feed her bits of whatever she was cooking as they fiercely argued over every aspect of Southern versus Northern cooking.</p><p>\u201cYou might be a damn Yankee who doesn\u2019t know kale from collard greens,\u201d Sally said once, \u201cbut you the best natural cook I ever met. You should be seriously thinking about opening your own place, sugar.\u201d</p><p>The praise had embarrassed Rowan, but the pleasure of it had stayed with her for a long time. She did love to cook, and sometimes daydreamed about having a little caf\u00e9 somewhere. But it would never happen, not in this lifetime. Reality had eaten up all the delicious dreams of her youth, and spit out only what it couldn\u2019t grind down and swallow: her spine, her hard head, and her battle-scarred heart.</p><p>\u201cHey, how \u2019bout you stay over this weekend and come fishing with me and the boys in the morning?\u201d William was asking. \u201cFound us a sweet little spot out by north side of the island. Coulda filled my cooler three times over by daybreak.\u201d</p><p>If everything went according to plan, Rowan wasn\u2019t going anywhere until the end of October. \u201cI\u2019ve got to haul some stuff up north for my boss,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone for a couple weeks. Maybe when I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho you talking to, Willie?\u201d One of the lousy pool players came over and peered at Rowan. \u201cYour girlfriend?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah.\u201d William tossed his bar rag over his shoulder. \u201cShe my bouncer.\u201d</p><p>The pool player laughed. \u201cThis cute little thing?\u201d</p><p>Rowan could tolerate being called a lot of things\u2014even a whore, since she\u2019d almost been one\u2014but little? Cute? She might look as if she were still in high school, but she was damned if she\u2019d be treated as if she were.</p> <p>She slid off the barstool, startling the laughing man when he saw she stood a head taller than him. \u201cYou wanna play me a game?\u201d She rolled up her sleeves, showing the twin black-and-red dragon tattoos scrolled around her forearms. \u201cFifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>The man glanced back at his friends before he inspected her, from her short, shaggy mop of brown curls to her scuffed sneakers. \u201cSure, kid.\u201d He eyed her small breasts and long torso, but it was her arm art that made him lick his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll even let you break.\u201d</p><p>William glared at Rowan. \u201cYou ain\u2019t playing him, Ro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, old man,\u201d the player assured him. \u201cI\u2019ll take it easy on her.\u201d He leered at Rowan. \u201cUnless you like it rough, sweetie pie.\u201d</p><p>She dug her wallet out of her back pocket, pulled out two twenties and a ten, and slapped them on the bar, watching her opponent until he did the same.</p> <p>William put an empty shot glass over the bills. \u201cI can\u2019t watch this again.\u201d He retreated to the far end of the bar.</p><p>Rowan chose a cue from the wall case, racked the billiard balls at the end of the table, and chalked the tip of her cue. Her opponent and his friends gathered around behind her, and when she bent over she heard a low murmur and snickering sounds.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to admire my fine ass, boys,\u201d she said as she set up the shot, \u201cfirst you\u2019d best get out the way of my stick.\u201d</p><p>The first ball she sank was an easy one; they actually cheered her on. The second she dropped with a bank shot quieted them down. They fell silent when the third and fourth balls knocked each other into opposing corner pockets. As she took each shot, the red eyes and scales of her dragon tats caught the light and gleamed beneath the fine sheen of sweat that formed on her skin. Beneath the ink covering her right arm, however, something else gave off a different glow, and when she saw the glimmer of blue through the black she jerked down her sleeve.</p><p>Five minutes later she had cleared the table and finished the job by tapping the eight ball so gently that it drifted into the side pocket.</p><p>\u201cGood game.\u201d Rowan walked past the gaping men, replaced the cue, and went to the bar to collect her winnings. Her opponent reached her in time to grab her wrist and hold the folded bills in her fist between them.</p> <p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t hustling me, jailbait,\u201d he said in a low, ugly voice. \u201cYou put the money back down and we\u2019ll do this two outta three. And I\u2019ll break this time.\u201d</p><p>Rowan stared down at his sweaty face. \u201cThe bet was one game, fifty bucks. I won. Let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, you pushing it.\u201d William called from the other end of the bar. \u201cYou turn her loose afore things get outta hand.\u201d</p><p>The loser gave him an impatient look. \u201cWhat are you gonna do, old man? Jump on over here and kick my ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rowan dropped the bills, which fluttered to the floor. When he looked down, she grabbed the back of his hair and rammed his face into the knee she lifted. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He toppled over, clutching his bleeding nose and uttering muffled, hoarse sounds. Rowan faced his friends, who did the wise thing and backed away. She bent down to check his injury and the amount of blood he was leaking onto the floor before she picked up the money.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been jailbait for a good three years,\u201d she told him before she straightened and addressed his friends. \u201cHis nose is gonna be sore, but it\u2019s not broken. Wrap some ice in a washcloth and hold it on; that should keep the swelling down.\u201d</p><p>Before she left the bar, she handed William a twenty. \u201cSee you when I get back. Give Sally a kiss for me.\u201d She glanced back at the tourists. \u201cSorry about the blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He pocketed the tip. \u201cNext time, you mopping it up.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Bradford Lawson spent the morning with his personal trainer at the club, where he worked on his abs and obliques before swimming a hundred laps in the pool. Since he\u2019d turned thirty he\u2019d stopped taking his fitness for granted and spent a minimum of three hours each day improving it.</p><p>The results showed in the sleek pads of hard muscle all over his body, but he remained dissatisfied. Physical exercise helped burn off the extra calories from the gourmet food and rare wine he liked to consume, but it took too much time and effort. Fortunately his trainer also provided him with injections that maximized the benefits of his workouts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking real good, Mr. Lawson,\u201d the trainer said as he drew out the needle and pressed a cotton ball over the dot of blood that appeared. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired and wet.\u201d Lawson closed his eyes and rested his head against the tile wall of the locker room as the booster streamed through him. The heavy, pleasant effect of the drugs faded after only a few seconds. \u201cI need another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about that,\u201d the trainer said, closing his case. \u201cYou\u2019ve been asking for a lot of doubles lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mix I use is special, you know, best-quality stuff.\u201d The trainer\u2019s tone grew tentative. \u201cThing is, see, it\u2019s real easy to get hooked on it. I think we should scale back the shots for a couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>He opened one eye. \u201cYou think we should.\u201d</p><p>The other man shifted his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cYou hired me to look after you. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Lawson chuckled. \u201cIn a couple of months I won\u2019t need you or your shit. But until then, you\u2019ll do what I tell you. Now give me another one, and do it fast.\u201d</p><p>The trainer shook his head. \u201cSomething happens to you, and word gets around, I could lose a lot more than my job.\u201d</p><p>Lawson got up from the bench and walked up until he was nose to nose with the trainer.</p><p>\u201cNothing is going to happen to me,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t shut your fucking mouth and give me another shot, I\u2019ll pop your head like a rotten grape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what I mean,\u201d the trainer said through white lips. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep boosting like this. You\u2019ll go off the deep end and kill someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know my limits, but all right. I\u2019ll cut back.\u201d He adjusted the collar of the trainer\u2019s polo shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve got to close a major deal today, though, and I\u2019m not walking in there feeling like this. So you give me another one now, and tomorrow we\u2019ll drop it down to a half dose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. You mean it?\u201d</p><p>Lawson nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The other man opened his case and took out a filled syringe. He extended Lawson\u2019s arm, tied a length of rubber tubing above the elbow, and tapped the inside bend until a vein rose up beneath the skin and he could administer the injection. \u201cThere you go.\u201d He removed the needle and turned to retrieve a cap.</p><p>Lawson brought his fist down on the base of the man\u2019s skull with enough force to drop him facedown on the slate floor. He picked up the case, checked the contents, and carried it over to his locker. As he dressed, the second injection refreshed and calmed him, so that when he went over to the stirring, groaning man he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fired. Find another place to work.\u201d Lawson carried the case out with him.</p><p>From the car he called ahead to Cecile\u2019s to confirm his reservation for lunch, and asked to speak to his usual waiter.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting a lady for lunch at one,\u201d he told the waiter. \u201cI\u2019d like her to have the chef\u2019s special. Perhaps you could meet me on your break to discuss the presentation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Will the lady need a ride home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glanced at the case on the passenger\u2019s seat beside him. \u201cShe\u2019ll be coming back to the office with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s to be taken today,\u201d Matthias repeated, to be sure he hadn\u2019t misheard Rowan.</p><p>\u201cAt one o\u2019clock, at this French restaurant.\u201d She recited an address. \u201cThat gives you about three hours, unless you want to change your mind and back out.\u201d</p><p>He finished writing down the address before he replied, \u201cWhy is she to be taken so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Drew has nothing on paper. But for it to go down like this, the order had to come from Genaro himself.\u201d She hesitated, and then said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to change your mind about doing this, are you? I don\u2019t think I can drive down there in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would take her yourself?\u201d He didn\u2019t know whether to feel amused or dismayed. \u201cShe would know who you were and what you intended from the moment she touched you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Jessa Bellamy would never lay a finger on me.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like rushing this way, Matthias. It\u2019s happening too fast. None of us are ready for her.\u201d</p><p>He was, since the moment he\u2019d entered the park last night. \u201cWe will make it do.\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cRent two more cars for me. Attend to the doors and the harnesses and then have them delivered to the second and third drop points.\u201d</p><p>She took in a sharp breath. \u201cYou\u2019re going to drive her out yourself? Is that really wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no time to bring in the others.\u201d He started the engine of his car. \u201cDo what you can to prepare for her there. I will contact you once I\u2019m in position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>Matthias drove downtown, stopping first at Jessa Bellamy\u2019s offices to check the lot for her car, which was parked in an end space. According to Rowan, she would meet Bradford Lawson at the restaurant, but he checked the signal of the GPS transmitter he\u2019d planted to be sure it remained strong and steady. If she changed her mind about the meeting, or for some reason bolted at the restaurant, he might have to pursue her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He found a space on the next block over that allowed him an unobstructed view of the lot beside Jessa\u2019s office where she kept her car, and parked there in order to pull up a map of the streets and businesses surrounding Cecile\u2019s. The large restaurant occupied a corner lot and offered valet but no public parking. Another concern was how he would remove Jessa from the premises. He called Drew and had him pull the building blueprints to check how many ways he might enter and leave the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cOn the plans I see two access doors and two emergency exits,\u201d Drew said. \u201cYou can go in through the front and walk straight through the kitchen out to the back. The alley has only one exit, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need two ways to leave so that if one is blocked, I can use the other.\u201d Matthias consulted the map. \u201cI think I will take her from the front. I will need the car close.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe valet isn\u2019t going to let you park anywhere in front of the place,\u201d Drew said. \u201cYour best bet to get her out that way is to do a snatch and run: Pull up, leave the engine running, yell to the valet something about your wife being sick, go in, grab her, drug her, carry her back out, toss her in the car, and go.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound simple, when Matthias knew it would be anything but that.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken my lunch hour yet,\u201d Drew mentioned. \u201cI could run over there, give you some backup.\u201d</p><p>Matthias grunted. \u201cIf you are seen, they will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I avoid the fieldwork,\u201d he said, his tone wry. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can pull this off by yourself. It\u2019s too public. Too many things can go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlace a call to Lawson at one fifteen,\u201d Matthias said finally. \u201cThat is when I will go in after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Keep your gloves on,\u201d Drew said before he hung up.</p><p>Matthias watched the lot until he saw Jessa Bellamy emerge from the building and walk to her car. She wore another plain suit, this one a green so dark at first glance it looked black. Between her lapels a vee of emerald cloth and a flat length of golden chain gleamed. Another glint of gold at the back of her head came from the long, plain comb holding her jet-black hair in a smooth roll.</p><p>She looked serious and sedate and strikingly beautiful.</p><p>This time Matthias saw that she carried a briefcase instead of a purse, and when she slid on a pair of sunglasses he noted that she had once more donned her black gloves. She would not use her ability on her clients unless she had a reason to, he thought. That would prove helpful to him as well, for if she touched him with her bare hands, her ability might make her see that he had come to take her.</p><p>He reached for the pack he had left in the backseat, and set it in the space between the front seats. As Jessa Bellamy drove out of the lot, he rolled up his sleeves and strapped thin, flexible sheaths to his forearms before sliding his daggers into them and covering them again. Rowan had also packed a coin-size pressure dart that he could hold and hide in his hand, but after looking at it for a moment he placed it in his pocket. He would use it if he had to, but not unless things went wrong inside the restaurant.</p> <p>His remote receiver showed Jessa\u2019s car to be a safe distance ahead now, so he pulled out of the parking space and followed her. She took the most direct route to Cecile\u2019s, which convinced him that she had no suspicions of what was planned for her. That would make things easier for him, but more difficult later, when the time came to tell her why she had been taken.</p><p>As he maneuvered through midday traffic, he put his hand in his pocket and held the pressure dart between his fingers, turning it over and over.</p><p>Not long now, my lovely one.</p><p>Jessa surrendered her keys to the young valet parking attendant, who handed her a numbered stub and an admiring look.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your meal, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said as he went around the back of her car.</p><p>She\u2019d land the largest contract she\u2019d ever been offered first, Jessa decided as she went into the restaurant. Then she\u2019d enjoy the food.</p><p>She was met in a quiet foyer by a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 in an elegant day suit, who greeted her as if she were the first lady before asking for her name. When she gave it, he smiled and told her that her party had already been seated. She checked her watch before she followed him into the main dining room, but she wasn\u2019t late\u2014in fact, she was five minutes early, as she\u2019d planned to be.</p><p>Cecile\u2019s owners had made quite a splash when they had moved their four-star restaurant from Paris to Atlanta, for they had insisted on bringing the antique furnishings, kitchen equipment, and even the draperies from the original location with them. After some wrangling with OSHA over building codes and licensing requirements, they adapted their expectations to the demands of doing business in the States, and then proceeded to dominate the downtown fine-dining scene.</p> <p>Jessa had never been to Paris, but Cecile\u2019s did the impossible by bringing the city to her. Deep, rich burgundy velvet had been gathered and draped to frame sheer panels of port wine organdy, embroidered with ivory and amber threads, covering the windows and gentling the afternoon glare of the sun. The carpeting, a series of old Turkish rugs, formed a graceful patchwork and disappeared under delicate floor-length ecru lace table linens. The cherry wood chairs, comfortably upholstered with champagne-and-pink tapestry cushions, gleamed with polish and years of loving handling.</p><p>The air brought a complex bouquet to her nose: the light florals from the vases of fresh flowers, fragrant beeswax from the tapers of the same in the old brass wall sconces, and the effervescent fruitiness of the champagne sparkling in dozens of flutes.</p><p>Couples and small groups occupied every table, talking and smiling over crackled porcelain plates as they politely devoured their meals. Jessa spotted red-brown game hens braised with wine and shallots, brilliant red lobster garnished with fanciful shapes in shimmering aspic, and delicate pastel souffl\u00e9s that seemed to float on the fork. Not a wineglass stood empty\u2014the owners were French, after all\u2014and no patron had to summon his or her waiter, for they were attended as carefully as blue-blooded royalty. Some of them, she suspected as she noticed some famous faces, probably were the American equivalent.</p><p>Walking through this shrine to haute cuisine, Jessa thought of the tasteless microwave dinner she\u2019d picked at last night and felt almost ashamed. She might not be as rich, powerful, or influential as the people who dined regularly at Cecile\u2019s, but she had been raised to appreciate well-prepared food. While living alone made cooking seem like an utter waste of time, she could certainly dust off her saut\u00e9 pan and rice steamer once in a while and toss together something fresh.</p><p>The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 approached one of the tables set in a discreet corner, where a good-looking man sat reading a single-page menu card. She\u2019d seen his Italian suit before, on a hip young movie star posing at the last big Hollywood red carpet event, but despite the overtly trendy cut, the dark brown jacket and camel trousers emphasized his even tan and professionally streaked hair. As he stood, the fit of his jacket changed enough to hint at a well-developed physique. She also noticed how short he had cut his nails; Angela did the same thing to avoid her lifelong habit of biting them.</p><p>Determined, up with the latest fashions, and something of a body peacock summed up her initial impression of Bradford Lawson.</p><p>He showed her the perfectly even teeth of a boyhood spent in braces. \u201cGood afternoon, Ms. Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Lawson.\u201d Jessa returned his smile, relieved that he didn\u2019t also offer the traditional business handshake. She\u2019d removed the gloves she always wore whenever she was out in public before arriving\u2014September was cool, but not enough to justify wearing leather gloves throughout a meal.</p><p>Avoiding his touch was a business necessity. In the past she had considered using her ability on potential clients as well as the people they hired her to investigate, but she felt she had to draw the line somewhere. If she looked into the dark side of every soul, she knew someday she\u2019d end up thinking about visiting the roof of the Bank of America building herself.</p><p>As she sat down, she saw he\u2019d nearly finished a cocktail, and wondered if her watch battery had run down. \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t been waiting long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. My previous meeting was canceled at the last minute, so I got here a little earlier than I expected.\u201d He motioned to a waiter, who trotted over to offer her a menu card. After he placed his order for one of the steak entr\u00e9es, he turned to her. \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>Jessa needed a clear head. \u201cWater, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have an excellent cellar here, and as it happens, one of my favorite chardonnays,\u201d Lawson mentioned. \u201cI think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d He told the waiter to bring a bottle.</p><p>Jessa wasn\u2019t accustomed to being overruled, even as smoothly as Lawson had done it, but she\u2019d met enough corporate alpha males to recognize a deliberate show of gender dominance. Lawson might want women to admire his body, but he liked ordering them around better.</p><p>\u201cJust a small glass for me,\u201d she told the waiter, surprised to see his strained expression. Her gaze shifted to the rings of underarm sweat darkening his otherwise crisp white shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll also have the shrimp St. Jacques with the endive salad and the lemon-caper vinaigrette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, ma\u2019am.\u201d The waiter hurried off.</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019s not contagious,\u201d Lawson observed, watching the man disappear through the swinging doors to the kitchen before turning back to Jessa. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The service here is usually flawless.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cEveryone has a bad day at work now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at GenHance. Jonah Genaro, our CEO, is very particular about whom we hire. He wants only the top people in their fields.\u201d He sat back. \u201cNow let\u2019s talk about how Phoenix, Inc., can see to it that he actually gets them.\u201d</p><p>Matthias watched the dashboard clock as he drove through the streets around the French restaurant. At one fourteen, he took his pack, stowed it under his seat, and then turned the corner and moved into the right lane. He accelerated enough so that when he pulled in past the frowning valet and stopped, the car\u2019s tires squealed. He left the engine running as he shoved open the driver\u2019s-side door and got out, locking the door with his spare key\u2019s remote. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSir.\u201d The valet trotted over to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t park here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy employer came here to propose to his lady friend. I was to take the pictures, but traffic delayed me. If I do not go in right away, I will be fired.\u201d He handed over his business card. \u201cIt will take two minutes, I swear to you, and then I will go.\u201d</p><p>Thunder rumbled overhead, and dark clouds spread rapidly over them, casting heavy shadows as they blocked out the sun.</p> <p>The younger man glanced up and scowled. \u201cIt was supposed to be sunny all day.\u201d He barely looked at Matthias\u2019s card before he handed it back to him. \u201cI guess you can leave it there for a minute. Get back out here fast, though, buddy, or my boss\u2019ll call to have it towed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Matthias strode into the restaurant.</p><p>He had decided to modify Drew\u2019s suggestion of the snatch-and-grab to something that would cause no disturbance. Rather than playing the part of a frantic husband coming to the aid of an injured wife, he was now a tardy photographer trying to keep his job. As soon as he saw the well-dressed man in the foyer, he took out another card.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bradford Lawson called for me,\u201d he told the man. \u201cHe wishes to have some photographs taken of him and Ms. Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t allow photographs to be taken in the dining rooms without making arrangements in advance,\u201d the man told him.</p> <p>Outside the restaurant, the air flashed as lightning boomed nearby.</p><p>\u201cThe photographs I take will be of only Mr. Lawson and his companion, and they will appear in several of the city\u2019s newspapers,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cMr. Lawson is very fond of Cecile\u2019s, which of course will be mentioned prominently in the accompanying article.\u201d</p><p>The older man beamed. \u201cWell, I think this once we can make an exception for Mr. Lawson. He and the lady are seated in the corner to your left.\u201d</p><p>Matthias thanked him and walked into the dining room. Several of the patrons frowned at him as soon as they saw the camera hanging from the strap around his neck, but Matthias ignored them as he spotted his target.</p><p>Lawson had moved his chair out of place so that he could sit closer to Jessa, who was listening to him talk. Her expression seemed odd, almost slack, and her eyelids hung low over her eyes. Lawson put his arm around her shoulders and leaned close, speaking in a lower voice.</p><p>Matthias stopped in front of their table and lifted his camera. \u201cWould you care for a picture of you and your lady?\u201d</p> <p>Lawson glared up at him, and then muttered an obscenity as Jessa\u2019s head drooped and she slumped against his shoulder. \u201cNo, my friend isn\u2019t feeling well. Too much wine, I think.\u201d</p><p>A rushing sound distracted the patrons around Matthias, who looked at the rain drumming on the outside windows at the front of the restaurant.</p><p>A waiter standing nearby hurried forward. \u201cDo you need help escorting the lady out, Mr. Lawson?\u201d He bent over, his arms outstretched.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>That was the only word Lawson uttered before Jessa flung the steaming plate of seafood in front of her into his face. As he fell back, she produced a slim case and swung it, ramming one end into the waiter\u2019s midsection. He doubled over, his head bouncing as it hit the edge of the table before it drove him to his knees.</p><p>Lawson swore and grabbed at Jessa, grasping the sleeve and yoke of her jacket, holding her down. Lightning struck so close to the restaurant that the wineglasses and porcelain dishes on the tables rattled. Several women and a few men uttered startled, fearful cries.</p><p>Matthias dragged the table out of the way and shoved Lawson off his chair. As he went down, GenHance\u2019s director flung the wine in his hand, glass and all, into Matthias\u2019s face. He turned his head at the last moment, and the glass burst against the side of his skull, dousing him with the chilled liquid.</p><p>As he shook the fragments of crystal from his face, Jessa stepped around the waiter to face him. Her eyes, like tide pools in moonlight, were wide and clear. She had been playacting.</p> <p>\u201cGo through the front,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun.\u201d He gave her a push as Lawson got to his feet, a gun in his hand. Matthias stepped on the waiter, palming his second blade as he blocked her with his body.</p><p>\u201cFucking bitch,\u201d Lawson swore as he changed his aim from her back to Matthias\u2019s face.</p><p>Before he could fire, Matthias slashed his wrist with one dagger and hamstrung him with the other, the honed steel cutting so deep that Lawson screamed.</p><p>He turned and ran after Jessa, catching up with her just outside. She looked from one end of the street to the other, her eyes wild. The heavy downpour became furious, flattening her hair and saturating her clothes in the time it took for her to turn her head to see him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t make the mistake of touching her, but he stepped close so she could hear his voice over the rain.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he told her, and held out his hand, \u201cor you will die.\u201d</p><p>RomanRelics.com</p><p>The Official Web Site of Roman Relics Magazine</p><p>September 2008</p><p>Special Report:</p><p>Controversial Imperial Scroll Raises New</p><p>Questions about Roman General\u2019s Death</p><p>by Alphonso York</p><p>One of the more intriguing artifacts found among the hundreds recently unearthed at a parking lot construction site in Rome is the so-called \u201cGermanicus Scroll,\u201d a personal communication that may have been sent by the Roman army proconsul of the same name to his grandfather, Emperor Augustus, in the year 14 CE.</p><p>Inked on well-cured leather and preserved by not one but three different resin-sealed casings, the scroll offers a poignant account of Germanicus\u2019s ceremonial visit to Kalkriese in Lower Saxony, where ten years past thousands of Roman soldiers were ambushed and massacred by a rebellious German chieftain and his army of Cherusci warriors. Dated in the year 14 CE, the scroll when authenticated may serve as proof that the Roman general visited the site a full year earlier than historians have always claimed.</p><p>The scroll itself consists of one hundred two lines of script, divided into two columns. The text is written in the first person, apparently by the general\u2019s own hand, and contains references to several personages of the time, including a popular senator who was also a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the emperor\u2019s wife.</p><p>Written only a matter of weeks before Augustus died, the scroll offers a fascinating glimpse into the mind of the great Roman general as he recovered the remains of his fallen comrades from the battlefield. Even more tantalizing, however, are the hints regarding the mysterious fate of Germanicus\u2019s childhood friend, Tanicus, whom historians have always included among the casualties at Kalkriese.</p><p>Roman Relics has obtained for our readers a complete translation of the text, provided by Professor Angelo Calabrese of the University of Rome:</p><p>Nero Claudius Drusus, named Germanicus, to most beloved and glorious Augustus Caesar, divine son of Julius and protector of the Republic, many fond greetings and continuing prayers for your health.</p><p>You write to me, Grandfather, of your displeasure that I do not report more of my travels and deeds. Since you demand it of me, under your compulsion I shall relate what I would have happily concealed until I might return to Rome and advise you in my own voice.</p><p>I have brought the legions north, as you commanded, and three days past we came upon Kalkriese. I came so the men would see it and know what it is to be a soldier of Rome, and so that I might in your name offer prayers and pay homage. My second task was to search for the remains of Varus, as asked of me by his wife and daughters when last I visited them.</p><p>We followed that pathway though the wood between the great bog and the high hill. Remnants of the rampart in the turf at the base of the hill can yet be seen, and it chilled my heart to think that Arminius and his horde concealed themselves there to await the first column. A hundred paces across from it, one can still pluck from the ground the broken shafts of the spears they threw in vain, but they were close and there are not many.</p><p>Two days we rode on through the open country and reached that place where the final three legions sought refuge so they might stand the last against the horde. As we made our way there we saw signs of how they pushed through, ever under attack. The bodies of those who fell from the outside ranks marked the way for us, and my horse could go no more than a hundred paces before I saw another of our dead, slain and left to rot.</p><p>You cannot know what it is to see fourteen thousand dead. In your darkest imaginings there is no equal. Weather-bleached bones cover the open ground, scant few where men fleeing the ambush were brought down by their pursuers, but here and there again piled where the ranks stood their ground back-to-back.</p><p>As we entered the woods, we saw skulls pegged to the trunks of every tree within our sight, a thousand and more, their hollow eye sockets staring at us in empty reproach. Others who had come here before me claimed that Arminius hanged them as a warning to us, that Rome may never again invade Germania. It proves useless on me; I can feel only rage that Romans were used for such a thing, and that no one thought to remove them and consign them to the flames.</p><p>My aide worried me with how we might know which belonged to Varus, and then the scout returned and called us to follow into the groves ahead. So we rode on, and now I must tell you: the years I have spent on the frontier have accustomed my eyes to sights of such barbarism that I should not have blinked. But who among us could have expected to see still standing the altars where the captives were made sacrifice?</p><p>The tribesman fashioned the altars from the armor hacked from the remains of the fallen. They did not concern themselves with removing the arms and legs and chests still within; they stacked and bound them together as they were taken, and used whole bodies roped together to serve as platforms. The flesh of these poor brothers has long gone, but their bones remain to give testimony. Upon these obscene mounds of flesh and iron, Arminius and his wretches laid out the finest soldiers ever to serve the Republic, and butchered them in more ways than I may tell you, and so they piled others atop them, again and again, until no more could fit, and another altar was made to be built. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt no peace, Grandfather, until we discovered in a hollow well hidden from the groves the untouched bodies of Varus and his staff. The reports brought out of Germania by those few who escaped were true. In the end the sons of Rome came together as brothers, united by their determination to die as they had lived, with courage and honor. The bones of their hands still clasp the hilt of each sword; their bodies still cradle the blade upon which each ended his life. Glad I am that they did not fall to the Cherusci, but had the heart and spine to do what every man dreads.</p><p>In shame I wept as I sent my men to collect the bones of our valiant fellows. We give them a funeral pyre this night, and I have sworn to return after the campaign to recover and send all of our dead to their rest. For now my priests consecrate the ground and entreat the gods to richly reward our noble dead. It pains me that I cannot remain here long enough to attend properly to all of them.</p><p>My only other regret is that I have found no proof of Septus Janus Genarius\u2019s claim that my friend and blade brother Tanicus accompanied Varus or died with him here. I know it possible that he was taken prisoner with the thousand sold into slavery, but my heart insists that, like Varus, he would have fallen on his blade before accepting the yoke. I never believed the tale that he remained in Germania in secret so that he might spy upon the barbarians, not for thirteen years with no word to us or his family. I will have council when I return from the frontier, and perhaps then the senator may be persuaded to speak more on the matter. He has always claimed that he himself escaped the barbarians when they killed Varus and his commanders. Now that we have proof that they took the only honorable course, the senator must explain why he did not do the same.</p> <p>If we are to erase the memory of what was done here, we must push on beyond the boundaries of the great river. These rebels must be shown what Rome is. I implore you in the names of Mars and Varus to speak to the senate and make this clear to them, especially Genarius, who continues to press you to recall our legions marching north so that Rome might not anger the tribes.</p><p>We cannot allow this massacre to go unanswered, Grandfather. If we do, then Rome will fall.</p><p>(Seal of) Germanicus</p><p>Dr. Calabrese strongly believes that the scroll may never have been delivered to the emperor, as it was found with its original seals intact. The professor is currently attempting to locate the construction site on available maps of the ancient city in order to determine ownership and possibly identify who buried it.</p><p>For more on this two-thousand-year-old mystery, pick up the latest issue of Roman Relics magazine, available at fine bookstores and newsstands near you.</p> <p>STORY UPDATE:</p><p>Controversial Imperial Scroll</p><p>Proven to Be Forgery</p><p>by Alphonso York</p><p>The so-called \u201cGermanicus Scroll,\u201d an intact first-century imperial scroll believed to be recovered from a parking lot construction site in Rome, has been proven to be a forgery by American experts who were given permission to examine it. After a second examination, a team of Italian experts has agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe forgery was very well-done, but upon closer inspection we found we were able to confirm the Americans\u2019 findings,\u201d Geno Zanella, the leader of the Italian team, told reporters. \u201cThis scroll was made in the last few weeks, not two thousand years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The American experts, whose trip to Rome was underwritten by a grant from biotech corporation GenHance, Inc., made no comment about their scandalous revelations, and released their findings and test results before they left Italy to return to the States.</p><p>RomanRelics.com attempted to reach Professor Angelo Calabrese at the University of Rome for his comments, only to be told by university officials that the professor has been missing since the forgery was exposed. The president of the university about Calabrese\u2019s abrupt disappearance: \u201cAngelo was the most honest of men. If he said the scroll was genuine, it was. You can be sure he will explain everything as soon as he returns.\u201d</p><p>Another colleague, who wished to remain anonymous, had this to say about the scandal: \u201cI think those Americans tampered with the find. They might even have switched the scroll with a counterfeit in order to steal it from us.\u201d When asked why Professor Calabrese vanished on the day the forgery was made public, the anonymous colleague said, \u201cHe was the only one who had worked with the scroll. I think they had him killed to cover up the theft.\u201d</p><p>At the time of this update, police in Rome were still investigating the matter.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The violent storm confused Jessa as much as what had happened in the restaurant. There hadn\u2019t been a cloud in the sky when she\u2019d left the office\u2014and not the slightest hint that Bradford Lawson had intended to drug her and abduct her. Now this strange man had come after her and uttered some nonsense about her dying.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jessa stared into beautiful, angry eyes the color of old jade. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenHance,\u201d the man told her. Tall and powerfully built, he stood like a prizefighter ready to throw a punch, his chin down, his arms bent, his hands fists. \u201cThey brought you here to take you. To kill you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d Jessa backed away from him. \u201cGet away from me.\u201d She turned toward the valet. \u201cCall the police\u2014\u201d The man bent over, shoving his shoulder into her belly almost as hard as she\u2019d hit the waiter with her case. Before she could recover or fight him off he upended her over his shoulder and ran with her twisting, kicking body to the car. Screaming for help, she struggled frantically, but he simply pulled her off him as if she were no more than a rag doll and flung her inside.</p><p>She landed on her side in the passenger\u2019s seat. Before she could push herself upright he clamped his right arm across her heaving form, slammed shut the driver\u2019s door, and drove out into traffic.</p><p>\u201cLet me out of here!\u201d She tried to free herself, clawing and pushing at his arm before grabbing at the door handle, which wouldn\u2019t move. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to safety,\u201d he said, weaving in and out of the traffic lanes with terrifying speed. \u201cI\u2019m saving your life.\u201d</p><p>The back of the car skidded on the wet road, fishtailing for a second before the man quickly righted it.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t drive like this.\u201d She pushed at his arm. \u201cThe rain is flooding the roads. We\u2019ll crash.\u201d</p><p>He checked the rearview mirror. \u201cBetter to crash, then.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to calm down, catching her breath as she looked at the interior of the car. The lock on the door had also been removed, and the windows of the car had been tinted almost black.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot get out,\u201d he told her, shifting his arm and reaching for something on her other side. \u201cThere is nothing you can use as a weapon. I will not harm you.\u201d As the traffic on the road ahead of them thinned, he leaned over her and pulled a funny-looking seat belt over her, clipping it into place.</p><p>She glanced down and saw the dark stains on his dripping sleeves. She almost asked him if he\u2019d been shot before she recalled the flash of steel she\u2019d seen in his hand. \u201cDid you stab Lawson?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>The matter-of-fact tone he used made her stomach roll. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pointed his weapon at my face.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cHe would have shot me. He would have done the same to anyone else who came between him and you. Then he would have shot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Bradford Lawson is a businessman.\u201d She pushed the wet tangle of her hair back from her eyes. \u201cHe works for one of the largest biotech firms in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t asking her; he was agreeing. Maybe she could talk him out of whatever he had planned. \u201cThen you must know he has no reason to shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he has many reasons. He was sent to take you,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey need you, but not alive. The drugs were the usual measure, but shooting you would have stopped you and made you easier to transport.\u201d</p><p>He sounded delusional, but she realized something else\u2014he wasn\u2019t American. She couldn\u2019t place his accent, but his careful English and the words he used made it clear that he wasn\u2019t speaking his native language. He might come from a country where violent confrontations were normal events.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken.\u201d she said, as gently as she could. \u201cA lot of Americans carry guns for protection. He probably took it out as soon as he saw you with your knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnives,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI had two.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cThen you can understand how that might have frightened him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took out the gun after you put your food in his face.\u201d He paused as he made a quick, tight right turn. \u201cI drew my blades only when I saw the weapon in his hand.\u201d</p><p>She was reasoning with a seriously disturbed man, and that required another deep breath. \u201cWith everything happening all at once, maybe it seemed that way to you, but I\u2019m sure it was the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it was not,\u201d he countered. \u201cYou knew he meant to take you before I came to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first saw you, you were making a pretense of being drugged,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou knew what he had planned before I reached you. You used my interruption as an opportunity to escape him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about his plans.\u201d Her fingers hurt, and she looked down to see she had them laced so tightly together that all the joints had turned white. She forced herself to relax her hands. \u201cI knew only that the waiter drugged the wine.\u201d</p><p>His mouth hitched. \u201cHow did you know this? Did he whisper it to you? Did he pass you a note?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t know, but he sounded as if he did. \u201cI tasted it when I took a sip,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cThat was a remarkable feat,\u201d he said, \u201cas the drugs Lawson uses have no taste.\u201d</p><p>He was toying with her. \u201cLook, mister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Gaven Matthias.\u201d</p><p>Why was he telling her his name? \u201cGaven, I\u2019m Jessa.\u201d Maybe he was some sort of deranged Good Samaritan who would respond better to some assurances\u2014not that she planned to keep them. \u201cI appreciate what you did back there. It was very heroic of you to risk your life for me. But you have to pull over and let me out now. I won\u2019t report you to the police, I promise.\u201d At least that much was true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLying to me and yourself will not change what has happened. Lawson was sent to take you, and you know it.\u201d He gave her a quick sidelong look. \u201cNow that he has failed, others will be sent. Professionals this time. They will go to your office and your home. They will watch your employees and your friends.\u201d</p><p>Her throat tightened. \u201cI\u2019ll call the police\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy now Lawson has reported you to them,\u201d he said, startling her again. \u201cHe will say that you arranged to have me attack him. That you are with me now. That we are armed, dangerous. The police will begin to search for us. They will block roads. They will issue warnings to the people. They will use the television.\u201d</p> <p>She went rigid. \u201cIf you know he\u2019ll do that, then you had to be in on it.\u201d</p><p>He stopped at a red light and turned to face her. \u201cYou are not the first to be taken. Nor will you be the last.\u201d</p><p>Now he was going to tell her how many women he\u2019d murdered, and how he planned to kill her. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenHance has. Many times.\u201d He saw the light turn green and returned his attention to the road.</p><p>Every book she\u2019d ever read featuring a serial killer had a scene like this, Jessa thought. The newly abducted victim, bound and helpless, begged for her freedom. The satisfied killer ignored her pleas or mocked her. So far Matthias had ignored every request she\u2019d made, and his cryptic statements could easily double as taunts. Even his assurance that he was taking her to safety didn\u2019t make her feel any better.</p> <p>The safety might be for him rather than her.</p><p>The seat belt he\u2019d pulled over her had three straps instead of two, which crisscrossed tightly over her from shoulder to waist. When she tried to loosen them, she discovered they had no give, and the belt clip on her left had no release button.</p><p>She was trapped, as surely as she had been in the restaurant. \u201cIf you really want to help me, Gaven, then please take this belt off me. It\u2019s too tight and I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her as he drove onto the ramp leading to the expressway. \u201cIf that were so, you would be unconscious by now.\u201d</p><p>He was the last man on earth Jessa wanted to touch, but if she knew what he had done in the past, she could be ready for what he intended to do to her. Working an arm out from under the restraining straps, she reached over and clamped her hand over his.</p><p>Shadowlight.</p> <p>A cutting wind scoured her face with tiny, stinging ice crystals, and she had to squint against the blinding intensity of white light. Taking a breath was the same thing as being stabbed in the lungs. Buried to midcalf in fresh, powdery snow, she felt her feet go numb.</p><p>The blizzard didn\u2019t allow her to see much of her surroundings, but she was outside, alone, and so cold her body shivered with the helplessness of someone having a seizure. If Matthias were here, she couldn\u2019t see him, but she slogged forward, wrenching her legs up and down, pitching forward as the snowdrifts collapsed under her weight. She landed on her hands and knees, and then she saw the vague shape of a man fighting through the snow ahead of her.</p><p>He struggled to stay upright against the wind. Under his arm he carried something, a snowy bundle too small to be a body but too large to be his laundry. The ice-encrusted scarf wrapped around his head covered all but his eyes, but it was Gaven Matthias. She could feel him as surely as she felt the wind and cold.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read his thoughts, however. His mind seemed wiped clean of everything but staying on his feet and taking the next step.</p><p>Jessa heard thunder, and what sounded like a low-flying jet over her head, and looked up. That was when the bomb went off, exploding with enough force to scatter the violent wind and create a momentary window of visibility. She could see the top of a ridge with an enormous shelf of snow that seemed to be rising higher.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until several smaller bombs went off and a cloud of white billowed at the base of the ridge that she realized the mountain was not rising but that the shelf of snow was sliding down, all of it at once\u2014on top of her.</p><p>Jessa flung up an arm as the first chunks of snow crust pelted her, as hard as thrown rocks, and then a white ocean roared over her, lifting and rolling her, flinging her against tree trunks and bouncing her off boulders before it swallowed her whole.</p><p>As a crushing weight settled over her, her thoughts became a jumble of disbelief: Snow? Mountains? Not Atlanta. Where? Where is he? What did he do?</p> <p>Her fingers slipped away from the disembodied hand she held, and she was glad. She didn\u2019t want to see the airless void of white anymore. But the cold that bit into her aching body didn\u2019t retreat, and the grinding weight pressing over her didn\u2019t ease.</p><p>The sunlight never came.</p><p>After speaking to Cecile\u2019s owners about the incident involving Lawson and his latest acquisition, and assuring them he would pay for all the damages they had incurred, Jonah Genaro called for his car. Before he left the office, he confirmed that Delaporte was dealing with the witnesses and the evidence left at the scene. Fortunately the waiter and Lawson had been removed by Lawson\u2019s driver and taken for medical treatment to a private hospital owned by one of his subsidiaries, or he doubted he could have kept the police from becoming involved.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty of posting retrieval teams at Bellamy\u2019s office and home,\u201d Delaporte added. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t surfaced yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTap every phone line and have Riordan run a sweep for her mobile,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cMonitor her personal and business bank accounts and credit card activity. She\u2019ll need money to flee the state. Have you identified the male accomplice at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, sir, but we\u2019re still interviewing the witnesses. Descriptions indicate he\u2019s a white male, early to mid-thirties, casually dressed and carrying a camera. The valet said he identified himself as a photographer Mr. Lawson called to the restaurant to take photos of him and Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>Had Bradford Lawson staged this entire incident in order to blackmail him, or grab Bellamy for himself? Genaro felt his temper rise. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Bradford. Send additional men out to keep Bellamy\u2019s employees under surveillance. Use whatever means are necessary. I want her brought in before morning.\u201d</p><p>At the hospital emergency room, a nervous charge nurse led him back to the treatment room, where two physicians were attending to Lawson, who was fighting restraints and raving.</p><p>Genaro\u2019s suspicions that his director had staged the incident for his own purposes or profit faded. From the amount of blood spattering the gurney, Lawson, the two physicians, and the floor, whoever had attacked Lawson had not been playacting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d he asked the senior physician.</p><p>\u201cHe has two knife wounds, one serious,\u201d the doctor replied. \u201cThe rage seems to be chemically induced, possibly from cocaine and steroid abuse. We\u2019re running a tox screen to confirm. He won\u2019t allow us to bandage him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d he told the doctors, who reluctantly withdrew. When the door closed, he approached the gurney and stood over Lawson. \u201cBradford. What happened today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think happened?\u201d Lawson snarled back, jerking at the straps holding him down. \u201cThat sorry bitch knew, Jonah. She knew before she got there. She brought protection with her and the fucker cut me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl yourself.\u201d When he didn\u2019t, Genaro wrapped his hand over Lawson\u2019s wrist wound and tightened his fist until the younger man howled. \u201cDo I have your attention now, Bradford?\u201d</p><p>He groaned a yes.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He eased back on his hold. \u201cPull yourself together and tell me everything that happened this afternoon at Cecile\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>As Lawson sullenly related the details of his meeting with Jessa Bellamy and how it had suddenly and inexplicably gone wrong, Genaro silently studied both of his wounds. The photographer who had attacked his employee had great skill with a blade; he had effectively crippled Lawson with two meticulously placed slashes but had not bothered to follow either with a jab to the heart or a major artery. Given the circumstances, the man who had come to Jessa Bellamy\u2019s rescue had intended to disarm and disable, not kill.</p><p>That made it almost certain that he was not a photographer.</p><p>\u201cDid the man have a military haircut, or use government-issued blades?\u201d he asked Lawson when he had finished his tale.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t military. The bastard\u2019s knives were strange. Old-looking.\u201d He shifted his leg. \u201cFuck. Maybe handmade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about an accent? German? South African?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not American. Maybe Dutch. He went right for my gun and my fucking leg, the cocksucker.\u201d He squinted up at Genaro. \u201cHe had a tat on the left side of his neck. Black, maybe a snake.\u201d</p><p>He went still. \u201cWhat shape was the snake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like a number eight, maybe. But sideways.\u201d</p><p>After grilling Lawson for another ten minutes, taking care to get a full description of the photographer, he released his wrist and went to the sink in the corner to wash the blood from his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhen you find her, I want her first,\u201d Lawson demanded. \u201cAll I need is a room, some cuffs, and eight hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBradford, you\u2019re not in any condition to deal with Ms. Bellamy.\u201d He reached for some paper towels and carefully dried his hands before turning back to him. \u201cLet the doctors finish working on you and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me here like this,\u201d Lawson raged. \u201cNot after what she did. She planned this, Jonah. She knew I was coming for her. Someone warned her. Just have them sew me up and let me out of here, and I\u2019ll find that fucking cunt myself.\u201d</p><p>Genaro found it interesting that Lawson\u2019s rage centered on Jessa and not the man who had attacked him. He knew about the younger man\u2019s predilection for intimidating and sometimes battering his sex partners; on more than one occasion he\u2019d exploited Lawson\u2019s weakness to deal with female subjects who subsequently proved much more cooperative. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A pity, he thought, that his director\u2019s present physical and mental condition rendered him useless, possibly in the permanent sense of the word. He\u2019d decide the younger man\u2019s fate as soon as the physicians reported back to him on the prognosis.</p><p>From the hospital Genaro had his driver take him to his private estate outside the city. Genaro rarely visited his personal residence during the week, as the guest suites at the GenHance building were more convenient, but tonight he needed a few hours alone to think.</p><p>His butler, who had once served in the households of British royalty, met him at the door. \u201cGood evening, Mr. Genaro.\u201d He took his coat and briefcase. \u201cWill you be dining at home tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have coffee and sandwiches, James. Bring it down to the armory.\u201d He walked to the elevator and took it down to the third sublevel of the house, where he stepped out, closed his eyes, and waited as jets of cool air blew down from the ceiling grid and a beam of UV light passed over him. A soft chime indicated the end of the decontamination cycle, and he went up to the wall scanner beside two massive steel doors and leveled his left eye with the lens.</p><p>The automated security system scanned his retina, identified him, and produced a small keypad from a concealed slot. Genaro entered his master code and stepped through as the doors slid silently apart.</p><p>He\u2019d originally built the armory to serve as his personal vault and a lockdown safe room where he could retreat if the house security was compromised. The room had independent power, ventilation, and water supply systems as well as enough nonperishable foods to keep a single occupant alive for as long as eighteen months. One wall contained security camera screens that continually monitored the interior of the house and sublevels as well as the grounds of the estate; the other had been outfitted with televisions that received their signals from three different satellites, an Internet server and access terminal, a powerful radio array, and direct voice lines to trusted allies in half a dozen countries.</p><p>An adjoining room served as a personal living space, with a comfortable bed, a large bath, and movie screens modeled as faux windows that displayed realistic outdoor views of the country and were timed to lighten or darken depending on the actual hour of the day.</p><p>When Genaro had left Italy to come to America in the nineties, he brought with him a small but unique collection of antiquities, which at first he displayed in the house and then moved to the vault room after some of the more fragile relics began to show signs of deterioration. The filtered air and climate-control units helped to preserve his collection, but there was another, more immediate benefit: securing them away from all other eyes. Genaro had spent most of his life acquiring the antiquities, and felt very possessive about them. He found he enjoyed storing them in the one place where they were safe and only he could enjoy them.</p> <p>That was something taught to him by the practices of the one man he thought might have understood him, his noble ancestor Septus Janus Genarius of Rome.</p><p>The twelve hundred and forty-two artifacts ranged from marble statues liberated from his ancestor\u2019s ancient Tuscan villa to dozens of bronze and terra-cotta figurines that had been purchased from collectors or the various Middle East black markets for antiquities. All depicted the head, bust, or form of Genarius in the flowing toga of a Roman senator or clad in the ornate armor of a legion commander.</p><p>Several ensembles of armor, exact reproductions of what Genarius would have worn during his years serving in the legion, were displayed on mannequins Jonah had commissioned to be made in the image of his ancestor\u2019s many busts and statues. He would have preferred to have the originals, but they had been lost to the sands of time.</p><p>Genarius had been one of the wealthiest men of his time, and his possessions reflected that privileged life: costly bronze mirrors, cast vessels, hand-fashioned goblets, and extravagant lamps had been recovered from his country home, as well as a few of the only blown-glass ornaments and finger rings of the era known to still exist. The cautious senator had also hidden beneath his villa sacks of coins, some so rare that they had yet to be cataloged by anyone in the world except Genaro.</p><p>Records and carbon dating indicated that all of his possessions had been removed from the house and hidden in an underground bunker by Genarius a short time before he had died. Perhaps he had been warned about the epidemic and tried to secure his wealth before the sickness reached his household; Genaro would never know for certain. In any case, before he had died the senator had moved most of his wealth to secret caches and vaults, where it had lain undisturbed for two millennia.</p><p>It had taken longer to find the scrolls Genarius had written, sealed, and secreted away in the tunnels beneath his city compound, but eventually Genaro had also discovered and opened that vault. There were books, letters, and manuscripts written about Genarius or mentioning him in some significant manner that dated back to the tenth century, many telling the tale of the common foot soldier whose courage had brought him up through the ranks until he had commanded his own armies.</p> <p>The prize of Genaro\u2019s collection was the original proclamation issued by Augustus appointing Genarius to the Roman senate; that had been preserved and passed down through countless generations of the Genaro family as proof of their ancestor\u2019s nobility.</p><p>Genarius had been an important man, serving three grateful emperors and building much of the Roman Empire. Aside from the Caesars, few Roman noblemen had ever been depicted in stone, which emphasized Genarius\u2019s standing among the elite of the empire.</p><p>His ancestor had also left behind evidence of a devoted but puzzling interest in the career of a distinguished praefectus castrorum, Tanicus. Like Genarius, Tanicus had risen through the ranks from foot soldier to centurion to primus pilus, and then had been named third in command of his legion. At first Genaro had assumed his ancestor had used his influence to help promote the man, until the translations of Genarius\u2019s many letters and records made it obvious that Tanicus had been made prefect while Genaro\u2019s ancestor still served as a centurion. From the intense interest Genarius had shown in following the commander\u2019s career, he assumed the man had been one of his ancestor\u2019s mentors or patrons.</p><p>Tanicus had been listed as one of the casualties of Kalkriese, but for years after the tragedy, Genarius continued to search for the commander. Apparently worried that his friend had been sold into slavery by Arminius, he had written to every known survivor of Kalkriese, begging for news of what had happened that day. He had a statue carved of the commander, which he kept in his house and, according to the dates on the scrolls, had continued looking for him until the last day of his life.</p><p>All that historians knew about Tanicus was that he was the childhood friend of Germanicus, the emperor\u2019s favorite grandson, and the most trusted of his commanders. He was also rumored to have been a member of a small, elite group of triarii. Little was known about the band of veteran soldiers, except that each member had been awarded the corona muralis, the simple crown of laurel leaves given to soldiers who had risked their lives to save another\u2019s. That highly prized award had prompted scholars to refer to the unit as the Laurels, and some estimated that the group might have been established as far back as the foundation of Rome itself, some seven hundred years before Tanicus had been born, and continued until the final collapse of the empire some five hundred years later.</p><p>Only Genaro knew that Tanicus had indeed belonged to the Laurels, and like the other members had tattooed himself with their distinctive mark. His ancestor had referred to the mark over and over in his descriptions of the commander, and had gone so far as to have it carved into the statue of Tanicus that he had commissioned.</p><p>Genaro went to the statue recovered from his ancestor\u2019s villa, the only known image of Tanicus. Oddly the sculptor had not attempted to idealize the commander\u2019s features, but portrayed him as an ordinary man with an austere face and dressed in the unadorned garments of the freeborn.</p><p>He seldom looked at the statue, for it had no value to him except as one of Genarius\u2019s personal possessions, but now he went to it and removed the protective cover draping it. Across two thousand years, the grim-faced commander stared at him through his blank marble eyes, his arms at his sides, his body poised as if he were preparing to take a step toward him. Genaro reached out and touched the mark chiseled on the side of the statue\u2019s neck, the tattoo of the Laurels, a mark that would have been covered by his armor or easily concealed by the collar of a cloak.</p> <p>Only Genaro knew that the mark of the Laurels was an ancient pagan symbol that had been found etched into the walls of caves in Tibet and on the trunks of enormous trees worshiped by forest pagans. No one knew the true origins of the mark, but the Romans had called it the lemniscus\u2014the ribbon\u2014and the Greeks sometimes called it the \u039f\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u00f3\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, the tail-devouring snake.</p><p>The Greeks had named it correctly, Genaro thought as he traced the mark with his fingers. It did resemble a snake that had twisted itself in half as it ate its own tail.</p><p>It also looked exactly like the number eight, tipped over on its side.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Matthias left the freeway and drove to a busy twenty-four-hour rest-stop complex, where he parked his car out of sight in a back lot next to the second vehicle Rowan had arranged for him. A magnetic cache hidden in the second car\u2019s rear wheel well also contained a tight roll of currency, a new disposable mobile phone, and a note from Rowan.</p><p>They\u2019re after you now. Keep her out of sight and call in when you switch cars.</p><p>He transferred his pack and wiped down the surfaces he had touched before lifting Jessa out of the passenger seat of the first car. As he straightened and nudged the door shut with his knee, Matthias noticed a couple with four young children walking from the restrooms into the back lot. Quickly he turned around and went to one of the metal benches beyond the curb and sat down, holding her upright against him on his lap. He placed her hands inside his shirt and tucked her face against his neck as he lowered his head and put his mouth against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that man doing, Mommy?\u201d he heard one of the children ask as the family passed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking a rest with his wife, Justin.\u201d The frowning mother quickly herded her children along at a faster pace while her husband slowed his step to take a longer look. \u201cPeter, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey.\u201d The husband gave Matthias a grin and a wink before trotting to catch up.</p><p>Matthias didn\u2019t want to move Jessa until the family departed, so he held her and waited as the couple helped their children into the backseats of their van. He would have been concerned with handling her as much as he had, for it surely would have roused another woman, but some indefinable sense of her told him that she had retreated into herself and would not wake for some time yet.</p> <p>This brief delay gave him the time to look at her as much as he wished, and he mapped every inch of her face, from the off-center peak of fine black hair above her left brow, down the gentle slope of her nose, and over her pretty lips to the strong line of her jaw. Awake she likely kept her features composed, giving away only as much as she was willing to allow others to see. Now she seemed softer, younger, untouched by the suffering she had endured.</p><p>He could only guess what her life had been like since her ability had come over her. Knowing that with a single touch she could see into the darkest corners of the soul could not have been a temptation; it must have seemed like a curse. He thought of all the people he had contact with in the course of a single day. He disliked touching strangers, but some contact was unavoidable when exchanging money, accepting goods, or walking through crowded areas. She could not wear gloves year-round and have it go unnoticed; she could not lock herself in her office to avoid the people who worked for her or the clients who sought her services.</p><p>\u201cHow do you manage it?\u201d he murmured to her. \u201cDo you surround yourself with the innocent, or do you make them think you are cold and distant?\u201d</p><p>A strand of her hair had caught in the corner of her mouth; he used a fingertip to brush it away. Even that small touch caused his hand to come alive with tingling nerves, just as it had when she had put her hand over his.</p><p>The brush of the tiny, invisible hairs on her thin skin reminded him of a delicate veil over silk. The paleness of her flesh still astonished him; he had grown accustomed to the uniform glowing tans of American women. Such ivory beauty should have been too fragile to bear anything more than a whisper or a breath without bruising.</p> <p>Matthias saw a flash of red brake lights as the van drove out of the lot, and knew it was time to move her. As he put his hand under her knees, her head slipped back against his arm, lifting her face to his. He held her for another moment so that he might feel her breath warming his mouth. He had never been so close to a woman and not had her pinned beneath him, opening herself to welcome the thrust of his shaft. With her ability, Jessa would not even have that much. Her loneliness was not by choice, he realized. To take a lover, she had to touch\u2014but he had seen it with his own eyes: The only touch she permitted herself was her own.</p><p>\u201cI understand now.\u201d He lifted her against his chest as he stood and carried her to the second car.</p><p>Lowering the seat, he eased her back until she couldn\u2019t be seen through the car\u2019s windows. As he made her comfortable, she remained limp, but the strength and steadiness of her heartbeat and breathing assured him she was not in a dangerously deep sleep.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t know what she had seen when she\u2019d touched him, but he could guess. He had relived the moment a thousand times in his own memory, cursing the desperation that had driven him that day. He had been an arrogant fool, so intent on seeking justice that it had blinded him as surely as the storm.</p><p>But had she seen everything? Would she understand?</p><p>After he returned to the highway, Matthias called Rowan to tell her he had made the first transfer, and to send one of their helpers to pick up the vehicle he had left behind.</p> <p>\u201cWho is after me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTry everyone with a badge in Atlanta,\u201d she said. \u201cYou and Ms. Know-it-all also made the six-o\u2019clock news. They don\u2019t have any shots of you, but by eleven her face will be plastered on every major channel in the nation. All they\u2019re saying is that you\u2019re both wanted for questioning as a person of interest in an attempted murder of a prominent businessman. You know how fast Genaro moves when he\u2019s motivated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He had hoped for a little more time, but that was not to be. \u201cWhat more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew stole a copy of the GenHance file on her,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cRecords only go back ten years, and then she doesn\u2019t exist, so Jessa Bellamy and her background are definitely bogus. She would know how to do that the right way, of course. He had more luck with the name you gave him. By the way, how come she\u2019s not making any noise? Did you gag her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sleeps.\u201d He flexed his right hand, trying to dispel the lingering sensations from touching her face. \u201cShe used her ability on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad move, boss.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhat are you going to tell her when she wakes up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may already know.\u201d Matthias glanced at Jessa. Now when he looked at her face, he wished she would wake. It would make moving her more difficult, of course, but he wanted to see her eyes again. He had never known a woman with rain-colored eyes. \u201cTell me about this luck with the other name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still downloading everything he stole from Genaro; give me a sec.\u201d After a short pause, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve got it. Okay. An Allen Taggart Price died during a workplace shooting in Savannah back in \u2019ninety-eight. Seven other people at this investment brokerage were also shot and killed by a mentally ill former employee, one Jennifer Johnson. The only unconfirmed survivor was Minerva Jessamine Starret, twenty-two years old.\u201d Rowan paused and then added, \u201cIt was her first day at work, poor kid.\u201d</p> <p>He hardly heard her over the rush of blood to his head. \u201cMinerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. I knew a kid in middle school named Jesus Supreme Lord Loomis. We called him Loomy Tunes.\u201d She flipped a paper. \u201cNo birth records but a child welfare report, estimated born 1976 in Chicago, abandoned at birth, placed as an infant in a Catholic group home for unwanted children\u2014big surprise there\u2014adopted in 1981 by Darien Thomas Starret of Savannah, no wife, so no mother for her. Enrolled same year in very expensive private Swiss school, stayed there until she graduated and attended college in France, returned to the U.S. in \u2019ninety-seven, resided with father until his death by natural causes in \u2019ninety-eight. Couple of months before she was shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Minerva was the unconfirmed survivor,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means they\u2019re not sure she lived. Minerva took a slug to the chest, point-blank range, was admitted to Savannah General and listed in critical condition for three days. Intake report notes indicate extensive lung and cardiac damage from the GSW. She wasn\u2019t expected to live more than an hour or two, so they didn\u2019t operate.\u201d Rowan flipped more pages. \u201cOkay, and now it gets really interesting. Minerva left the hospital three days later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter being shot in the chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen witnesses swear they saw her walk out of the building. That was the last time she was seen alive. Officially reported as missing and declared dead by the state in 2005 so they could auction off her inheritance and drop the proceeds in the treasury.\u201d She made an amused sound. \u201cI\u2019ll give you three guesses what comprised the bulk of her estate.\u201d</p><p>He already knew. \u201cSapphire House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Now, would you mind telling me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI would mind. Are there any photographs of Minerva Starret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s license from DOT.\u201d Rowan\u2019s friendly voice became distant. \u201cTransmitting a JPEG. Should be on your screen now.\u201d</p><p>Matthias looked at the small image that appeared on the viewscreen of his mobile. The identification picture showed a young, smiling girl with short-cropped black hair. The poor camera and indifferent lighting had washed most of her vivid coloring and muted the gleam of her black hair, but it could not erase the blaze of energy and determination in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Rowan asked, her voice oddly strained. \u201cIs this little princess our girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa is more queen than princess.\u201d Matthias pulled off the highway onto the shoulder, parked, and shut off the engine before he held the phone next to her face. The lines and shape of the nose, mouth, and jaw of the image were very similar to Jessa Bellamy\u2019s. \u201cThere is a strong resemblance. Do the hospital records say if Minerva had any marks or scars on her body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the great hole in her chest ...\u201d Rowan fell silent for a time. \u201cHow about that. Minerva had a small tat on the inside of her left wrist. A gold and black owl.\u201d</p><p>Matthias took Jessa\u2019s left hand and turned it up so that he could inspect her wrist, but saw no tattoo of any kind. \u201cJessa does not have a mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she was the shooter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Matthias took a piece of her hair and idly wound it between his fingertips. \u201cShe could not kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re basing this assumption on what? Listening to her snore for an hour?\u201d Rowan made a rude sound. \u201cGaven. I know you like her, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s gorgeous and troubled and helpless and all that shit. But if this is going to work, you can\u2019t get involved with her. None of us can.\u201d</p><p>He let the strands of dark hair slide out of his fingers. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t snore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He sat back and closed his eyes. \u201cIs everything prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoom\u2019s ready, fortress is secure, and Drew is starting the paperwork. We should be able to relocate in a week.\u201d</p><p>Seven days, that was all he had, and then he would never see her again. \u201cVery well. Go to bed; sleep. Tomorrow will be the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake me up when you get in.\u201d</p><p>Matthias switched off the mobile and reached for the locking security harness installed in place of the passenger seat belt. He disliked restraining her, but if she were to wake during the last leg of the journey, she would likely try to escape him. He shifted her so that she would be as comfortable as possible under the harness, and tucked her hands beneath the straps. As he did, his thumb brushed across the thin skin of her left wrist, and he felt something. He reached up, turned on the interior overhead dome, and brought her wrist under it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A series of pale lines marked the inside of her wrist, almost too light to be seen. As he turned her arm, unlike the rest of her skin, they caught the light and reflected it. The shape they formed was that of a small, round-headed bird.</p><p>Exactly, in fact, like the outline of an owl.</p><p>Lucan noticed three things about the state of Georgia: The land was beautiful, the natives\u2019 dialect made them almost as incomprehensible as the Cubans of south Florida, and the men in authority here did not care for females having the same.</p> <p>\u201cThat there\u2019s the problem, miss,\u201d the fat desk sergeant said as he settled his bulk on one elbow so he could get a better view of Samantha\u2019s neckline. \u201cY\u2019all come here without an invite to pick up a prisoner after hours. I don\u2019t know how y\u2019all run your department down there, but that\u2019s not how it works in Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>Much to Lucan\u2019s disappointment, Samantha did not leap across the scarred surface of the reception desk or rip out the offensive mortal\u2019s throat. She, the soul of patience, merely smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe prisoner has considerable financial resources at his command and is a serious flight risk,\u201d she told the insolent mortal. \u201cThe last time he made bail on capital murder charges, he fled the state. The district attorney wants only to assure that he stands trial in Fort Lauderdale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, my captain don\u2019t care if he has to go before a judge in the North Pole.\u201d He chuckled at his own joke. \u201cWe got our way of doing things, and this ain\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Lucan took her elbow and pulled her to one side. \u201cThis is a waste of time. I will go and retrieve the bag of scum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScumbag,\u201d she corrected. \u201cWe had an agreement. We\u2019re here to extradite Max Grodan, not terrorize and destroy half the city.\u201d Before he could reply, she added, \u201cBehave yourself, suzerain, or I\u2019ll make you fill out the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the stack of forms the desk sergeant had produced. \u201cYou would not be so heartless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep pushing and find out.\u201d She went back to the desk, collected the forms, and made an appointment to see the chief of homicide the following afternoon. \u201cWould it be possible to obtain a copy of the arrest reports?\u201d When the man scowled, she added, \u201cI have to call the district attorney tonight, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be interested in how cooperative your department has been.\u201d</p><p>The sergeant released a long-suffering sigh before he trudged into a back office and returned a few minutes later. \u201cHere\u2019s copies of what all the feds sent over with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Sam took the folder and glanced at Lucan. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive of my favorite words.\u201d He clasped her hand in his. \u201cBut I\u2019ve already arranged suitable accommodations.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t seem to hear him, engrossed as she was in the contents of the file.</p><p>In the car, she finished reading and closed the folder. \u201cThat\u2019s odd. I thought they caught him in the act, but they didn\u2019t even know he was in the city. Stop driving so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a Ferrari,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIt does not allow itself to be driven slowly. What act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSetting up another con,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cThe guy uses his partners for everything\u2014making hotel reservations, renting cars, buying whatever he needs\u2014all under their names. That way there\u2019s never any evidence implicating him. He never leaves a trail. I figured his new partner tipped off the Bureau. Instead, they get an anonymous phone call reporting him and the partner.\u201d</p><p>Lucan shrugged. \u201cSo a good citizen did their duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone knew everything\u2014where he was, who he was with, what they\u2019d already done in New York, and what they planned to do here. Max is a ghost. He just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d She frowned, thinking. \u201cMaybe one of his old partners got away from him. But how would she know where he was, and what he was doing?\u201d She looked up through the windshield. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur hotel room, so to speak.\u201d He parked at the curb in front of the Armstrong building. \u201cI spoke to Scarlet. He was kind enough to extend to us the use of his city stronghold.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look happy as she got out of the car. \u201cAll right, I suppose it\u2019s okay. Which floor is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou borrowed the entire building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I am a visiting suzerain.\u201d He put an arm around her waist. \u201cWhat would you have me do, Samantha? Take rooms for us at the Motel 6?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d She walked with him to the entrance, where a human male dressed in a dark brown suit met them at the doors.</p><p>\u201cSuzerain Lucan.\u201d The mortal bowed. \u201cI\u2019m Charles Kendrick, the building manager. Suzerain Scarlet sends his regrets that he could not personally attend you, as he is still overseeing the repair work at Rosethorn. We\u2019ve prepared a suite for you on the fourth floor. If you require anything during your stay, please notify the staff by pressing zero on any phone.\u201d</p><p>Lucan noted the small black cameos glinting in the mortal\u2019s cuffs, indicating the mortal was a tresora, a trusted human who had been trained from birth to serve the Kyn. \u201cThank you. We should not be here for long.\u201d</p><p>Lucan could feel Samantha\u2019s tension building as they took the lift to the fourth floor, where it opened as an entrance to the massive guest suite.</p><p>She glanced around the walls covered with peach silk hand-painted with trompe l\u2019oeil trellises and dark green ivy, the light oak English country furnishings, and the crisp white and sky blue draperies. \u201cJesus. I feel like I just stepped into a dinner mint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could inquire to see if they have something more in line with a Skittles theme,\u201d he said, bending to place a kiss on her shoulder, and then frowning as she moved to avoid his touch. \u201cPerhaps the bedchamber will be more to your liking.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and wandered around the sitting room, almost but not quite touching several of the room\u2019s treasures. \u201cYou only see stuff like this in high-end house porn magazines.\u201d She looked up at the room\u2019s rock-crystal chandelier, from which a small bluebird hung in perpetual flight.</p><p>She pushed her hands into the pockets of her trousers, but not before he saw that they were shaking. \u201cHow far away is Motel 6 again?\u201d</p><p>Lucan realized his sygkenis had little exposure to the sort of luxuries the centuries had allowed the Kyn to acquire, but she was hiding something else behind her sarcasm. \u201cWe can leave and go anywhere you wish. You have but to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can do this.\u201d She sat down gingerly on a French chaise and hunched her shoulders as she rubbed the side of her forehead. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d</p><p>As he went to her, her scent wrapped around him. It had a deeper, more pervasive note than usual, one that betrayed her real state. \u201cYou lied to me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that you would attend to your needs before we departed Fort Lauderdale.\u201d He cupped her cold cheek. \u201cIf you had, your body would be warm, and your hands would not be trembling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt slipped my mind.\u201d She rose and tried to go around him, but when he countered the move she came up short. \u201cI\u2019ll give myself an injection later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot to pack my syringes, all right?\u201d Her pupils shrank to thin black crescents as her hazel eyes turned pure gold. \u201cI\u2019d order some more from the local pharmacy, but I doubt they carry the copper-tipped, blood-filled brand.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that her temper could easily incite his own, he forced his own thoughts to remain calm. \u201cYou cannot keep depending on the needles. Before you shout at me again, remember that our bond and your distress rouse my talent, and you are standing directly beneath a crystal chandelier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She exhaled slowly. \u201cAlex told me she uses only injections. She said it\u2019s better this way. Easier to live with\u2014like being a diabetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexandra heals humans,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou hunt their killers. Your personalities are different, and so are your instincts. The needles have not been satisfying you for some time now, have they? Why have you concealed this from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my problem,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t need blood all the time. I can go a couple of days without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut tonight you want it. Very badly, I think.\u201d He studied her stubborn expression. \u201cWho tempted you? Rob\u2019s tresora downstairs? Or that annoying mortal at the police department?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her waist. \u201cI\u2019m still in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to realize that her dents ac\u00e9r\u00e9es were fully extended, or that she was shedding enough scent to seduce a small army. \u201cThere is no reason to deny yourself any longer.\u201d He took hold of her arms and tugged her closer. \u201cI will hunt with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d Now she bared her fangs. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not blame a starving mortal for feeling hunger,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cYet you condemn yourself for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I look at someone and all I can think of is sinking my teeth into his throat, being happy is a little hard to swing.\u201d She turned her head. \u201cThey must have some bagged blood in here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot hunt a plastic bag.\u201d</p><p>Her fiery golden eyes flashed up. \u201cI don\u2019t hunt anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree, Detective.\u201d He pulled her closer, ignoring the stiffness of her limbs as he pressed her face to his chest. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said into his shirt, and then, reluctantly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, his love for her almost overwhelmed him. \u201cWe are hunters, Samantha. Our needs cannot be ignored or forgotten, or we risk losing control. When that happens, we do not merely feed. We kill. You will kill.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it happen before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d When he nodded, she uttered a wretched sound. \u201cYou should have let me die, Lucan.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou should never have given me a reason to live.\u201d He shifted around her, curling an arm around her waist. \u201cCome. There is a club in the hotel at the end of the block. It should offer some variety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking about people like they\u2019re entr\u00e9es,\u201d she said as she walked to the lift with him.</p> <p>Lucan stopped on their way out to have a discreet word with Kendrick before escorting his sygkenis to the Bar with a View. Samantha remained mute as he led her to a table and ordered wine, and didn\u2019t object when he left her to walk among the mortals to select a likely candidate. He found an attractive, healthy young thing, took a moment to compel and instruct her, and then returned to the table. Samantha looked rigid and miserable as she stared into her wineglass.</p><p>\u201cAlways choose someone young and of a healthy weight,\u201d he said, startling her. \u201cTake in their scent; it will tell you much about them. Inebriated or drugged humans give off an unpleasant, acrid odor. Those with diseases smell of strong chemicals or rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going to sniff anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not have to.\u201d He looked up as the fetching young black female he had chosen for Samantha approached them. \u201cThey will bring their scent to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there.\u201d The girl, barely out of her teens, flashed her pearly teeth at Lucan before turning to Samantha. \u201cI saw you walk in, and I had to come over and say hi.\u201d She sat down in the chair beside his sygkenis. \u201cI\u2019m Abby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Samantha made it halfway to her feet before Lucan caught her. \u201cNo. She\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is an adult,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAdolescents have a simpler scent. It does not attract us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-four,\u201d Abby said at the same time Samantha said, \u201cI\u2019m not attracted to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not suggesting you take her to bed, my love.\u201d Lucan reached over and took Abby\u2019s hand, bringing it close to his sygkenis\u2019s face. \u201cBreathe her in. That\u2019s it. Can you feel her pulse in the air?\u201d</p><p>Samantha closed her eyes, swallowed, and nodded.</p><p>He turned to the mortal female. \u201cAbigail, would you be kind enough to show my lady to the powder room, please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s right around the corner.\u201d Abby took Samantha\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Lucan watched them cross the crowded floor of the club before he followed. He stopped outside the women\u2019s restroom, moving aside as several smiling females streamed out before he entered.</p><p>Inside he found Samantha holding off the young female, who was trying in vain to embrace her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d Abby was saying, her expression dazed. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>Samantha turned her head and saw him. \u201cGet her off me.\u201d</p><p>Lucan reached back and flipped the bolt on the door. \u201cShe is under your influence now. Command her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand still,\u201d Samantha told the girl, who immediately dropped her arms and stood quiescent. She began to reach for Abby but suddenly jerked her hands away. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. Lucan, please, get her out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must trust yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d She gave him a wild look. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, help me out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you will not harm her.\u201d Lucan went to stand behind the girl and rested his hands on her shoulders, urging her closer to his sygkenis. \u201cYou will be gentle. You will take only what you need from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Abby whispered.</p><p>Samantha took hold of her wrist and brought it to her lips. She hesitated again, but this time the call of the girl\u2019s blood proved to be too much for her, and she struck. As she drove her fangs into the mortal\u2019s flesh, Abby shuddered and groaned her pleasure.</p><p>Lucan supported her as he watched Samantha feed, stroking the girl\u2019s arms with soothing hands. He did not have to tell his lady when it was time to stop; Samantha wrenched her mouth away and pushed at the girl.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cYou must see to them when you are through,\u201d he told her, taking a handkerchief from his jacket and pressing it over the puncture marks in the girl\u2019s wrist. \u201cMost will stop bleeding at once, but should it continue, you must tend to her. A small amount of your own blood will seal the wounds.\u201d Fortunately the girl responded well and her blood clotted immediately. \u201cWhen you know she is well, you must remove the memory of this.\u201d He turned Abby toward him. \u201cYou will forget us and return to your home now. Go to bed and sleep the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget. Home. Sleep.\u201d Abby nodded and left the restroom as soon as he unlocked the door.</p><p>Lucan turned back to find Samantha sitting on the floor, her flushed face buried in her hands. He crouched down beside her. \u201cIt was not so bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was horrible. I wanted to ...\u201d She pressed her hand over her mouth for a moment. \u201cI felt something when I was ... I could feel everything she felt. I knew. I knew she would have done anything I told her to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL\u2019attrait is very powerful. Most humans cannot resist it.\u201d He brushed the dark hair back from her face and lifted her to her feet. \u201cThe more you deny yourself blood, the more you will need. If you take too much, you will enrapture the mortal and become enthralled. You will drain all the blood from the body and fall unconscious for many days. The human will die beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis happens every time you use humans for blood.\u201d She spoke as if to herself rather than him. \u201cYou can see inside them. Feel what they\u2019re feeling. The pleasure. The lust.\u201d</p><p>Lucan couldn\u2019t understand why she sounded so disgusted. \u201cWe are designed to be attractive to mortals. It is what brings them to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I saw what you did. You went and picked her out for me. You made her come to me.\u201d She shook her head and laughed bitterly. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t get my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not allow yourself to hunt,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI had to do something.\u201d</p><p>Furious eyes met his. \u201cWhy her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed adequate\u2014\u201d Her fist stopped him, and he staggered backward. Over the sinks, the mirrors began to crack. \u201cWhat the devil is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feed only on men?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>He used his hand to wipe the blood from his mouth. \u201cNot unless there are no healthy females for me to use, and what the bloody hell does it matter?\u201d</p><p>She shoved him back. \u201cDo you have sex with them? These women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I, when I have you for that?\u201d He caught her by the wrists before she could punch him again. \u201cYou are not always as obliging as the bespelled, of course, but I am learning to be patient.\u201d One of the sinks behind her split in half and crashed to the floor. \u201cIs that it, my darling? Are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>She leaned in close. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring me a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no difference in the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go and get me a man,\u201d she snarled. \u201cA cute one with a nice body. I\u2019ll do him right here on the fucking floor.\u201d</p><p>The window in the opposite wall shattered. \u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough for one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to do me that first night I met you in the club.\u201d She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and stared at the light smear of red it left on her skin. \u201cThis is why you got so pissed when you couldn\u2019t put me under. Because I resisted you. I wouldn\u2019t spread my legs for you.\u201d</p><p>Another sink exploded. \u201cIn the end, darling, it was your choice to come to my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was like that girl, if I was that fucked-up, how the hell could I choose anything?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for him to answer, but quickly strode out.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Jessa hadn\u2019t slept through the night in years, not since the moment she\u2019d woken up in an intensive care unit, breathing through a tube and hearing the slow beeps of monitoring equipment. The fact that she knew she was unconscious, and not by choice, initially alarmed her, because she didn\u2019t want to wake up in a hospital bed again. But on some level deeper than consciousness or awareness, she knew she wasn\u2019t injured, sick, or even in danger. The frightening sensory overload from the shadowlight had knocked her out, and her mind needed time to absorb the impact and recover.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dream, but she didn\u2019t lose her sense of herself in oblivion, either. That, she was sure, was because of the man. She could feel him there, on the other side of the darkness, waiting for her. He had caused this, but he was also watching over her. There were moments when she could almost feel him all around her, on her face, against her body. For all she knew he could be doing anything to her, but she didn\u2019t feel helpless or vulnerable, or even frightened.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand it\u2014not after the memories of being swept away and buried alive in the suffocating cold slowly emerged. If he did that to her\u2014and she knew touching him had caused it\u2014why did he feel so warm and safe?</p><p>Gradually the darkness thinned around her, and her senses began to work again. She felt a pleasant texture against her cheek and smelled lilacs close by. Something covered most of her body, something light and soft and luxurious. She heard the tick of a clock and the trickle of water. The only discomfort she felt was from the dryness of her mouth and a vague soreness in her right arm.</p><p>Her senses also told her that she was not home, or at the office, or anyplace she recognized. She waited, listening for the sound of voices or the movements of bodies, and when she felt sure she was alone she opened her eyes a fraction.</p><p>Someone had switched on two lamps with brown and amber stained-glass shades. She saw books, shelves, small tables, and many armchairs. To her right sat an old desk; her cheek pressed into a new pillow. She felt the edge of carved wood under her palm. None of it was familiar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Turning her head slowly, she saw that she lay under a heavily embroidered velvet crazy quilt on the comfortably pillowy cushions of an oversize love seat or daybed. Her feet were bare, and someone had also removed her jacket, but otherwise she was still dressed. Some of her hair fell around her face as she levered herself onto one elbow.</p><p>A door opened, and before Jessa could think better of it she looked toward the sound. A very tall teenager wearing a ragged gray sweatshirt and worn, stained jeans walked toward her, a wooden tray in her hands.</p><p>\u201cToo late to fake it,\u201d she said as Jessa dropped back down and closed her eyes. \u201cI already saw the baby blues. Hopefully you like grilled cheese and tomato soup.\u201d</p> <p>Jessa stayed where she was and watched as the girl placed the tray on a table by the daybed. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe. Welcome to the Freak Protection Program.\u201d She straightened and tugged her sleeves down, covering the black swirls of the tattoos on her forearms. \u201cEat something.\u201d</p><p>Jessa checked the tray, but the only utensil on it was a plastic spoon. The sandwich had been put on a paper plate, and the bottle of iced tea was also plastic.</p><p>Nothing I can use as a weapon. \u201cI want to talk to the man who brought me here.\u201d She had to concentrate for a moment to recall his name. \u201cMatthias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you.\u201d The girl smiled, a vicious show of dazzling white teeth. \u201cWell, Queenie, I\u2019m not your fucking gofer.\u201d She walked out.</p> <p>Jessa rolled off the daybed and went after her, expecting to find the door locked. It wasn\u2019t. She looked down at her bare feet; if she had to run, she needed shoes. Luckily she spotted her pumps sitting under the table by the daybed, and put them on before she slipped out.</p><p>Outside the room she saw no sign of the girl. Two long walls of old, cracked, whitewashed concrete interspersed by closed wooden doors formed a long, windowless corridor. The low, rounded ceiling, heavy-duty shop lights wired above the doors, and old bricked floor made her realize she was not standing in a hallway but some sort of underground tunnel.</p><p>Underground where?</p><p>Jessa had worked with enough people from New York City to recognize the girl\u2019s Brooklyn accent, and considered the odds of that being where she was. It would take most of a day to drive to New York, but the clock in the library room had shown the time to be seven fourteen. At the same time, she didn\u2019t know if that was the morning or evening hour. Had Matthias drugged her? How long had she been unconscious?</p><p>She walked past the doors to one end of the corridor, keeping her footsteps as quiet as she could, only to discover it turned off into another pair of tunnels. She took the right, which stretched out for two hundred feet before it split in two. There she went left, and then right again, until she stopped. Wherever she was, the place was a labyrinth, with no exit signs or any indication of what lay behind the twenty-two doors she\u2019d already passed.</p><p>Jessa walked up to the nearest door, braced herself, opened it, and stared into a shallow closet filled with small, brand-new kitchen appliances. The top shelf was packed with can openers, the next a row of coffeemakers, and the third an assortment of blenders. All of them were neatly arranged, still in their boxes, but they didn\u2019t make sense. Who needed eleven can openers, or nine coffeemakers?</p> <p>She moved down to the next door, but it proved to be another closet, this one packed with long bolts of designer drapery fabric standing on end and arranged by color.</p><p>There was enough material to dress the windows of a dozen houses.</p><p>She looked up and saw at least fifty spools of satin cord and clear plastic bags filled with a variety of hanging tassels.</p><p>Confusion piled on top of her anxiety. She\u2019d expected to see guns, men huddled together around a phone, or at least some scowling guard to grab her and march her at gunpoint back to the library room\u2014not Martha Stewart\u2019s spring window-treatment collection.</p><p>The sound of stone scraping against stone came from the end of the hall where she stood, drawing her attention. She closed the closet and followed the noise to the last door before the next intersection. This one stood partially open, and she pressed herself against the wall beside it before she glanced around the corner.</p><p>From where she stood she could see almost half of the room. Candlelight and a working fireplace filled the interior with a warm, shifting amber glow, and cast shadows over what appeared to be neatly stacked short columns of smooth stone disks. She would have thought them to be garden pavers or stepping-stones, except they each had a notched hole in the center, through which stood a four-foot wooden pole. Bundles of wide leather straps sat on top of some of the stacked disks, along with long lengths that resembled belts with odd hanging loops. The floors and wall were empty except for a layer of fine white sand.</p><p>She listened but heard only the scraping sound, and carefully eased the door in another inch.</p><p>A barefoot man dressed in a pair of old, loose khakis stood to one side of the room, his back facing her, his arms outstretched. Around each hand he had looped one of the wider straps, from which dangled two of the stone disks. Slowly he brought his hands up over his head, causing the stones to scrape against each other with the movement. He lowered them again, just as slowly, but this time in a diagonal direction, forming a vee with his arms. After several similar movements it became clear that he was working out with the stones as if they were weights.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d used them, either, Jessa guessed, mesmerized by the powerful lines of his upper body. She\u2019d seen a lot of men who worked out, but never one like this. He seemed built out of pure, perfect muscle, not simply developed but brutally beautiful, thick and smooth, with every contour in absolute balance.</p><p>Unwelcome heat crept up her neck, tightening in her throat and sharpening her field of vision. Her body reacted to the sight of all that masculine beauty like a brainless bimbo\u2019s would, all shivering nerves and surging blood. Intellectually she knew she couldn\u2019t touch him, not after what had happened to her in the car, but her senses didn\u2019t seem to care. They were in full-blown lust now, eyeing and measuring him, speculating on how it would feel to be held in those magnificent arms and petted by those strong hands. He\u2019d be a hard lover, thorough and demanding, the sort of man who had sex the way soldiers went into battle: Breach the defenses, break through the lines, and claim whatever was on the other side.</p><p>She\u2019d never had a lover like that. Would never, she reminded herself.</p><p>The uncertain light reflected off the gleaming sweat on his skin, added the intense aura of primal male, but it also revealed here and there the corded scars of old wounds. Too many to have been inflicted all at once and for him to survive. However he had been hurt, the man showed no physical sign of impairment.</p><p>Jessa knew what the scar of a gunshot wound looked like and how difficult they were to remove, even with dermal laser treatments. The scars this man carried were straight and jagged, and of varying lengths, and seemed to be from the sort of injuries a wide, heavy blade would inflict. If he had been stabbed that many times ...</p><p>He can\u2019t be one of the Takyn, she thought, drawing back a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to stand there for the rest of the night?\u201d he asked without looking at her.</p><p>She knew that voice, but stayed where she was. \u201cYou\u2019re Matthias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He finished his lift before lowering his arms and moving toward one wall, where he hung the straps on two pegs. He took a towel from a third and rubbed it over his face before he turned around. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>She decided to be blunt. \u201cI feel kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the towel over his shoulder and went to a wrought-iron stand that held a large, shallow porcelain bowl filled with water. He splashed his face with the water several times before using the towel again.</p><p>The fact that he wasn\u2019t running after her nor did he even seem worried that she would escape gave Jessa enough confidence to step into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I? Why did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenHance lured you to the restaurant in order to take you.\u201d He took a shirt hanging from the basin stand and pulled it on. \u201cI can protect you better here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenHance wants your ability.\u201d He walked toward her. \u201cTo have it, they must harvest it from your body. That would kill you.\u201d</p><p>She had thought from the way he spoke in the car that he was disturbed, possibly temporarily unbalanced by the attack in the restaurant. Now she was convinced he was permanently delusional. \u201cSo you brought me here to keep GenHance from killing me.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and looked down at her. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep me here so they don\u2019t try to kill me again?\u201d she asked, very carefully.</p><p>\u201cI will protect you, Jessa Bellamy.\u201d He reached out to her, and frowned as she avoided his hand. \u201cI told you in the car, I will not harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you telling me that after you threw me in that car and restrained me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no time to explain,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to move quickly or they would have taken both of us.\u201d</p><p>The way he kept saying \u201ctaken\u201d bothered her. \u201cThere\u2019s time now. Why don\u2019t we go to the police together? You can tell them what you know, and they can arrest Lawson and whoever else was trying to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He began buttoning his shirt. \u201cWill you tell them what you saw when you touched the waiter\u2019s hand?\u201d</p><p>She forced out a sigh. \u201cI told you in the car, I didn\u2019t see anything. I tasted the drugs in the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know what you can do, Jessa. So do they.\u201d He walked past her and left her there.</p><p>She should start looking for a way out, but something told her it would take hours, and even if she did find an exit, it would probably be locked. She had no money, no identification, and no idea where she was. She might still be in Atlanta. She could be in New York\u2014or New Zealand.</p><p>All she knew for certain was that Matthias had brought her here, and since he knew the way in, he had to know the way out.</p><p>Matthias had already disappeared around a corner by the time she moved to follow him, but he didn\u2019t vanish like the girl who had brought her food. She caught up with him in the next tunnel, and kept her distance while sorting out how she might convince him that she didn\u2019t need protection and to let her leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made two more turns, entering a third, darker passage with no doors, and stopped at a narrow, rusting hatchlike door. There he waited until she came as close as she thought was safe.</p><p>\u201cThis is the way out. Go through, climb the stairs to the top, and you will be outside.\u201d He watched her face. \u201cThe nearest police station is three streets to the south.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cYou\u2019re not just going to let me walk out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am not Lawson,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a free woman. Go.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, and to get to the hatch she would have to stand within inches of him. \u201cThis is a trick.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cTouch me. If I am lying to you, you will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like\u2014\u201d She stopped, appalled at how she had nearly given herself away. \u201cAll right. Thank you for ... helping me.\u201d She went to the hatch.</p><p>He made no move to stop her. \u201cDo not return to Atlanta or contact those you know there. They are waiting for you to do that. When GenHance finds you, they will not attempt to take you alive. They have some of the police in their employ. If you are detained, they will see to it that you die in your cell, and then arrange to claim your body.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded like the plot for a bad techno-thriller movie. \u201cHow can you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not the first they have tried to take.\u201d</p><p>The cold, rusted steel of the hatch wheel bit into her palms as she gripped it. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. GenHance is a research-and-development firm. They\u2019re working on cures for birth defects and genetic diseases. They have no reason to kill me.\u201d She met his narrowed gaze. \u201cI\u2019m just a businesswoman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are Kyndred. Made from birth to be unique among humans. Your ability is genetic, Jessa. It was encoded in your cells deliberately. GenHance knows this, and that it can be taken from you and given to another.\u201d He paused, and then said, \u201cThat is why it does not matter whether you are alive or dead. They need your cells, some of which they cannot retrieve without killing you. Your life is not important to them.\u201d</p><p>The thought of deliberately cursing someone else with her ability made bile well up in her throat. \u201cIf I did have this ability, which I don\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think not? With a single touch you can know the darkest secrets any man possesses. Knowledge is power. You use it to bring justice to those who have eluded the law. Another would take those secrets and wield them like a weapon. No one in power anywhere would be safe.\u201d</p> <p>She was letting him talk her into believing his delusions. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were careful when you called the FBI,\u201d he said. \u201cYou used different pay phones away from where you live and work. You kept the calls short, and gave them nothing they could use to identify you. Still I was able to find you. So did GenHance.\u201d</p><p>He knew.</p><p>She released the hatch wheel and looked at the flecks of rust on her hands. \u201cI was going to stop calling them. I promised myself this was the last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have found another way to identify you. The business you do. The people you expose. In time it would have led them to you.\u201d His tone changed. \u201cThey will attack your resources, and they will not stop until you are penniless. Tomorrow they will file a lawsuit against your company and use it to close the business. Your bank accounts will be emptied and your credit cards canceled. Your loans will be terminated and your home will be repossessed.\u201d</p><p>He was talking about everything she\u2019d worked for, everything that mattered to her. Jessa wanted to hit him. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has already begun.\u201d He gestured toward the corridor. \u201cCome and I will show you.\u201d</p><p>Rowan switched off the tunnel monitor as soon as she saw Matthias escorting Jessa Bellamy into the security center. \u201cNo problems so far,\u201d she told Drew on the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s already got Queenie following him around like a groupie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQueenie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boss thinks she looks like a queen.\u201d That still rankled on more than one level. \u201cI expect they\u2019ll be tied up for a couple hours while he shows her the stuff and she has another why-me meltdown. You want to drive up and grab a couple of beers?\u201d</p><p>Drew chuckled. \u201cSure. Right after I quit my job and set fire to my house.\u201d</p><p>She let her voice drop a sultry octave. \u201cAfter all this time talking to me on the phone but never once meeting in person, you know you want to see what I really look like. And, baby? I\u2019m even better than I sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem impressed. \u201cMore like you want to check me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou give great phone,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve got you figured for a six-five, two-twenty, blond ex-surfer dude.\u201d</p><p>He choked on whatever he was drinking. \u201cTry a five-nine, skinny, red-haired, pale-faced geek,\u201d he said after he finished coughing.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThat makes me a head taller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d He sighed. \u201cBetter we stay phone buddies. With my delicate ego, I could never handle facing the real Rowan.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded. \u201cHoney, no one can.\u201d</p><p>After she finished the call. Rowan went to retrieve the tray from the library. Queenie hadn\u2019t touched a crumb, so she picked up the cold grilled cheese and ate it on the way to the kitchen. There she reheated the soup and sipped it from a mug as she prepared dinner. Matthias wouldn\u2019t care, but she could never bring herself to throw away perfectly good food.</p><p>Especially not sandwiches.</p><p>Rowan knew what it was to be hungry; she\u2019d lived on the street for almost three years. Back in the day she\u2019d gotten used to the cold, the wet, the filth, and the dark. She\u2019d found the places where she could hide and rest, in the parks and the alleys and the doorways. In time she\u2019d learned how to make a shelter out of a couple of crates or a cardboard box. During the winter she\u2019d discovered which abandoned buildings were the warmest and safest, and how to barricade herself in a musty old closet for a blissful eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.</p><p>It was hunger that she feared. That grinning death-headed motherfucker had taken a liking to her, thanks to her screwed-up metabolism that kept her perpetually skinny, and once she\u2019d run away from her last foster home he\u2019d stalked her every day. Even after she\u2019d quieted her belly with a handout or a church meal, he\u2019d waited and watched just out of sight, knowing he\u2019d soon get another chance to sink his dull tombstone teeth into her again.</p><p>Living on the street, Rowan discovered she could do a lot of repulsive things, like go two weeks without bathing, wear clothes that were little more than bundles of rags, or bat away a rat with her bare hand. She\u2019d grown wise and tough and strong during those years, fighting to survive. But she\u2019d never been able to shake her obsession with food. When she wasn\u2019t spare-changing or standing in a line outside a soup kitchen, she\u2019d haunt hot-dog stands and pizza joints and burger palaces so she could breathe in the delicious scents. A walk through an open-air food market was for her like cruising through Tiffany &amp; Co. had been for Holly Golightly. She couldn\u2019t even pass a Coke or gumball machine without checking the slot to see if someone had left something behind.</p><p>On the bad days when she couldn\u2019t stop herself, she\u2019d take the subway to Manhattan and walk the rows of restaurants there. She\u2019d pace back and forth in front of the windows, stopping occasionally to look in at the rich people stuffing their faces. She didn\u2019t care about the people; they were no better than her, but the food they ate was so beautiful and elegant that it sometimes brought tears to her eyes. Usually a waiter or busboy would be sent out by the manager to chase her off, but that hadn\u2019t been the worst.</p><p>People coming out of the restaurant would sometimes notice her there, and come over to offer her their take-home containers and doggie bags.</p><p>Then she\u2019d feel the shame of it, of what she was, crawling over her dirty skin, and she\u2019d cringe inside her ragged clothes and stumble away. But first she\u2019d snatch the doggie bag of scraps or the plastic bowl of leftover soup. Because as much as every mouthful shredded her dignity, it held off the specter of hunger for another day.</p><p>Rowan hadn\u2019t wanted to live like a stray dog. She\u2019d tried to get work, even going to stand with the illegals on certain corners where they were picked up every morning and were paid twenty bucks for ten hours of backbreaking labor unloading trucks or clearing out debris from demolition sites. The labor bosses never picked her to join their crews, even when they thought she was a boy\u2014she was too skinny and pale. One told her that he didn\u2019t hire junkies.</p><p>Unwilling to become a thief or a whore, Rowan had tried collecting discarded cans and bottles out of the trash, but it took hours and she burned up too much energy hunting for them. Then she could take only as much as she could carry to turn in at the recycling center, and that amounted to only a dollar here and there. She remembered with perfect clarity the first time she\u2019d been desperate enough to eat a piece of half-eaten fried chicken she\u2019d taken out of a garbage can, and being so sickened by the spoiled meat that minutes later she\u2019d puked until she dry-heaved.</p><p>To this day she couldn\u2019t stand the smell of fried chicken.</p><p>During her last year as a homeless kid she began to think of nothing but food, daydreaming about it, planning elaborate meals she would make someday when things were better. If she saw a TV in an electronics store window tuned to a cooking show, she\u2019d stop and watch it through to the end. She\u2019d go into the public library to get warm on a cold day, and end up spending the afternoon reading cookbooks.</p><p>The fear of starvation followed her into her sleep, swallowing her up in nightmares where she watched her body shrink down to skin over a skeleton in a matter of seconds. When she woke, she would huddle, touching herself with her hands to make sure it hadn\u2019t happened while she\u2019d slept and there was still a little flesh under her cold, clammy skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If it hadn\u2019t been for the sisters, Rowan might have ended up that way.</p><p>She met them when she\u2019d gone to a church to get in line for the free dinner on Thanksgiving Day. It had been crowded, and then the food had run out just as she\u2019d gotten to the front of the serving line. One of the old ladies who was handing out cards with directions to another soup kitchen touched her hand, and without thinking Rowan held on to her.</p><p>The lady stared at Rowan\u2019s face without blinking, and then abruptly asked her to come into the back to help her with the dishes. Having nothing better to do, Rowan followed her.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d Instead of handing her a dish towel, the lady offered a white box. \u201cIt\u2019s a box lunch. They give them to us for serving today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this.\u201d Instantly ashamed, Rowan tried to give it back to her. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t particularly like turkey sandwiches. Too dry.\u201d The thin lips crimped. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take it, I\u2019ll throw it away.\u201d</p><p>That was enough to convince her, and she started to go, but the old lady asked her to sit down at the table. Then she did the same, and started talking to her about living in New York since the forties, and how hard it was for older women on their own to feel safe.</p><p>Rowan wolfed down the skimpy turkey sandwich and celery sticks before she saw the last item in the lunch box: a slice of apple pie in a neat triangular cardboard container. It was the kind they sold frozen by the slice in the supermarket, and was more crust than anything. But her favorite dessert had always been apple pie, and she hadn\u2019t tasted it in more than a year. Seeing it made her throat hurt.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Deborah,\u201d the lady told her. \u201cI have a house in the Bronx that I share with my sister, Annette. She\u2019s a widow and I never married, so living together saves us a little money. Where are you living, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d Rowan tried to look defiant, but she knew she wasn\u2019t impressing the old gal, not with a week of dirt on her face. In a smaller voice she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have anyplace. I\u2019m homeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you use drugs?\u201d When she glared at her, Deborah smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Your eyes are too clear. Are you in any trouble with the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless they catch me. Next year I\u2019ll be too old for them to put me back in foster care.\u201d Angry with herself for saying too much, Rowan placed the slice of pie in front of the old lady. \u201cThanks for letting me have your lunch. It was really decent of you. I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>Deborah\u2019s fine silver eyebrows arched. \u201cTo where? You said you have no place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do stuff like this,\u201d Rowan told her. \u201cChatting up people like me ... it\u2019s dangerous. You don\u2019t know who I am. I could beat you up or mug you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t have any money until my check comes in on the first,\u201d the old lady told her. \u201cBut I have a nice little house, and a spare room, and no daughters or sons to look after me and Annette. How would you like to come and see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to help me even though the food was gone.\u201d</p><p>When Rowan would have replied, she waved one of her hands. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor. I have to take the bus, you see, and I hate to ride it alone. The young men who sit in the backseats are always watching me.\u201d</p><p>Rowan had gone with her, scrounging enough change from her pockets to pay the bus fare. The little house turned out to be just that, a small but tidy place in the Bronx with geraniums in the window boxes and lace curtains in the windows. Deborah\u2019s sister, a slightly older woman with the twisted fingers of advanced arthritis, had welcomed her in like a visiting niece and fussed over her, offering her tea and cookies and then asking her to help with dinner, which Rowan then had to stay and help them eat. As Rowan washed the dishes, Annette began nagging her sister to make her stay with them for the night because the buses had stopped running.</p><p>Rowan wanted to leave, but neither of the old gals would hear of it. Deborah persuaded her to use their tiny bathroom and shower, and when Rowan stepped out of the shower she found a pile of clean, folded old clothes waiting for her on the bathroom counter. Her clothes had been taken away, and later she would find out that Deborah had immediately tossed them out in the trash.</p><p>As elderly and frail as they were, the sisters were amazing bullies, and refused to listen to a word Rowan said. Shortly after nine, Rowan found herself sitting on the bed in the spare room, looking around the neat little room in disbelief as Deborah called out a good-night and that they would see her in the morning.</p><p>She had stayed with the sisters that night, and settled down in that real bed. The clean sheets and fluffy pillows had felt so good and soft against her scrubbed skin that she\u2019d wallowed for a while, but in the end the soft mattress had felt too alien, and she\u2019d tossed the top sheet on the floor and settled down there.</p> <p>In the morning Deborah gently shook her shoulder to wake her. She didn\u2019t say anything about finding Rowan on the floor, but asked her to join them for breakfast. Over homemade waffles, sausage links, and the best coffee Rowan had ever tasted in her life, the sisters offered her a job as their housekeeper and companion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d pay you if we had the money,\u201d Annette said, her kind eyes worried, \u201cbut between the two of us we barely have enough to cover our prescriptions and living expenses. That\u2019s why we can only offer you room and board.\u201d</p><p>Rowan didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a job or family,\u201d Deborah said. \u201cAnnette and I are getting on now, and we need a young person around the house to help us. You need a home. It\u2019s a perfect match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d Rowan protested. \u201cI could be a thief or a killer. I could take advantage of you, clean out this place while you\u2019re sleeping and take off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Deborah said, her expression stern. \u201cYou\u2019re a good-hearted girl; anyone can see that. Besides, by not offering you a salary we\u2019re taking advantage of you.\u201d She stood up. \u201cYour first job is to help me with these dishes. Annette keeps dropping and breaking things.\u201d</p><p>Her sister nodded. \u201cMy arthritis makes me clumsier than a Republican at a gay bar.\u201d</p><p>Rowan knew what waited for her outside that little house, and the last three years had taught her never to question an act of kindness. So she moved into the spare room, and became the sisters\u2019 housekeeper and companion, and repaid their kindness by keeping the little house spotless and whipping up the most delicious meals she could manage from the food they could afford. The two sisters only just scraped by on their Social Security checks, so Rowan became a champion at clipping coupons and finding the best prices at the local markets.</p><p>Every weekend she worked with Deborah cooking for the homeless at the church, and through her work there was offered a part-time job supplying muffins and cookies to the owner of a convenience mart. At the end of the first year she\u2019d lived with the sisters, she was bringing in enough to cover her room and board and improve their living conditions considerably.</p><p>Deborah refused to accept any rent money from her, but Rowan used her earnings to see to it that her ladies never wanted for or needed anything. She would have happily lived with the sisters forever, but one morning Annette didn\u2019t wake up. After her sister\u2019s funeral Deborah seemed to grow old overnight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to pry, Rowan, but I must if we are to talk about your future,\u201d the old lady had said to her one night over dinner. \u201cI can\u2019t go to be with Annette unless I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Rowan assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eighty-seven years old, my dear,\u201d the old lady said. \u201cWe both know I\u2019m not long for this world. I want to leave you the house and everything we have, but our lawyer tells me to do that I must give him your full name and Social Security number.\u201d She studied Rowan\u2019s face. \u201cIf we do that, they\u2019ll find you, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Rowan started to deny it, and then sighed. \u201cYeah, they would. I\u2019d explain but you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know,\u201d Deborah said, looking a little ashamed now. \u201cYou talk in your sleep. The first couple of weeks you were with us, Annette and I would take turns listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know everything?\u201d</p><p>Deborah nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t allow you to be in danger again, so I must sell the house before I go. We\u2019ll put the money in traveler\u2019s checks.\u201d</p><p>Rowan shook her head. \u201cEven if you did that\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t let you\u2014I couldn\u2019t cash them.\u201d She touched the old lady\u2019s frail hand. \u201cLeave everything to the church, the way you and Annette planned to. I\u2019m working now, and when the time comes I\u2019ll find a place. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dead and buried.\u201d Rowan plucked at the edge of her sleeve, tugging it down over the new black dragon tattoo she\u2019d just gotten to cover the other mark. There was one question that remained unanswered, and it was one she had to ask. She glanced up at Deborah. \u201cWhy did you take me in?\u201d</p><p>The old lady looked uncomfortable. \u201cYou know why. We needed a housekeeper. You needed a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but I know what I did to you the day we met.\u201d Rowan took a deep breath. \u201cWhat was her name? The girl you loved?\u201d</p><p>Deborah put a hand to her throat, and then her face crumpled like an old tissue. \u201cMary Margaret O\u2019Brien. She never ... I never told her.\u201d Regret dulled her eyes. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t like me, so there was no point. She married very young, and died in childbirth. It broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it,\u201d Rowan told her. \u201cI was just so hungry. I didn\u2019t even realize what I had done until later, and I should have gone. But you and Annette were so nice, and I was lonely and afraid ...\u201d It was her turn to be swamped by shame. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d She gave her a wistful smile. \u201cIt was a lovely moment for me, to see her face again. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened until Annette and I began to eavesdrop on your sleep. Rowan, can you ... do that ... for everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only for men.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI mean, only for someone who\u2019s been in love with a woman. I can only be a woman.\u201d</p><p>Deborah held out her hand. \u201cThen would you do an old lady one last favor?\u201d</p> <p>Rowan slowly gripped her hand and closed her eyes. She had never used her ability in front of another person who knew about it; not even when she had been screamed at, threatened, and then beaten. She held her breath as she felt the skin on her face stretch and shift as the shape of it gradually changed. Her short, dark hair became a cap of thick ginger curls, and when she opened her eyes and looked at Deborah, she did so through the grass green eyes of Mary Margaret O\u2019Brien\u2014just as she had for a moment when she\u2019d first met Deborah at the shelter.</p><p>\u201cJust as I remember her,\u201d the old lady said, and lifted Rowan\u2019s hand to press a gentle kiss on the back. \u201cThank you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Deborah contracted pneumonia that winter, and never really recovered. A few months later she died as her sister had: peacefully, in her sleep. When Rowan came back to the house after the funeral to pack up her things, she found an envelope tucked away in her bureau, and in it a note from Deborah along with enough cash to pay the rent on a small apartment for a year.</p><p>The church didn\u2019t need our old jewelry, Deborah had written. Thank you for being so good to us, and remember us in your prayers. We love you, Rowan.</p><p>At least someone had loved her once in her life, Rowan thought as she went to the fridge and surveyed the contents. At least she\u2019d had that much.</p> <p>Queenie\u2019s dossier didn\u2019t specify her eating habits, but since Rowan went along with Matthias\u2019s vegetarian diet, they didn\u2019t keep any meat on hand. Italian would just have to do, she decided as she took out a basket of plum tomatoes and a couple of sweet yellow onions. Her hands flew as she took out her frustrations on the ingredients; ten minutes later she had a pot of marinara sauce bubbling on the stove and went to work on hand-making the pasta.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to go to all this trouble\u2014she\u2019d personally seen to it that the pantry was stocked with enough non-perishable supplies to see them through an ice age\u2014but she\u2019d bet good money that Queenie couldn\u2019t boil an egg. Maybe if she reminded Matthias more often that she could do a lot more than simply clean up and whip his ass at pool, he\u2019d start realizing how important she was to him. Maybe he\u2019d finally figure out why she\u2019d followed him around like a goddamn groupie ever since she\u2019d first laid eyes on him.</p><p>Yeah, and if he ever does, he\u2019ll just pat me on the head and tell me I\u2019m sweet and he\u2019s too old for me and I\u2019ll grow out of it someday. Then I will take a pool cue to the blind son of a bitch\u2019s thick skull.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d</p><p>She whirled, her dough knife in her hand. \u201cWhat? Fuck.\u201d She drove the tip of the knife into her cutting board and kept her back toward Matthias until she could compose herself. \u201cSorry. You scared me.\u201d She looked around him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dazed and Confused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa is using the computer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re giving her access to our hardware?\u201d She leaned back against the counter. \u201cWant me to write down the main number for GenHance for her? Might help speed things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa must know what Genaro has done to her. The computer will tell her everything.\u201d He went over to the stove and lifted the cover on the sauce pot. \u201cThis smells very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needs fifteen more minutes.\u201d She took the cover from him and replaced it. \u201cYou want this on a tray, or will Her Highness be dining in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will eat here, as always.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhy are you angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I should go grab a couple of hot prospects, bring them down here, and give them the run of the place. Would liven up things considerably.\u201d His blank expression made her hands curl into fists. \u201cYou left her alone, on a computer, an hour after she wakes up\u2014and you don\u2019t see anything wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa adjusts quickly. She will accept us as her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you forgot, we don\u2019t know Jessa. Jesus Christ, Matt.\u201d She threw out her arms. \u201cYou have no fucking clue what\u2019s going on inside her head right now. She could totally freak out, wreck the equipment, start running around and screaming for help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe she is checking the balance in her bank accounts through the encrypted server,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cAfter that she plans to review the information we have on Genaro, and she will likely send a warning to her friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Okay. Terrific.\u201d She went over to the counter, kicked up the linguine she\u2019d hand-rolled and cut, and threw it into the boiling water. \u201cDinner will ready in thirty minutes.\u201d She stiffened as his hand rested on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not disabled the security measures, so she cannot leave,\u201d he assured her. \u201cBut if we are to gain her trust, she must believe that she can.\u201d</p><p>Rowan exhaled. \u201cShe\u2019s not stupid. She\u2019ll try to go anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think so,\u201d he said. \u201cNot after she learns what Genaro has done. She is a good woman, Rowan. We will persuade her to help us.\u201c He gave her shoulder a fond squeeze before he left the kitchen.</p><p>A good woman. One who could be trusted. Of course she was.</p><p>Steam from the pot heated Rowan\u2019s face but she didn\u2019t move. A year ago she had gone into Matthias\u2019s bedroom one night, a small mirror in her hand, and she\u2019d sat by his bedside and held it, watching as she touched him and let herself change. Her ability allowed her to assume the image of any man\u2019s ideal woman, the woman he would ultimately fall in love with. She\u2019d desperately wanted to know whom Matthias could love, but she hadn\u2019t recognized the beautiful, regal face in the mirror. All she found out was that his ideal woman looked nothing like her.</p><p>Later she saw that face two more times: first when she had uploaded the driver\u2019s license photo of Minerva Starret, and then when she had seen Jessa Bellamy\u2019s face.</p><p>His dream girl had arrived, and nothing would keep them apart now. Not even her love for him.</p><p>As Rowan watched the long strips of pasta dance around the bubbles, she let the tears slip down her cheeks and drip, one by one, into the boiling water.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Lawson didn\u2019t remember much after Genaro left. The doctors came back and he shouted at them to leave him alone, until one of them stuck a needle into his IV tube. From the way things got fuzzy after that it must have been a tranq. He was too doped to fight them when they dragged him over to another gurney, and when they rolled him onto a bed, he passed out. Sometime later he woke up in the dark, fiery pain shooting up into his hip, and howled until someone came. A fat-faced nurse blabbed at him to be quiet as she stabbed what felt like an ice pick into his hip. He would have taken a swing at her, but she split into three and then danced around the room.</p><p>Morning came like a rancid bitch with a rolling pin, pounding on his head and shrieking in his ears. He groped until he found the call button and thumbed it over and over. Another hatchet-faced twat in whites appeared, but this one wouldn\u2019t give him the stuff. She told him he\u2019d have to wait until the doctor made rounds.</p><p>He told her what he thought of her until she left, and then he waited. He hit the call button. The lazy slut of a nurse didn\u2019t come, but spoke over an intercom in the wall. She said the doctor wasn\u2019t in yet. They did that three more times, and then the stupid whore stopped answering the call signal. Like he was nothing\u2014he was nobody.</p><p>Lawson saw an empty wheelchair sitting at the end of the bed, but when he tried to sit up his thigh stretched and the pain became a thousand snakes, crawling and biting their way up his chest. His heart thundering in his ears, he eased back on the pillows and tore two holes in the sheets with his clenched fists.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of hospital are you running here?\u201d Bradford said as soon as the doctor came in. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting on you for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting for thirty minutes, Mr. Lawson.\u201d He picked up the chart hanging from the end of the bed and read the top page.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the needle?\u201d When the doctor didn\u2019t answer, he added, \u201cThe nurse wouldn\u2019t give me anything for the pain. She said you would. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe amount of drugs still in your system makes it unwise to continue to administer IV morphine, and oral analgesics will only promote more bleeding.\u201d The man barely glanced at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tough this one out for now, but in a few days the pain should begin to ease.\u201d</p><p>He was in agony, and the shithead wasn\u2019t going to give him anything at all. He\u2019d have to get to his stash. \u201cJust sew me back together and discharge me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that, either,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cThe man who attacked you completely severed your semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris muscles. We\u2019ll schedule the first surgery as soon as your condition stabilizes, but you will be hospitalized for several weeks, and then you\u2019ll require extensive physical therapy to restore some function to your leg.\u201d</p><p>His condition. Extensive therapy. Some function. Lawson\u2019s gut knotted, but he wouldn\u2019t give in to fear. Not when he had work to do. \u201cGive me whatever papers I have to sign to get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>The doctor met his gaze. \u201cMr. Lawson, listen to me very carefully. The muscles that your attacker cut through are what allow you to bend your knee and extend your hip. If you leave this facility without proper treatment, and they heal as they are, you will never walk normally again, and it will be impossible for you to run, jump, or climb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it later.\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s cold eyes remained pitiless. \u201cContinuing to inject steroids and cocaine won\u2019t help you, either. Aside from inducing the unacceptable levels of aggression and anger you\u2019ve been displaying since you were admitted, your addiction has inflicted a considerable amount of damage to your liver and spleen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slammed his arm into the aluminum bed railing. \u201cI\u2019m not a fucking addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the test results from the lab here in your chart. I understand you run a lab for Mr. Genaro.\u201d The surgeon tossed the folder on the bed. \u201cRead them for yourself.\u201d He turned and left the room.</p><p>Lawson picked up the chart and threw it at the door, shouting after the doctor until his voice gave out, and then collapsed and covered his face with his shaking hands. They wouldn\u2019t give him anything to help him cope, and now they were giving him this runaround about fixing his leg. But he didn\u2019t blame the doctor. He might be as much a prick as Genaro, but he was just another workingman, trying to clean up after all the stupid fucking bitches of the world.</p> <p>Like Jessa Bellamy, the cunt from hell who had done this to him.</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d known the worst thing she could do to him was to have her asshole boyfriend cut him up and cripple him. And there was no way in the world Bradford Lawson was spending the rest of his life on crutches or in a wheelchair while that snotty little tramp danced off laughing at him. She was going to be sorry she\u2019d ever thought of fucking with him.</p><p>Lawson had to get out of here, now.</p><p>His head felt as if it were going to split open, but he forced himself to calm down. He couldn\u2019t risk any more injections; the doctor was probably right about the liver damage. Besides that, the steroids wouldn\u2019t do anything to fix the problem with his leg. But Lawson needed something; he couldn\u2019t stay here and let them fumble around with him, not when every minute he spent on his back was one that Jessa Bellamy didn\u2019t deserve to breathe.</p><p>Genaro thought he was too messed up to go after the bitch, but Lawson knew better. He\u2019d limp into hell if it meant he could drag that conniving slut back out and show her exactly how much damage a blade could do. He could call Genaro and find out if they had her yet, and demand he have the extreme pleasure of putting her down, but the old man wouldn\u2019t keep her alive one second longer than he had to, not now.</p> <p>All Lawson needed was a good leg, and something to knock back the pain. He could steal the morphine from the lab, but the leg ...</p><p>He sat up, swearing as the sudden movement jolted his leg, and then panting out a laugh. He didn\u2019t need to steal morphine, or anything. The answer to all his problems was back at the lab, locked up in secure storage and guarded around the clock.</p><p>A secure storage to which Lawson had the key code. Guarded by techs and security who worked for him.</p><p>He eyed the wheelchair, which had a metal frame, and then groped for the phone beside the bed. After getting the dumb twat at the switchboard to give him an outside call line, he phoned a car service he used for special appointments, and issued terse instructions for a car, a gun, and a driver who could keep his mouth shut.</p><p>Getting out of the hospital bed took the last of his strength, but every time his vision grayed Lawson imagined the Bellamy woman standing just out of reach and smiling. He managed to drag the wheelchair around the bed and hoist himself into it before he sagged over, trembling and covered in sweat.</p><p>The driver slipped into the room a half hour later and, after giving Lawson\u2019s bloodstained bandages a troubled look, silently offered him a Glock, which he tucked out of sight by his hip. The driver then wheeled him out into the hall.</p> <p>No one stopped them on the way out, but Lawson would have shot anyone who tried. The driver had to lift him from the chair into the back of the car, which nearly made him pass out again, and then drove him from the hospital to GenHance\u2019s downtown headquarters.</p><p>Lawson sent the driver away as soon as he was back in the wheelchair outside the main entrance. Delaporte came out personally to open the doors for him.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lawson.\u201d The chief of security wheeled him inside, taking him around the metal detector every employee had to pass through, just as Lawson had hoped. \u201cMr. Genaro will be out until morning.\u201d His eyes dropped to the red-soaked bandage wrapped around Lawson\u2019s thigh. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be back in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my sources called me about Bellamy\u2019s medical history,\u201d he lied. \u201cI have to pass the information along to Kirchner so he can avoid the same problems with the new acquisition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll tell me, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonah already thinks I\u2019m washed-up, Don,\u201d Lawson said, keeping his voice low and humble. \u201cPlease, let me do this much. It\u2019ll prove to him that I can still be useful.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but his tone did. \u201cAll right. But once you\u2019re through with Kirchner, you\u2019ll let my guys take you back to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Lawson nodded. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He reached for the wheels and propelled himself to the elevators, gritting his teeth against the fresh burst of pain that erupted from his thigh. Once inside the elevator, he wrapped his hand around the gun, but Delaporte didn\u2019t follow him inside.</p> <p>On the top floor, Lawson wheeled out, checked the hall, and then rolled down toward the main lab. He knew Kirchner spent every waking hour working on the new acquisition, so he didn\u2019t worry about being discovered.</p><p>Only one tech remained on duty at night, and he opened the door for Lawson as soon as he saw him through the window.</p><p>\u201cSir, we just heard this evening what happened to you.\u201d Carl Linder\u2019s eyes widened as he took in Lawson\u2019s appearance. \u201cJesus, I mean, sir\u2014are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks worse than it is. Close the door, Carl.\u201d While the tech did that, Lawson shifted the Glock and tucked it under a front fold of his patient\u2019s gown. \u201cWould you take me back to the storage area? The old man wants a quick count on the transerum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Carl pushed his wheelchair back through the lab and stopped by the keypad, where Lawson input the code. It didn\u2019t release the locking mechanism. \u201cHere, let me\u2014they just changed all the codes today.\u201d</p><p>If Genaro had changed the codes, it meant someone with access to the lab had fucked up royally and was due for termination\u2014and there was no one else as fucked-up as Bradford Lawson.</p><p>His rage swelled as he thought of how the old man had looked at him in the hospital. What he\u2019d read as pity had been contempt.</p><p>Lawson waited until the tech input the correct code and opened the massive reinforced steel door before he wheeled himself inside. The chilly interior of the storage unit smelled sharply of the alcohol and formalin used to preserve the various tissue and bone samples collected from previous subjects. But Lawson had eyes for only one case containing four shelves of glass vials, each filled with colorless liquid.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get you an inventory form, Mr. Lawson?\u201d Carl asked.</p><p>\u201cWho put this in the case?\u201d Lawson demanded, pointing at the middle shelf.</p><p>Carl wandered over and peered in. \u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2014\u201d He stopped as he felt the muzzle of the Glock touch his ear. \u201cMr. Lawson, don\u2019t kill me, please. I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake this.\u201d Lawson shoved a syringe into Carl\u2019s hand. \u201cFill it with the transerum.\u201d</p><p>Carl fumbled a little, but after a moment he had the needle ready. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInject me in the left thigh.\u201d Lawson kept the pistol against the younger man\u2019s head, and when he didn\u2019t move, he shouted, \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take this stuff,\u201d Carl pleaded. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tested it on the brain-dead guy\u2019s wound yet. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInject me,\u201d Lawson said calmly as he pulled back the edge of the gown to expose the bandaged surface of his leg, \u201cor I\u2019m going to make you his twin brother.\u201d</p><p>Carl\u2019s hand shook, but he managed to plant the needle in the muscle, and slowly depressed the plunger. The transerum felt hot as it poured into Lawson\u2019s tissues and spread out with a beautiful glow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathed as the pain diminished. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I need.\u201d The heat grew more intense as it wrapped around his leg. \u201cFuck, that burns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me call Dr. Kirchner,\u201d Carl suggested. \u201cHe\u2019ll know what to do. He can give you something, you know, to make you more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComfortable.\u201d Lawson looked at him through half-closed eyes, smiling a little. \u201cDo you know what this will do to me? What this will make me?\u201d He laughed as the burning sensations tightened around the huge stitched gash in his flesh. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be like a god. They\u2019ll all crawl to me now. Every one of those sluts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mr. Lawson.\u201d Carl began backing toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll get some clothes for you, huh?\u201d He turned, and then crumpled forward as Lawson shot him three times in the back.</p><p>The heat became the world for a time as the transerum worked quickly up through his torso and down his arm. But Lawson endured the burning sensations, knowing that this was his trial by fire, and that with each passing moment every weakness, every flaw in his body was being systematically destroyed. He could feel the residual glow the transerum left behind, swelling in his muscles as they regained their perfection, knitting together every fiber and sinew that had been damaged. The center of his chest blazed, and he laughed helplessly as he realized that even his damaged liver was being regenerated.</p><p>Finally the blaze inside died, and his senses expanded, bringing the world to him in infinitely minute detail. The rush of the air through the ceiling vent, the faint whir of the centrifuge in the next room, the dripping of the blood still oozing from Carl\u2019s wounds\u2014his hearing had become so sensitive he could probably hear a pin drop from a mile away now.</p><p>Slowly Lawson got up from the wheelchair and felt the bloody bandage stretch across his newly healed muscles. He reached down and ripped it away, running his palm over the unmarked surface on the back of his thigh.</p><p>\u201cBetter than new,\u201d he murmured, and did the same to the bandage on his wrist. The transerum had erased everything, leaving nothing behind, not even a scar. When he took a step, power spread through his limbs, eager and limitless, as if every muscle in his body had been changed into coiled steel. On a whim he jumped over Carl\u2019s body and landed on the other side of the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lawson retrieved the other item he needed before he took stock of his appearance. He couldn\u2019t leave in the stupid open-backed patient\u2019s gown he was wearing, but fortunately Carl was about the same size. He tore the sleeve of the dead man\u2019s shirt as he pulled it from his torso, and chuckled.</p><p>He\u2019d have to be careful now that he was a god, or he\u2019d tear the world apart.</p><p>He dressed, and then pulled a lab coat from a rack in the lab. It covered the bloodstained holes in the back of Carl\u2019s shirt, although he didn\u2019t expect to encounter any opposition when he left the building. Anyone who saw him\u2014even Delaporte\u2014would know he had transcended into a new being. They wouldn\u2019t meddle with the god he had become.</p> <p>Lawson walked down the hall, but instead of taking the elevator he went to the stairwell. After the first flight of stairs he stopped being careful and started jumping from landing to landing. His body sang with strength and ached with agility; by the time he reached the first floor he was laughing again.</p><p>As much as he would have liked to jog back to the city on foot, it would take too much time, so as soon as he left the building Lawson went to where he had left his Lexus.</p><p>The parking spot was empty, which puzzled him; he never lent his car to anyone. The old man must have had it moved to a better spot. He saw that Kirchner had locked his keys in his SUV again\u2014the doctor was incredibly absentminded\u2014and punched a fist through the driver\u2019s-side window. After he brushed the glass off the seat, he got in and drove down to the main gate.</p><p>The security guard, a beefy ex-SEAL named Ted Evans, lowered the gate and stepped out of the shack. \u201cMr. Lawson. Mr. Delaporte just called down. He\u2019d like you to get out of the vehicle and wait here, please.\u201d</p><p>Lawson frowned. Ted Evans had played racquetball with him a few times in the company gym; he seemed like a nice guy. It was a real pity he didn\u2019t understand what had happened to Lawson.</p> <p>\u201cTed, I need you to give Don a message for me.\u201d He climbed out, grabbed the guard by the throat, and threw him into the side of the shack. Before Ted could fall Lawson pinned him there, shoved the Glock into his belly, and emptied the clip into him. The guard left a wide swath of blood on the decorative brick as he slid down to the ground.</p><p>Lawson grabbed Ted\u2019s hair and jerked on it in order to check his eyes and make sure he was done. He heard a quick, liquid tearing sound and straightened, still holding the guard\u2019s dripping, decapitated head. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured, dropping Ted\u2019s head into his lap before he grinned. \u201cGuess I don\u2019t know my own strength.\u201d</p><p>Lawson took the guard\u2019s .32 from his holster, dropped the empty Glock onto the ground, and got back into the SUV. He drove through the lowered wooden arm, splintering it, and then turned off on the road toward the city.</p><p>He\u2019d start at Jessa Bellamy\u2019s house, he decided as he enjoyed the cool breeze coming in from the open window. She\u2019d probably called one of her neighbors by now; women were always worried about silly shit like watering their plants and collecting their mail. He\u2019d talk to each and every one of them until he found out where she was hiding. And then Jessa Bellamy was going to spend some time with him.</p><p>Extensive, quality time.</p><p>TalkBoard.com</p> <p>Forums &gt; Private &gt; TAKYN Group &gt; Lights Out</p><p>October Discussions</p><p>Topic: Miles to Go Before I Sleep</p><p>From: J</p><p>To: All members</p><p>I\u2019ve had to relocate due to problems at home and will not be online until I\u2019ve found a new place.

If you have to move on, remember to turn the lights out before you go.</p> <p>J</p><p>Jessa posted the message to the board before she logged off from the anonymous browser. She used the terminal\u2019s erase function to remove the URL from the cookies list, but even if the computer was caching her session, no one would be able to track who accessed the discussion board and read the message.</p><p>Early on, the Takyn had established a private code and found random public-access sites where they could use it to leave messages for one another; it was one of the many security measures they\u2019d put in place to protect the group. She logged off from the public library\u2019s ISP she\u2019d used to get to the board and returned to the files Matthias had opened for her.</p><p>The documentation he\u2019d scanned was extensive and looked quite genuine, even down to the GenHance masthead and the highly technical content that each memo, report, and case file contained. It supported everything he had told her\u2014that Jonah Genaro was using his corporation as a front, and the philanthropic work he publicly carried out to cure genetic birth defects was merely a smoke screen for a far darker purpose.</p><p>Jessa couldn\u2019t decipher the laboratory test slips, but the doctor\u2019s reports were written in layman\u2019s terms. Ten years ago GenHance had obtained a sample of human cells that had contained what was referred to as an unidentified genetic anomaly. At first research carried out on the sample showed it to be infectious and lethal until a portion of the anomaly was eventually successfully removed from the cells via a complicated process of genetic splicing and cloning. More samples were obtained, and the entire process was repeated.</p><p>It had taken more than a decade to complete the experiment, but according to the final report\u2014signed by Bradford Lawson himself\u2014the resulting transerum contained aggressive blood, tissue, and bone cells that would infect the body like cancer, and then genetically alter the existing cells in order to provide very specific physical and mental enhancements\u2014all without killing them in the process.</p><p>She read over three times Lawson\u2019s predictions of what benefits the transerum would provide before she let it sink in. The transerum had been created in order to change normal people into superhumans, strengthening their immune systems to be almost inviolate at the same time it increased their physical strength tenfold. Then there were the notations on the specific endowments outside the realm of human ability: sensory acuteness, telekinesis, and precognition. There was also a list of abilities that sounded like something out of a science fiction novel: memory manipulation, sonic disruption, and body alteration.</p><p>Lawson seemed to believe that any human given the transerum would undergo a massive genetic change that would allow him or her to acquire these unnatural abilities; the only good thing in the report was that every nonhuman specimen they had tested the transerum on had died within minutes of being injected.</p><p>Jessa closed the file and sat back in the chair, rubbing her eyes. Over time the Takyn had discussed what they believed had changed them: genetic experiments performed on them when they were infants, possibly when they were in utero. What had been done to them was the worst sort of violation, but at least they had had the comfort of knowing from the few details they could put together that the experiments had stopped sometime in the eighties.</p><p>Judith, the youngest member of the group, had offered the most information on that; she had survived the destruction of one of the facilities where the Takyn had been kept as children, and her immediate escape had allowed her memory of the event to remain intact. Paracelsus, whose ability allowed him to see the past while handling physical objects, had traveled to other abandoned facilities around the country while searching for other Takyn. All he had discovered with his ability, however, was an orchestrated effort to shut down the program and disperse the test subjects into the general population.</p><p>Now GenHance intended to restart the experiment, and Matthias and his people were somehow involved.</p><p>If Matthias had created all this as part of some elaborate hoax in order to gain her trust, it was doomed to failure. Although the first time she had touched him hadn\u2019t shown her anything useful, that had been under extreme circumstances with her life in danger, and fear must have affected her ability. Now that things were calm and there was no immediate threat, all she had to do was touch him and she felt sure that, as with everyone else, she would see the truth.</p><p>Her first instinct\u2014always to run away from what she was\u2014faded as she thought of what he had said in the car: You are not the first to be taken. If Matthias had found her, he might have identified some or all of the other Takyn. She couldn\u2019t leave here until she discovered just how much he knew about them; to do otherwise would put her, the Takyn, and all the other children who had been part of the experiments at risk.</p><p>She would have to convince him that she was willing to go along with whatever he had planned. Gaining his trust was essential, but she\u2019d have to go carefully. She couldn\u2019t pretend to be cooperative too fast; he\u2019d never believe her.</p><p>\u201cJessa,\u201d Matthias said from behind her, making her jump. \u201cStop now. Rowan has prepared food for us.\u201d</p><p>Game on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d In reality she was starving, but she couldn\u2019t show any desire to sit down and have dinner with her kidnapper and his jailbait girlfriend. Not yet.</p><p>He reached past her and shut off the monitor. \u201cYou have questions. We will answer them over the meal.\u201d</p><p>She swiveled around to face him. \u201cDo you ever take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and it transformed his features from austerely attractive to simply stunning. \u201cFrequently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone to great lengths to collect all this information on GenHance\u2019s illegal activities. I can\u2019t imagine it was easy or cheap.\u201d She gestured toward the computer. \u201cWhy not take it to the police? He can\u2019t own everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonah Genaro has such influence and wealth that it cannot be calculated,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he does not presently control or own, he can buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some countries I know that would give him unlimited immunity from prosecution, but this is America,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cWe have a free press, and they love nothing more than the opportunity to tear down omnipotent moguls like Genaro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never allow it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa wondered what country he had come from that he would believe one man could have so much power. Or was his conviction just another part of the ruse? \u201cWhether or not he could, by keeping this secret, in effect you are helping Genaro protect GenHance.\u201d</p><p>He studied her expression. \u201cWhat do you think the authorities in this country would do if they discovered the true nature of the Kyndred?\u201d</p><p>He sounded like a conspiracy-theory nutcase. That would explain why he\u2019d brought her to an underground bunker. \u201cThey\u2019d detain ... these people. Test them to see just how powerful they are. Then they\u2019d lock them up or try to use them.\u201d She glanced down and let her voice tremble a little. \u201cAll right, they\u2019d probably do the same thing Genaro is doing\u2014harvest cells so they could make their own superhumans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe do not protect Genaro,\u201d Matthias told her. \u201cWe protect ourselves.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected him to admit that much. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re one of them. One of these Kyndred.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not American.\u201d Real dread washed over her now. \u201cAre there others in Europe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I know of? Only me.\u201d He turned around. \u201cCome. I am hungry, and Rowan does not like waiting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, Rowan doesn\u2019t like much,\u201d she told him as she followed him out of the room. \u201cDoes she have some problem with your bringing me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her.\u201d</p><p>Jessa recalled the open hostility on the girl\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t think she wants to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Matthias stopped her. \u201cRowan is very young and unsure of her place in the world. You are not. This makes her angry. She envies you.\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not that old, and according to you, I just lost everything I had in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you did not.\u201d He opened a door, from which came the scent of tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. \u201cYou have us.\u201d</p> <p>Jessa walked into a large, well-appointed kitchen fitted with the latest appliances and two long granite-topped counters. Four leather-topped stools sat around a center island, where three place settings of Asian china had been placed. A long basket lined with a checked cloth held tiny, steaming rolls gleaming with drizzles of oil and grated garlic, and a colorful salad of field greens, sliced radishes, and shredded carrots filled a wide, shallow wooden bowl.</p><p>Rowan barely spared her a glance as she brought a steaming platter of linguine covered with a rich-looking red sauce to the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting any hotter,\u201d she told Matthias.</p><p>Jessa took the seat nearest to the door while Matthias sat on her right and Rowan hovered at her left. The young girl didn\u2019t actually sit down once over the next forty minutes, but stood and held her plate as she ate, as if she were afraid someone would take it from her.</p><p>Jessa waited until she saw both of them sample the food before she took a small portion for herself; she ate enough to quiet her rumbling stomach but no more. She considered asking questions during the meal, as Matthias had suggested, but when she noticed just how much Rowan ate she completely forgot about it. The skinny young girl demolished three heaping bowls of the salad and half the basket of rolls before digging into the linguine. Only after polishing off her fourth serving of the pasta did she sigh and bring her arm up as if to wipe her mouth on the sleeve.</p><p>She stopped herself, reached for a napkin, and then caught Jessa\u2019s fascinated gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>She offered a tentative smile. \u201cYou have quite an appetite.\u201d Before Rowan could snap her head off, she added, \u201cThis sauce is extraordinary\u2014it\u2019s so fresh. You must have made it from scratch. Are you a chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, no.\u201d She grabbed up the empty dishes and stalked over to the sink to rinse them.</p><p>When Jessa tried to finish clearing the table, Matthias caught her eye and shook his head. \u201cRowan,\u201d he said aloud. \u201cThe meal was excellent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d The girl kept her back to them and scrubbed.</p><p>Jessa picked up the dishes and, before Matthias could stop her, brought them over to the sink. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a chef, you should be. I happen to love Italian food, and your sauce is one of the best I\u2019ve ever tasted. Thank you for making it.\u201d</p><p>Rowan took the dishes from her, hesitated, and then muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She turned to Matthias. \u201cYou want coffee in the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Jessa reluctantly followed him out of the kitchen. \u201cI should stay and help her clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan would not allow it. When she cooks, she is ...\u201d He paused as if unsure of the right words to use. \u201cMaster and servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen is her territory.\u201d Jessa stopped outside the one door she recognized, the one that led to the library where she had awoken. \u201cDoes she have an eating disorder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is her body that is disordered,\u201d he corrected. \u201cFood does not stay with her. If she does not eat like three men, she grows very thin.\u201d</p><p>As Jessa followed him into the library, she thought of Vulcan. He described having a similar problem with fluids; he was forced to drink an inordinate amount of water every day or he rapidly became dehydrated.</p><p>\u201cSo Rowan is also Kyndred.\u201d Thank God she wasn\u2019t one of the Takyn; Jessa couldn\u2019t imagine dealing with someone as surly and resentful as Rowan.</p><p>\u201cYou should know that she is,\u201d Matthias said as he went to crouch in front of the fire and add another split log. \u201cWe are sensitive to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was like you.\u201d She went to the love seat and shook out the crazy quilt before neatly folding it. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake, and so did Genaro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still turn from the truth and hide behind this pretense.\u201d He came over to her, took the quilt from her hands, and tossed it aside. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Being so close to all of Matthias\u2019s muscle and intensity made Jessa want to run. She should have felt afraid or intimidated, and the fact that she didn\u2019t made her feet itch to get the hell out of there. Why was she responding to him like this, as if some unseen energy between them were growing and soon would explode? Common sense told her to first put some space between them; she couldn\u2019t maintain her charade of reluctant cooperation, not when she could feel his body heat melding with hers and smell the dark, compelling scent of his skin wrapping around her.</p><p>She\u2019d move in a minute; there was something she had to know. Something that might explain all of it. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is too soon for trust,\u201d he said, \u201cand too late for doubt.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if he was trying to reassure her or goad her. Maybe he meant to do both. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want many things.\u201d A faint groove appeared in his cheek. \u201cFor now, be with me. Talk with me. Come to know me. You will not regret it.\u201d</p><p>The timber of his voice was set to mesmerize, but she wasn\u2019t giving in to that. Not until she knew exactly what had motivated him to drag her out of her life and down into his. \u201cWhy did you save me, Matthias?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are one of us. All we have is each other.\u201d He lifted his hand and skimmed his thumb beneath her right eye, tracing the crescent of thin skin beneath her lower lashes. \u201cHave you never imagined being with your own kind?\u201d</p><p>Her own kind. She would have laughed out loud had it not been so pathetic. There was no one like her, not even among the Takyn. Their unique abilities made them beautiful and strong and noble, and set them above other people. They were always doing amazing things with them, even in secret. Delilah had the ability to control and use animals, especially dogs, and had tracked and rescued countless people lost in the wilderness. Vulcan used his power over copper to create elaborate sculptures, which he donated to hospitals and museums, while Paracelsus kept an online site that constantly corrected the mistakes historians made about the past. Even Aphrodite, whose ability allowed her to instantly enslave any man she chose, had never used it to hurt anyone. She went out of her way not to.</p><p>Compared to the others, Jessa felt cursed by the shadowlight. It forced her to see the ugliness that existed in every heart, and had condemned her to spend the rest of her days alone.</p><p>His hand moved away from her face, and the cessation of the delicate abrasion made her flinch. This time the contact hadn\u2019t pushed her into the shadowlight\u2014but why? She couldn\u2019t touch anyone without seeing.</p><p>\u201cJessa?\u201d</p><p>Hearing him say her name enfolded her in a tangle of useless emotions and impossible longing. The man was built like a fortress, and he made the woman in her want nothing more than to collapse against him and hold on and feel his arms closing around her. Even as her logic argued against it, her body responded to the promise of his. He had gotten her away from Lawson; he had not harmed her; he would protect her.</p><p>All she had to do was give up everything that had kept her safe for the last ten years, and God only knew what else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like you and your friend. I live alone. I handle things on my own. I don\u2019t need anyone else in my life.\u201d She was laying it on a little too heavy; she sounded as sullen and defensive as Rowan. He would respond better to helpless but courageous. \u201cWhatever abilities I may or may not have, they\u2019re my responsibility. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you could use them to help others like us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat others like\u2014\u201d She stopped as Rowan came in carrying a tray with a stainless-steel thermal carafe and two colorful glazed mugs. Piled on a plate between the mugs were tiny triangular cakes studded with dried cranberries and walnuts.</p><p>\u201cThese are scones. I made them this morning. The coffee is decaf.\u201d She set down the tray and surveyed them both. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. Just drop the tray in the kitchen when you\u2019re through.\u201d She left before either of them could reply.</p><p>\u201cShe bakes, too.\u201d Jessa went over and picked up one of the miniature tea cakes. \u201cWhat does she do on her days off? Rescue people from burning buildings?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe feeds the homeless.\u201d</p><p>Of course she did. Rowan had that look of a true paragon about her. Matthias would sleep with no one less. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan will not admit it, but caring for others makes her happy.\u201d He prepared the coffee and handed her a mug. \u201cYou are the one who rescues the defenseless.\u201d</p> <p>He had no right to talk to her like this. Not in the same breath he\u2019d used to praise his girlfriend. She wanted to throw the hot brew in his face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have your facts straight.\u201d She sat down and hunched forward to compose herself. \u201cI don\u2019t rescue people from anything. I make a living at ruining their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you see your ability?\u201d He sat down beside her. \u201cThe young men and women who work with you would not agree, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve helped a few people in trouble who didn\u2019t deserve what happened to them,\u201d she conceded, forcing a note of shame into her voice. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t excuse the other things I\u2019ve done. Ellen Farley is sitting in jail right now because of me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze turned shrewd. \u201cWould it have been better to let her be killed by her partner?\u201d</p> <p>She absorbed the shock of his question, but only barely. \u201cWhat are you, some sort of mind reader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Genaro, we have friends among the authorities. Not as many, and they are not corrupt, but they help to protect us.\u201d He picked up a roll of paper from the table. \u201cThis was sent to us after the Farley woman was arrested.\u201d</p><p>Jessa took the fax and read it. It appeared authentic, but of course she had no way to tell if it was. It contained an interdepartmental memo from the Atlanta Police Department. According to the terse paragraphs, Ellen\u2019s partner, Max Grodan, had been identified as a fugitive and the primary suspect in a series of murders, and was being extradited to stand trial in Florida.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t involved in the killings,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cShe was going to be his next victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did not ruin her life,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cYou saved it.\u201d</p><p>He was very good, persuasive and sympathetic. She\u2019d have to be the same. \u201cYou said you\u2019ve found others whom GenHance was trying to kill.\u201d She handed the fax back to him. \u201cWho are they, and where are they now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany places,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir names no longer exist. We arranged new identities for them before they were relocated.\u201d</p><p>Welcome to the Freak Protection Program, Rowan had said. \u201cIs that the plan for me?\u201d</p><p>He watched her face. \u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>But not anymore, she silently amended. Maybe she had pushed enough for one night. \u201cI\u2019m a little tired. Am I supposed to sleep in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan has prepared a chamber for you.\u201d He stood. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>The room he showed her to was located a few doors down from the kitchen\u2014probably so Rowan could keep an eye on her, Jessa thought\u2014and contained a bed, a dresser, and a color television. There were also a variety of paperback novels on a three-tiered bookcase and one of the wrought-iron stands with a porcelain basin and jug. She walked around the room, looking for surveillance equipment, but discovered only a small spiderweb and a few patches of dust that Rowan had missed on the carved wooden headboard. She turned around to see Matthias standing in the doorway. Acutely aware of the bed behind her, she offered him a cool smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is fine,\u201d she said, and as he turned to leave she added, \u201cYou never told me what your ability is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glanced back at her. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p> <p>With that he closed the door.</p><p>Matthias enabled the alarm sensor outside Jessa\u2019s chamber door, which, if she opened it, would send a silent alert through their security system. Wherever she went, the tiny transmitter he had planted in the heel of her shoe would track her movements.</p><p>Rowan was waiting for him in the communications center. \u201cShe scrubbed her cookies but I recovered them from the redundant drive.\u201d She pulled up on the screen the message board and the message Jessa had posted. \u201cShe warned her pals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe expected that she would.\u201d He read the message. \u201cYou can decipher the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that complicated. Basically she\u2019s telling the others that she\u2019s alive, in trouble, and she\u2019s giving up control of the group until she\u2019s safe. She wants them to watch their backs and cover their tracks.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cYou do realize, of course, that this whole nice-hostage act of hers is total bullshit.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe is afraid for her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think her friends can take care of themselves just fine.\u201d Rowan used the keyboard and opened another window. \u201cAccording to the late news, Queenie\u2019s just made the feds\u2019 top-ten most-wanted list, which I\u2019d say totally blows the plan. You\u2019d better make sure she doesn\u2019t find a way out of here. Genaro will have her on a cutting table so fast she\u2019ll think she\u2019s sushi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not wish to escape now.\u201d</p><p>Rowan uttered a sour laugh. \u201cMatt, the only thing that girl wants is out of here. She\u2019s just trying to play us to find out how much we know. So quit thinking with the little head.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand over his cropped hair. \u201cMy head is not little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot around her, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cAnd before you ask, no, I\u2019m not explaining that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Allow Jessa access to every room except the library and the armory.\u201d He stood. \u201cI will relieve you in four hours.\u201d</p><p>She cleared the screen and brought up a game of mahjongg. \u201cPleasant dreams.\u201d</p><p>A lifetime of self-discipline and constant travel had taught Matthias to sleep where and when he could. He slept lightly and woke at whatever hour he wished. After Rowan had come to live with him, he discovered she could do the same, but for far different reasons. He also learned never to go near or touch her when she was sleeping, even when he knew she was in the throes of one of her nightmares. The one time he had tried to wake her, she had attacked him like a wounded animal before coming to her senses.</p><p>In his chamber he stripped to his skin, washed, and stretched out on the thin pallet that served as his bed. Jessa would not be sleeping, he guessed as he stared up at the ceiling. She would search the room, wait for some time, and then slip out to search the tunnels.</p><p>He closed his tired eyes and willed his body to relax. Being near her and refraining from touching her had required more effort than he cared to admit, but he was not accustomed to denying himself. When it was convenient, he sought out and used willing women at regular intervals to relieve his physical needs. Now it was decidedly not convenient.</p><p>Silencing his thoughts tonight proved as difficult as relinquishing his mind to the darkness. Sleep was like food: Having too much or too little could make one weak and muddled. He knew Rowan would not allow Jessa to escape, but the resentment and anger she felt toward their unwilling guest might influence her judgment.</p><p>He understood in part why his young friend disliked Jessa\u2014she had enjoyed most of the advantages that life had denied Rowan\u2014but there was more to it than he was sensing. Rowan had a good and generous heart, but she had already closed it against Jessa. It could not be merely out of envy.</p><p>Matthias drifted into the light, dreamless sleep from which he could easily wake, but the sound of footsteps roused him an hour before he was to take over the watch. He knew it was Jessa the moment she slipped into his chamber. Confronting her would serve no purpose but to frighten her, so he lay still and kept his breathing slow, and tracked her by the sound of her movements and the intensity of her scent.</p><p>She moved around the room, searching it methodically before she crouched down to look under his pallet. At first he imagined his chamber appeared odd to her, lacking as it was in most of the modern amenities, but then he remembered how her bedchamber had looked from the skylight. For a woman her needs and tastes were as Spartan as his own. She stood, and his skin prickled as she came around and moved to stand over him. He did not mind her looking down at his nakedness; he knew he was made well and that most women responded to his body with natural desire. He had looked upon her in her bed, too; it seemed fitting that she see him in his. The only sound he could hear was the gentle rush of her breathing, but she remained there looking down at him for some time. Then, so lightly that he barely felt it, her fingertips brushed over the insides of his wrists, first the left and then the right.</p><p>She was checking him for the marks, and touching him as little as possible so she would not use her ability.</p><p>He pretended to stir and turned onto his side, giving her his back. That allowed her to see the left side of his neck, and as he expected, she touched the twining black snake etched into his flesh.</p><p>Slowly her hand moved away, and he fought the impulse to turn over and pull her down atop him. If he did, he would have had her under him before she could gasp, and accepting him into her body before she could speak. His shaft, already stiff and thick, swelled and lengthened at the thought. In another time and place he would have ignored convention and done just that, for among his people no woman would touch a sleeping man unless she wanted his attention.</p><p>Perhaps on some level she did. Touch me again and I will give you what you truly seek.</p><p>To his great disappointment Jessa moved away, and left his chamber as silently as she had entered it. He turned over slowly and listened as her steps retreated before he opened his eyes. He could still smell her in the air, feel the silk of her touch on his skin. He sat up and looked down at his cock, the head of which had emerged, fully engorged and ready to stroke and pleasure.</p><p>Finally he understood what Rowan had meant, and in spite of his discomfort, he smiled. \u201cQuit thinking, little head. The woman is not ready for us.\u201d</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Samantha walked the streets of Atlanta for several hours until most of the euphoria she felt from the girl\u2019s blood faded away. A few times she considered calling Lucan on her mobile to let him know where she was\u2014he didn\u2019t like not knowing\u2014but she wasn\u2019t ready to listen to the inevitable lecture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes, she was Darkyn. No, she had no choice but to live on human blood. Yes, she could make a little more effort in the assimilation department. But what was hammering inside her skull, what was really going to dig in and do a lot of damage, were the residual echoes of Abby\u2019s thoughts. She could still feel the girl\u2019s pleasure, still hear everything that had flashed through her head. Whether it would fade like the physical afterglow of feeding or remain imprinted was yet to be seen, but whatever happened she\u2019d have to live with what she\u2019d done to that girl. She\u2019d taken her blood and in the process had brainwashed her.</p><p>Maybe the same way Lucan had done to her the first time he\u2019d fed on her blood.</p><p>Her phone rang in her pocket. Lucan had a habit of reprogramming her ringtone without telling her; tonight it played the theme to the movie Twilight. She considered chucking the device down the sewer, but that would only make him come looking for her.</p> <p>She flipped open the phone. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to, sweetie,\u201d Alexandra Keller said, \u201cbut the pain currently drilling a hole in my skull won\u2019t go away, and morphine no longer works on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the doctor,\u201d Sam snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about it. I\u2019m just a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also the only Kyn who was changed by my blood,\u201d Alex reminded her. \u201cThat means whenever you\u2019re in trouble, I feel it. As for what that feels like, ever stick an ice pick in your ear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t give me ideas.\u201d Sam stopped and looked around. She was standing at the back of the Armstrong building. She\u2019d come back to him like some sort of goddamn homing pigeon. \u201cEverything is fine, Alex. I\u2019m just not having a great night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame here. If everything is fine, why do you sound so pissed off?\u201d</p><p>Sam looked up at the lights on the fourth floor. \u201cLucan took me out to hunt. My first time. I did it, but I had no idea ... I\u2019ve been using him or bagged blood since I changed. You know what it\u2019s like when you use a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I do,\u201d Alex admitted. \u201cI have yet to sink fangs into anyone other than Michael. Was it that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore, when I was human, I thought I felt all those things because I loved him.\u201d She walked slowly down toward the loading platform. \u201cIt happened again with the girl I used for blood tonight. You feel the exact same thing. When you bite them, it\u2019s like an aphrodisiac on ricochet. They go crazy for you, and you feel that, and then you want them just as much. I can\u2019t explain it better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done something similar.\u201d Her tone remained neutral. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with this, Sam? Would you rather have the girl feel pain and horror, like in the movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, no, of course not.\u201d Sam stopped at the front entrance to the building and sat down on the bottom steps. \u201cIt just makes me wonder, you know? I never fell in love until I met Lucan, and then it happened so fast ... but I didn\u2019t fall in love until after he used me for blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney, I got to spend a little time with Luc after he grabbed me in Fort Lauderdale, and he would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Alex.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to hear about Lucan and what he\u2019d never do. \u201cIt was bad enough finding out I look just like the chick he had a crush on in the seventeen hundreds or whatever. Maybe that\u2019s the whole deal for him: that I look like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset, Sam, but honest to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I do that to someone else?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat if I bite them and make them think they love me and then somehow infect them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou infected me when Lucan gave me your blood, and you weren\u2019t even in the room\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you shut up and let me finish one fucking sentence, please?\u201d Alex waited until she heard silence, and then added, \u201cThank you. Okay. Let\u2019s get a few things straight. You can\u2019t infect anyone unless they\u2019re already carrying Darkyn DNA, they\u2019re dying, and you give them your blood. That\u2019s the only way it happens without killing them. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam muttered.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the deal is between you and Lucan right now,\u201d Alex continued, \u201cbut you are not now nor have you ever been a stand-in for Frances. He loves you, kiddo. He told me, and I saw his face and his eyes when he said it. He wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you that when I was human,\u201d she reminded her, \u201cand he was feeding on me. Not a lot, but enough to influence his feelings. You should have heard how he talked about humans. He called us ...\u201d She trailed off as she tried to remember the exact phrase. \u201cHe called us a movable feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf all you were to Lucan was a Happy Meal, then why did he give you my blood after Dwyer shot you? Why was he so desperate to save your life?\u201d When Sam didn\u2019t reply, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful girl, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re great in the sack, but really, sweetie. Look at the guy.\u201d</p><p>Samantha felt the hair on the back of her neck prickle, and turned around to see Lucan standing a few steps above her. She didn\u2019t know how long he had been listening, but his face had no expression and he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s big, he\u2019s blond, and he\u2019s a badass,\u201d Alex was saying on the phone. \u201cHe can have\u2014correction, probably has had\u2014any woman he wants.\u201d</p><p>She stood up slowly. \u201cThey\u2019re all like that. Maybe that\u2019s all there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you why I fell in love with Michael, but I know it\u2019s not just the bond of blood,\u201d she said, all the humor vanishing from her tone. \u201cYou remember the high lord. Richard Tremayne. Richard\u2019s seneschal, Korvel, bonded me to him when I was separated from Michael. We spent a lot of time together, and then Richard hurt me and Korvel took care of me. That was all it took. Even after I left Ireland, Korvel came to me in my dreams. Worse, when I was asleep I called him to me. That\u2019s how powerful these bonds are.\u201d</p><p>Sam began walking up the steps. \u201cSo it took you over, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of me,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI wanted to have sex with Korvel, sure, but I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t, not even when I was dreaming. The love I felt for Michael kept pulling me back. When I finally realized what was happening, I knew what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>She stopped one step below Lucan. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Michael everything.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd do you know what that stupid bastard did? He offered to let me go back to Ireland. He said if I wanted Korvel more than him, he\u2019d just have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyn males usually go insane when they\u2019re separated from their life companions.\u201d Sam saw her lover\u2019s eyes turn from misty gray to glittering chrome.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t think Mike would have waited around for the straitjacket,\u201d Alex said. \u201cSam, you know this works both ways. If you two split up, whatever happens to him probably will happen to you, too.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and skimmed her fingertips across the grim lines of his mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t ever leave him, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d She could face it as well as him. \u201cI wake up and I want him. I go to work and I think about him. I come home and I can\u2019t wait to touch him.\u201d She dropped her hand to his shoulder and took the last step so that she stood only an inch from him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can live without him anymore, Alex. Even if there were a way to get over this thing between us, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s only one more question I have for you,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>She closed her eyes as Lucan curled his hand around the back of her neck. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still on the phone with me?\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed helplessly as Lucan took the phone from her and spoke into it. \u201cGood evening, Alexandra. My sygkenis bids you good-night and farewell.\u201d He listened for a moment. \u201cYes. I will tell her.\u201d He switched off the phone and tossed it over his shoulder before he scooped Sam up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHow much trouble am I in?\u201d Sam asked as he carried her inside, mainly so she wouldn\u2019t break down and cry all over him.</p><p>\u201cNone, unless you were lying to Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>Lucan carried her into the elevator and from it to their suite. Only when they were inside and he had kicked the door shut did he set her down on her feet.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t pissed off at me,\u201d she said carefully.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am that.\u201d He tilted her face up to his. \u201cYou should know that if you ever try to leave me, I will hunt you down and drag you back to my stronghold.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say now. But understand what that means, my sygkenis.\u201d His fingers tightened on her jaw. \u201cAlex\u2019s blood may run in your veins, but you belong to me, and I am not Michael Cyprien. I will not play the noble lover and sacrifice my love for you. You cannot bring someone like me out of the darkness and then change your mind about it. I am yours, Samantha. You have all of me. The beautiful mask and the monster beneath it. And make no mistake: I am a monster. One who will happily, joyfully tear apart anything that comes between us. As you yourself have already witnessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like threatening the one you love to keep a relationship together.\u201d She rested her forehead against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m in love with a monster, and tonight when I fed on that girl, I felt like a monster, so that kind of works out.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of what happened at the club. What happened between us when I was human. Alex said I need to talk to you about it. Can we do that without you reducing this place to a pile of smoking rubble?\u201d</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>\u201cThe building is safe,\u201d Lucan said, \u201cbut I cannot guarantee the telephone will survive the night.\u201d He strode over, snatched up the receiver, and said, \u201cWhat now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam watched as he listened.

The statue, believed to be deliberately concealed at the ancient port site, was discovered to contain an inscription referring to a conspiracy to assassinate Roman emperor Octavian Augustus.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very excited,\u201d the team\u2019s chief archaeologist, Professor Jeffrey Williams, said during the international press conference held in Rome on Saturday. \u201cThis is the largest and most well-preserved statue of Minerva Victoria ever found, and the early evidence indicates that it was deliberately buried very early in the first century. As soon as the kids translated the inscription on the inside of the base, we understood why it was concealed in such an unorthodox manner.\u201d When asked how the team located the statue, the professor became somewhat chagrined. \u201cI wish I could say we found it because of our meticulous research, but the area where we were working was not considered of any particular value, and has been used for years as an outdoor laboratory to demonstrate proper procedures on a dig. To be honest, it was simply dumb luck that all of the archaeologists who surveyed the site before our team never explored the interior tunnel where the digging equipment is stored, or they would have found the vault a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>The enormous marble statue, reported to be over eight feet tall and more than three feet wide, depicts the ancient Roman goddess Minerva (known to the Greeks as Athena) as winged and poised in a classic victorious stance. While the majority of statues from the era were sculpted with solid bases to provide better stability, a fitted marble slab concealed the Minerva statue\u2019s hollow base interior. The statue, encased in many layers of protective wools and linens, was found sealed inside a stone vault inside the service tunnel, which was originally excavated in 1911.</p><p>Professor Williams believes the Latin inscription found inside of the base provides the first solid evidence of a conspiracy to murder the emperor Augustus, long believed to have been poisoned in 14 CE by his ambitious wife, Livia, so that her son, Tiberius, could assume the throne.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not releasing the translation of the inscription until the statue has been dated and authenticated,\u201d Professor Williams told reporters. \u201cIt would be irresponsible to do otherwise. What I can tell you is that once we prove this new evidence is legitimate, the historians are going to be busy rewriting a lot of their books.\u201d</p><p>2 October 2008</p><p>Tragedy Strikes Student Archaeological</p><p>Dig at Ostia Antica</p><p>Sixteen American archaeology students and their instructor, Jeffrey Williams, have been killed in a tunnel collapse at the archaeological site where yesterday they had evidently discovered an intact statue of the goddess Minerva.</p><p>Maria Salza at the Center for Archaeological Studies in Rome issued this statement: \u201cWe extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families of the young Americans who lost their lives in this terrible tragedy.\u201d</p><p>According to witnesses, the students and their instructor had just entered the tunnel to retrieve some equipment when the collapse occurred. Although in the first hours after the collapse rescue workers held out hope of finding survivors, subsequent inspection of the site with specialized equipment revealed all of those who were caught in the collapse were killed instantly.</p><p>Workers have now begun the grim task of digging out the tunnel to recover the bodies and determine the cause of the tragic accident. An international search-and-rescue team provided by American biotech corporation GenHance, Inc., will be arriving this afternoon to provide their assistance.</p> <p>\u201cOur people will do whatever it takes to help with the recovery efforts,\u201d GenHance CEO Jonah Genaro told reporters. \u201cWe will also be bringing home the victims of this terrible tragedy. It\u2019s the least we can do for their families and loved ones.\u201d</p><p>Police are still interviewing witnesses, many of whom claim they heard an explosion just before the tunnel collapsed.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Jessa spent most of her first night in Matthias\u2019s underground labyrinth searching through the tunnels and rooms. He and Rowan seemed to be the only occupants, and neither of them tried to stop her from moving about freely. She discovered why when she retraced her steps and found her way back to the communications center, the kitchen, and the library, only to find that she had been locked out of those rooms.</p><p>She guessed Matthias didn\u2019t want her helping herself to Rowan\u2019s knives or the computer system, but she didn\u2019t understand why the library had been made off-limits. Antique furniture and old books weren\u2019t much of a threat\u2014unless they were concealing something else.</p><p>If I had to protect sensitive information, Jessa thought, I certainly wouldn\u2019t hide it in a filing cabinet.</p><p>Nothing told her where she was, except that she was obviously underground. She had to move carefully to prevent her footsteps from echoing, and the thick concrete sides of the tunnels and the absence of windows gave the place a cavelike feel. She was glad she\u2019d never developed any form of claustrophobia, or she would have been climbing the walls by now.</p><p>None of what she saw looked new; from the stains, cracks, and condition of the concrete she guessed it was at least thirty or forty years old. She\u2019d heard stories from her father about nuclear attack shelters that many paranoid American citizens had built during the Cold War era; for a time it had been quite a trend to have a bomb shelter in the backyard.</p><p>Was this place one of them? If it were, why would Matthias have installed a fireplace? The smoke had to be channeled up to the surface through a chimney or ventilation system, or he and Rowan would have suffocated. How was he dispersing the smoke without revealing the presence of his secret bunker?</p><p>She stopped in her tracks as she remembered something Matthias had said: GenHance wants your ability. To have it, they must harvest it from your body.</p><p>Was this some sort of research laboratory, like the underground facilities Paracelsus had discovered during his searches for evidence about their past? Had she been brought here to be experimented on again?</p><p>Jessa went to the next door, tried it, and found it unlocked. When she looked inside, however, she didn\u2019t see test beakers, Bunsen burners, or medical equipment. She saw big, comfortable-looking pillows scattered on the floor and three tiers of wall-to-wall shelving. Thin, brightly colored books stood in neat rows, arranged by height, and stretched the length of each shelf. She moved into the room, went to the nearest shelf, and took down one of the books.</p><p>The colorful front cover read DK Eyewitness Books and Space Exploration and featured a bird\u2019s-eye view of an astronaut in a space suit standing in the open cargo bay of the space shuttle with Earth looming like a giant behind him.</p><p>What was Matthias doing with a book that was published for children?</p><p>She replaced the book, which was one of more than a hundred DK books on the shelf. Beside them were more picture books, ranging from Old Penn Station by William Low to The Story of Negro League Baseball by Kadir Nelson. All of the books featured exceptionally vivid illustrations paired with simple text, and all seemed to be about every subject under the sun, from travel to history to biographies of famous people. All had been read many times, judging by the dings to the covers and the faint cracks on the spines.</p><p>As harmless as they seemed, the books didn\u2019t comfort her. If Matthias and Rowan had brought children down here ...</p><p>She backed out of the room and closed the door. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to believe they were involved with the doctors who had experimented on her and the other Takyn when they were children, or that the experiments were still ongoing. Paracelsus and Vulcan would have found some evidence of it.</p><p>She checked several other rooms, bracing herself each time as she expected the worst, only to find the most innocuous of discoveries: closets packed with collections of old radios, calculators, small electric motors, and lamps. In the next room she found a collection of fifty different folding chairs neatly arranged in concentric circles, and in another she wandered through a maze of stereo equipment. None of what she saw made sense to her; if Matthias were collecting these things, he didn\u2019t seem to care what they were worth. He displayed rare antiques next to yard-sale finds.</p><p>Her search also made her realize that Matthias was fond of very old weaponry, which he displayed in several locked collectors\u2019 cases hung throughout the tunnels. Most were some form of dagger or short sword, but there were two cases of antique pistols and one large collection of spiked hammers and maces. Each weapon had the marks of age and care; most had been carefully polished to a weathered gleam. The pristine condition of the blades reminded her of the old bronze sword in the glass case over the library fireplace. He had never cleaned that one, she guessed, not with the dark bloodstains streaking the ancient metal.</p><p>She wanted to ask Matthias why he was collecting things in such odd ways, and then she turned a corner and picked up a trace of his scent on the air. Everything seemed slightly magnified in this place; the smells seemed to be much sharper and more pervasive. But by following Matthias\u2019s scent she was able to locate his room, and after listening at the door for some time she decided to look inside.</p><p>As soon as she saw his bare body stretched out on the camp bed she should have backed out and left, but he didn\u2019t wake, and she couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to search his room. He kept almost nothing in the small chamber, which made it obvious he came here only to sleep. After moving quietly around the interior, she stooped to glance under the thin and uncomfortable-looking mattress upon which he slept, but found nothing, not even dust bunnies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stood and looked down at him. Asleep he should have looked younger or vulnerable, but his strong, handsome features appeared unchanged. Only when he smiled, she decided, did he change into someone less godlike.</p><p>For the first time she wondered whether he were one of the Takyn, and didn\u2019t yet realize who she was. They had been so adept and thorough at concealing their exact abilities as well as their identities that she had no way of recognizing one of her friends in the flesh, unless ...</p><p>At some point during the experiments that had been performed on them, each of the Takyn had been tattooed with the image of an animal. After searching one of the abandoned facilities, Paracelsus had told the group that the doctors had used the tattoos to name them as well as classify their abilities. Aphrodite had suggested it might be better for all of them if they kept their tats under wraps, but Jessa had taken the extra step of having her own removed, which had taken several months and many painful treatments.</p> <p>She reached down, bracing herself before she ran her fingertips quickly across the inside of his wrist, feeling it for the telltale texture left behind by laser treatments. Fortunately the shadowlight didn\u2019t take her, and all she felt was smooth skin over dense muscle. His other wrist proved to be just as unmarked.</p><p>Jessa straightened and bit at her bottom lip. Some of the others hadn\u2019t been marked on the wrists or arms; Delilah said her tattoo had been placed in an unmentionable area, while Paracelsus complained of always having to keep his shirt buttoned to the collar to cover the ink on his collarbones.</p><p>Matthias moved, making her catch her breath and freeze in place, but he only turned over onto his side and settled back into sleep.</p><p>He was marked.</p><p>Jessa stared down at the snake tattoo, wound in the shape of a sideways figure eight, that had been inked into the side of his throat. The only color used had been black, but the work was particularly detailed; she could count the tiny individual scales along the entire body, and counted three mock lights reflected in the reptile\u2019s single eye. The snake was depicted as biting\u2014no, devouring\u2014its own tail.</p> <p>She knew enough about symbolism to recall that the snake eating itself represented infinity. What do you think should last forever?</p><p>She didn\u2019t meant to touch the tattoo, but something about it drew her fingers like a magnet. Only after a minute had passed did she realize something else\u2014sometimes she could get away with a quick touch, but extended or repeated contact with anyone always triggered her ability. Yet touching Matthias like this was not sending her into the shadowlight.</p><p>Surviving a blizzard and an avalanche isn\u2019t a sin, she thought, shivering a little as she remembered the brutal cold he had endured. Why would such a terrifying experience make you feel guilty or ashamed?</p><p>Curious as she was to discover the reason he felt guilt and shame over his ordeal, Jessa had to be practical. The snake didn\u2019t prove anything except that Matthias had been tattooed sometime in the past. If she were going to believe his story about the Kyndred and being part of some rescue operation, she\u2019d need more to go on than a mark on his neck.</p><p>Although she tried several times to find it, Jessa couldn\u2019t locate the security hatch Matthias had shown her. She felt sure she was moving through the correct tunnels, but found herself reaching only one dead end after another. Exhaustion began to tug at her feet, and reluctantly she returned to the room he had given her.</p><p>The door didn\u2019t have a lock on the inside or outside, so she took the straight-backed chair sitting beside the washbasin and propped it under the knob. It was too flimsy to keep the door shut for long, but if someone came in, the sound of it falling would wake her.</p> <p>Normally she slept nude\u2014another habit she and Matthias shared\u2014but she kept her clothes and shoes on as she curled up on the bed. When the opportunity to escape came, she thought as she closed her eyes, she had to be ready.</p><p>Jessa fell asleep almost as soon as her head touched the pillow, and she was so tired she didn\u2019t expect to dream. Yet when oblivion overtook her, she felt herself drawn through the darkness back to more familiar surroundings: her bedroom in her apartment.</p><p>She stood beside her bed and saw someone in it, covered by her sheets. On one level she knew she was seeing herself in the past, but the shape under the linens seemed wrong. It was bigger and wider than it should have been.</p><p>Carefully she reached out to draw back the sheet, and went still as a large, hard hand caught her wrist and pulled her down on top of the body. Another male hand pushed aside the linen to reveal Matthias\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t real.\u201d She rolled off him onto her side. \u201cThis never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched you.\u201d His gilded jade eyes shifted as he looked at her skylight. \u201cFrom there.\u201d</p><p>Jessa glanced up. \u201cFrom the roof?\u201d He nodded. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d His fingers smoothed a piece of hair back from her face. \u201cYou were restless that night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have trouble falling asleep,\u201d she admitted, placing her hand on his hip as if it were perfectly natural. She remembered what she usually did when she was restless and groaned a little. \u201cYou saw what I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. You were beautiful.\u201d He brushed a fingertip against the fringe of her lower lashes. \u201cI wanted so much to come inside.\u201d His fingertips moved down to rub across her lower lip. \u201cYou brought me pleasure that night. Watching you, I shared yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a dream.\u201d She ran her palm up to his waist, and then over the corded, unyielding muscles of his abdomen. \u201cNone of this is really happening.\u201d</p><p>He seemed amused now. \u201cAnd if some of it did?\u201d</p><p>Jessa buried her face against his chest and laughed. \u201cI think I just got even.\u201d As she spoke, her mouth brushed against his skin, and she felt his body tighten. \u201cGod, this feels so real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be.\u201d His hand cradled the back of her head as his other arm curled around her, urging her closer. \u201cBetween us, it can be everything you\u2019ve imagined and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even bump into a stranger without seeing the ugliness that they hide inside. Now I\u2019m touching you, and all I see is you.\u201d Jessa lifted her face. \u201cWho are you, and why are you in my dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods brought us together,\u201d he murmured as he bent his head. \u201cNothing will keep us apart.\u201d</p><p>Before Matthias\u2019s mouth touched hers, Jessa woke to the feel of something prodding her in the shoulder. She opened her eyes, expecting to see him, but only Rowan\u2019s scowling face hovered above her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Queenie,\u201d the girl said. She was nudging her with a wooden spoon. \u201cCome on, wake up. I haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d</p><p>Jessa sat up and blinked. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakfast time.\u201d Rowan thumped a tray filled with food onto the end of the bed. \u201cFrench toast with almond butter, sliced peaches, and black coffee.\u201d She took a neatly folded pile of garments from under her arm and dropped them next to the tray. \u201cClean underwear and clothes, brand-new and in your sizes. Before you ask, I was the one who checked your labels while you were napping yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jessa said.</p><p>\u201cBring the tray back to the kitchen when you\u2019re done. If you want a shower, your bathroom is at the end of the hall on the right. The hot water lasts about five minutes, so I\u2019d make it fast.\u201d</p><p>Jessa eyed the chair, which was back in its original place by the basin. How had Rowan dislodged it and put it back without waking her? Or had Matthias come in and ... She wanted to crawl under the bed now. \u201cDid he come in here to check on me?\u201d</p><p>Rowan arched her brows. \u201cI cook for him, Queenie; I don\u2019t keep a GPS on him.\u201d</p><p>It must have been only a dream, Jessa decided. One she\u2019d think about later, when she was alone. \u201cLast night the kitchen was locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open when the rest of us are awake and harder to stab with the kitchen knives.\u201d She turned to go.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need to go into the kitchen for that,\u201d Jessa pointed out. \u201cI could have pried open one of those weapons cases.\u201d</p><p>Rowan looked back at her. \u201cWith what? Your teeth?\u201d</p><p>Good point. \u201cWhy do you have all those old weapons down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt just likes to collect them. It\u2019s a guy thing.\u201d She hesitated, and then said in a gruff tone, \u201cI serve three meals a day, but you can use the kitchen when I\u2019m not working in there. Whatever you mess up, you clean up, or you and I are going to have a problem. Matthias is a vegetarian, and I cook for him, so don\u2019t go looking for anything that had legs.\u201d</p><p>Jessa eyed the wooden spoon in Rowan\u2019s hand. Obviously the girl knew about her ability or she wouldn\u2019t have used it\u2014but there was something more to this ongoing hostility of hers. \u201cIf you like, I can help out with the cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the tentative hand of friendship is extended, right on schedule.\u201d Rowan\u2019s upper lip curled. \u201cBe still, my fucking heart.\u201d She walked out.</p><p>Jessa made a trip to the bathroom before she ate. Rowan\u2019s breakfast tasted as delicious as dinner the night before, and she didn\u2019t have difficulty finishing it. She carried the tray back to the kitchen, where she found a fresh pot of coffee but no Rowan. She poured herself a second cup to sip as she hand-washed her dishes and put them in the rack beside the sink to air-dry.</p><p>\u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>Jessa turned quickly and almost bumped into Matthias\u2019s chest. It reminded her so much of the dream that she jumped backward to avoid the contact. \u201cGod, you\u2019re like a cat. What did you do, teleport in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is teleport?\u201d He said the word slowly, as if for the first time.</p><p>\u201cIt means ... Never mind.\u201d He was just very quiet, and she needed to stop thinking about her ridiculous dreams and pay more attention to her surroundings. \u201cI\u2019d sleep better if there were a lock on my door.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t be worried about dreaming anymore, either.</p><p>\u201cYou do not need one.\u201d He gave her his flash of a smile. \u201cYou are safe, Jessa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs you keep telling me.\u201d She made the mistake of gazing into his eyes and once more fell into that golden jade trap. She\u2019d seen men with prettier eyes, but none with the intensity of his. Whenever he was around her, he gave her his full attention. It should have made her feel self-conscious, not gratified. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d He retrieved a mug from the cabinet and poured a cup of coffee for himself.</p><p>She looked around the kitchen. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any clocks down here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe do not need them.\u201d He looked at her clothes. \u201cI asked Rowan to fetch fresh garments for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave me some.\u201d Now she felt self-conscious\u2014and grubby. \u201cI was going to change after I take a shower.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his coffee. \u201cTell her if you need any potions or paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThe unguents and colors women use.\u201d He made a vague sweeping gesture. \u201cTo put on the face and skin after you bathe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean lotion and makeup?\u201d she suggested. When he nodded, she asked, \u201cYour English is good, but I can tell it\u2019s not your native language. Where do you call home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo place.\u201d Something\u2014anger, regret\u2014darkened his expression before he turned away from her. \u201cWhen you are finished bathing, come to the library. We have much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>The rising sun irritated Lucan\u2019s eyes even after he put on the dark glasses his sygkenis had purchased for him, but Samantha seemed unbothered by the light. More annoying than his discomfort was the fact that they were being made to wait at the entrance to the property. \u201cWhy are we standing here when we could be inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a search warrant to enter the building without an invitation,\u201d Samantha told him in an absent tone. She was watching the mortal standing inside the small shack that served as a guard post. \u201cOpen your window, please.\u201d</p><p>Lucan pressed the button and held it until the glass slid down into the door. He understood her request as he breathed in a particularly sharp scent. \u201cThe sentry is afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, and not of us. Wait here.\u201d Samantha got out of the car.</p> <p>While his sygkenis questioned the guard, Lucan sat back and closed his burning eyes. He had not tried to dissuade her from joining him on the hunt for this rogue Kyn; he knew from past experience that even if he ordered her to stay behind, she would simply follow him. Even when she had been human she had been utterly fearless.</p><p>Except when it came to her nature, he silently amended. Samantha could hunt vicious killers day and night, but when it came to feeding herself, she balked at the necessity as if she were a nun being asked to join an orgy.</p><p>He understood her aversion to their need for human blood. She was a child of the twenty-first century, and had grown up in a land of affluence and compassion. In America, it was said, no one needed to go hungry or die of starvation. She had also been brainwashed by dozens of ridiculous movies about vampires, all of which portrayed their natures as evil and their dependency on blood as uncontrollable and murderous.</p><p>The truth was far more complicated. After returning to their homelands from the Crusades, Lucan and many of his brother warrior-priests known as the Knights Templar had been stricken with the plague and had died. Three days after their deaths, they came back to life, clawing their way out of their graves and rising to walk the night. The warriors discovered they were no longer human, but vampiric creatures who could feed only on human blood. They were also incredibly strong, fast, and, with a miraculous ability to spontaneously heal, nearly impossible to kill. Each transformed warrior discovered he possessed a unique psychic talent along with a beautiful, powerful scent, and that the combination of both allowed them to bespell humans as well as control their minds. They became known by many as the \u201cdark Kyn\u201d of humanity.</p><p>The Darkyn soon discovered that they had to protect themselves and their kind, and formed secret communities known as jardins with their own ruling lords, territories, and strongholds. They also discovered that they didn\u2019t have to kill humans in order to survive, and began the work of learning how to coexist with them while hiding among their societies. They transformed some humans into their own kind, and used other, trusted mortals as their servants and guards.</p><p>A century passed, after which two things happened: The Darkyn lost the ability to change mortals, and every attempt they made proved fatal to the human. At the same time, a group of religious zealots became aware of the existence of the Darkyn, and vowed to hunt down and kill the former Templars. The zealots formed an order known as the Brethren, and while impersonating Catholic priests pursued the Darkyn all across Europe. As they hunted, captured, tortured, and killed the former Templars, the Brethren also realized they would not outlive their enemy. So they began breeding, raising, and training their own replacements, and the secret war between the Brethren and the Darkyn had endured for the last six hundred years.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until early in the twenty-first century that Michael Cyprien, the seigneur who ruled over all of the jardins located in America, had accidentally changed a human into a Darkyn. Dr. Alexandra Keller, whom he had abducted and forced to perform reconstructive surgery to restore his ruined face, had become the first human in six centuries to survive the process of transition\u2014this, according to Alex, only because she had first been genetically altered by the Brethren to become a vampire hunter. It was Alexandra\u2019s blood that Lucan had used on Samantha as she lay dying from a fatal gunshot wound, and that had transformed her into Darkyn.</p><p>Lucan had never regretted taking away Samantha\u2019s humanity in order to snatch her back from the cold clutch of death. By that time he\u2019d known that he loved her more than any woman he had ever known, even the one he had once thought to be the great love of his life. Losing her would have been the same as committing suicide. Yet despite her transition, his sygkenis had not yet accepted what she had become. Sometimes Lucan wondered if she ever would.</p> <p>Samantha was not using l\u2019attrait on the guard; that much was obvious by the mortal\u2019s tight-lipped responses to her questions. She still insisted on relying on human methods, a practice he found charmingly naive but highly inefficient. Tired and rapidly losing patience, he climbed out of the Ferrari and went to deal with the guard himself.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to wait in the car,\u201d she said when he joined her. Her eyes narrowed as his scent flooded the air around them. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have waited twenty. This is faster,\u201d he told her, and turned to the shack\u2019s small window. \u201cYou, there. Sentry. Attend me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, as I told the detective ...\u201d The mortal breathed in, blinked, and gave him a foolish smile. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was this man of yours murdered last night?\u201d Lucan asked.</p><p>\u201cRight over here.\u201d The guard pointed to the other side of the shack.</p><p>Samantha gave Lucan an impatient glance as she walked around and then stopped. The strong odor of disinfectant cleaner did not entirely mask the smell of blood and gunpowder.</p><p>Lucan examined the wall. \u201cThere.\u201d He pointed to traces of pink staining the concrete.</p><p>Samantha crouched by the stain and examined the ground. \u201cNo shell casings, but ...\u201d She reached down with her scarred hand and pressed it over a spot in the grass, and then closed her eyes.</p><p>Her scent, as dark and seductive as midnight in the Amazon, grew strong and hot.</p><p>\u201cHis name was Theodore,\u201d she murmured in a faraway voice. \u201cNo. Ted. He\u2019s working on a crossword puzzle. He needs a five-letter word for \u2018temptation\u2019s fruit.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cApple,\u201d Lucan told her. To the guard who was coming out of the shack, he said, \u201cStay there and do nothing.\u201d</p><p>The man beamed. \u201cWhatever you say, sir.\u201d</p><p>Samantha opened her eyes, but her gaze had a blind quality to it as she looked toward the drive leading to the building. \u201cDel calls down. He says I have to stop him if I can. Some kind of trouble. Someone hurt.\u201d She slowly rose to her feet and walked to the edge of the drive. \u201cFuck me, he\u2019s been working out. How did he get so big so fast? Right, have to do this the way Del wants. He\u2019ll listen to me.\u201d She stopped speaking but her lips moved as she shaped more words. Her whole body jerked violently, and then she wheeled backward as if she\u2019d been thrown.</p><p>Lucan caught her from behind to keep her from hitting the wall in the same spot where the blood traces were. \u201cSamantha.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head wildly. \u201cNo, oh, Jesus\u2014no.\u201d She clapped her hands to her head, stiffened, and then sagged against him, turning and burying her face in his chest.</p><p>Lucan knew Samantha\u2019s ability allowed her to read the blood of the dead and through it see their last minutes of life, which often identified their killer for her. As much as it helped her with her detective work, it exacted a terrible price: She also experienced firsthand the victim\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cLucan, oh, my God.\u201d She panted out the words, shuddering uncontrollably as she tried to collect herself. \u201cThe victim knew him. They were friends. And he tore his head off. With his hands. With his bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh.\u201d He cradled her head and pressed her cheek to his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Over her shoulder he saw a stocky man driving a golf cart toward them. \u201cWas the killer one of our kind?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed a hand over her damp face. \u201cNo. At least, I don\u2019t think so. But there was something wrong with him. He smelled like ...\u201d She shook her head as she straightened her shoulders and seemed to regain control over herself. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Not like us. Not human. He smelled wrong.\u201d</p><p>The man in the cart stopped a short distance away and got out. He had a self-important stride, one that faltered as soon as Lucan\u2019s scent washed over him.</p><p>\u201cFlowers?\u201d the man muttered, looking confused.</p><p>Lucan beckoned to him as he put a supportive arm around Samantha\u2019s waist. She had recovered from the vision, but he could still feel how shocked she felt. \u201cDo you know the man who killed your guard last night?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d The portly man\u2019s face twisted. \u201cBradford Lawson.

Were they lovers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Bellamy humiliated him in front of our boss. Her boyfriend used a blade on him.

The pale set of her face compelled him to lean over and place a gentle kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cAn apology, in advance of the offense.\u201d He pressed his gloved hand to her cheek. \u201cYou asked me last night why I would not let you die. I am a selfish man, Samantha, and I wager I will be until the end of time. But even before Dwyer shot you, living without you had already become unbearable. So you see, it was as much to save my life as yours, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but her eyes glowed as she rubbed her face against his palm.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cNine dead, and four eyewitnesses who can positively identify Bradford Lawson as the killer.\u201d Genaro looked at the sweating faces around the conference table. \u201cIn addition to addressing the catastrophic failure of our security measures, we must now deal with the media exposure and the unwanted attention from the federal authorities. I would like an explanation, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Only Dr. Kirchner dared to meet his gaze. \u201cThe technician who allowed Lawson access to the storage area is dead. Once Lawson had injected himself with the transerum, there was no stopping him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed Evans tried, the poor bastard,\u201d Delaporte said. He touched the wireless receiver clipped to his right ear and stood. \u201cExcuse me, sir.\u201d He left the room.</p> <p>\u201cWe can deal with the eyewitnesses,\u201d Genaro\u2019s attorney said. \u201cThe FBI will be more difficult, but we have some influence there as well. Under no circumstance should we turn over Lawson to the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming we can capture and contain him.\u201d Genaro tossed the file of hastily prepared reports onto the table. \u201cSo where is he and who is he killing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s evidently targeted Jessa Bellamy,\u201d Kirchner said. \u201cAfter he attacked her neighbors, he ransacked her apartment. But he\u2019s not completely mindless; he retrieved her computer equipment and took it with him.\u201d</p><p>Genaro looked at Riordan. \u201cI assume you obtained access to her personal computer files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hacked in and copied the contents of the hard drive yesterday, sir,\u201d his senior tech said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t recover anything useful on the first pass, but I\u2019ll have my people take it apart and search for encrypted data. However, under the current circumstances I doubt Lawson will find anything to help him locate Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawson had complete access to all the information we have on Bellamy,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cHe knows who she was, and what she can do. He\u2019ll use it to track her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has more than data,\u201d Kirchner put in. \u201cWe know that the Kyndred are sensitive to one another, and have the ability to both broadcast their locations and track one another. The transerum Lawson injected was earmarked for our latest acquisition, and was designed to boost the latter effect.\u201d He saw Genaro\u2019s face and quickly added, \u201cIt will still take him some time to pick up her trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiordan, access Bellamy\u2019s credit accounts for traveling expenses. I want to see complete reports on where she does business outside Atlanta, where she takes her vacations, and any other movements she\u2019s made in the last ten years. Create a list of family, friends, and associates and any properties or time-shares they own.\u201d Genaro looked over at Delaporte as he reentered the room. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a homicide detective involved in the Farley case who is asking to speak to you, sir,\u201d his security chief said. \u201cShe\u2019s extraditing Farley\u2019s partner to Florida on murder charges. Evidently she knows about Lawson and Bellamy, and made the connection between Bellamy and Farley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re holding her at the front gate, sir.\u201d</p><p>A cop from Florida wouldn\u2019t be able to get a warrant to search GenHance\u2014not in Atlanta. \u201cGive her the usual speech. We\u2019re at a loss as to why this terrible tragedy happened, we\u2019re making arrangements for the families of the victims, and then get her the hell out of here.\u201d He turned to address the rest of his staff. \u201cI want Lawson found. Have him followed closely, but do not interfere with his activities.\u201d</p><p>Kirchner cleared his throat. \u201cUnder the circumstances, sir, permitting Lawson to roam freely would prove extremely hazardous to the general population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe public is not our concern, Doctor,\u201d he told him. \u201cAt this moment Lawson represents the best opportunity we have to locate and retrieve Bellamy. He won\u2019t stop tracking her until he finds her. He\u2019ll also save us the trouble of terminating her.\u201d</p><p>Genaro left the conference room and went to the security center, where he reviewed the archived surveillance videos of Lawson entering and leaving the building. The two men his director had murdered were of little consequence; what he was most interested in was the change the transerum had made to Lawson\u2019s physical condition. The man had arrived in a wheelchair, his face damp and pale, his voice tight with pain. The fresh bloodstains on his patient\u2019s gown and wrist bandage bore mute testimony to the condition of his wounds. Forty minutes later he had emerged from the lab in the dead technician\u2019s clothing, his movements easy and his pace brisk.</p><p>More remarkable to see were the alterations to Lawson\u2019s musculature. Genaro knew the man had been a dedicated bodybuilder, but even the steroids he had abused couldn\u2019t give him the power or the bulk that the transerum had. He appeared to have gained forty or fifty pounds of unilateral muscle mass, causing his enhanced physique to strain the seams of his clothing. Kirchner had projected a slight increase in body size and condition, but this went far beyond Genaro\u2019s expectations.</p><p>His only regret was that Lawson had availed himself of the transerum without being implanted first; the behavioral inhibitor Kirchner had designed to manage their test subjects would have given Genaro more options on how best to use and control him.</p><p>On the way to his office Genaro stopped by Kirchner\u2019s lab to have a word with the geneticist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased with the progress you\u2019ve made preparing the new acquisition,\u201d he told him, \u201cbut I want you to delay injecting it with the transerum until we bring in Lawson and perform a thorough screening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be prudent.\u201d Kirchner closed the door between his office and the lab before he added, \u201cI\u2019d also recommend we recover Lawson alive if possible.\u201d</p><p>Genaro\u2019s brows rose. \u201cGiven his current mental condition, that\u2019s unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe transerum is designed to augment and enhance physical and mental abilities,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve recommended that the buyers use it only on brain-dead specimens. As a result, we\u2019ve never really considered what effect it might have on an active mind\u2014or an unstable one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will reverse any brain damage Lawson has,\u201d Genaro pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt will repair the cellular damage,\u201d Kirchner agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s the psychotropic effects that concern me. Lawson was borderline psychotic to begin with; the transerum may enhance his delusions or even push him into a full and permanent break with reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this sympathy for Lawson?\u201d Genaro had never known his chief geneticist to be overly concerned with the welfare of their test subjects. This and the comment he had made during the meeting indicated otherwise. \u201cOr are you experiencing some sort of crisis of conscience, Doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more of the market impact, sir,\u201d Kirchner said. \u201cThe buyers are expecting very specific results. I\u2019ve worked with a number of these governments and coalitions in the past; if the transerum has an inherent flaw, they will not be understanding or politely ask for a refund.\u201d</p><p>A technician interrupted them to hand Kirchner a list.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve inventoried the storage unit.\u201d The doctor peered at the paper in his hand. \u201cLawson stole more than the transerum. The original sample is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have injected it,\u201d Genaro said.</p><p>\u201cIf he had, he never would have gotten out of the building.\u201d Kirchner crumpled the list in his hand. \u201cWe can\u2019t synthesize more transerum without the progenote, so if it\u2019s destroyed, the program is finished.\u201d He gave Genaro a guarded look. \u201cUnless you can obtain another sample.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe source no longer exists.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the truth, but he had no intention of allowing the doctor or anyone on his staff to know from where he had obtained the sample. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Lawson isn\u2019t a complete idiot; he knows how valuable it is. He\u2019ll either try to sell it or use it as a bargaining chip. Put the acquisition in stasis for now, and we\u2019ll do what we can to keep Lawson alive.\u201d He glanced out at the technicians working at various stations. \u201cI\u2019ll send the engineers up to modify the testing chamber. One more thing\u2014has anyone not assigned to the lab been coming here or talking to you about the acquisition lately?\u201d</p><p>Kirchner\u2019s expression became shuttered. \u201cAs I told Chief Delaporte, unauthorized personnel are not permitted entry to the lab. As for me, I don\u2019t discuss the work with my staff; I wouldn\u2019t answer questions from an outsider.\u201d His cold eyes shifted. \u201cIf internal security has been compromised, it didn\u2019t originate here.\u201d</p><p>Genaro nodded. \u201cThank you, Doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Genaro spent the next hour in his office studying Lawson\u2019s medical tests and the projection reports on the transerum.</p><p>Delaporte knocked once and ducked his head inside. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I need to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Genaro gestured for him to come in and set aside the chart. \u201cIs it the detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I handled that and went about my business. We have another situation.\u201d His security chief took out a handkerchief, unwrapped it, and placed it on Genaro\u2019s desk. In the center of the linen was a high-capacity USB memory stick. \u201cHousekeeping found this in one of the men\u2019s rooms. It was taped to the back of a commode. I copied the contents onto a duplicate stick and swapped them out.\u201d</p><p>Genaro didn\u2019t touch it. \u201cWhat\u2019s on it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInternal memos, acquisition reports, accounting information, and transportation schedules, all dated within the last five weeks,\u201d Delaporte told him. \u201cThere\u2019s also a copy of every document we have on Bellamy. That may explain how she anticipated our retrieval. Someone working on the inside here could have warned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Genaro regarded the memory stick. \u201cDid you find any prints or DNA on it or the toilet?\u201d</p><p>Delaporte shook his head. \u201cNo one has tried to retrieve the duplicate yet, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor the traffic in and out. The public has access to this restroom; it could be a handoff from the thief to an outside courier.\u201d</p><p>Genaro grew thoughtful. \u201cThis thief doesn\u2019t bother to encrypt the files he\u2019s stealing, but he takes great care not to leave any trace evidence. What does that tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows we keep prints on file for everyone who works here,\u201d Delaporte said.</p><p>\u201cIf he has an ounce of intelligence, he\u2019s already switched out the prints in his personnel files.\u201d Genaro used the handkerchief to pick up the memory stick and sniffed it. \u201cNo, this man was concerned with only one thing: not leaving behind a single trace of his DNA. Can you guess why, Del?\u201d</p> <p>His security chief frowned. \u201cHe knows we can use it to figure out who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say our thief can\u2019t afford for us to obtain a sample of his DNA,\u201d Genaro said as he gently wrapped up the stick. \u201cAnd there is only one reason for that.\u201d</p><p>Rowan paid a visit to the library before Jessa, flopping down in a chair and watching in silence as Matthias collected the books he needed from the shelves.</p><p>At length she spoke. \u201cFirst we trust her with the run of the place, and now we\u2019re going to tell her about the super-freaks of the Dark Ages. Dragging your feet a little, don\u2019t you think, boss?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one of his feet. \u201cI walk as I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being sarcastic again,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhat I mean is, you\u2019re rushing into this too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa is one of us.\u201d He turned to look for Brother Ennis\u2019s journal. \u201cShe should know all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means you\u2019re going to tell her about you and your adventures. Too bad we don\u2019t have a lab like GenHance\u2019s.\u201d She glanced up at the glass-encased sword over the fireplace. \u201cA microscopic examination of the blade would definitely sweeten things up between you two. Unless she decides it\u2019s all too much and flips out, like I almost did.\u201d</p> <p>She never needled him unless she had a purpose. \u201cIs there something you want, Rowan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides her out of here?\u201d She spread her hands. \u201cNot a damn thing, boss.\u201d She removed a folded paper from her back pocket and showed the front page to him. \u201cGenaro has upped the stakes again.\u201d</p><p>He took the paper and read the front page quickly. \u201cHe must have killed him to arrange this.\u201d He noted her mulish expression. \u201cYou know that she cannot leave us now. Or is it that you want her dead?\u201d</p><p>Outraged, she jumped to her feet and tore the paper from his hands. \u201cYou have the fucking nerve to say that to me? After everything I did for you?\u201d</p><p>He knew she used her surliness and anger as a form of self-defense, but he imagined guilt was fueling her fury at present. \u201cWas it so terrible, what you did? What you do now?\u201d</p><p>The rigidness left her shoulders. \u201cNo. I bought into all this. I\u2019m a good little soldier for the cause.\u201d She sounded as if she hated herself. \u201cI did a lot worse before I met you and Andrew.\u201d She regarded the paper. \u201cYou want me to put this in her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You could also talk to Jessa and tell her the truth,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThere is no need to conceal it from her now, and it would ease your conscience. It might help sway her opinion of us as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be the nasty housekeeper, thanks.\u201d She folded and stuffed the paper back into her pocket before she abruptly changed the subject. \u201cBy the way, Drew didn\u2019t check in when he was supposed to this morning. He\u2019s three hours overdue.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe demands on him will be many now. He will contact us when he is able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s been caught or compromised? He\u2019s all by himself down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrew knows the dangers. He has planned for them.\u201d Matthias found the last of the books and took it down, turning pages until he found the passage he wanted. \u201cIf he has been found out, he will take measures to protect himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Genaro and his happy little army of Mengeles.\u201d</p><p>She kicked the chair she had been sitting in. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose him, Matt. I should go down there and make sure.\u201d</p><p>Matthias looked up, surprised by the suggestion. \u201cI need you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Why?\u201d A faint sneer distorted her mouth. \u201cYou and Queenie seem to be bumping along fine. I\u2019m just getting in the way now.\u201d</p><p>He put down the book. \u201cI do not understand you. Say what you mean to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want her,\u201d she said flatly, \u201cand if she gave you the green light, you\u2019d be all over her. Shit, you had the perfect opportunity the other night when she sneaked in to search your room. Why didn\u2019t you jump her then?\u201d</p><p>He thought of the brief dream he\u2019d had before he\u2019d woken and felt almost amused. \u201cHow do you know I didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came out of there too fast.\u201d She realized what she had said and quickly stared at the toes of her boots. \u201cWhich I shouldn\u2019t have been timing and I know it. Look, I know when I\u2019m not necessary. Let me go down and see what\u2019s happening in Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For now, you will stay.\u201d He went to her and took her cold hand in his. \u201cMuch of what you have said is true, Rowan, but whatever I want from Jessa, keeping her here and keeping her alive are the two most important tasks I have. We need her ability to continue the search. I cannot do this without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ll stick around for the duration.\u201d She drew her hand from his and looked up at him with hurt in her eyes. \u201cJust don\u2019t expect me to kiss her ass, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not have to kiss any of her parts,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Rowan left, and by the time Jessa joined Matthias in the library he had finished arranging the books in the proper order. She had bathed and changed, and had woven her damp hair into a long braid; she smelled of Rowan\u2019s shampoo and his own soap.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He gestured to a chair by the fire. \u201cWas there enough hot water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d She looked around as if deliberately trying to avoid his gaze. \u201cYou have a nice library. How long did it take for you to collect so many books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen years.\u201d He picked up a split length of oak from the wood basket and placed it on the fire. \u201cRowan found many of them for me from booksellers who use the Internet for their shops. They send books in packages now.\u201d He still found that rather disconcerting.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t always have time to shop in the brick-and-mortar stores.\u201d Her gaze darted from the books to his face to the floor. \u201cYou know, I would never have guessed you to be the bookish type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no time for reading when I was a boy. There was always something more interesting to do outside.\u201d And how much trouble he would have saved himself and perhaps the world if he had become a scholar, as his father had wanted. \u201cDo you read any books about history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did when I was in school. I rarely have time, but when I do read I like fiction.\u201d She seemed to forget her discomfort as her brows drew together. \u201cIs this what you wanted to discuss? What books I read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would make things easier if I show you.\u201d He had to go carefully now. \u201cI have been collecting these since I came to know there were more in the world like me. When I came to America ten years ago, I brought them.\u201d He carried the oldest manuscripts over to the table and set them in front of her. \u201cI knew I would have to show the others proof of what we are.\u201d</p><p>She shifted a fraction to avoid touching him. \u201cOthers like you and Rowan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had expected she would continue to deny what she was, and still he felt impatient. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do some old books prove what you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do not,\u201d he said. \u201cThey prove what we were.\u201d He rested his hand on the topmost book. \u201cNo matter when they have lived, people have always kept accounts of what they know. They may lie to everyone around them, but most feel a need to tell the truth with their words. Sometimes in journals, like this one.\u201d He picked up the first book. \u201cThis belonged to an English priest named Ennis of Aubury. He questioned nonbelievers, and wrote down what they confessed to him under torture.\u201d</p> <p>She drew back a little. \u201cWhy would you want to read something so awful as that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor his truth.\u201d He opened it to the page he had marked with a piece of cord. \u201cRead.\u201d</p><p>Jessa glanced at the page. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not written in English.\u201d</p><p>As natural as reading Latin was to him, he often forgot that most Americans could not read the root of their own language. \u201cI will translate for you. Ennis writes: \u2018Another peasant was found murdered in the fields. As the others before him, his throat was torn out but there was no blood in the wound. I questioned the outlaw heretic and he told me of the renegade and his companion, the ones who could not be killed. It is clear to me that the dark Kyn have infested the county.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She leaned over to examine the slanted, dense handwriting. \u201cThe \u2018dark Kyn\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is what they were called in this time.\u201d He turned to another page farther along in the book. \u201cHere he writes: \u2018This morning I will go into the forest. The smith\u2019s wife swears she saw her dead son walking along the stream. I believe these creatures can take on the appearance of their victims so that they might lure more to their death. May the Heavenly Father help me bring this evil being into the light.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Jessa didn\u2019t say anything, but she pressed her lips together, and her fingernails dug into the armrests beneath her hands.</p><p>\u201cI think Ennis did find him.\u201d He flipped through the rest of the pages to show her that they had been left blank before he closed the cover. \u201cThis is the oldest story I have found about them thus far.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the page. \u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose the monk called \u2018the dark Kyn,\u2019 \u201d he said carefully. \u201cCreatures like us, who may have created us.\u201d</p><p>Her expression immediately changed, became guarded. \u201cYou believe that we were created by evil beings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis one Ennis speaks of could change his shape,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cSo can some of our kind. There are more stories about them, how they came to be and why they were hunted.\u201d He gestured toward the stack of books. \u201cThe dark Kyn were human once, and then they were killed or died of sickness. They came out of their graves changed, very strong and very fast. They hunted at night, and lived on human blood. They had great power\u2014abilities\u2014like us.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat you\u2019re describing sounds like the myths about vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are never called that in these books,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cSometimes the writers call them \u2018maledicti\u2019 or \u2018the cursed ones.\u2019 Rowan thinks the vampire stories began from tales of what they did during their wars.\u201d</p><p>Her wide-eyed gaze shifted to his face. \u201cThere were vampire wars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least three, and one in which they fought one another.\u201d He took out another book. \u201cIn this one a traveling French merchant returning from the East reported seeing terrible battles at night, in the countryside. He swore he saw men being slain and then rising up to fight again.\u201d He could feel her disbelief now, as if it were filling up the space between them with bricks and mortar. \u201cI do not lie to you, Jessa. The words are here. Written by the hand of those who lived in these times. The old ones like us have been living in hiding for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they have. Vampires are supposed to be immortal.\u201d She folded her hands under her chin and rested her elbows on her knees, staring at the books. \u201cWhen I was a girl, I used to love to read stories about the Loch Ness monster, and UFOs, and Bigfoot. I think when we\u2019re young we need that hope to hold on to. To think that there are still mysteries and wonders out there waiting for us to discover.\u201d</p><p>She tried to be kind even when she was shutting him out. \u201cYou do not believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in vampires, Matthias. I can\u2019t.\u201d She dropped her hands. \u201cIf they were real, and you and Rowan were like them, or were created by them, then why don\u2019t you drink blood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are not the same. We are still mostly human.\u201d Frustration rose inside him. \u201cYou do not see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have to meet one of these dark Kyn before I could put any faith in these accounts of them.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIf they are still living among us, then they\u2019re very good at hiding. Rather like the Loch Ness monster.\u201d</p><p>She would never believe him now if he told her he had tracked some of them. \u201cHow do you explain what you can do with your touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything.\u201d She exhaled slowly. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re going to turn into vampires? Is that why you and Rowan live underground? Why you brought me here? Are you afraid of the sunlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you took my hand in the car, you saw me in the snow and the mountains. You saw the worst of me.\u201d He offered her his hand. \u201cLook again. I am not afraid of you seeing what is inside me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cI think we should talk about how long you plan to keep me down here.\u201d Before he could reply, she held up her hand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s for my safety. I can\u2019t stay here forever, Matthias. I have to do something about GenHance. I have to go back\u2014and take back my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat life do you have up there?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou live alone. You have no lover or friends. The only time you willingly touch someone is to look into the darkness in their soul. If it were not for me and my bringing you here, you would be dead now. Butchered by GenHance for the ability you keep saying you do not have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried very hard to convince me that you\u2019re my friend, and that I\u2019m safe here.\u201d Jessa gestured toward the books. \u201cThis, and what you\u2019re saying, they don\u2019t make me feel safe, Matthias. They make me think you and Rowan are in trouble. That you need the kind of help that I can\u2019t give you.\u201d</p><p>He drew back. \u201cYou insult me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s really only one way to prove you\u2019re right and I\u2019m wrong. Show me everything you have. Tell me who the Kyndred are, where they\u2019re living, and what you\u2019ve been doing to protect them. Let me talk to some of them.\u201d</p><p>For an instant he was tempted to seize her and shake some sense into her stubborn head. But perhaps he expected too much from her. \u201cRowan left the morning newspaper in your room,\u201d he told her. \u201cRead it.\u201d He strode toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the paper?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her. \u201cYou are, Jessa. You are wanted by the authorities for killing Lawson.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>The enhancements bestowed on Bradford Lawson by the transerum turned out to be even more spectacular than Kirchner had predicted. His injuries had healed almost instantaneously and completely, and his newfound strength seemed unlimited. Even his mind had been augmented, allowing him to think as fast as a computer and solve problems almost before they happened.</p><p>Only one minor problem had spoiled what should have been the ultimate state of perfection: He was starving.</p><p>Almost from the moment he had killed Ted Evans and left GenHance, a voracious hunger, unlike anything he\u2019d ever felt, began to gnaw at his insides. Logic told him that his increased physical abilities would require more calories, but by the time he reached Jessa Bellamy\u2019s apartment complex he felt as if he hadn\u2019t eaten for a week. He\u2019d ignored the grinding hollowness inside him as he snapped the neck of the complex security guard and went to her building, but after questioning and dismembering two of Bellamy\u2019s neighbors he\u2019d been unable to stop himself from seizing what food he could find in the second\u2019s kitchen and eating until his jaw ached.</p><p>The hunger quieted enough for him to finish his interrogations and search Bellamy\u2019s apartment, but once he\u2019d gone back on the road it had started in on him again. Stopping at a convenience store, he strangled the clerk before loading up the passenger seat of Kirchner\u2019s SUV with boxes of candy bars, racks of chips, and liter bottles of soda.</p><p>He hated eating all that sugar and junk as he drove out of the city\u2014his new body deserved better\u2014but if he didn\u2019t meet the demands of his altered metabolism, he suspected it would start eating him from the inside out.</p><p>A pity Genaro\u2019s transerum had such a serious flaw\u2014one Jonah would have to address if he were to sell the stuff overseas. As soon as Lawson tracked down Bellamy and took care of that unfinished business, he would return to GenHance and have the old man do whatever it took to eliminate the unwanted painful side effect.</p><p>Fortunately his enhanced mental abilities were working with impressive efficiency. It had taken him only minutes to pick up Bellamy\u2019s trail; she had left Atlanta and traveled east. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure how he knew that she had; he only felt her drawing him to her. His sense of her remained bright and steady, as if she were a beacon only he could detect. There were others with her as well, at least two, but he felt only the vaguest sense of them. It didn\u2019t matter to Lawson who had given her refuge; they would die just as quickly as all the others.</p><p>Then he would have her to himself.</p><p>Jessa Bellamy wouldn\u2019t have to die right away, he decided, sorting through the many enjoyable fantasies about hurting women that he had dreamed up over the years. If her body proved to be even half as resilient as his own, he could keep her alive and hurt her for a very long time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Flashing red and blue lights glared in his eyes, and in the rearview mirror he saw a highway patrol car speeding up behind him. Quickly he groped through the pile of empty wrappers beside him, found and stuffed two king-size Snickers bars into his mouth as he pulled over onto the shoulder, and put the SUV in park. He ate another four while waiting for the trooper to walk up to the driver\u2019s-side window, which he rolled down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, Officer?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The trooper\u2019s silly hat tilted down as he peered inside. \u201cHave you been drinking tonight, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly some Pepsi.\u201d Enjoying himself a little, Lawson held up one of the empty liter bottles. \u201cI might be on a sugar high, but I don\u2019t believe that I was speeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me your name?\u201d</p><p>Now that he had been transformed into the first true superhuman, he could never answer to the name Bradford Lawson again. He needed a new title, one that would tell this ignorant mortal and the rest of the mortal world what he had become.</p><p>\u201cApollo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve become the god of the sun and light.\u201d</p><p>The trooper put a hand on the hilt of his service weapon and shuffled back. \u201cStep out of the vehicle, please, Mr. Apollo.\u201d</p> <p>Lawson opened the door, releasing a small flood of candy wrappers and chip bags onto the ground. They crackled as he stepped on top of them.</p><p>\u201cI have the worst case of the munchies in history,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot because I\u2019ve been smoking pot, of course. A god doesn\u2019t need that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>The trooper nodded and pointed to the front of the car. \u201cPlace your hands on the hood, Mr. Apollo, and spread your feet apart.\u201d</p><p>Cops these days simply didn\u2019t have a sense of humor, Lawson thought as he assumed the position. When the trooper moved to stand directly behind him, he threw his head back, smashing it into the man\u2019s face. By the time the trooper uttered his first howl of pain Lawson had picked him up and tossed him over the hood of the SUV. He sailed fifty feet and landed with a thud, rolling until his body lost momentum and flopped over onto his back.</p><p>Lawson picked up the flashlight the trooper had dropped, and switched it on, focusing the beam toward the spot where the mortal had landed. As he moved past the shoulder, his left foot plunged down into a hole in the ground. An angry buzzing exploded all around him, and a swarm of furious bees engulfed him.</p><p>Not bees, he thought as they zipped past his eyes, and he saw their distinctive colors. Yellow jackets.</p> <p>\u201cGet off,\u201d he shouted, swatting and whirling as he tried to get away from the stinging insects. Their tiny bodies bounced off his face, neck, and arms; they burrowed into the openings of his shirt and trousers to attack the rest of his body.</p><p>Lawson hated being stung, and began to sob as he fell to his knees. He toppled over and lay there for some time, his entire body ablaze with hot, needling pain. Things grew fuzzy, and then dark.</p><p>Sometime later he came to and sat up. Dead yellow jackets fell from his shoulders onto the ground, and he smashed them with his fist. There didn\u2019t seem to be any more of them flying around him, but there were countless tiny, still bodies covering the ground.</p><p>He struggled to his feet. The transerum had protected him again, and he breathed in deeply as he felt no pain from the thousands of stings he had sustained. He kicked at the dead insects, grinding some of them to mush under his heel before he staggered over to see to the trooper.</p><p>He looked down at the cop\u2019s ruined face. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ...\u201d His blood pounded in his ears, hot and heavy, and he couldn\u2019t seem to catch his breath. \u201cWhy did ... you ... pull me over?\u201d</p><p>The trooper turned his head and coughed out more blood.</p><p>Humans could be more annoying than yellow jackets, he thought as he lifted his leg and rammed it down on the man\u2019s right knee. The resulting scream didn\u2019t entirely drown out the satisfying crunch of bone. \u201cI can break ... the rest of your bones ... easy.\u201d Why was it so hard to remember words? \u201cWhy ... did you ... stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeaving,\u201d the cop choked out. \u201cWeaving all over the road. Can\u2019t drive like that. Hurt someone.\u201d</p> <p>Hurt someone? The words buzzed around his head like the yellow jackets, tiny and mindless and stupid. But they also cleared his thoughts and calmed his labored breathing as they reminded him of who he was now.</p><p>Why would he care if he hurt anyone? A god did not have to concern himself with the inherent weaknesses of mortals. He was stronger than them, ten times more intelligent, a new and vastly superior life-form. No one would ever again cause him pain or humiliation the way Jessa Bellamy had.</p><p>He could see her in his head so clearly now. Every detail of her treacherous, beautiful face, every arrogant look she had given him. She would never be satisfied with her attempt to cripple him, he knew, especially not now that he had ascended to a new level of existence. No, in her jealousy and ugliness she would want to harm him again\u2014even try to kill him\u2014as soon as she could.</p><p>\u201cShe sent you after me, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Lawson bent down, seized the man by the throat, and lifted him off the ground with one hand. He bit the side of his neck, digging his teeth in deep before he ripped out of a chunk of flesh and spit it out. \u201cThe lying bitch swore out a complaint against me.\u201d He shook him a few times. \u201cYou were going to serve me with another restraining order? Was that it?\u201d</p><p>The trooper didn\u2019t answer, his head lolling back and forth over his left shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI never touched her.\u201d Lawson licked his lips and tasted the man\u2019s blood on them, and felt a new sensation surging through him. \u201cI wanted to, but I couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d have seen. All my secrets.\u201d The sound of his own voice crooning comforted him as he put the limp body on the ground and straddled it. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have that.\u201d He ripped open the front of the trooper\u2019s uniform shirt and tore away the front panel of the protective vest beneath it. \u201cThe old man hates me for being young and strong. She\u2019d go to him. Make him fire me.\u201d</p><p>Sometime later Lawson rose and walked over to pick up the flashlight he had dropped by the yellow jacket nest. He switched it on, but the bright beam of light hurt his eyes. He tossed it away, and then felt pain in his hand. Two bone shards were embedded in his palm, and he plucked them out before he walked back up to the road and got in the SUV.</p><p>Things had changed again, but he felt at peace with himself. Without saying a word, the trooper had explained everything that had gone wrong.</p><p>Now it was right. So right that it filled him with an indescribable emotion. All the work he had done at GenHance had been noble, and his heart had been in the right place, but ultimately the scientists had failed. All of their theories and conjectures had been wrong. Lawson wondered what Genaro would make of it when he told him.</p><p>The transerum contained no flaw, but rather a new imperative, one that had caused the final transformation of the mortal who had been Bradford Lawson, and the sacrifices that would have to be made to his glory.</p><p>Now he was truly Apollo, the god reborn to walk among men.</p><p>By the third day of her captivity, Jessa had determined three things: She apparently wasn\u2019t in any immediate danger, it would take weeks to completely search her prison, and Matthias and Rowan weren\u2019t going to be as easy to dupe as she\u2019d hoped. As much as she wanted to escape and find some way to disprove the murder charge, she also knew she couldn\u2019t escape without first discovering what Matthias did or didn\u2019t know about the Takyn. If she didn\u2019t, he might try this again with Aphrodite, Vulcan, Delilah, or one of her other friends.</p><p>For his part, Matthias generally treated her like a guest instead of a prisoner, seeing to her needs and comfort without complaint and talking to her courteously. He watched her closely, however, and always seemed to be waiting around the corner whenever she walked through the tunnels.</p><p>Rowan\u2019s attitude toward Jessa gradually became less hostile, although she remained mostly distant or sarcastic, depending on her mood. Jessa quickly learned to avoid the girl when she was working in the communications room or cooking in the kitchen, the times when her temper was prone to flare fastest. She also refrained from asking questions or becoming too personal with the young housekeeper. She did refuse to let Rowan continue to wait on her, something she thought at first might provoke a confrontation. Yet when she told Rowan she didn\u2019t want breakfast brought to her room, all Rowan did was produce an old battery-operated clock radio and tell her to be in the kitchen at six a.m. or make her own meal. Jessa immediately tried to listen to the radio\u2014a local broadcast would tell her where she was\u2014but the small speaker produced only crackling static.</p><p>Matthias didn\u2019t bring up the subject of vampires again, which was a relief, as Jessa didn\u2019t know how to respond to his wild conjectures without further insulting him. Instead he allowed her to use his computer equipment whenever she asked, delivered a stack of paperback novels (none of which was newer than six months, she noted) to her room, and otherwise left her alone. When she asked whether she should return the books to him, he told her they belonged to Rowan. Later she saw him reading one of the books from the collection in the children\u2019s library room, and caught the faint movements of his lips as he silently sounded out some of the words.</p><p>Why would a grown man, even one who couldn\u2019t speak English perfectly, collect and read children\u2019s books when he owned one of the finest private libraries she\u2019d ever seen?</p><p>Although he knew about her ability, Matthias didn\u2019t try to avoid having physical contact with her as Rowan did. Each day he seemed to find some excuse to touch her casually, whether it was passing a dish to her at the table or taking her arm to guide her in a different direction while walking with her in the tunnels. For the first couple of days Jessa stiffened each time, anticipating a return into the shadowlight, but no matter how prolonged the contact was between them it never took over her consciousness. Instead, something else invaded: an unfamiliar but pervasive blend of warmth and comfort that danced along her skin and brought all of her senses to an acute state of awareness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa had enough experience to know what was happening. Her physical attraction to Matthias grew stronger every day; her body responded to him more often on a purely feminine level. The fact that he could touch her without triggering the shadowlight removed the primary obstacle that had kept her celibate since her ability had changed, and the needs that had remained sullenly dormant for so long were now wide-awake and demanding more.</p><p>Every touch, no matter how brief or casual, had always been an ordeal for her. Now Matthias had changed all that, turning any physical contact into a kind of furtive aphrodisiac.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand why she was so strongly attracted to a man about whom she knew so little. She still couldn\u2019t place his accent, or the strange formality of his English. He didn\u2019t speak like someone who had trouble understanding the meaning or the grammar; he spoke as if he came from a completely different world. His habits\u2014eating with his fingers, rolling paper instead of folding it, and the way he sometimes watched with full concentration as Rowan used the food processor or the can opener\u2014also made him seem out of step with the real world. And why would a grown man read, much less enjoy, children\u2019s books?</p> <p>Then there was his relationship with Rowan, who was certainly more than his housekeeper. Jessa had first suspected the girl might be his lover, but Matthias showed her nothing more than a decidedly paternal brand of affection. She never caught them in an intimate moment, and while they might have been sneaking into each other\u2019s rooms every night, why would they hide it?</p><p>To keep herself occupied with something other than these perplexing observations and Matthias, Jessa spent hours on the computer checking through the contents of the hard drive for any files on the Takyn. To her disappointment she found nothing stored on the system but the files Matthias had shown her on GenHance, some Asian card games, and the service provider program they were using to gain access to the Internet.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to rely on what Matthias had shown her, so Jessa began checking news sites and researching GenHance\u2019s business activities since the corporation had been founded in the late eighties. While GenHance had a sterling reputation, very little real information existed about Jonah Genaro and his company. Most of what was published by the media was taken mainly from press releases issued by Genaro\u2019s own public relations department. Part of this was due to the fact that Genaro owned GenHance outright and, despite its size and diversity, had never offered up shares to be publicly traded. That made the corporation one of the largest privately held businesses in the world.</p><p>An old profile written by Forbes about Genaro, whom they identified as one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, filled in a few blanks.</p><p>\u201cGenaro inherited ninety billion dollars from his Italian grandparents,\u201d she told Matthias one night over dinner. \u201cOriginally it was left to his parents, but they died in a car wreck in New York when he was sixteen. Their will specified that the family money was to be divided equally among their brothers and sisters and their children, but every other member of the Genaro family died in a boating accident three years later. They took the family yacht to sail over to one of their homes in Greece, but the engines exploded on the way there. No one radioed for help, so the boat burned and sank before anyone could get to them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe probably had them killed,\u201d Rowan put in as she finished clearing her plate.</p><p>The girl ate twice as fast as she and Matthias did, Jessa had noticed, and would sit with her hand or sometimes her arm curled around her plate, as if she expected it to be taken away from her. Rowan seemed to have some sort of love-hate relationship with food that bewildered Jessa, yet the girl was never stingy with the meals she prepared, and in fact often nagged her to eat more. Rowan looked up, caught Jessa watching her, and scowled.</p><p>\u201cThe article said he was in his first year at Oxford when the yacht accident happened,\u201d Jessa said quickly.</p><p>\u201cHe would not have bloodied his own hands,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cHe would have hired someone to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would a nineteen-year-old kid even know how to arrange having his entire family killed?\u201d Jessa asked him. \u201cNever mind trying to do it long-distance from England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had ninety billion damn good reasons to try,\u201d Rowan replied. \u201cI bet he practiced with his parents first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he was an only child.\u201d Jessa didn\u2019t want to defend the man who had probably framed her for murder, but she couldn\u2019t accept that Genaro could be so cold-blooded\u2014not with his own family. \u201cHe must have loved them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only things Genaro loves are wealth and power,\u201d Matthias advised her. \u201cHe will never have enough to redeem his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does his name have to do with it?\u201d Jessa asked, but he merely gave her one of his enigmatic looks before he rose and left the kitchen. Irritated, she turned to Rowan. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can tell me what he means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read in Forbes,\u201d was all the girl would tell her.</p><p>Rather than sneaking out of her room and searching the tunnels again, Jessa continued looking for evidence under the guise of constantly getting lost. She knew Rowan and Matthias were taking turns watching her through some sort of security system at night, but neither of them seemed to notice how often she took a wrong turn during the day. Her pretense allowed her to discover a great deal about her surroundings. What she thought were dead ends to the tunnels were actually old steel doors that extended into recesses in the concrete walls. From the look of them, Jessa guessed they were fire doors. She noted them as she explored, drawing a mental map of the tunnels, until she found the one she was sure concealed the tunnel that had led to the hatch that led to the surface and freedom.</p><p>The discoveries she made during her waking hours kept her quiet and watchful, but each night her caution seemed to evaporate as soon as she fell asleep.</p><p>Since the first night, Jessa had been dreaming vividly, always finding herself with Matthias in some familiar place: her apartment, her office, her favorite restaurant. Once, she was whisked off to the pool at her apartment complex, where she dreamed she was making laps with Matthias beside her, keeping pace.</p><p>In the dreams his presence never disturbed her; in fact, she behaved as if she had invited him into them. During the pool dream they swam together in sync from one end to the other, and when she suspected he was holding back she kicked off the last wall with all her energy and raced him to the deep end.</p> <p>He surfaced at the same time she did, but rather than touch the wall he pulled her into his arms. \u201cYou cheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won.\u201d She twined her arms around his neck. \u201cHow did you learn to be such a strong swimmer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a boy I fell off my horse into a river, and I did not wish to drown.\u201d He treaded the water easily as he maneuvered her into a corner. \u201cYou are like a fish.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou\u2019d better be referring to my ability to swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are all sleek and shining when you are wet.\u201d He parted his legs to bring her closer, and their bodies pressed together. \u201cYou move like the river. Like the rain.\u201d</p><p>Jessa felt his hands on her waist and curled her hands over his broad shoulders. \u201cWhy do I keep dreaming of you like this? As if you were always with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps part of me was.\u201d He glanced down. \u201cI want to kiss your mouth.\u201d</p><p>He often told her of his desire for her, but he never did more than touch her or hold her in his arms. It made her heart ache as much as her body.</p><p>\u201cNone of this is real,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will wait,\u201d he told her, pressing his forehead to hers, \u201cuntil you want me when you wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait.\u201d Jessa closed her eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And then she woke, and Rowan was there, standing over her, not looking angry or indignant.</p><p>\u201cQueenie.\u201d The girl tugged on her sleeve. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s just a dream.\u201d</p><p>Disoriented from being wrenched from the intimate moment with Matthias, Jessa blindly pushed at her, making contact with only her denim-covered hip, and then snatched her hand away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She knew the girl disliked being touched, and suspected it had to do with something other than Jessa\u2019s ability.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Rowan looked shaken as she backed away. \u201cWe all get bad dreams, right?\u201d Before Jessa could reply, she hurried out of the room.</p><p>What happened to you? Jessa thought as she stared after her, and then covered her face with her hands. What is happening to me?</p><p>Jessa\u2019s first real opportunity to escape came after she had been with them for a week. After breakfast she washed dishes and then went to take her morning shower, but turned around and went back to the kitchen to ask Rowan if she had any facial moisturizer she could use. As she drew close to the open door, she heard Matthias and Rowan talking, and stayed out of sight.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow go topside and get the supplies we need,\u201d Matthias was saying. \u201cI will stay with her. She does not have to be watched every moment now. She has stayed in her room every night this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re all such good pals now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Rowan sounded disgusted. \u201cDid it ever occur to you that she\u2019s been staying in her room only so we\u2019d stop watching her at night? Which we have, so it worked great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa could not know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe she doesn\u2019t now,\u201d the girl said, \u201cbut she will the first time she sneaks out after hours. She wants you to trust her and confide in her, and she\u2019ll keep up the nice act until you do. For Christ\u2019s sake, Matt, I like her, too, but remember who you\u2019re dealing with. The woman made her living informing on people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need Jessa\u2019s ability to see the truth,\u201d he told her. \u201cUnless we convince her to work with us, share information, and help us to find the others, we will never get to the Kyndred before GenHance does.\u201d</p><p>Rowan made a rude sound. \u201cYou\u2019re living in a dreamworld, boss. That girl\u2019s never going to tell us a damn thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen let me dream. I enjoy it.\u201d He walked across the kitchen and opened something. \u201cHere is the money. Go early, before she wakes. See your friend William while you are out.\u201d</p><p>Aware she could be discovered eavesdropping, Jessa silently retreated back to the bathroom, where she showered and considered what she would do.</p><p>Rowan would have to leave through the hatch door Jessa hadn\u2019t yet found, and since she believed that was the only way out it was imperative that she shadow Rowan in the morning. Rowan had been waking at six a.m., so if she left early, she\u2019d go at five a.m. Jessa would have to get up earlier than that\u2014four a.m. would probably be best\u2014and then find a vantage point near Rowan\u2019s bedroom where she could stand watch and then follow the girl as she left in the morning. Since Matthias was no longer watching her, she might even have a chance if she were careful to see how to open the fire doors, and possibly follow Rowan up to the surface.</p> <p>The sole drawback was the fact that she hadn\u2019t yet been able to search the library, where she was convinced Matthias was keeping whatever records he had on the Kyndred. She needed to do that today so that she could leave in the morning with a clear conscience. That meant coming up with an excuse that would allow her to spend at least an hour alone in the room.</p><p>Being in the shower reminded her of the pool dream, and she thought about every moment of it. Jessa couldn\u2019t understand why she kept dreaming of being with Matthias, but it was starting to get under her skin now. Somehow she was becoming obsessed with him\u2014and she was never more aware of it as when she pulled herself out of her thoughts and discovered she hadn\u2019t noticed that the water of the shower was now running ice-cold.</p><p>She dried off, dressed, and went in search of Matthias. She found him in his exercise room, where he was working out with the stone disks she had seen during her first night of captivity. As before, he didn\u2019t stop lifting the heavy stones as he spoke to her.</p><p>\u201cYou were a long time bathing,\u201d he said, balancing two of the heaviest stones on the palms of his hands before he extended his arms forward and out. \u201cDo you prefer cold water to hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just got a little lost in my thoughts,\u201d she lied. There was no way in hell she was telling him about the dream, ever, so she focused on the excuse she\u2019d invented. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to keep an open mind and make sense of all this at the same time. I was wondering, would you let me look through all the books you have about the dark Kyn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot read Latin,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She covered her dismay with a rueful smile. \u201cTrue, but you said some of them were written in other languages. I went to school in Europe, and I can read French, German, and Spanish.\u201d</p><p>He put down the stones, straightened, and turned to her. \u201cYou also said you do not believe in vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do is look through the books and see if there are any other clues as to what these people might have really been.\u201d His expression seemed doubtful, and she added, \u201cI know they mean a lot to you. I\u2019ll be very careful with them, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He studied her expression. \u201cVery well. I will meet you in the library in an hour.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the stones. \u201cYou lift those things for an hour? No wonder you\u2019re so ...\u201d Embarrassed now, she stopped.</p> <p>\u201cRipped,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what Rowan calls it, even though I never tear anything.\u201d He put his hand to the center of his chest. \u201cIt is good for the body and the heart.\u201d He picked up the smallest of the stone disks and offered it to her. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never lifted weights. I\u2019d probably tear something. I prefer to swim to keep in shape.\u201d Jessa turned to hide her embarrassment and headed to the tunnel. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa.\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>\u201cIf I could give you back your life,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI would. Even if there were no place for me in it.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, enduring the rush of emotion his voice tugged from her heart. He sounded so lonely she almost turned around and ran to him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice breaking on the last word as she left him. I can\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter 14</p> <p>Sam woke up near twilight to find herself alone in the bed. Usually she was the first to rise at night, but since Bradford Lawson\u2019s killing spree Lucan had been waking early and going out with the jardin trackers every afternoon. They were hunting for the killer\u2019s trail, sometimes until dawn, but so far they had been unsuccessful.</p><p>Something went wrong during the first night they went out, but Lucan wouldn\u2019t tell her what it was.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t like it, but she had her own priorities when it came to homicide suspects, and she began building a case against Lawson. It might have been difficult to obtain the information she needed, but Kendrick had proved invaluable in that department. That evening he delivered to her copies of police reports, witness statements, and preliminary autopsy results on all of Lawson\u2019s victims.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Sam told him. \u201cIt\u2019s everything I need. How did you do this so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have made very good friends among the local authorities as well as the FBI,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will help us as much as they can.\u201d</p><p>Even Lucan\u2019s tresora, Herbert Burke, would have been hard-pressed to assemble such a complete file. \u201cCould I bribe you to move down to Fort Lauderdale and go to work for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite flattered, but I\u2019m afraid I must refuse.\u201d The tresora smiled. \u201cOnce we pledge ourselves to our lords, the oath we take to serve is for life.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI hope Scarlet knows how lucky he is.\u201d</p><p>After seeing through her ability just what Bradford Lawson could do to a human being, she had called down to Fort Lauderdale to notify Garcia and her partner of a change in plans, and asked them to send up another officer to transport Grodan so she could focus on finding Lawson.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s escalating very fast,\u201d she told Rafael. \u201cEach murder is more brutal than the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawson might be one of these Kyndred Lady Alexandra is searching for,\u201d Rafael suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we find him. And I know we\u2019re supposed to make nice with them and bring them over to our side, but that\u2019s not going to happen with this guy. He\u2019s turned into a killing machine, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to stop until he finds this Jessa Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that unlikely,\u201d Rafael said. \u201cJessa Bellamy is wanted for murdering Bradford Lawson.\u201d</p><p>Sam went still. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Kendrick for a paper,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIt is front-page news across the country.\u201d</p><p>After she ended the call, she obtained a newspaper from the tresora and read the headline story. According to the reporter covering the story, second-degree murder charges had been filed against Bellamy after she attacked Lawson at a popular downtown restaurant. Hospital officials claimed Lawson died of his injuries several hours before he murdered Ted Evans.</p><p>\u201cThis is utter garbage,\u201d Sam told Kendrick. \u201cLawson was alive when he went to GenHance that night. He was alive when he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be that the authorities are trying to locate Ms. Bellamy in order to secure her as a material witness, or place her in protective custody,\u201d the tresora suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhen we do that, we generally don\u2019t first charge them with murder.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cSee what you can find out about this Bellamy woman, and where she might have run to.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately Lucan was not as forthcoming with what he learned while out hunting for Lawson. Every morning her lover returned, grim and withdrawn, and placed several calls to some of the other American Kyn lords. He always spoke to them in one of the old languages that she didn\u2019t understand, and when she asked he told her only that they were discussing territorial matters. Then he would go down to the training room for an hour and return to drop, exhausted, into bed.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t like it, but she held back from confronting Lucan about the situation. Whatever it was, he was taking it very personally.</p><p>Instead, she did what she could by spending her time at the various crime scenes and collecting all the information she could on Bradford Lawson. So far she\u2019d uncovered several complaints of battery filed by former girlfriends, all of whom later dropped the charges, and a violent attack on a personal trainer who turned out to be a dealer specializing in performance-enhancing drugs. She had reached a couple of the girlfriends by telephone, but the moment she said Lawson\u2019s name they hung up on her. The personal trainer had dropped out of sight after being discharged from the hospital. Three of Lawson\u2019s former victims had abruptly moved out of the state and then disappeared as well, although there were no indications of foul play or missing-persons reports filed. It was as if they didn\u2019t want to be found again.</p><p>Tonight she was hoping that Kendrick had discovered some new information on Jessa Bellamy, the woman accused of murdering Lawson the day before he began his killing spree.</p><p>She went down to Kendrick\u2019s office on the first floor and found the tresora speaking in low tones to one of his staff. Both men abruptly ended the conversation as soon as they saw her, and the tresora invited her in as the other man left.</p><p>She eyed the thick folder on Kendrick\u2019s desk. \u201cHas there been some new development in the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA body was just discovered near the interstate,\u201d he said, taking the folder and opening a drawer to put it away. \u201cIt may or may not be connected to the other murders.\u201d</p><p>She nodded toward the folder. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I have a look at it?\u201d</p><p>Kendrick\u2019s expression turned troubled. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a good idea, my lady. The crime scene photos are quite graphic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a homicide detective, Ken,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it all and then some.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t give her the file. \u201cIt would be better if you first discussed this with Suzerain Lucan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe gave you orders not to show it to me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a reply, but held out her hand. \u201cI know you\u2019re immune to l\u2019attrait, but I\u2019m still a lot stronger and faster than you. Come on, hand it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will tell your lord that I did not do so willingly?\u201d he asked as he gave her the file.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll even give you a black eye, if you want.\u201d She opened the folder to a horrific image of human body parts. The next was another angle of the same scene, as were the other pictures. She looked up. \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of the body?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is all our people were able to recover, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She sat down as she studied the photos. \u201cIf a dead body stays outside long enough, it attracts the usual scavengers.\u201d She noticed some black mounds of feathers around the body parts. \u201cAre these buzzards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She went to the next photo, which showed a close-up of one of the birds. \u201cThey look dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, my lady. The police also recovered some other dead animals near the body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven if the victim had been poisoned, it would have taken a couple of hours to do the same to anything that fed on the remains. These birds look like they dropped as soon as they touched it.\u201d She looked up. \u201cIs that what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not certain yet, my lady.\u201d He looked miserable. \u201cOne of the policemen on the scene observed some rats crawling near the body. They died a few moments after coming in contact with the remains.\u201d He paused, and then added, \u201cSo did one of the forensic technicians working at the scene. Evidently one of his gloves tore during the removal process.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the pictures in her lap. \u201cAre you telling me this dead body is so toxic that no one can even touch it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would seem so, my lady.\u201d He took out a handkerchief and blotted the sweat from his forehead.</p><p>She thought of the photos she had seen of Bradford Lawson\u2019s other victims. He had dismembered some of them, but not as badly as had been done to this body. \u201cDo we know who the victim was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a Georgia state trooper.\u201d Kendrick stood. \u201cWe have sent tissue samples over to England for Lady Alexandra to analyze. Please, my lady, you should leave this unpleasant business to Suzerain Lucan and the other Kyn lords.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded. When he didn\u2019t answer, she said, \u201cKendrick, I\u2019m the only real cop on the premises. I have to know what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were able to recover the video from the trooper\u2019s vehicle dashboard camera,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThe final images on the tape show him stopping the SUV Bradford Lawson stole from GenHance. It also shows Lawson attacking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawson killed this man.\u201d</p><p>The tresora looked uneasy. \u201cWe believe the killer has to be a Darkyn using Lawson\u2019s mortal identity. A human could not do what he did to this man.\u201d</p><p>She curled her scarred hand into a fist as she remembered the bizarre, repulsive smell Lawson had been radiating when he had killed Ted Evans, and the sense of wrongness about it. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the teeth marks on the remains,\u201d Kendrick said unhappily, \u201cit would seem that he not only killed this man, but he ate parts of him.\u201d</p><p>Matthias met Jessa in the library as he had promised, and placed a short stack of books on his desk.</p><p>\u201cThese you should be able to read,\u201d he told her, and showed her how he had marked the passages in each with a piece of cord. \u201cRowan translated the ones written in French for me, but she cannot read German or Spanish.\u201d</p> <p>That surprised her. \u201cRowan speaks French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe taught herself to read it from books, for cooking.\u201d He placed a writing tablet and pen beside the books. \u201cWill you translate into English what you read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d She glanced up at him. \u201cI thought you read all these yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose in Latin and English I can read myself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stories in the other languages were read to me by a translator, but I did not write then.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand what he meant. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know how to write in English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen years ago I did not know how to read or write,\u201d he admitted. \u201cRowan has been teaching me, but I am a poor scholar.\u201d</p><p>She felt appalled now. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re trying. Weren\u2019t you able to go to school when you were young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not for reading or writing.\u201d He started to say something else, and then seemed to change his mind. \u201cI will leave you now.\u201d</p><p>After he had gone Jessa took the first book and skimmed through it. Written in modern Spanish, the text detailed a number of religious trials that were held in Madrid in the late fourteenth century. The author of the book, a noted historian, had translated some of the medieval documents he had found while researching the legal proceedings. Jessa found one startling passage about the conviction of a Templar knight who had escaped persecution in France only to be apprehended in Spain.</p><p>The fugitive refused to give his name to the court, or identify his accomplices, or speak at all, even under the duress of torture. The chief interrogator noted that although he could tolerate neither food nor drink, he remained unnaturally strong and impervious to pain for some months. This was first attributed to the evil that had seized his soul and through it taken control of his mortal form, until a special investigator was sent by Rome to question the prisoner. The Italian priest used copper implements, which proved to be the only metal that could penetrate the knight\u2019s skin, and holy water, which caused it to burn. Before a confession could be taken, the prisoner took his own life by thrusting one of the investigator\u2019s copper daggers into his heart. His last words were reported to be: \u201cDeath could not hold me in my grave, nor will you keep me to rot here.\u201d</p><p>Jessa read over the translation she had written and then slowly closed the book. The text was compelling, and certainly fit in with Matthias\u2019s theory, but the historian had likely made some broad interpretations of the medieval records. She was tempted to keep reading and see what was in the other books, but that would waste the time she needed to search the library.</p><p>She began with the desk, which she found unlocked, but the contents of each drawer proved to be ordinary: a collection of pens and pencils, blank paper, and some newspaper clippings stuffed into a folder. She went through the articles, which were all stories about people in America and Europe who had gone missing. The last clipping was the front-page story about her being wanted for killing Bradford Lawson, the same article Matthias had shown her. None of the other people in the articles had been accused of murder, but the one common denominator was that they had all vanished abruptly and without leaving any clues as to their whereabouts\u2014exactly, she thought, as she had.</p><p>Were these the other Kyndred Matthias had spoken of? Had he abducted all of these people before her? She counted the articles; there were more than twenty of them.</p><p>She got up from the desk and slowly walked around the room, inspecting each bookcase and looking behind the books. Other than some dust and a few spiderwebs, she found nothing.</p><p>She stopped in front of the fireplace and looked up at the old bronze blade mounted in the glass case. The dark stains on it still repelled her, but there was something about the way it reflected the light that made her reach up and touch the glass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hermetically sealed,\u201d Rowan said from behind her, making her jump and spin around. The girl gave her a chilly smile. \u201cThe only way you can get it out is to break the glass. For which you\u2019ll need a sledgehammer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just curious.\u201d Jessa kept her expression bland. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an old sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were all the rage around two thousand years ago.\u201d Rowan set a steaming mug on the desk. \u201cMatt thought you might like some tea.\u201d</p><p>She was a little thirsty. \u201cThank you, that was very kind.\u201d</p><p>The girl ignored her and picked up the notebook with her translation. \u201cLovely handwriting. You dot all your Is and cross all your Ts. Do you starch your underwear, too?\u201d</p><p>She decided to counter Rowan\u2019s sarcasm by giving her a compliment. \u201cMatthias said you\u2019ve been teaching him to read and write. I think that\u2019s really nice of you.\u201d</p><p>The girl scowled as if Jessa had insulted her. \u201cHe\u2019s not dumb, you know. It\u2019s not his fault he never had the chance to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s stupid at all,\u201d Jessa said. \u201cBut he must be from a very poor country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop fishing, Queenie, and drink your tea.\u201d Rowan sauntered out.</p><p>Jessa returned to the desk and picked up the notebook, turning it over in her hands as she gazed around the room, and then stared at the fireplace. The brick mantel surrounding the hearth stood out a good foot from the wall, and appeared to have been built in different sections. She got up and went over, checking both sides, and then noticed something about the brick.</p><p>As a child she had walked hundreds of paths through the city squares, and most of them had been made from bricks formed by slaves who used clay from the river. The distinctive, old-blood color of the bricks had been unique, a color referred to ever after as Savannah grey.</p><p>The fireplace had been built with the same kinds of bricks. Jessa sat down on the floor and touched the warm, rough surface of the hearth. The archaic bricks, so coveted by builders and restoration experts, were very rare, and almost never seen outside the city. Either she was back in Savannah or close to it.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. She\u2019d sworn never to return to her childhood home; it would have been too dangerous. She\u2019d bitterly regretted everything she\u2019d had to sacrifice in order to create a new identity for herself, but after waking up in the intensive care unit and discovering that the fatal gunshot wound in her chest had completely healed in less than twelve hours, she\u2019d panicked and run. And had been running ever since. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa braced a hand against the brick to stand, and felt something move under her palm. She looked carefully at the mortar between the bricks and found a seam, and traced it before she tugged at the stones. A large section of the hearth shifted, but it was too heavy for her to slide out.</p><p>This was where he was hiding everything, she thought, and tried pulling at the section of brick again. It didn\u2019t budge, and there seemed to be something holding it in place. She spent the next thirty minutes trying everything she could think of to dislodge it, including wedging the tip of her pen into the seam, but under pressure the pen merely snapped in half and the section remained in place.</p><p>She muttered something rude under her breath as she stood and brushed the traces of brick dust from her hands before giving in to her temper and kicking the brick. That simply hurt her toes, and she hopped for a moment before she limped over to the desk and sat down to rub her sore foot. At least she knew where his hiding place was, and possibly where she was.</p> <p>Now all she had to do was break into his cache, and break out of her prison.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Riordan called together his techs for a short meeting, during which he reviewed the latest list of demands from the chairman. \u201cWe need the data collected and all reports finished by close of business today. Until further notice, everyone is also on twelve-hour shifts.\u201d</p><p>No one complained, but a few eyes rolled.</p><p>He turned to his senior tech, a whiz kid Genaro had recruited straight out of MIT. \u201cBill, I\u2019ll need all the files we recovered from Bellamy\u2019s hard drive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was hoping to work on them this morning,\u201d Bill said. \u201cYesterday I noticed some gaps in the ROM that didn\u2019t look right. They could be hidden file markers or something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow up on that for you,\u201d Riordan promised.</p><p>Once his techs returned to their cubicles, Riordan went into his office. Lori, his assistant, had gone down to collect the mail, but had left his morning drink\u2014a chilled bottle of vitamin water\u2014on his desk next to a pile of messages. He drank half the bottle while sorting through the slips and waiting for his terminal to boot up.</p><p>The morning conference had derailed his schedule, something he couldn\u2019t afford with Genaro on the warpath, but he had a dedicated crew and they\u2019d work quickly to pull the necessary data. Everything else would have to wait.</p><p>Bill came in with a CD containing Bellamy\u2019s files and closed the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Andy? Everyone\u2019s been so jumpy today you\u2019d think the floor was hot-wired.\u201d</p><p>Riordan had kept his staff loyal by keeping an open-door policy and working alongside them rather than over them. At times, like now, he regretted that he couldn\u2019t be more honest with them. \u201cYou want me to give you the need-to-know speech again?\u201d he asked as he took the CD.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I get it.\u201d the tech admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to work in the dark. The newspapers are saying this girl killed the director. We know she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf and when I can tell you anything more, I will. Damn it.\u201d The pen he was holding had snapped, and was now leaking blue ink onto his fingers. \u201cLori\u2019s downstairs. Cover the phones for me for a minute, will you?\u201d</p><p>Riordan went to the men\u2019s room closest to his office and tried to scrub the ink from his hands. As he did, one of the guys from accounting came in with a newspaper under his arm.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d The man nodded and stepped into a stall.</p><p>Riordan dried his hands, studied them, and reached again for the soap dispenser. As he did, Delaporte came in to use one of the urinals. As the heavyset man passed him, he caught a whiff of something.</p><p>\u201cThat a new cologne?\u201d Riordan asked him.</p><p>Delaporte glanced at him as he stood in front of the urinal and unzipped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Riordan grinned. \u201cYou smell like perfume and coffee, Del. Been chasing one of the girls around the typing pool?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I ...\u201d He frowned. \u201cI was just going about my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat feels better,\u201d the accountant said as he stepped out of the stall and came to the sinks. \u201cHey, Andy, who do you like for the Super Bowl this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCardinals are looking pretty good. So are the Steelers.\u201d Riordan soaped his hands. \u201cBut the Bucs still have a shot, I think.\u201d</p><p>As the other man expressed his opinions of all three teams, Riordan saw Delaporte glance at the stall the accountant had used before joining them. Now he understood why the security chief had come here when he had his own office and private restroom five floors down.</p><p>Move.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get that off with regular soap,\u201d the security chief advised him. \u201cGo over to the lab; they have a solvent hand cleaner that removes everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Del.\u201d Riordan dried his hands a second time, nodded to the accountant, and walked out and down the hall to the elevator. As he did, he checked his watch. He had rehearsed and timed everything he needed to do, and he knew it would take him precisely four minutes and nineteen seconds to either get out alive or kill himself.</p><p>Andrew Riordan had no intention of committing suicide.</p><p>He pressed his fingertip into a recess hidden on the underside of the rail at the back of the elevator, triggering the unit he\u2019d installed in the ceiling of his office. He then set his watch to countdown as he heard muffled shouts coming from the data center. He stepped through the doors into the elevator and pressed the button for the lobby level.</p><p>Four minutes, ten seconds to live.</p><p>Footsteps thudded in the corridor, and someone called, \u201cHold those doors, please.\u201d</p><p>Riordan pressed the Close Doors button and held it until the panels slid shut and the cab began to descend. He didn\u2019t glance up at the security camera hidden in one of the lights, and kept his stance and expression casual.</p><p>Three minutes, forty-one seconds.</p><p>Forty.</p><p>Thirty-nine.</p><p>At the lobby level he stepped out of the elevator and walked through the back hall to the secured exit to the delivery platform. He took a key card from his wallet, swiped it, and pushed the heavy door open. Once outside the building, he jogged away from the senior employee parking lot, where his car was waiting, and went to the back lot where the platform workers kept their vehicles. There he took a duplicate key he\u2019d made to Bill\u2019s compact car, unlocked it, and got in.</p><p>Two minutes, ten seconds.</p><p>He saw the first of the security guards emerge from the building as he was pulling out, and made a one-eighty turn to head toward the eight-foot-tall fence running across the back of the property. Bill\u2019s tiny car bumped and bounced as it left the paved lot and traveled over the uneven ground, but it had a lot of pep and picked up speed nicely. Riordan had it up to eighty mph by the time he reached the fence and rammed the car through it.</p><p>One minute, thirty-eight seconds.</p><p>Metal shrieked and sparks exploded as Riordan flew over the deep ditch beyond the fencing and landed with a hard jolt. The little car\u2019s back wheels spun for a few seconds as they hung on the opposite edge of the ditch; then the tires dug in and the car shot forward with a high-pitched roar of its small engine. Riordan drove expertly through the back property, following a trail winding around the trees and the brush until he came to a utility road and made a sharp left turn.</p><p>Seven seconds.</p><p>Riordan opened the driver\u2019s-side door, braking enough to reduce the car\u2019s speed to a safe level before he jumped out and hit the ground rolling. Bill\u2019s car continued down the straight road for another quarter mile before it ran off into the trees and crashed.</p><p>His watch beeped, indicating his time was up. Drew switched off the countdown function as he retreated behind a ficus tree and watched the road until he spotted several dark vehicles driving at high speed toward Bill\u2019s wrecked compact.</p><p>Time to live.</p><p>Riordan ran every morning before he came into work, and covered the mile of uneven ground to his next destination in less than five minutes. Under the camouflage tarp covering the four-wheeler he\u2019d stashed in the woods were also two tanks of gas and a backpack containing ten thousand dollars in cash, clothes, a disposable cell phone, and his new identity. The ATV started up at once, but the cell phone\u2019s battery was drained and needed recharging.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He had forgotten to pack a charger, and would have to buy another phone before he could call in to Rowan and let her and Matthias know he\u2019d been exposed. That wouldn\u2019t happen for at least four or five hours, after he\u2019d put some distance between him and GenHance and picked up the rest of what he needed, but it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>He climbed on, started the engine, and took off.</p><p>Jessa spent the rest of the day in the library writing out translations in English of the passages she read concerning Matthias\u2019s supposed vampires. She no longer had any interest in the books, but the task allowed her to calm down and think more clearly. Her life had been completely disrupted, and her isolation here had led her to feel some reluctant sympathy for Matthias and Rowan. She\u2019d almost forgotten that they were, in fact, keeping her prisoner here.</p><p>It had to be the dreams. Something about them was affecting her, was making her feel trust for a man who had abducted her. Who had imprisoned her.</p><p>I want to kiss your mouth.</p><p>What else did he want from her? What else would he take?</p><p>Once she finished the translations, she left the notebook beside the books and returned to her room, where she sat and mentally reviewed everything she had seen in the tunnels and rooms. It would be next to impossible to steal a knife from the kitchen; Rowan immediately noticed anything that was out of place. She\u2019d never seen any hand tools around that might help her pry loose the bricks. Some of the daggers in the display cases looked strong enough, but the cases were always kept locked.</p><p>The dinner hour came and went, but Jessa didn\u2019t bother to join Rowan and Matthias in the kitchen. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to keep up the pretense anymore.</p><p>She tried to nap, but her thoughts refused to let her sleep. She took one of the paperbacks Matthias had given her, but the beautifully written words of Val McDermid\u2019s historical mystery danced before her eyes. Finally she gave up trying to entertain herself and went to get something to snack on from the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she saw Matthias working at the counter, she almost turned around and went back to her room.</p><p>\u201cYou did not come for the evening meal,\u201d he said without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI forgot the time.\u201d She smelled something sweet. \u201cI\u2019m not very hungry anyway.\u201d At the same time, her stomach growled.</p> <p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said, taking some strawberries from the bowl Rowan kept on the kitchen table. \u201cI will share my fruit with you.\u201d</p><p>Jessa watched Matthias sort through and pile the strawberries into a crystal bowl before he began adding other things to them. After seeing him work out with his odd stone weights she expected him to be clumsy or heavy-handed, but instead he worked with a chef\u2019s confident skill.</p><p>\u201cDo you always cook for your prisoners?\u201d She winced as she saw him pour balsamic vinegar over the fruit. \u201cOr is this your way of getting rid of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not eat as you should. That is why you are so quick to anger.\u201d He added sugar and cream to the bowl before bringing it to the table. \u201cAn empty belly only feeds the temper.\u201d He reached for the pepper grinder and twisted it over the fruit.</p><p>Jessa muffled a laugh. \u201cJust out of curiosity, have you ever heard of using a cookbook?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He swirled the bowl a few times before he reached in and plucked out one of the cream-coated strawberries, holding it by its green top as he offered it to her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not crazy about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaste.\u201d He rubbed the tip of the strawberry across her bottom lip, smearing some of the cream mixture along the curve when she didn\u2019t cooperate. \u201cAre you afraid you will like it?\u201d</p><p>She bit the strawberry in half, intending to spit the vile thing back into his face. Then the warm berry\u2019s tart juice, made silky and sweet by the sugar and smooth cream, filled her mouth. The vinegar and pepper only amplified the tastes, giving it a very subtle edge and touch of heat.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jessa didn\u2019t realize she had closed her eyes until she opened them. \u201cThat\u2019s ... different.\u201d</p><p>Matthias\u2019s faint smile didn\u2019t reach the translucent jade of his eyes as he brought the rest of the strawberry to his mouth, his teeth neatly separating the berry from the top. His jaw muscles flexed as he slowly chewed and swallowed, but his eyes never left hers.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, so I was wrong.\u201d Feeling a little self-conscious, she licked the cream from her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d She tried to take another.</p><p>One big hand pushed the bowl out of her reach. \u201cOnly good?\u201d</p><p>He had to rub it in, of course. \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want another?\u201d He took a second berry from the bowl, but when she tried to take it from him, he moved his hand away. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Jessa didn\u2019t like the way he was looking at her\u2014as if she were something he wanted to bite. \u201cI can feed myself, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very well.\u201d He held the strawberry under her nose. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh she imitated a guppy.</p><p>Matthias didn\u2019t let her have it this time. Instead he teased her, placing the berry between her lips and then taking it away before she could take a bite, rubbing it here and there until she grabbed his wrist.</p> <p>Shadowlight.</p><p>Jessa stood at the edge of a winter forest. Thick, icy air wrapped around her, and snow was everywhere, under her feet, weighing down the tree branches, and slowly swirling above her head, spinning and floating as it fell from the sky. The setting sun polished each flake until they glinted like tiny bits of glass. Ahead of her a clearing funneled its thick white drifts between two enormous, frost-covered stones.</p><p>Sunlight.</p><p>Her heart beat once, twice, and then she was back in the kitchen, still trying to arm-wrestle a strawberry away from Matthias.</p><p>Disoriented as she was by the unexpected touch-sight, she couldn\u2019t seem to let go of his wrist. \u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you want something, it is.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to notice anything was wrong with her. With a deliberate show of strength, he brought the strawberry to his mouth, biting it so that streams of juice and cream ran down his palm and onto her fingers.</p><p>Jessa released him, but now he took hold of her wrist and guided her hand to his mouth. The shock of returning to herself so quickly faded as he put his tongue to her skin and slowly licked one finger and then another clean. Her breath rasped in her throat as he took the tip of her smallest finger into his mouth and sucked lightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she heard herself ask, her voice so low and distant it seemed to come from that faraway winter forest.</p><p>\u201cTasting.\u201d His free hand spanned the front of her throat before he slid it under her hair and curled it over the back of her neck. \u201cDo you want more?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean the strawberries, which was fine, because she couldn\u2019t think about them. As she tried to form the word \u201cno,\u201d his tongue found the center of her palm and stroked it before his teeth tested the sensitive mound of flesh beneath her thumb.</p><p>That love bite set something loose inside her, a hot, heavy, feline ache that climbed over her breasts and inched down to curl in her lap, sinking sharp little claws into the tense muscles of her thighs and drawing a thick, silky tail of sensation between them.</p><p>His hand on her nape tugged, urging her forward. He was going to kiss her.</p><p>In her mind she saw herself crossing the now unbearable distance between them, pressing his mouth to the tight peak throbbing over her heart. She saw her own hands tearing open her blouse so he could get at it, so he could suck her properly, while she took his gilded hair in small, tight fists\u2014</p><p>His face blurred before her eyes as he came closer, and the warmth of his breath touched her lips. \u201cJezebel ...\u201d</p><p>The name and all its secrets hit her like a slap, and she jerked, finding her feet and almost knocking over the chair as she backed away. A stumble later she had put three feet and a fortress of sanity between them.</p><p>If Jessa understood anything, it was the shadowlight. It never lied to her, never showed her anything but cold, hard truth. Matthias had walked through that winter forest; he had left something terrible in it. He might have killed and buried someone there; that might explain what she had seen and felt the first time she\u2019d touched him.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d A quick turn allowed her to hide most of the shaking and the stupid look she felt sure was plastered on her face. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Jessa didn\u2019t hear him following her, but halfway to her room she felt him loom up behind her. Confronting him interested her about as much as encouraging him, so she kept moving. She reached her room and turned the pretty porcelain knob when his hand shot past her cheek and flattened against the edge to hold the door in place.</p><p>A wall of hard chest muscle brushed her shoulders before he bent his head to murmur beside her ear, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me. Why?\u201d</p><p>Afraid of him? If he didn\u2019t soon get away from her, she was going to climb up him and the wall and dig her way out of here with her bare hands.</p><p>Or worse, she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of you.\u201d She pulled on the knob and managed to get the door to open an inch before he shoved it closed again.</p><p>Jessa ducked under his arm to get out from under him, but he turned her and had her up against the wall before she could blink. This close she could see every detail of the mark on his throat. What sort of man believed that forever was a black snake biting its own tail? She forced herself to look up into his face, but light from behind him effectively masked his features.</p><p>\u201cYou are still empty.\u201d His fingers spread over her abdomen, the edges of his fingernails scratching the fabric of her skirt as he pressed them in and out in a kneading motion. \u201cDo you feel it here?\u201d His hand shifted lower, stopping just short of sliding between her legs. \u201cOr here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I would stay here and let you protect me from Genaro,\u201d Jessa said, keeping her tone reasonable. \u201cYou never said that I\u2019d have to sleep with you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep with me?\u201d He sounded amused. \u201cThat is not what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Now she was lying, too. \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear,\u201d he repeated, almost thoughtfully. \u201cIt means so that we understand each other, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. No sleeping together. No dreams.\u201d She glanced down meaningfully, but he didn\u2019t step back. \u201cNow you say good-night and go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do not yet understand me. When I have you\u201d\u2014he clamped his hands around her waist\u2014\u201cyou will not dream. You will not sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jessa grabbed his shoulders as he lifted her off her feet and pinned her to the wall. His head bent, but instead of forcing a kiss on her lips he put his mouth to her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhen I have you,\u201d he said again, \u201cthere will be nothing between us. No clothes. No fear. No words.\u201d</p><p>The smell of him, all summer heat, clouded her thoughts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will give yourself to me. I will take you.\u201d He pushed the hem of her skirt up with his knee and nudged her thighs apart. \u201cI will put myself inside you here, where you need me. Where I need to be.\u201d He bit her earlobe, the side of her jaw, and the spot where her neck curved into her shoulder before he lifted his head. \u201cThat is how it will work. Am I clear to you?\u201d</p><p>Jessa closed her arms around his neck and held on as the unyielding iron of his thigh rubbed against her. Sweat traced the line of her back as her struggle turned inside out and she fought the wild heat rising inside her. If she didn\u2019t put a stop to this now she would do anything he wanted, right here against the wall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d She pushed at his shoulders. \u201cPut me down. I can\u2019t do this. Not with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he said, his mouth as cool and hard as his words against her lips.</p><p>April 29, 1998</p><p>Dear Mom,</p><p>Hi from Italy! I\u2019ll probably get home before this letter arrives, but Donnie\u2019s on the phone trying to confirm our flight back and I have to write all this stuff down before I forget something. You would not believe what\u2019s happened in the last three days. Seriously! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I really love Italy, and Donnie is the best fianc\u00e9 a girl could have. But honestly, Mom, I hate climbing mountains. It\u2019s cold, it\u2019s wet, and there\u2019s nothing but rocks and trees and more rocks and trees. When we get back from this trip, and you ever hear me or Donnie say the words \u201cmountain climbing\u201d again, I want you to slap some sense into both of us.</p><p>Saturday Donnie and I drove to the Alps and stopped at that inn I told you about, the really pretty one at the base of the mountain in that pretty town. We were just planning to stay there for the night and make a one-day trip to Berlin to get some chocolate and that cuckoo clock Grandma wanted. Well, you know how Donnie gets the minute he\u2019s near anything taller than a hill, and then he met this group of German rock climbers. They got to talking and next thing I know this chick Gerta is lending me some of her gear so we can go climbing with them.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go. Seriously! Our tour guide back in Rome told us it was the wrong time of year to climb. But you know Donnie. Show him a rock hammer and he\u2019s strapping on his boots. Anyway, the Germans were pretty nice for climbers, and that girl Gerta helped me keep up. Still, it took five hours to climb up from the inn to this stupid pass, and by the time we got to the top I was ready to ralph up my breakfast in Donnie\u2019s lap. Everything was all slushy and dripping, and then this huge slab of snow and ice just collapsed and rolled down the mountain. I swear, if we hadn\u2019t stopped under this big boulder overhang thing, your little girl wouldn\u2019t be writing this letter. Seriously.</p> <p>I wanted to go down right then, but one of the Germans spotted another climber in the snow and yelled, and of course we had to slog through all this crap that came off the top of the mountain to dig the poor guy out. At first I thought he was dead for sure, and then he opened his eyes and sat up and\u2014oh, God, this is, like, the most embarrassing thing\u2014he was totally naked. The only thing on his bod was this wicked tat of a snake.</p><p>Fritz, one of the German guys, said people do that sometimes when they get hypothermia\u2014they get a little weird in the head, think it\u2019s hot instead of cold and then start stripping. Seriously! Thank heavens Donnie had a change of clothes in his pack or the poor guy would have finished freezing to death.</p><p>The amazing thing was that even though he was buck naked and got hit by an avalanche and everything, he wasn\u2019t hurt, not really. I mean, he had a bad cut on his head, and he was kind of out of it, but no broken bones or anything like that. Gerta thought he might have some kind of, like, brain injury, because he couldn\u2019t talk or tell us his name or anything. He didn\u2019t seem to understand us, either, no matter what language we used. I said some stuff I remembered from high school French class, and Donnie tried Italian and Spanish, but no luck. Did you know Germans speak, like, twenty different languages? They tried everything they knew, until Gerta said he was probably, like, really traumatized from getting caught in the avalanche and we should take him down to the inn and get a doctor to take a look at him.</p><p>I thought it would take forever to climb back down with this guy being hurt and all, but he kept up with us and even showed Fritz this faster way down, so he must have been a really experienced climber. He didn\u2019t seem upset until we got to the inn, and then he got a little freaked out. He kept looking around like he didn\u2019t know where he was. Donnie said it was a delayed reaction or something. First the guy looked like he was going to pass out right there in the parking lot, and the Germans had to grab him to keep him from running out into the middle of the street.</p><p>The people at the inn didn\u2019t know who he was, but since he was hurt and kind of starved-looking they were really nice and gave him a room and a huge free meal and stuff. They also called this doctor from the village who checked him out. Later he came by to talk to me and Donnie, and said the man had some sort of amnesia that usually happens to people after they go through wars and stuff. The name of it had letters, like PMS, but I can\u2019t remember exactly what they are now.</p> <p>I almost freaked out the next morning when we went to check on him, and the innkeeper said he borrowed some gear from the Germans and went back up the mountain. Seriously! You\u2019d think after what he\u2019d been through he\u2019d be scared to climb, but no, the guy jumped right back on the horse. He didn\u2019t come back until just before we were going to leave, and he looked better, but I think he was really upset. He still couldn\u2019t talk to us, but he used his hands to, like, say thank-you, and gave Donnie and Fritz each an old, nasty-looking coin.</p><p>I wanted Donnie to throw that thing away, it was so covered with crud, but he said he thought it was really old and we should have it appraised. So while we were in Berlin Donnie took it to this coin dealer, and the dealer washed off the crud and got all quiet and then he told Donnie that it was pure gold and in mint condition and stuff. Get this, Mom: It\u2019s, like, two thousand years old and worth a huge pile of money. Seriously!</p><p>The dealer said we could get a lot more money for it from a collector in the States. Donnie\u2019s worried we could get in trouble for taking it out of Italy, but I\u2019m just going to stick it in my bra. Like customs is going to look there, right? So when we get home we\u2019re going to sell it and use the money to pay for a really nice wedding. Donnie said if we sell it to the right person there might even be enough left over for us to put a down payment on a town house. Tell Daddy, since I know that will make him happy, ha ha ha.</p><p>Oh, I almost forgot\u2014I don\u2019t know what happened to the man with amnesia, but he was gone when we stopped at the inn on our way back to Rome. The innkeeper said he just walked down the road the day we left and disappeared. Donnie thought about calling the newspapers, you know? But I told him that they would for sure want to know where that guy found the coin and if there were more, etc. So we\u2019re not going to tell anyone. I know\u2014you and Daddy would say we should go to the police, but we really did save that man\u2019s life. So we\u2019re looking at this like a little reward for being Good Samaritans, that\u2019s all.</p><p>We\u2019re going on to Venice like we planned, and I\u2019ll call you from there to make sure you have the right flight number and gate and stuff and when we\u2019ll be arriving at LAX. Give Daddy and Jimmy and Sarah a hug for me, and see you next week!</p><p>Love,</p> <p>Becky</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The many wars Matthias had fought had not all taken place on blood-soaked battlefields. Some, like the one Jessa was fighting, happened in the endless expanse of the soul, where the combatants could not be seen or heard, only felt.</p><p>In that golden place within, where the truth of her shone bright and hot as the summer sun, she fought herself.</p><p>Her body trembled and her fingers dug into his arms, and she was so rigid that she felt like a bundle of dry twigs ready to snap. But her soft, lush mouth welcomed his, and she tasted as sweet and hot as her hidden self, the woman he met every night in his dreams, all woman, all eager desire now.</p><p>The dampness of her skin and the change in her scent told him that she would soon lose this battle, and if she did so in his arms she would never forgive herself. That alone gave him enough will to fight back his own need and ease away from her.</p><p>\u201cThere is no reason to fear this,\u201d he said, keeping their hands linked. \u201cIt has been between us since the first moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you kidnapped me,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I looked into your eyes.\u201d He ran his hand over her hair, moving it back from her brow. \u201cI knew then that you were made for me. That you were meant for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you,\u201d she said again, with less conviction. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not meant for you.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to pick her up, carry her into her room, and show her with his mouth and hands and body what he could say only with words now. But that was what she was expecting: to be overpowered, to be taken. That would allow her to continue the battle inside her soul, for she could then hold both sides of herself blameless.</p><p>As much as he wanted her, he would not force her. \u201cI will wait for you to come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what is more insulting,\u201d she said, her face becoming a mask of calm. \u201cYou thinking that I\u2019m afraid, or that I\u2019d want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think. I know.\u201d He pressed his mouth to her brow before she could move away. \u201cYou cannot command fate, Jezebel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my name,\u201d she said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cNeither is Jessa.\u201d He released her and left her there.</p><p>Matthias spent the rest of the evening working the stones until his muscles ached and he dripped with sweat. After he bathed, he went to his room and slept for an hour before rising and going to the communications room. There he read through his e-mails, and found one sent from a mobile phone with an unfamiliar number.</p><p>From: D.</p><p>To: Rainman</p><p>Subject: Moving</p><p>Hey, everything looking peachy? Not so much here. I\u2019m okay but my apartment caught fire so I\u2019m out looking for a new place. I have what\u2019s left of the furniture, but I could use some help with moving it or I\u2019ll have to borrow a truck. I\u2019ll be hanging at Tag\u2019s place until noon. Give my regards to the ladies.</p><p>Later, D</p><p>\u201cD\u201d identified the sender as Drew Riordan, as did the beginning words, the first letters of each spelling \u201chelp.\u201d Rowan was the only one who could interpret the meaning of the rest of the message, but Matthias could guess the gravity of his situation. The only reason Drew would have sent a coded message was if somehow his presence at GenHance had been discovered, and he had been forced to leave to avoid being taken.</p><p>Matthias went to wake Rowan, who blinked sleepily until he told her about Drew\u2019s message. She sat up and read the copy he had printed.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t catch him in the act, but they found out what he\u2019s been doing,\u201d she said as she decoded the message. \u201cHe had time to dupe his files and then fry all the computers in his department before he took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis absence will confirm that he was the one passing information to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will all the crap they find when they search his office.\u201d She threw off her covers and bounced out of the bed. \u201cHe needs transportation. He says he\u2019s going to wait for a pickup in Price Park until noon. If we don\u2019t show by then, he\u2019ll steal something and go to ground.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Matthias caught her arm as she went to the closet. \u201cYou cannot go alone to retrieve Drew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave Queenie here by herself,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s already noticed the fire doors sealing the tunnels. How long do you think it will take her to figure out that the dome lights open them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenHance will be searching for Drew,\u201d he told her. \u201cI will send for one of the others to accompany you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all too far away to get to Atlanta by noon.\u201d She heaved out a breath. \u201cMatt, we knew this might happen, and now it has. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She eyed the door. \u201cNow would you get out of here so I can change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the library before you go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rowan met him there a few minutes later. She had dressed in her leather garments, and carried her spare helmet and a hard-sided case that fastened to the back of her motorcycle.</p><p>Matthias handed her an envelope filled with currency, a disposable mobile phone, and a pair of sheathed blades.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like weapons,\u201d she reminded him, but clipped the sheaths to her belt above each hip.</p> <p>\u201cNeither does Drew. Here is his photo.\u201d He handed her the snapshot Drew had given him when they had first met.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She studied it. \u201cHe does have red hair. But he doesn\u2019t look geeky.\u201d She glanced up and saw his expression. \u201cHe described himself to me once on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will send him a photo of you as well, so that he will know you on sight,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou will be careful and return as soon as you may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be reckless and probably stop for dinner on the way back.\u201d She grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, boss. I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather have watching my back than Drew.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cExcept you.\u201d</p><p>Matthias pulled her into his arms and held her for a moment, and then let her go.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d she promised, and slipped out.</p> <p>He went to the fireplace to retrieve the blank documents he would need to use to create a new identity for Drew, and saw faint marks on the edges of the false bricks. Jessa had found his cache, and had tried unsuccessfully to open it. Her offer to translate the stories about the dark Kyn had been a lie.</p><p>He went out and down the tunnel toward her room, which he found empty. The lingering trace of her scent led him to Rowan\u2019s room. She must have been outside listening to them. She would have heard Rowan speak of the dome lights that opened the fire doors. That meant there was now nothing to stop her from going topside\u2014except him.</p><p>Jessa watched as Matthias came out of the library, and as soon as he went around the corner toward Rowan\u2019s room she moved, hurrying inside. She went immediately to the fireplace cache, which he\u2019d left open, and reached into the steel-lined box, taking out a stack of files.</p><p>The topmost was labeled with her adopted name, Minerva Jessamine Starret, and contained a complete dossier on her dating back to the year her father had adopted her. Matthias had found copies of the old newspaper articles on Darien\u2019s funeral, the massacre at Oglethorpe Consolidated, and her own disappearance from the hospital. There were also dozens of photographs, all candid shots of her in Atlanta. He must have followed her for days to take the shots; he had photographed her standing by her car, entering her office building, driving downtown, walking through parking lots ... and sitting by the fountain in the park.</p><p>He had been there that night, watching her. Listening to her.</p><p>Jessa tore the photographs out of the file and flung them into the flames, and then threw the entire folder in on top of them before she opened the next one in the pile.</p><p>The rest of the files contained the same type of information on dozens of men and women all over the country. Some of the profiles were comprehensive, but four contained only bits and pieces on four people who had not been identified by name: a professor, a zoologist, a cop, and a midwife. Jessa recognized the description of the zoologist\u2014she had to be Delilah. Then she saw that someone had written the name Delilah in the margin of one of the pages.</p><p>He knew as much\u2014if not more\u2014about the Takyn as she did.</p> <p>Jessa\u2019s anger swelled as she focused on the masthead at the top of one of the forms. She couldn\u2019t believe her eyes at first, and flipped through the others to find the masthead the same on each one. Every report had been written on company stationery by one Andrew Riordan, chief technical supervisor at GenHance, Inc.</p><p>Matthias had lied to her all along. He wasn\u2019t saving her from GenHance. He was working for them. He\u2019d taken her for them.</p><p>She pitched all of the files into the flames, and when they didn\u2019t burn at once she scanned the room. She spotted and seized a small oil lamp sitting to one side, removed the wick holder, and dumped the contents on top of the smoldering heap of folders. The oil caused the fire to roar, scorching the stones around the edge of the hearth before it died down. By the time it did, all of Matthias\u2019s dossiers had been reduced to curls of ash.</p><p>She checked the cache again for more information, but found only several stacks of bills and an envelope filled with blank passports, driver\u2019s license forms, and Social Security cards. She emptied the cache, grimacing as she pocketed several thousand dollars. She didn\u2019t want to steal his money, but she\u2019d need it once she escaped. She took the rest and fed it to the fire, taking considerable, savage delight in watching his money and means of changing his identity burn as well.</p><p>She knew Matthias might have discovered her ruse by now, so she left the library and followed the route she had planned. Now that she knew they\u2019d been using the fire doors to seal off the tunnels, and how to open them, she made her way to the one that concealed the surface hatch. Rowan had left it open, but as she passed over the threshold a shadow separated from the wall and strong arms grabbed her from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou did not say good-bye,\u201d Matthias said against her ear.</p><p>Jessa kicked and writhed, frantic to free herself, but he kept her locked against him and lifted her off her feet, hauling her back into the tunnels and using his elbow to press the dome light and seal the fire door.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting and I will put you down,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d she shouted, thrashing against his arms.</p><p>Matthias carried Jessa back to his room, where he placed her facedown on his pallet, straddled her waist, and reached for one of the belts hanging on the wall.</p><p>She jerked her head up. \u201cYou are not beating me with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not beat women.\u201d Quickly he looped the pliant leather around her wrists, cinching them together before he tied them to the top of his pallet frame. Her heels drummed against his back as she arched and pulled but found she could not free herself.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he told her, putting one hand on her neck and the other flat against her right shoulder. \u201cIt will be easier if you are.\u201d</p><p>She jerked. \u201cI\u2019m not lying here and letting you rape me.\u201d</p><p>His own anger flared; how could she think he would do such a thing to her? He bent over and put his mouth next to her ear. \u201cIf I wanted to fuck you, woman, I would have tied you down on your back.\u201d</p><p>Her movements stilled, and she dragged in some air. \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>When he did this in the past he found speaking in a soft, persuasive voice helped greatly, but there was no point in speaking to her, not when she was in this agitated state. He would gentle her first, and then they would talk.</p><p>Matthias felt the taut muscles in her neck and back, and worked the flat of his fingers against them, rocking his hand as he rubbed until he felt some of the tenseness ease. She was all fight and fire, but one could not battle forever, and even the fiercest flames eventually burned low.</p><p>He wished he kept a brush in his room so he could draw it through the blue-black mass of her hair, now spilling all around her face in wild abandon, but he kept his own too short to need grooming. Once he had rubbed both sides of her neck and both shoulders, he went to work on her spine, pressing his fists on either side and moving his knuckles in gentle, circular motions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a massage?\u201d he heard her say. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He made his way down as far as her waist, and then lifted his weight and shifted back onto her thighs. The curves of her flanks tempted him to part her legs and rub her where she most needed the relief, but that he would do later, when she opened herself to his touch willingly. He merely allowed himself to run his hands over her buttocks once before he shifted back again, stroking his thumbs across the bunched muscles of her thighs.</p><p>She had beautiful hips and strong legs. Once he reasoned with her, he would use his hands on them again.</p><p>Matthias turned completely around so that he straddled her thighs but faced her feet, and lifted the right calf by the ankle. She tried to back-kick him again, but he held her fast and tugged down the trouser to expose her leg.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d she snarled, straining against his grip.</p><p>\u201cLie still.\u201d When she didn\u2019t, he added, \u201cI can do this with your legs bound.\u201d</p><p>That quieted her at once.</p><p>Returning to his task, he wrapped his hand around her leg, beginning just below the knee. With firm, drawing strokes, he worked her calf from knee to ankle, going down a little farther each time, pumping the heel of his hand against the rigid extension of her muscles until that too, softened. He attended her other leg, and when she had gone limp beneath him he took hold of her left foot.</p><p>She groaned something, and he heard the leather of his belt creak.</p><p>A woman\u2019s foot was a tender, delicate thing, and Jessa\u2019s narrow, gracefully arched sole was the same color as her lips. It proved to be almost as sensitive, he discovered as he found the first of her pleasure points just beneath the center of her toes. Using his fingertips, he caught and squeezed the nerve endings there with just enough pressure to make her twitch, and then brought his thumb up beneath to smooth over the spot.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her words came out in a low plea. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Matthias found a second point, and then a third, and attended to them with equal care. He had never known a woman to have more than that, but his ministrations revealed another two along the arched inside. The skin was so delicate he feared he might bruise her with his hands, so he lowered his head and put his mouth to her so that he might use his tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bucked under him, crying out as he drew the edge of his teeth over one spot and then the other to see just how responsive they were. \u201cMatthias.\u201d</p><p>From her shivering and moving under him she was close, so he used his mouth on her other foot, nipping and licking with deliberate pressure, his fingers playing over the other bundles of nerves in tandem, until he felt her body stiffen and the sound of pleasure and release come from her throat.</p><p>Matthias lifted himself from the pallet and reached for his belt, releasing it and removing it from her wrists. Both were slightly reddened, chafed not from the loops but from her struggles against the leather. He massaged both wrists gently before he rolled her over and sat down beside her.</p> <p>She stared up at him, her rain-colored eyes drowsy. \u201cWhy did you do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it.\u201d He brushed a trickle of sweat from her temple. \u201cIt has been a long time for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need ...\u201d She bit down on her lip and looked away from him.</p><p>He caught her cheek and turned her face back to see his. \u201cYour pleasure is enough. When you come to me, when we join our bodies, I will make you feel much more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll kill me,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Jessa tried to sit up, but her arms trembled too much, and she slumped back. \u201cI can hardly move. Is this your ability? Massaging someone into a vegetative state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not an ability,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly it is what I did to my horse whenever he became unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, her lips quivered, and then she began to laugh. \u201cYou rubbed me down like a horse?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI did not do the same to his hooves. He would not have felt it. Or liked it as much.\u201d He took her hand in his. \u201cWe must speak the truth to each other now, Jessa.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cYou could start by telling me why you lied about working for GenHance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did not lie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the files in the library,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery report you have came from GenHance. Did they hire you to abduct me? Is this some sort of brainwashing by isolation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reports are from GenHance. Until today, my friend Drew worked there. He sent us copies of all the reports on those Genaro has identified as Kyndred. We have been trying to reach them before they are taken. You were the latest.\u201d He saw that she didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cYou heard me speaking to Rowan about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you both knew I was listening.\u201d Doubt filled her eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway. I burned all the files. And your money, and your fake IDs.\u201d</p><p>Now it was his turn to chuckle. \u201cYou are very loyal to your friends, Minerva.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that. Minerva Starret died in that hospital ten years ago. I just inherited the body.\u201d With a groan she sat up, using his hand as leverage, and then rubbed her damp face. \u201cI need to use your washbasin.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around her, helping her over and holding her upright as she picked up the water jug and tipped it to fill the basin.</p><p>\u201cMatthias?\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>He bent over. \u201cDo you need a towel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The last thing he saw was the swing of the jug before it smashed into his face.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Lucan accompanied the hunters back to the interstate and the scene of the last man known to be killed by Lawson. Eight days had passed since the senseless murder, but their nightly searches had turned up nothing of use. It was as if the man had existed for only a space of forty-eight ghastly hours, and had been snatched up by the hand of God from this desolate place.</p><p>\u201cThe ground still reeks of him,\u201d Devon, the lead tracker, said. A falconer in his human life, he had acquired as a Kyn warrior the ability to see through the eyes of his hunting birds. After discovering the animals that had died after exposure to the body, however, Devon had left his peregrines behind. \u201c \u2019Twill have to be burned over and strewn with copper.\u201d He crossed himself. \u201cPerhaps even blessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Father and fallen angels had nothing to do with this.\u201d Lucan crouched, removed his glove, and touched the ground. Where the body parts had lain, the soil felt wrong, but he could not define how. He scanned the area before he stood. \u201cGabriel Seran is yet in Europe chasing after lost Kyn, is he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is said, my lord,\u201d Devon said.</p><p>\u201cDamn me. If anyone could track this thing, it would be him.\u201d His mobile rang, and he checked the display before he flipped it open. \u201cWhat is it, Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too, big guy,\u201d she replied. \u201cKendrick said you were out hunting, but this can\u2019t wait until morning. I analyzed the tissue samples he sent over from the last victim. The good news is, we can break out the champagne. Bradford Lawson is definitely not Darkyn.\u201d</p><p>He would celebrate later. \u201cWhat else can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe victim\u2019s tissues are saturated with a powerful neurotoxin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA poison produced by the body and lethal to pretty much anything that breathes,\u201d she explained. \u201cI can\u2019t identify it, but the components share similar characteristics to flying-insect venom.\u201d</p><p>He took the phone away from his ear, stared at it, and then spoke again to her. \u201cAlex, while I am quite certain that you have more knowledge in your smallest finger than the sum of what resides between my ears, I can assure you that a bee or a wasp did not kill this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless there were a couple million of them involved,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhoever or whatever this killer is, he probably can produce this venom in large quantities. My guess is he uses it like our abilities, and with it he can stun or kill anything he bites or touches.\u201d</p><p>Lucan gazed at the men around him. \u201cDoes this venom affect us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI tested it on several Kyn blood samples, and our pathogen ate it for breakfast. But, Lucan, that makes us the only living things who are immune to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all very well and good,\u201d he told her, \u201cbut we cannot pick up a scent trail, and there have been no more bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s begun eating them, there won\u2019t be.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThe tissue samples sent to me gave off an extremely strong odor that blocked out everything else I could smell in the lab, even Michael. It\u2019s probably a hundred times worse there. You need to move away from where the body was found.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHas Sam tried to read the victim\u2019s blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Seeing what Lawson did to the first victim caused her to collapse.\u201d He stared at the blood-soaked ground. \u201cI will not allow her to know what was done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d And the tone of her voice told her that she did. \u201cCall me if you need anything else.\u201d</p><p>Some of the knot in his gut loosened. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Lucan switched off the phone and breathed in. He had hunted hundreds of killers during his lengthy existence. Not one of them, no matter how mad, had given off such a stench.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d Devon asked.</p><p>\u201cLady Alexandra has determined that this one is not Kyn,\u201d he told the men. \u201cNor is he human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA changeling, perhaps?\u201d one of the other hunters suggested. \u201cThere are creatures who feed on the dead. If he has been using their blood ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe vows he is not one of us. And changeling or not, no Kyn can consume flesh.\u201d Lucan paced around the marked perimeter as he inhaled over and over. As before, there was no scent trail leading away from the crime scene, but the farther he moved from the rotten odor left behind by the body, the easier it was to breathe. Then he picked up the faintest trace of something else\u2014a different scent, one of sweat and chemicals\u2014emanating from another source.</p><p>He found the flashlight sitting in a clump of weeds, and removed it. The batteries were dead, but as soon as he picked it up the sour, unpleasant smell intensified.</p><p>\u201cI think he must have handled this,\u201d he said to Devon when the tracker joined him, and indicated two dark stains on the handle. \u201cBlood.\u201d He sniffed them. \u201cNot polluted as the dead man\u2019s was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to me,\u201d a familiar voice said.</p><p>Lucan looked up to see his sygkenis walking down from the road. He handed the flashlight to Devon before he strode up to meet her. \u201cYou were not to come to this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet here I am.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cOrdering Kendrick to keep me away was a nice move. Too bad it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>When she tried to walk past him, he seized her by the arm. \u201cThis is my work, not yours. You will return to the city.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cYou want me to accept what I am, and be Darkyn, and handle all the shit that comes along with it, but only when it\u2019s convenient for you and I won\u2019t get in the way? Is that how you think this is going to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha, you cannot see this. Not after what was done to this man. Lawson\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAte parts of him. I know. I made Kendrick tell me. That\u2019s why we have to find him, tonight, before he does this again.\u201d She tried to shrug off his hold. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d He picked her up to toss her over his broad shoulder, but she wound her arms around his neck and kissed him. That sent all the fear and anger out of his head, and slowly he lowered her down onto her feet.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he muttered against her mouth. \u201cYou are not fighting fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one says I have to. Listen to me.\u201d She put her cool hands to his cheeks. \u201cI can do this. I\u2019m stronger than you think. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cDevon,\u201d he called out, not looking away from her beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d The tracker joined them.</p><p>\u201cGive my sygkenis the flashlight.\u201d To her, he said, \u201cThere is some blood on the handle. I think it came from Lawson.\u201d When she opened her mouth to argue, he added, \u201cI know he is still alive. But you were able to read my blood that night at your apartment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou died a human death and came back to life as something else,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThat was the only reason I could.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cUntil last week, this man was mortal. Alexandra says he is not Darkyn, but perhaps he underwent a transition like ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She took the flashlight from Devon. \u201cThe blood is a week old anyway, I probably won\u2019t.\u201d Abruptly she stopped speaking and gripped the handle, denting the aluminum surface beneath her fingers as her eyes closed.</p> <p>She shuddered once, and then froze. The flashlight fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d He rested his hands on her shoulders. When she didn\u2019t respond, he shook her. \u201cWake up. Damn it, you will not do this to me again. Samantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly as she looked up at him, her eyes huge. \u201cI won\u2019t. Yellow jackets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He is wearing a yellow jacket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey killed him.\u201d She moved past him and went to a spot some yards away. He followed her, and there saw the mounds of dead insects on the ground around a broken nest. \u201cHere.\u201d She pointed to a depression in the ground. \u201cYou were right. He did die. Right here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe rose again, the way we did. But he\u2019s not like us. He\u2019s like the insects. On the inside, where you can\u2019t see it.\u201d Her expression twisted as she pressed her hands to the sides of her head. \u201cI can feel him now. He\u2019s in my head. He can feel them, too. Jesus, he\u2019s almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d When she didn\u2019t answer, he caught her chin. \u201cSamantha, look at me. Where has Lawson gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to where Jessa Bellamy is,\u201d she said simply. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to Savannah.\u201d</p><p>Jessa dropped the handle that had broken off the porcelain pitcher, bent, and pressed her fingers to the side of Matthias\u2019s neck. His pulse beat steadily under her fingertips, and the cut on his forehead wasn\u2019t bleeding too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said before she stepped over his motionless form and ran out of the room.</p> <p>She\u2019d never struck another person in her life, and she felt horribly ashamed of herself. She didn\u2019t want to leave him like this, helpless and alone. But this was her only chance to escape, and whether he was telling the truth or just another elaborate series of lies, she had to get away from him.</p><p>She opened the fire door leading to the surface hatch, and went through it to a narrow stairwell. She climbed up two levels, and saw a landing with two different doors. She discovered that neither was locked, and the first one she tried opened to a small, neat garden with a stone path leading out to a street.</p><p>Jessa knew the moment she walked outside that she was in Savannah. As cool and damp as the air was, she could smell the river, and the lush scent of growing things. As she made her way to the street, she noticed the flower beds and the neat rows of small green plants laid out in the tiny yard. Then she glanced back and stumbled as she saw the tall, stately house with its elegant lines and the faded but still sparkling outer coat of dark blue paint.</p><p>Sapphire House. She\u2019d been kept prisoner under her own home. She was standing in her own backyard.</p><p>Jessa shook her head, backing away from the sight before she turned and ran. It was a bad dream\u2014it had to be\u2014but then she saw the square where Darien had died, and the imposing spires of St. John\u2019s, and even the much-hated coffee shop across the street.</p><p>Matthias had brought her home.</p><p>Pain lanced through her head as she fled down the street, away from the square and toward the river. She didn\u2019t know where she was running, only that she had to run; she had to escape this. And still the questions screeched inside her head: How had he known? Why hadn\u2019t he told her? How could he have built that place under her own house?</p><p>She had to stop and catch her breath at the entrance to the riverfront walk, and as she gulped in air she remembered something: Darien had never permitted her to go down into the cellar. He\u2019d frightened her with tales of rats and spiders lurking down in the dark corners, and kept the door latch padlocked.</p> <p>But more than once during her holiday visits from school Darien had disappeared from the house, only to reappear hours later. None of the servants ever saw him leave. Once, when she asked him about it, he told her he\u2019d found his own little hiding place in the house, and he went there when he wanted some peace. Jessa also recalled some odd references to masons coming to the house to talk to her father in the sporadic letters Geraldine had written to her.</p><p>The age of the walls, the odd sizes of the rooms, and the library and the fireplace now made sense. Her father had loved sitting by the fire and reading. Matthias hadn\u2019t built the underground shelter. Darien had, probably using the same tunnels his ancestor had for storing the goods he\u2019d smuggled into the city.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent more on Old Blue than likely I should have, Darien had told her when they\u2019d discussed her legacy. Yet Jessa could never remember her father making any major alterations to the house, or buying any high-priced items. They\u2019d lived quietly and modestly, and Darien hadn\u2019t cared to throw parties or waste money on keeping up with Savannah society. The only thing she could remember him purchasing regularly, in fact, were the books he loved.</p><p>Jessa climbed down the stairs to the side street leading around to the riverfront. All of the shops, bars, and restaurants were closed, so she had the walkways to herself. As she looked out across the river to the new hotel that had been built on Hutchinson Island, she folded her arms around her waist. Everything she knew had changed now, and everyone she had loved was gone. Darien and Tag couldn\u2019t help her with this; there was no one she could rely on, no one to tell her what to do or where to go.</p><p>She was thinking like Minerva. She couldn\u2019t do that. She had to get away from the memories as well as Matthias.</p><p>A clock in the window of one of the shops told her it was close to three a.m. In a few hours businesses would begin to open; she\u2019d have to find an Internet caf\u00e9 and contact Aphrodite. She could trust Di, and knew that if she asked, her friend would take her in, at least until she could figure out what to do next.</p><p>\u201cJessa,\u201d someone whispered.</p><p>She turned around, expecting to see Matthias, but found only the empty stretch of walkway. Quickly she hurried toward the next alley that led up to street level, and when she heard the whisper a second time she broke into a flat run.</p><p>Clouds rushed in from the sea, covering the moon and blocking out the starlight. Jessa flinched as lightning flashed over the bridge and thunder boomed, exactly as it had the day Matthias had abducted her from the restaurant.</p><p>He was coming for her again. He\u2019d take her back to Sapphire House, back to the ruins of her life, and then she would go crazy.</p><p>\u201cJessa.\u201d A tall, broad shadow appeared in front of her, blocking her only avenue of escape. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize the voice, but it wasn\u2019t Matthias. Something crawled over her skin, a sense of wrongness, as if the shadow were some sort of nightmare she\u2019d woken to. The man moved closer, and the smell of him struck her like a fist to the belly.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d get away from them,\u201d the voice said. \u201cI could feel you thinking about and planning every little detail. Just the way you did with me.\u201d</p><p>Now she knew the voice. \u201cMr. Lawson?\u201d She backed up a step. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you.\u201d The shadow moved into the light, and it was Lawson, or a man who looked like him, except much bigger, with bulging limbs encased in skintight clothing. Some of his garments had begun tearing in the middle of the seams, as if his body had somehow swelled after he had dressed. He had been very well developed, she remembered from meeting him in the restaurant, but he hadn\u2019t been like this. She would have thought he was wearing some sort of padding under his clothes, except for when she looked into his eyes.</p><p>After one glance she couldn\u2019t bear to look at his face again. His eyes had turned as shiny and black as an insect\u2019s, with no visible corneas, irises, or pupils. When he smiled, she saw something long, sharp, and pointed flash.</p><p>Fangs, she thought. He has fangs.</p><p>\u201cYou look surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t find you?\u201d</p><p>Jessa couldn\u2019t move. \u201cWhat happened to you? What did that to your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou attacked me. You had me crippled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything\u2014\u201d She stopped as she remembered the attack in the restaurant. \u201cMatthias couldn\u2019t have done this to you. I was there. I saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the transerum,\u201d he told her. \u201cI went to GenHance and stole it. Injecting myself with it was the only way I could repair the damage you did to my body. But I\u2019m not angry with you anymore. You made me very strong.\u201d He lashed out, slamming his fist into the wall beside him, and left a deep crater in it as bits of smashed brick fell to the ground. \u201cYou see? I couldn\u2019t do that when I was human. You made me into a god.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she knew everything Matthias had said was the truth. GenHance was experimenting on human beings. Somehow they\u2019d done this. And seeing that Lawson now had fangs, she realized that maybe even the stories about the dark Kyn were true, too.</p><p>What could she say to him, now that he was like this? Was there any way to change him back to the way he had been? Her stomach rolled as she sensed that there wasn\u2019t. \u201cMr. Lawson\u2014Bradford\u2014you should be in the hospital. The doctors can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help. I\u2019m right where I need to be, with you. I came to thank you in person.\u201d He stretched out his arms in an affectionate gesture. \u201cCome here and I will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Matthias woke up with a throbbing head, blood in his eye, and drenched clothes. He saw the fragments of his water jug on the floor around him, checked the gash on his brow, and pushed himself slowly to his feet. The pain receded as he used his sleeve to clear his eye.</p><p>He remembered now. Jessa had pretended to be weak-kneed after the rubdown. He\u2019d helped her to the basin. And she\u2019d bashed him in the head so hard she\u2019d knocked him out. Now she\u2019d fled, and as she knew how to get to the surface, she was probably out on the streets, looking for help. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had to find her before she was seen.</p><p>When Matthias emerged topside, he calmed himself, cleared his mind, and breathed in. Jessa had left a trail of her scent through the little kitchen garden Rowan had planted that led out to the street. He followed it, but once outside the property the scent thinned, telling him that she had broken into a run to the east.</p><p>He should have told her where she was before this. How frightened and confused she must have felt to step out into the night and see Sapphire House. To know that she had been held beneath the home in which she had been raised all this time.</p> <p>He walked east, grateful only that it was still some hours until dawn. He still had a chance to track her and catch her before she exposed her presence in the city. He would explain how he had come to purchase Sapphire House at auction solely for the purpose of using its vast underground labyrinth of old smuggler\u2019s tunnels as a safe haven for Kyndred on the run.</p><p>He stopped in every place that she had, and with each step felt his skin tingle and his chest tighten. Emotion roiled inside him, snarling need mingling with fear, empathy with anger. He had become so attuned to her that he imagined he could feel her, body and soul. From the sensations he felt he guessed she was nearer to him, and she was afraid. He lost the scent for a moment, and looked around before he realized that she had descended the stairwell leading to the riverfront. He took the steps three at a time as he hurried down and ran out onto the river walk.</p><p>Concentrating on the frighteningly acute sense of her, Matthias turned north and moved silently along the storefronts, keeping to the shadows as he looked ahead. He would not charge at her or grab her. He would call her to him. He would find the words to regain her trust. He had to.</p><p>Clouds thickened across the sky, and then he heard her scream. His muscles bunched and he broke into a flat run.</p><p>Jessa stumbled backward out of an alleyway, almost into his arms. She turned and shoved at him, but not to thrust him away.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d she said, her eyes filled with terror. \u201cRun. We have to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, Jessa,\u201d Matthias heard a man\u2019s voice croon. \u201cWe have so much to do tonight. And tomorrow. And next week. And next month.\u201d</p><p>He saw a man coming toward them, and while he seemed normal enough, something about him made Matthias thrust Jessa behind him. \u201cShe is not for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d The man shuffled forward and then straightened as he studied Matthias. \u201cYou\u2019re the man she hired to cut me.\u201d</p><p>He peered at Lawson\u2019s face. \u201cShe did not hire me. I came to her aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what she had you do. She told you to cripple me.\u201d The thing cocked its head. \u201cDo you know they were going to put me down? Kill me, just because I\u2019d been injured on the job. That wasn\u2019t covered in the employee benefits package. I never saw a single paragraph on reasons employees will be terminated permanently.\u201d</p> <p>Matthias knew then that Lawson was crazy. His training also told him he was no match for him, not unarmed and trying to protect his woman.</p><p>\u201cStay close to me,\u201d he said to Jessa before he looked up to the sky and drew on the power inside him.</p><p>Lightning flashed, illuminating for a few seconds the face of the thing. Matthias recognized the features as Lawson\u2019s, but when he looked into its solid black eyes, all he saw were the depths of hell.</p><p>The clouds swelled full and ugly, and tiny drops of water and larger pellets of ice began to fall all around them. Lawson skewed his head to one side and yowled as a chunk of hail bounced off his head. Nothing touched Matthias or Jessa.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it hitting you?\u201d Lawson demanded, covering his head with his hands.</p><p>\u201cThe rain belongs to me. So does the woman.\u201d Matthias lifted his eyes once more and sent out his power. An instant later a torrential flood of water came crashing down around them.</p><p>Matthias seized Jessa\u2019s hand and pulled her with him as he ran from the thing in the alley and into the blinding rain. Only his sense of the ground beneath his feet led him back to the stairwell to the upper street level. He could feel the thing coming up fast behind them, and stopped only long enough to scoop Jessa into his arms before he mounted the stairs.</p><p>She slung an arm around his neck and curled her other hand into his sleeve before she looked back over his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s coming up the stairs.\u201d</p> <p>Matthias thought quickly, and when he reached the top of the stairs he abruptly changed direction, across the narrow street and into the long park. He headed for the small, roped-off area where the city was repairing damage done to one of the old statues in front of the Cotton Exchange.</p><p>The old lion statue, which had been struck by a driver who had lost control of her car, had been demolished in the accident, leaving behind only a paw. Debate had raged back and forth for some time, but eventually the people of the various historical societies had agreed to replace the lion with a more modern work of art that embraced both the history of Savannah as well as its future.</p><p>Matthias had seen the replacement installed over a series of months. The ten-foot-high sculpture, made entirely of old wrought iron recovered from the factory down by the river, formed an enormous, open sphere. The long rods of iron had been stretched out into elongated strips and twisted into shapes representing the different continents of the world. On the shape representing America, the artist had welded a brass replica of a magnolia bloom.</p><p>The vanity of the past, the artist claimed, had been shaped by his hammers into a vision of Savannah as part of the global community of cities leading the way into the future.</p><p>Matthias was simply glad the sculptor had weakened the wrought-iron rods by stretching them, and had made the interior large enough for two people to stand inside. He stopped beside it and put Jessa down on her feet. Gripping two of the rods, he strained, pulling them apart.</p><p>Once he had made a space large enough for both of them to pass through, he turned to her. \u201cGet inside.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s too strong. It won\u2019t protect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d He looked into her eyes. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a moment longer, and then squeezed through the gap to step inside the sculpture. Matthias followed, turning to press the bars back in place. By the time he moved Jessa to the very center of the sphere, Lawson had reached them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die again,\u201d she whispered, staring at the madman on the other side of the bars. \u201cBut you heard him. He isn\u2019t planning to kill me right away.\u201d She brought his hand up to her neck. \u201cIf it looks like he\u2019s going to take me ... can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I must, I will.\u201d He watched Lawson as the other man circled around the sculpture. \u201cOnly wait, Jessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is very helpful of you.\u201d Lawson bared his fangs as Matthias wrapped his arms around her. \u201cLike monkeys in a barrel. Or was it turkeys, or fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Genaro where we are?\u201d Matthias asked him.</p><p>\u201cI tell Jonah all sorts of things,\u201d the madman said. \u201cHer name, for example\u2014it\u2019s Minerva, not Jessa. Did you know that? Funny that she\u2019s named after a Roman goddess. When I made the final transition, I became a god myself.\u201d He stopped and peered in at them. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way you male mortals taste. Come out of there, give her to me, and I\u2019ll let you run away again. Maybe I\u2019ll be so busy with her I even won\u2019t bother to look for you right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have to kill me,\u201d Matthias told him. \u201cto take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d Lawson wrapped his huge fists around the iron bars and began to pull.</p><p>\u201cMatthias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he said softly, and waited until she did. He held her close as he did the same and lifted his face.</p><p>He sent every ounce of his power flying up into the sky directly above them, making himself the conduit and the storm the vessel. The air crackled and all the hair on his body and Jessa\u2019s rose up, drawn along with the power. A low, deep sound reverberated overhead as the storm gathered in on itself, and small white lines sizzled through the dark mass.</p><p>Power filled the sphere as a thick bolt of lightning struck the sculpture, electrifying it. Matthias looked as Bradford Lawson screamed, and millions of volts of power streamed from the iron through his hands and into his body.</p><p>Jessa kept her eyes closed, at one point burying her face against Matthias\u2019s chest, but he watched Lawson as the primeval power rammed through Lawson\u2019s limbs and arched between him and the sculpture. The jittery shaking of Lawson\u2019s body made it seem as if he were performing some grotesque sort of dance. The bolt lasted another three seconds before it vanished, and Lawson fell against the smoldering iron bars, his face a blackened, smoking ruin.</p><p>Matthias released Jessa only long enough to pry apart the bars again, and put his arm around her shoulders as he eased her out. As the pounding rain tapered to a softer shower, he glanced back at the dead man clinging to the sculpture.</p><p>\u201cThis is your ability,\u201d she said, the rain streaming down her face like a thousand tears. \u201cYou created the storm. You controlled the lightning. The same way you did the day we met, at the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bring the rain.\u201d He smoothed the drenched hair back away from her face. \u201cLightning is drawn to me wherever I am in the storm. If I think very hard, I can summon it.\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder, stared at Lawson\u2019s body, and then turned back to him. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave him here like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe authorities will find him in the morning and take him away. Whatever was done to him will be discovered. Then GenHance will come for him.\u201d He put his hand to her cheek. \u201cWe cannot know how much he told them. We must leave the city before they arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere can we go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRowan and Drew are coming back from Atlanta. I will contact them and have them meet us at a safe place in the country. Then we will decide together where we will go.\u201d He stroked his thumb beneath her eye, catching the tear that spilled from it to mingle with the rain on her face. \u201cThere is no more time for me to chase you or talk to you. You have seen for yourself what GenHance can do. We must fight this battle together, or what was done to Lawson will be only the first of countless horrors.\u201d He put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cWill you give your trust now? Will you stay with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa closed her eyes on the last of her tears before she put her hand over his. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Rowan violated every speed limit on the highway, but she rolled into Atlanta just after dawn. Since she\u2019d arrived too early to hit a Starbucks, she stopped at a combination gas station and food mart to top off her tank and grab something to eat.</p><p>The muddy-looking carafe of coffee at the hot-beverage station made her wrinkle her nose, but they had bottled springwater and bags of powdered sugar-covered mini-doughnuts, one of her guilty pleasures. She sat on the curb outside the store and dialed home to let Matthias know she\u2019d made it, but he didn\u2019t pick up the line.</p> <p>\u201cHow much you want to bet that he and Queenie are sharing a shower this morning?\u201d she asked one of the doughnuts before she popped it into her mouth.</p><p>Polishing off the rest of the bag took her less than two minutes, and she washed them down with half the bottle of water before splashing her hands with the remainder. Once she\u2019d wiped her fingers dry with her bandanna, she took out the photo of Drew Riordan and studied it.</p><p>He had pale skin like Queenie, but the glorious blaze of his spiky red hair washed out everything else in the shot. He had very dark eyes, but they didn\u2019t look black or brown. Navy blue or hunter green, she decided. He wasn\u2019t smiling, but the faint bracketed lines on either side of his very decent mouth made it obvious he did, and often. The hump from a broken nose\u2014probably from a schoolyard brawl with some kid who\u2019d called him Bozo\u2014didn\u2019t spoil his face. Neither did the beard he wore trimmed close to the square angles of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cIrish,\u201d she murmured. With a name like Riordan, that was a given, although he\u2019d been adopted out like the rest of them. \u201cYour parents probably picked you because you had the right color hair.\u201d</p><p>She tucked away the photo and stood, brushing the light dusting of crumbs and powdered sugar from the front of her jacket. On impulse she tried dialing Matthias\u2019s mobile number, but that went almost immediately to voice mail.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Ro,\u201d she said after the tone. \u201cIt\u2019s morning, and I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll call in later when I hook up with Drew. And I\u2019m worried, so answer one of the phones next time, okay?\u201d</p><p>She pocketed her phone and blew out a frustrated breath. Queenie might be a champion conniver, but she wouldn\u2019t do anything to Matt. For one thing, she couldn\u2019t\u2014the boss had serious muscle and skill, and he could take her down with one hand tied behind his back. She also didn\u2019t think Queenie would try to screw with him, at least not physically. She watched him the same way he watched her, and while her expression never gave away anything, the eyes said it all.</p><p>\u201cFace it: They\u2019re about to become a couple, and you have to deal with it,\u201d she said to herself as she walked to her bike. \u201cShe\u2019s classy, and he deserves her. But she\u2019ll never feed him as well as you have.\u201d</p><p>Nor would she ever deserve him. None of them did.</p><p>She nodded to an older man at the next pump who was filling up his Lexus, and had just straddled her bike when her phone rang.</p><p>She answered it without checking the display. \u201cAbout time, boss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not your boss,\u201d a soft, feminine voice said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even my phone. It belongs to my boyfriend, Andy.\u201d</p><p>Rowan checked the display, which showed Drew\u2019s mobile number. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Andy\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to bother you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut his family has been calling here all night trying to reach him. There\u2019s some kind of emergency back at home, and they need to speak to him right away, but this is the only phone he carried with him, and honestly, I have no idea where he is today. I thought I\u2019d try some of his friends and see if they could get a message to him for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood try, bitch,\u201d Rowan said, checking her watch. It would take the people monitoring the call another two minutes to track her signal.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d the girl said faintly.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you people are supposed to be better than this,\u201d she taunted. \u201cThat\u2019s not the only phone he has. He has no family and, oops, his name isn\u2019t even Andy.\u201d</p><p>The sweet tone became crisp. \u201cMr. Riordan is in a great deal of legal trouble. We know he\u2019s responsible for destroying company property as well as flagrantly violating the confidentiality clause in his employment contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlagrantly.\u201d Rowan was sorry to see she had only forty seconds left; she was really beginning to enjoy herself. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful word. They send you to corporate pretty-speak school or something, babe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe assume Mr. Riordan is your friend,\u201d the woman continued, her tone tight and unfriendly now. \u201cIf he wants to avoid a lengthy prison term, he must return to GenHance at once. Perhaps you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rowan made a dinging sound. \u201cWhoops, time\u2019s up. Give Jonah this message: Andy says he can go fuck himself.\u201d With five seconds to spare Rowan switched off her phone, pulled off the back, and popped out the battery, heaving it into the road. The phone she wiped clean before dropping it into the courtesy container of window cleaner beside the pump.</p><p>The old man at the Lexus gave her a cautious look. \u201cEverything okay there, miss?\u201d</p><p>Rowan bared her teeth. \u201cJust found out my boyfriend\u2019s cheating on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s an idiot, honey.\u201d He gave her an admiring look, and for a moment she could see the handsome young man he had been. \u201cI\u2019d dump him. I\u2019d make him pay for the phone, too.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a genuine smile this time. \u201cOh, yes, sir. He\u2019s going to pay. He surely is.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Genaro listened to the recording of the girl\u2019s voice for a third time, switching it off just before she uttered her obscene message meant for him.</p><p>\u201cShe must have destroyed the phone immediately after she ended the call, sir,\u201d Delaporte said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way she could have terminated the signal before we located her. We know she was somewhere downtown, so she\u2019s in the city.\u201d</p><p>He suspected Riordan wasn\u2019t working alone, but the girl\u2019s speedy arrival meant that his cohorts were well organized. \u201cWhat were you able to glean from the background noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beeps are from a gas pump being used,\u201d Bill, the technician who had assumed Riordan\u2019s position, said. \u201cThere\u2019re also two repeating tones from an audible walk signal used exclusively in the business district. The station was on a corner at an intersection with a pedestrian crossing, and there are only two of those in that area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObtain the security videos from both stations, and interview the clerks,\u201d he told Delaporte. \u201cI want to know what she looks like and what she\u2019s driving.\u201d He turned to Bill. \u201cWhat other numbers were you able to salvage from Riordan\u2019s SIM card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that one, sir. The rest of the data was too badly corrupted by the virus he triggered.\u201d He shuffled his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cSir, I know it\u2019s not my place, but I can\u2019t believe Andy had anything to do with this. Maybe someone blackmailed him, or ...\u201d He saw Genaro\u2019s expression and paled. \u201cRight. Well, I think I\u2019ll get back and try to run the SIM card again.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte watched the younger man flee from the office. \u201cI recommend we put someone else in Riordan\u2019s position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll do for now.\u201d Genaro saw his private-line light flash and picked up the phone. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He listened as one of the police captains, a man with a predilection for very young girls, related two reports that had come in from the authorities in the eastern section of the state. \u201cFax all of the witness statements to us at once, and keep me updated.\u201d He hung up the receiver. \u201cLawson was seen in Savannah last night. He confronted Jessa Bellamy and the man who took her from the restaurant, and shortly after was struck by lightning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLightning?\u201d Delaporte\u2019s brows rose. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was for several hours,\u201d Genaro said, and templed his fingers. \u201cLawson revived this morning and killed three people working in the county morgue. Shortly thereafter he was seen down at the docks, where he hijacked a truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat interests me is the man with Bellamy. There was a lightning storm the day Lawson tried to retrieve her at the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s one of them, and he has control over weather ...\u201d His security chief sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never encountered one with that kind of ability, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be a progenitor.\u201d Genaro stood. \u201cWe will need to contain Lawson now. Tell your men to use whatever force is necessary, but get him out of the truck first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be simpler to shoot him while he\u2019s driving, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truck is a tanker used to fuel ships,\u201d he told him. \u201cIt\u2019s filled with enough high-grade marine fuel to take out a city block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him out of the truck first, sir,\u201d Delaporte promised.</p><p>Genaro went to the lab, where Kirchner was working with one of the engineers on the new containment unit. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing Lawson in today,\u201d he told him after sending the engineer out of the cell. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to be ready to process him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will, sir.\u201d The doctor picked up a chart and took out his pen to make some notes. \u201cI\u2019d like to do a full workup on him if there\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe survived a lightning strike,\u201d Genaro told him.</p><p>Kirchner stopped writing and glanced up. \u201cA direct hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so. He was pronounced dead and transported to the morgue, where he revived a few hours later. I\u2019ll send over the reports as soon as they arrive. You\u2019ll need to investigate this further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, the transerum does have its limitations,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cThe resurrection factor is directly related to pathogen stimulation. The death of the host effectively ends the dormant stage. We\u2019ve never known a host to survive a second death experience.\u201d His cold eyes grew dreamy. \u201cUnless a new mutation has occurred that revives the host indefinitely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am not in the business of selling eternity, Doctor,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cThere\u2019s no profit in immortality. Whatever is responsible for Lawson\u2019s third rebirth, I want it identified and eradicated from the transerum. You will report on this only to me; is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Kirchner looked as if he wanted to argue with him, but in the end he nodded and went back to his work.</p><p>Genaro stopped by the isolation room, where the acquisition lay in a chemically induced coma. He came several times during the week to inspect the condition of the body, which was being kept in peak condition by the physical therapists on staff. That and the complex network of equipment surrounding the bed would keep the body alive and healthy indefinitely.</p> <p>He\u2019d ordered Kirchner to remove the bandages from the lower half of the battered face, and the bruises and cuts around the nose and mouth were slowly healing. Extensive cosmetic work still had to be performed, but that could wait until they were prepared to bring the body back to consciousness.</p><p>Because the acquisition had no mind, it wasn\u2019t a person anymore, and was referred to only in terms used for laboratory specimens. It allowed his people to work without unnecessary sentiment or attachment, but the day would soon come when the body would again become a person, and would need a new name.</p><p>It was like being God, Genaro thought, and creating the first man.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d he said to the body. \u201cThat is what we\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the room, unaware that under the bandages, the eyes of the body moved beneath their lids, as if watching something no one else could see.</p> <p>The place in the country Matthias drove to was a bed-and-breakfast located in a farming district near the border of Tennessee. He didn\u2019t stop along the way, but she was glad he didn\u2019t. Watching Savannah disappear in the rearview mirror was like waking up from a sad dream. They didn\u2019t talk during the drive, either, but after the encounter with Lawson and the revelation of Matthias\u2019s ability, Jessa felt almost numb. Discussing anything would have been beyond her, and he must have sensed that.</p><p>Matthias came around the car to help her out, and kept an arm around her waist as he walked with her to meet the older couple who had emerged from the inn.</p><p>\u201cJessa, these are my friends, Sarah and Paul Clark.\u201d He turned to the couple. \u201cI am sorry we woke you so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, Gaven,\u201d the woman said, reaching for him with open arms. She had black hair streaked with silver and features that reminded Jessa of her favorite language teacher in school. Her smile turned wry as she turned to Jessa. \u201cWelcome to Clarks\u2019 Bed-and-Breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d Jessa kept her hands in her pockets.</p><p>The tall, stoop-shouldered man nodded to Jessa. His expression was more reserved, but he had kind eyes and shook hands with Matthias with enthusiasm. \u201cGood to see you, Matt.\u201d He looked past them. \u201cNo one on the road for twenty miles.\u201d</p> <p>Jessa looked back. She could see almost a mile down the road, but then the asphalt disappeared over a sloping hill.</p><p>\u201cMy husband was an eagle in his past life,\u201d Sarah joked.</p><p>Jessa glanced at Matthias. \u201cThey\u2019re like us.\u201d He nodded, and she eyed Sarah\u2019s hair a second time. The couple appeared too old to be Kyndred, and yet their voices sounded very young.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very intuitive, Gaven,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI guess this isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d The air around her seemed to split in half, sweeping away the image of the older couple, leaving two strangers in its place: a plain-faced, skinny woman with strawberry blond hair, and a dark-skinned, wide-bodied man with a shaved skull and eyes that were the color of ripe cantaloupe. For a moment she thought he was blind, until she saw the pinpoints of his pupils, which were tightly constricted. Both appeared to be in their late twenties.</p><p>\u201cMy wife likes to play dress-up.\u201d Paul\u2019s oddly colored eyes shifted as he studied Jessa\u2019s face. \u201cSarah is also very tactile, so you should tell her.\u201d</p><p>She drew back a little. \u201cYou can see what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see the tension in your facial muscles increase whenever ability is mentioned.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve also discreetly avoided touching us.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never admitted her ability to anyone but the Takyn. For a moment she struggled with the words. \u201cWhen I touch someone, I have a vision and see the things they\u2019ve done that were wrong, or made them feel guilty. Whether they want me to or not. Exactly when, where, and how it happened.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than look repelled, Paul smiled. \u201cI\u2019d better tell you the story about that car I boosted when I was sixteen, and the time Sarah dressed up as Cindy Crawford for our anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Jessa.\u201d Sarah chuckled at her expression. \u201cWe don\u2019t keep secrets from each other, and now that you\u2019re here, we can\u2019t. Come inside now so I can feed you two.\u201d</p><p>Inside the large, well-equipped kitchen Sarah expertly prepared a hot breakfast of pecan-studded pancakes, sliced peaches, and fragrant chamomile tea. She happily accepted Jessa\u2019s offer to set the table while Matthias told Paul about Drew Riordan being exposed, Rowan\u2019s trip to Atlanta, and the terrifying encounter with Lawson.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to go to the farm, Matt,\u201d Jessa heard Paul say. \u201cSarah and I will drive you all out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the farm?\u201d she asked Sarah.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place Gaven owns in central Tennessee. He spends time there every spring and summer, grows organic produce, and gets away from all that.\u201d She made a vague gesture toward the north. \u201cWhen Paul and I met him, we\u2019d just lost everything\u2014GenHance seized our costume business, called in the note on our house, cleaned out our accounts, and had us both charged with income tax evasion. If Paul hadn\u2019t seen them coming, they probably would have gotten us, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthias didn\u2019t tell you? He owns this place.\u201d Her eyes twinkled. \u201cHe has about two hundred different properties all over the country. He asked us if we\u2019d like to run an inn, and since Paul and I like people, and we\u2019ve always dreamed of having a little country house, it seemed perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the first one he\u2019s brought here,\u201d Jessa guessed.</p><p>\u201cHe brings us others from time to time. The ones who are almost ready to relocate and take up new identities. It gives them a little break before they have to become someone else.\u201d Sarah handed her a platter with three tall stacks of pancakes. \u201cServe yourself first, or the guys won\u2019t leave you a crumb.\u201d</p><p>Over pancakes Sarah told them some funny stories about some of their guests. Jessa winced as she heard about the newlyweds who had gone for a nature walk, succumbed to a moment of passion, and ended up with a case of poison ivy in the worst possible places. Paul contributed his tale of the New York executive who had been grimly determined to ride one of their horses and have photos taken to show his friends back in the city, at least until he slid off the back of the horse and sprained his tailbone.</p><p>Matthias excused himself from the table so that he could use the Clarks\u2019 phone to contact Rowan, leaving Jessa alone with the couple.</p><p>Jessa wanted to ask Sarah more details about her life and her ability, but didn\u2019t quite know how. She\u2019d spent so many years hiding her own that she had no idea how to even initiate such a conversation.</p><p>Once more Paul saw her anxiety. \u201cI think Jessa would like to hear about something other than our fun with the guests.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a grateful look. \u201cOther than Matthias and Rowan, I\u2019ve never met others like me in person. I have so many questions. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Paul told her. \u201cAsk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you two meet each other?\u201d</p><p>Sarah grimaced. \u201cIt was pretty typical of how people like us usually hook up. Paul and I met through a social group for single adults searching for their biological parents. We hit it off, compared notes, and found out we had a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah and I were probably born in Chicago,\u201d Paul put in. \u201cThat\u2019s where we were both adopted as infants. Most of the records were lost, but we know the Catholic Church was involved in placing us. We also made sure we weren\u2019t related before we got romantically involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank heavens for mail-away DNA tests,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cWe both went to good families and had normal childhoods, at least until I was hit by a car when I was twelve, and Sarah contracted meningitis when she was sixteen. We both should have died, but instead we came back, better than new.\u201d He gestured toward his face. \u201cMy eyes used to be brown. The doctors thought the brain hemorrhaging caused the change in the color of my irises.\u201d He glanced at his wife. \u201cSarah did better. She kept her ability a secret from everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard,\u201d she said, and the air wavered around her as her image blurred and changed into that of a wide-eyed, stocky man in a white lab coat. \u201cThis doctor was the only one who ever caught me dressing up,\u201d he said in Sarah\u2019s voice, \u201cand he quit drinking the same day.\u201d The air parted, restoring her to her normal appearance.</p><p>Jessa had watched the transformation more closely this time. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually change shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could. I\u2019d definitely do something about this mug of mine.\u201d She patted her angular cheek. \u201cWhat we think I do is alter the light around me so what you see is how I want to appear to you. I can also cast an illusion that changes the appearance of anyone within five feet of me, which is how I can do this.\u201d The air around the table wavered, and suddenly Jessa saw two Sarahs sitting at the table. She laughed as she looked down at herself and saw that she had been changed into a Sarah clone as well.</p><p>\u201cThat is amazing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a brain trick,\u201d Sarah said, dispelling the illusion. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fool Paul, because he can see the shifts in light intensity whenever I dress up. I need the light, too; I can\u2019t use my ability in complete darkness. Also, my body stays the same. So while you may see Paris Hilton\u201d\u2014she changed into an exact twin of the famous socialite\u2014\u201cwhat you get is still plain old Sarah Clark.\u201d She dropped the illusion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa\u2019s head started to whirl from watching all the rapid changes. \u201cUsing your ability doesn\u2019t make you tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the opposite.

Fortunately I\u2019ve learned how to control the dilation of my pupils. I look with my ability only when I really need to see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you see through things? Is that how you could tell no one was on the road this morning?\u201d Jessa asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, my vision functions on line of sight, just like everyone else\u2019s.\u201d He pointed up. \u201cBut I can detect thermal disruption in the air from engine exhaust, body temperature, or any heat-producing source up to fifty miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou both seem so normal,\u201d Jessa said before she thought. \u201cWhat I mean is, you seem to have accepted this so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had some problems when I was younger,\u201d Sarah said, her smile fading a little. \u201cEvery girl wants to be prettier, and God knows I\u2019m not a beauty. I used an illusion to get the cutest guy on campus. I almost married him, until I decided a week before the wedding to have him meet the real Sarah to see if he really loved me or the illusion. He freaked out and accused me of giving him drugs. Then he spit in my face and left me.\u201d She met Jessa\u2019s gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done, in case you\u2019re worried about bumping into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the best, too.\u201d Paul reached over and took her hand in his. \u201cYou could have kept up the illusion for the rest of your lives. He would have never known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything happens for a reason.\u201d She smiled at her husband. \u201cYou\u2019d think a guy with eagle eyes would take one look at me and run the other way, but this one didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw what was really beautiful.\u201d He lifted her hand and kissed the back of it. \u201cFirst time you smiled at me, baby.\u201d</p><p>Matthias rejoined them. When Jessa asked after Rowan, he said he had been unable to reach her, but left a message on her voice mail telling her about their new location.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting anyone to come in for a week,\u201d Sarah told Matthias as the men cleared the table. \u201cPaul and I are going to make a run to town for supplies and maybe see a movie, so you\u2019ll have the place to yourselves most of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a movie?\u201d Jessa heard Paul murmur to his wife as she joined him at the sink.</p><p>\u201cOf course we are. That double feature sounds good.\u201d She nudged him with her elbow, and in a lower, scolding tone added, \u201cSome people need some alone time.\u201d</p> <p>Paul smiled at her. \u201cWill you make out with me in the back row?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, smart guy, and I\u2019ll go as your grandmother,\u201d Sarah warned.</p><p>The couple showed them to two adjoining rooms, and after setting out fresh linens and clean clothes, and telling them what they could find in the kitchen for lunch and dinner, the Clarks left for town in their old pickup.</p><p>Jessa retreated to the bathroom, where she showered and tried not to imagine Matthias doing the same in his. She should have been ready to drop, but now that they were alone she felt as if she\u2019d arrived at some new and slightly terrifying place. The feeling didn\u2019t go away when she wrapped herself in a big towel, came out into her bedroom, and looked at the adjoining door to his. It was locked on her side, so the choice was hers.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d told her it would be.</p><p>He\u2019d saved her life twice now. He\u2019d protected her, first from GenHance and then from the monster that Bradford Lawson had become. He had brought her here, and wherever they were going next, she knew she\u2019d be safe with him.</p><p>Gratitude didn\u2019t make her release the dead bolt.</p><p>She\u2019d loved Tag. He\u2019d made everything fun, even the first time they\u2019d made love, when he\u2019d joked about letting her kick him in the groin afterward to make things even. A few years after losing him, she\u2019d tried with other men, the ones she could bear to touch. She\u2019d even considered taking Caleb as a lover until she\u2019d discovered his guilty crush on Angela. Jessa knew what it was to wish, and to want, and to have, but she\u2019d never known it with the intensity that Matthias brought out in her.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t lust or loneliness that made her open the door. He\u2019d come to her in her dreams, where she had fallen in love with him, and now she was awake, and she wanted him.</p><p>Jessa wasn\u2019t surprised to see him standing just on the other side, wearing a towel around his hips.</p><p>\u201cYou should sleep.\u201d His eyes never left her face.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t dried off but dripped with water, as if he\u2019d felt her there and walked out of the shower to meet her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou have not truly looked inside me. There is more to me than what you have seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d She stepped over the threshold. \u201cYou\u2019re a stranger, and a friend, and a protector. You\u2019ve come to me in the night, in my dreams. Matthias, you\u2019re the man I\u2019m going to love for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to speak. His chest expanded as he inhaled, held the breath, and slowly released it. Then he knelt on one knee before her, and pressed his face into her abdomen, and wrapped his arms around her legs. She looked down at the sunlight gilding the wet, gleaming strands of his hair and put her hand to the back of his head, stroking it as the wonder of the moment shimmered over her.</p><p>No shadowlight. Only sunlight. Only love.</p><p>When he rose he lifted her, shifting his arms so that he supported her shoulders, and held her as he crossed the room. Placing her gently on the edge of the bed, he knelt again, smoothing his hands down her arms before he tugged free the fold that held the big towel around her.</p><p>Jessa kept her hands at her sides and hoped he liked what he saw.</p><p>He unwrapped her like a gift, lifting her a little to pull the towel free before he dropped it to the floor. A big hand splayed over her spine, and as he came up he eased her back, bracing himself over her on his elbows.</p><p>Jessa reached between them to pull away the last thing keeping their skin apart, and brushed the shaft of his stiff, thick penis with her knuckles as she pushed the towel over his buttocks until it slipped away. Matthias\u2019s tense body shook as he bent his head, tasting her mouth with his.</p><p>The kiss was slow and soft and made lights dance inside her head.</p><p>She felt his hand stroke down the side of her body before he caught the back of her thigh and brought it up to cradle his hip. She did the same with the other, and forgot to breathe as she felt him nestling against her, the hot, straining knob of his cock pressing into the wet silk of her folds. She could feel her labia flowering open to him, caressing and enveloping him, and in reflex she tightened, holding him there a moment longer so she could savor, so she could remember.</p><p>Jessa didn\u2019t realize her eyes were closed until he kissed one lid and then the other. She looked up at him, saw herself in his eyes, and lifted her face so she could give him her mouth as he gathered her up with his arm. She opened for his tongue, soothing the hard thrust of it with sweet strokes of her own, and then he drove inside her, wide and hard, deep and unstoppable.</p><p>That first, astonishing stroke seemed endless; he kept pressing in, taking and filling until some primal sound rose from her throat and he touched the heart of her sex. Celibacy had kept her almost as narrow and tight as she had been the first time, and the tender, vulnerable flesh inside her body contracted around him, trying to accommodate the ruthless penetration as well as hold him in place. The stretching, burning sensations within brought on a rush of simple, feminine fear. Could he feel how tightly they fit? Would he know how easily he could hurt her?</p><p>\u201cYou are as tender as a maiden.\u201d He rolled onto his side, bringing her over onto hers and relieving some of the internal pressure. \u201cPut your hands on my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>Jessa slid her hands up and looked down as he put his hands over her breasts. The dark gold of his skin against the whiteness of hers made her arch against his palms, but when he worked his fingers over her, rubbing and squeezing and fondling with the same strange technique he had used on her feet, something unraveled inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou have very fine breasts,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt will give me pleasure to watch our son suckle them.\u201d</p><p>Strangely that thought aroused her as much as his touch. \u201cI\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved. \u201cI will fuck you and give you my seed until you are.\u201d</p><p>That outrageous statement dumbfounded Jessa. It also filled her with wild delight.</p><p>He moved his thumbs against the tight beads of her nipples, abrading them lightly before he lowered his head and took the left peak into his mouth. He dampened it with his tongue before he sucked, tugging with a firm rhythm that made her forget about the slight discomfort between her thighs and the slight motion of his shaft inside her.</p><p>The movement of his cock into the ellipse of her sex made the sound of a gentle kiss, and then a passionate one.</p><p>He eased his mouth away and draped her thigh over his hip, holding it there as he braced her. His other hand he wedged between them, pressing the tip of his middle finger into the split at the top of her mound. He quickly found the small ridge of her hood and pressed again, this time to expose her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She jerked as he massaged her there, and drove herself down on his penis, working it deeper into her drenched sex.</p><p>\u201cDo you hurt anymore?\u201d he asked her, his jaw set.</p><p>Trembling on the brink of an orgasm, she shook her head and clutched at him. \u201cGaven, please.\u201d</p><p>He rolled her onto her back, rocked his hips to spread her thighs wider, and stroked in deep. This time her sex accepted every hard inch he gave her, and pulled at him, eager and needy. He kept his thrusts slow but deep, the bed shaking under them from the heavy, powerful pistoning of his body into hers. He reached between them again to finger her clit, and that shoved her over the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If pleasure were an abyss, it didn\u2019t have a bottom. Not with Matthias. Jessa tumbled through the dark heat and dancing light, lost to herself, found again in his arms.</p><p>Matthias kept at her, fucking her through the climax as she rode it out, and then through the tremors to the building of the next. She writhed, trying to free her hands so she could touch him, but he had her wrists pinned and held her there, at the mercy of his relentless cock. Jessa wrapped her legs around his hips and thrust back at him, rubbing as much of her body against him as she could.</p><p>The second time she came, she tightened around him, forcing him to feel every ripple, and, before he could resist, taking him with her into that beautiful darkness.</p> <p>Into the shadowlight.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Matthias knew the greatest pleasure of his life in Jessa\u2019s arms. Her body accepted his, although at first it took some coaxing, and permitted him to worship her with all the passion he felt. As soon as he spilled his seed into her, he felt the glow of life beginning. This day, this very first time together, he had given her his son.</p><p>He opened his eyes to look upon her face, and instead saw the wilderness around him. Immense old trees, their bare, blackened limbs made glassy with ice, stood as sentries and witnesses to what a few months ago had been a field of grain. Snow drifted down, gently shrouding dozens of bodies where they had fallen. Barbarians cut to pieces by blows from expert hands wielding the finest blades in the world. Romans impaled on sharpened stakes and pierced by hundreds of hastily made arrows.</p><p>Matthias didn\u2019t have to count the dead. He knew the name of every Roman whose body littered the ancient battlefield. But he could not be here. The gods would not be so cruel as to tear him from his lover\u2019s arms and send him to this place. He did not believe his eyes, not until he saw the lone, hunched figure of one of the fallen rise, stumbling over the bodies as he went from man to man, reaching for the throat of every Roman.</p> <p>Looking for life in the kingdom of the dead.</p><p>Tanicus peered at him from across the field, but Matthias knew he didn\u2019t see him. Still he tried to call out to him, to warn him before the arrows began to fly out of the forest. But Tanicus kept moving, performing his grim task, his breath leaving white clouds in the still air, the blood from his side wound streaming down to paint his legs with thin red streaks.</p><p>Once more Matthias stood frozen in time, unable to move or do more than watch as the arrows came and struck the Roman. Then came the barbarians from the trees, slinking out of their hiding places, and one who stood taller and strode with a different pace.</p><p>The courier from Judea, the one who had been a centurion, now dressed in the furs and wools of Rome\u2019s enemy.</p><p>The courier went to Tanicus, who had been driven to his knees. He lifted his fur-wrapped sandal and kicked the Roman over.</p><p>\u201cYou should have remained in camp, Prefect.\u201d He gestured, and his creatures surrounded the Roman, stripping him of his cuirass and braces while the courier drew his sword. \u201cHave no fear. I will give you a proper burning, and send you with your men to Elysium.\u201d</p> <p>Matthias roared in silent rage as the traitor braced his foot against the strong neck of the fallen Roman and drove his sword into Tanicus\u2019s chest. Then he saw what the dying soldier could not: a border patrol charging toward the battlefield from the south. The traitor looked up, his face twisting with fear, and tried to pull his sword from the Roman\u2019s body.</p><p>With the last of his strength, Tanicus reached up, grasping the blade with both hands, holding it in place.</p><p>Out of time, the traitor barked orders to his men, and they fled back into the trees. Only when they had gone did Tanicus release the blade, his gashed hands falling on either side of his body, the bloody palms open to the sun.</p><p>Matthias tried to close his eyes, but something would not permit it. The patrol went into the woods after the barbarians, and the field became still and lifeless again. The sun raced across the sky, following them as twilight settled over the battlefield. Then two hands twitched, curled, and reached up to grasp the traitor\u2019s blade a second time.</p><p>Tanicus wrenched the sword out of his chest, using it as a brace to push himself up. He tore at his under tunic, and watched with wide eyes as the wound in the center of his chest stopped bleeding and began to seal itself. Still holding the blade, the Roman staggered to his feet.</p><p>Tanicus knelt by the body of one large Roman, rested his hand on the man\u2019s chest, and murmured a prayer, and then carefully removed the cloak tangled under his body. He did the same to other men, wrapping himself in their cloaks before he used a saddle blanket that had fallen to the ground to wrap up the sword. He had to take it with him, for it was the only real proof he had that the courier from Judea was betraying his people to their enemy.</p><p>Tanicus turned around and changed direction, trudging toward the trail leading up into the mountains. Matthias knew, as the Roman did, that the border patrol\u2019s camp lay on the other side of the ridge, and the high pass through the mountains was the quickest route to it.</p><p>Snow began to fall as Tanicus walked up the trail. He pulled the cloaks tighter around himself and covered his head, but the storm came fast, as they often did in the high places. Soon the Roman was battling his way through roaring wind and pelting ice, his head down, his arm clamped around the bundle that held the sword.</p> <p>He never heard the snow above him break loose, and stopped only as the first edge of it engulfed his legs. The massive drift knocked him off his feet and pushed him into the boulders on the opposite side of the pass, where he disappeared under tons of ice and rock.</p><p>Time passed. The pass remained buried in snow, which never completely melted away. Romans marched through the pass, and then barbarians came from the other direction, leading their army. The sky brightened and darkened, the light coming and going faster and faster. Blurs of bodies moved through the pass. Sometimes Matthias could catch glimpses of them and their strange dress, while the snow sloping on both sides of the pass gradually grew steeper.</p><p>The second avalanche came, pouring through the pass and scouring it clean. On a slope beyond, a group of young people huddled to one side, watching with fearful eyes as the tumbling ice streamed past them, leaving behind the still form of a man. The snow took with it the remnants of ancient woolen clothing, which had long ago rotted away from his body.</p><p>They babbled in their strange tongues as they hurried over to the man and pulled him from the snow. He opened his eyes and looked upon the faces of these children, whose speech he could not understand, and whose clothing and gear were unlike anything he had ever known. One of the young men offered him a hand and an encouraging smile.</p><p>Tanicus, the Roman who had been betrayed, who died twice, first at the hand of the traitor, and then on the whim of the gods, lifted his arm and took his hand.</p><p>You were the Roman buried in the snow.</p><p>Matthias looked at the woman standing beside him, watching the rescue. It was Jessa, and it was she, not the gods, who had brought him here.</p><p>Yes. I am Gaius Maelius Tanicus.</p><p>Jessa came out of the shadowlight into the sunlight, her body wrapped around Matthias\u2019s. She didn\u2019t know how she had taken him with her into the vision of what had been, but he had been there with her and watched everything that had happened to him in the distant past. Fate had brought the man she loved to her through time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And she was, for putting him through that. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to take you there with me.\u201d</p><p>He was watching her, his eyes dark with the shadows of that past. \u201cI wish that I had told you first. I knew you would not believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things have to be seen to be believed.\u201d She stroked his face with wondering fingertips. \u201cYou were buried for so long. It must have terrified you to wake up in our world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought at first I was in some other place. Elysium, perhaps.\u201d He smiled a little. \u201cThe children who found me were so young and kind. But they had so many strange things, and their language\u2014I could not fathom more than a few words. From there they took me down to the village and I saw the land beyond the strange dwellings and roads. Land does not change so much over time. I knew when I saw the ridge behind me that I stood where the border patrol\u2019s camp had once been. But it was gone. Everything I knew had vanished.\u201d</p><p>Matthias told her how he had kept silent and accepted the help of the people who had taken him in, although it had been most difficult when the doctor had come to examine him, and he got his first look at modern medical instruments.</p><p>\u201cThe wounds in my chest and on my hands and side were no longer there, and had left no scars. It was as if they had never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI had grown thin, and my limbs were weak, but after the people gave me a meal I felt strong again. I borrowed some clothing and ropes and went back up on the mountain. I found the traitor\u2019s sword in the snow, and what was left of the purse I had carried. I came down and gave the young men some coins in return for their kindness. Then I left and followed the road south, to Rome.\u201d</p><p>Jessa learned it had taken him several weeks to make the journey, and along the way he picked up enough of the modern version of Italian to make himself understood. He found an antiquities dealer and traded one more of his coins for the odd paper money everyone used, and traded that for food, rooms, and better clothing.</p><p>\u201cI knew what had happened to me only when I came to the city,\u201d Matthias said. \u201cThe Rome I knew no longer existed. What buildings I remembered had become crumbling ruins. The ancient statues of the city bore the likeness of many of the noblemen I had known and served. The first numbers I learned were to tell the year: 1998. I had slept on the mountain, in the ice, dreaming of rain for almost two thousand years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you dream of rain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say. But that is all I remember from my sleep.\u201d His gaze grew distant. \u201cEndless dreams of rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have known on some level that you were buried alive,\u201d Jessa said. \u201cPerhaps you simply wanted the snow to melt away, so that you could be free again.\u201d She propped herself on one elbow. \u201cYou were Kyndred before the avalanche. That must be what allowed you to survive all those centuries buried in the snow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had no power over the storms when I served the emperor,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI was an ordinary man. A soldier. I did not discover my ability until sometime after I woke to this world, when a man tried to rob me. Then it seemed to come out of me on its own. The thief was struck down by hail that never touched me. The rain came down for hours after he fell.\u201d</p><p>Jessa realized something. \u201cYou must be the very first Kyndred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never found another from my time,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the old ones, the dark Kyn, they came into this world centuries after my first life.\u201d He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. \u201cThe courier who tried to slay me on the battlefield ... he escaped that day. In time I found accounts of him in the history books. They say he was elevated through the ranks of the army, and later was named a senator of Rome. He grew wealthy and powerful, until he was struck down by a plague, but his sons carried on his cursed name, and passed it through all their generations to this time.\u201d</p> <p>Jessa frowned as she felt a peculiar twinge inside her head, like the beginning of a bad headache. \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeptus Janus Genarius,\u201d he told her. \u201cJonah Genaro is his last living descendant.\u201d He glanced at her and sat up. \u201cJessa?\u201d</p><p>She pressed the heels of her hands to her temples. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. I can feel ...\u201d She trailed off as her stomach surged and she fought against the alien sensation. \u201cIt\u2019s Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawson is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He survived.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cHe can feel me, the same way I can feel him. He\u2019s coming here, Matthias. He\u2019s coming to kill both of us.\u201d</p> <p>Rowan left her bike under a tree by the pretty fountain in Price Park and scanned the area. A couple of people with dogs were walking on the other side of the grounds, but she saw no one else. She checked her watch, and saw it was two minutes to noon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better show, Drew,\u201d she muttered, \u201cor I\u2019m going to be pissed at you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d a voice said from above.</p><p>Rowan tilted her head back and saw a man standing in the tree over her bike. \u201cWhat are you doing up there, you idiot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaintaining cover, smart-ass.\u201d He jumped, dropping down twelve feet before landing neatly beside her. \u201cWere you followed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I six years old?\u201d she countered.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked her over. \u201cSixteen, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-one and legal, thank you very much.\u201d She shoved her spare helmet into his hands. \u201cHop on. We\u2019ve got a lot of road to cover.\u201d</p><p>Something whizzed past her cheek and thunked against the tree. Two more things zipped past her nose before Drew knocked her to the ground.</p><p>Drew seized the back of her collar. \u201cKeep your head down and crawl,\u201d he said. \u201cBehind the fountain. Move it.\u201d</p><p>Rowan crawled, ducking again as more bullets hit the tree where she\u2019d just been standing.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t followed,\u201d she insisted as she got behind the fountain and huddled next to Drew. \u201cThey must have been tailing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019d spotted me,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d already be lying on a slab at GenHance.\u201d He looked up as something pinged against the metal sculpture, and grinned. \u201cOh. We\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Rowan stared at him. \u201cWe\u2019re being shot at. We\u2019re unarmed. We\u2019re about to be killed or taken, or both. Probably both. We\u2019re screwed, is what we are, Andrew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave faith, baby girl.\u201d He lifted his head and looked toward the source of the shots before ducking down. \u201cDo you have any pennies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple thousand in a jar back home,\u201d she snapped. \u201cTossing one in the fountain and making a wish will not make the bad guys go away. Just FYI.\u201d</p><p>Drew shoved his hand into her hip pocket and pulled out a handful of change. He sorted out the silver and dropped it, curling his fingers over the remaining pennies.</p><p>\u201cSo your bike, is it pretty good on gas?\u201d he asked in a conversational tone. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about getting one for years, but with gas prices the way they are, it seems like the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to die with a crazy man.\u201d She folded her arms over her waist. \u201cWell, at least I never slept with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to live long and prosper, baby girl. And you never know.\u201d Drew made a V sign with his fingers, winked, and stood. \u201cHold your fire,\u201d he shouted at the men crossing the park. He held up his arms. \u201cWe\u2019re not armed. We surrender.\u201d</p><p>Rowan grabbed the leg of his jeans. \u201cHey. I\u2019m not surrendering, you nitwit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up and raise your hands,\u201d he said out of the side of his mouth. \u201cSo the nice shooters think that you are.\u201d</p><p>Rowan realized something, rose, and stood beside him, holding her hands in view. \u201cThe fucking fountain is made of copper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He lowered the fist holding the pennies and pretended to rub his nose, while the fountain began to shake.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cYou could have mentioned it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd spoil the fun?\u201d Drew glanced at her, his eyes glittering like two new pennies. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be more of a wild biker chick. You sound just like my mother.\u201d</p><p>Rowan watched the men advancing on them. \u201cFour of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about the guns?\u201d</p><p>He opened his palm and the pennies in it began to float around his fingers. \u201cPut a cork in them.\u201d</p><p>The fountain stopped shaking and produced an eerie whine as the copper basin began undulating.</p><p>The shooters stopped a few feet away from the fountain and aimed for their heads.</p><p>\u201cGuys.\u201d Drew smiled. \u201cPut down the guns, turn around, and walk away.\u201d</p><p>One of the men laughed. None of them moved.</p><p>Drew sighed. \u201cIt never works in the movies, either.\u201d</p><p>The pennies streaked away from his hand, moving so fast Rowan couldn\u2019t follow them. One man\u2019s gun exploded in his hand, and as the blast knocked him backward the others dropped their guns and shouted, seizing their bloody hands, in which Rowan saw penny-size wounds.</p><p>\u201cShit, Drew, you only hit one out of four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got their hands, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He scowled at her. \u201cYou try ramming a penny down the barrel of a weapon from thirty yards away; then you can complain about my aim.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cOkay, it was pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everyone says pennies are worthless.\u201d Drew touched the basin of the fountain and slowly raised his hands like a magician trying to conjure. The copper screamed as it flared up as if molten, shedding flakes of green rust as the water it contained poured out and flooded the ground.</p><p>The uneven wall of copper split in two, then four, then eight sections before they lifted into the air and stretched out over the four men. Each of the copper strips wove through the others before the ends drove themselves into the ground. Drew sent more copper from the fountain to reinforce the strips, until he had fashioned a crude but effective cage around the shooters.</p><p>Rowan heard a shout, and looked over at a white-faced man who had stopped at the curb and was peering through the open window of his car. \u201cCall nine-one-one,\u201d she yelled to him. \u201cThese terrible men have vandalized the park.\u201d</p><p>The man gunned his car and sped off.</p><p>\u201cNo one wants to do the right damn thing anymore.\u201d Rowan walked over to the cage, reached in, and grabbed the uninjured hand of the man closest to her. The image of a voluptuous, Marilyn Monroe-type blonde in a tight sequined dress filled her head, and her body went into shift. A moment later she pouted her red lips and looked into the man\u2019s wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cHoneybunch, how could you shoot at me?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRosie, I swear I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d Caught up in the vision of the woman he loved, the shooter smiled. \u201cI thought you were back in LA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too lonely for you, sweetie pie.\u201d Rowan leaned close. \u201cHow did you find us? Who else is going to try to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes glazed over. \u201cWe tracked the bike. Teams all over the city.\u201d He grunted as one of the other men slammed a fist into the side of his head, and he slumped back.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get away,\u201d the second man told her. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Rowan stood, shifting back into herself as she turned to Drew. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth curled. \u201cCan you do the blonde again? Maybe for the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She walked past him. \u201cAnd come on. We need to steal a car.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Bradford Lawson felt like a new man. He didn\u2019t look like one, not yet, as the transerum was still healing the damage from the lightning strike. But large patches of burned flesh were sloughing from his face, falling like black dandruff into his lap. He could feel the same itch all over his body as his skin slowly regenerated.</p><p>The truck he\u2019d stolen as a present for Jessa Bellamy handled beautifully, even when he drove it over a hundred miles an hour. And he had to, now that she was moving again. He\u2019d hit the accelerator as soon as he\u2019d felt the connection between them becoming weaker and thinner, and it was growing stronger. He was close enough now to taste the brightness of her fear.</p><p>She knew he couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>Jessa felt a little different now, too. Lawson wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he\u2019d come back from the dead in a different phase of his transformation, or if she had changed from being in his presence. She had given him so much delight with her cringing and pleading in Savannah; he was sure that seeing him now would have her crawling to him to kiss his feet and beg for his forgiveness.</p><p>He\u2019d make her kill her boyfriend first, he decided. Then he\u2019d take her back to GenHance and have Genaro transform her into a suitable mate. One he could beat as much as he liked, and who would always heal, just as he did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The goddess to his god.</p><p>A roadblock ahead made him press the air brakes and coast to a stop behind a long line of cars. The unmarked cars and the big men in the dark suits looked like feds, Lawson thought, but they might be working for Genaro. Then he saw the silver BMW at the very front of the line and smiled.</p><p>There she is.</p> <p>Lawson put the truck in reverse, smashing into the car behind him, before he shifted gears and plowed into the one ahead. The force of the truck hitting the station wagon sent it skittering into the next. He crashed through both and turned the wheel, going around the others and hitting two oncoming cars, flipping one and rolling the other into the shoulder.</p><p>He saw Jessa and her boyfriend climb out of the car and run, and stopped the truck just before it hit the barricade of unmarked cars. A cloud of black dust wafted from him as he jumped down.</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d One of the big men came toward him and distracted him. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to move\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lawson took hold of the man\u2019s left arm, ripped it from his body, and used it to knock the head off his shoulders. He took a bite out of the arm before he dropped it and started after Jessa.</p><p>He had missed lunch and breakfast. Maybe he\u2019d have Jessa feed her boyfriend to him instead.</p> <p>The sky clouded overhead as Lucan\u2019s driver came to a stop.</p><p>\u201cThe roadblock is in place, my lord,\u201d the driver said. The sound of vehicles smashing together made him remove his shades and peer through the windshield. \u201cThere is a truck trying to drive through the stopped cars.\u201d</p><p>Sam felt Lawson before he climbed out of the tanker truck, and grabbed Lucan\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s him on the other side of the roadblock. The one in the truck.\u201d Her hand shook as she reached for her weapon.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart,\u201d he told her, tugging her hand away. \u201cThis is my work.\u201d He took off his gloves and opened the door before he looked back at her. \u201cIf I fail, summon Richard. He will be the only one strong enough to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She climbed out after him.</p><p>Lucan turned to thrust her back into the car; then they both heard the Kyn warrior cry out. Sam watched in disbelief as Lawson pulled off the Kyn\u2019s arm as if it were an insect wing and used it to decapitate him.</p> <p>Lucan\u2019s eyes turned to chrome. \u201cStay here, Samantha.\u201d He strode past a man and a woman fleeing from Lawson.</p><p>Sam called to the two mortals to take cover, but a blue sedan screeched to a stop between them and the couple jumped into the backseat. The sedan spun around and sped away from the roadblock.</p><p>She turned at the sound of smashing glass and saw the windows of every car Lucan passed explode outward. Lawson, who was covered in some kind of black soot, stopped a few feet away from her lover.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the old ones,\u201d she heard Lawson say. \u201cI\u2019m your new god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is only one God,\u201d Lucan informed him pleasantly. \u201cYou are not Him.\u201d</p><p>Lawson lifted one of his hands, and a bolt of electricity shot out, hitting Lucan in the chest and sending him soaring backward to land on top of one of the cars, crushing the hood inward with the impact.</p><p>Sam pulled out her weapon and started to run.</p><p>Rowan looked back at them. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Matthias put his arm around Jessa. \u201cHow did you know we would be on this road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah called Drew. My cell phone\u2019s history.\u201d Rowan turned her attention back to the road, but glanced in her rearview. \u201cWho the hell was the guy shooting lightning out of his hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawson,\u201d Jessa said, her voice bleak. \u201cHe\u2019s coming after me again. GenHance did something to him, made him like us, and like the dark Kyn. And something else. Something worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe passed a truck stop about two miles down the road,\u201d Drew said. \u201cWe should change cars there.\u201d He smiled at Jessa. \u201cNice to meet you at last, Ms. Bellamy. You\u2019re even prettier in person.\u201d</p><p>Rowan made a rude sound. \u201cSave it, Andrew. She\u2019s taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Matthias turned to Jessa, who held his hand between hers. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>Rowan eyed him in the mirror. \u201cWas that GenHance with the roadblock back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jessa said before he could reply. \u201cThey weren\u2019t GenHance or the police. That woman who got out of the car was wearing a gun in a holster, but she didn\u2019t dress like a cop. And that big man with the fair hair ...\u201d She gripped Matthias\u2019s hand. \u201cThis is going to sound a little strange, but when I passed him, I smelled flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be he was a florist,\u201d Drew suggested.</p><p>Rowan chuckled. \u201cOr he likes wearing perfume.\u201d</p><p>Matthias knew the man and the woman had been dark Kyn, but he didn\u2019t want to frighten his friends or disturb Jessa. There would be time later, when they were safe, to speak of such matters. \u201cDrew, what happened to Lawson to make him as he is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently he broke into the lab at GenHance and injected himself with the transerum,\u201d the younger man told him. \u201cHe\u2019s pumped full of it now, and if it works the way Kirchner predicted, he\u2019ll be next to impossible to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had fangs,\u201d Jessa said. \u201cHe also survived being electrocuted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would mean he\u2019s mutated.\u201d Drew rubbed his eyes. \u201cThey haven\u2019t perfected the transerum yet. They were letting Lawson run around to see what effect it had on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turned him into a monster,\u201d Jessa said, shuddering. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even look human anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can kill him?\u201d Matthias asked as Rowan pulled off into the truck stop.</p><p>\u201cYou have to separate the brain from the body to kill both,\u201d Drew said. \u201cMy guess is by decapitation, dismemberment, or ripping out his spine. Burning might work, too, but he\u2019d have to be incinerated to ash.\u201d</p><p>Jessa stiffened. \u201cHe\u2019s getting closer, Gaven,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cThey weren\u2019t able to stop him.\u201d</p><p>Matthias scanned the parking lot. He spotted a welder\u2019s flatbed truck, which was stacked with pipes, and an old fueling station that had been boarded up and appeared unoccupied. He measured the distance from the fueling station to the diner.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d He pointed. \u201cPark the car over there.\u201d</p><p>Lucan heard Samantha screaming his name, and the sound of a truck engine. He rolled off the ruined hood of the vehicle just before the tanker smashed into it, shearing off the front end. From the ground he leaped up onto the side of the truck, wrenching open the passenger door.</p><p>Lawson turned, kicking at his face, and screamed as Lucan seized his leg. Before Lucan could do more than shatter the bones in it, the wounded man hit him with another burst of power, which knocked Lucan out of the cab and onto the road.</p><p>Lucan rolled to avoid the back wheels of the truck and staggered to his feet. The burns to his face and chest throbbed painfully as he watched the truck knock aside the cars his men had positioned to block the road, and heard the roar of the engine as Lawson accelerated.</p><p>\u201cLucan.\u201d Samantha reached him and grabbed his arms. \u201cYour face.\u201d</p><p>He could feel the wounds healing. \u201cIt will pass.\u201d He turned to her. \u201cHelp the mortals who have been injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy talent shattered his leg. I can kill him.\u201d He bent and kissed her with his scorched lips. \u201cTake care of the people here.\u201d</p><p>He took one of the cars Lawson had not destroyed, and followed after the tanker, trying to gain on it before Lawson reached a populated area. Fortunately the only dwellings Lucan saw ahead of them were a gas station and a restaurant, which he was sure Lawson would pass.</p><p>Sure until the tanker slowed, and then turned.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be me,\u201d Jessa said to Matthias after he told them about his plan. \u201cI\u2019m the one he wants.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSarah and Paul will be here soon. She will cast an illusion over me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll reach us before they do.\u201d She looked at Drew. \u201cAre you as fast as Rowan says? Can you pull me out in time?\u201d</p><p>As he nodded. Rowan walked over to Matthias and held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d When he didn\u2019t touch her, she wrapped her fingers around his wrist. \u201cQueenie, in case you were wondering.\u201d Her body blurred, and when she turned around she was a mirror image of Jessa. \u201cHe really loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan, I can\u2019t let you\u2014\u201d Jessa began, but the younger girl waved her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get a vote. No one does. Like I said, my turn.\u201d Her gaze shifted as the sound of a truck braking drew their attention. \u201cNo more time to discuss it. He\u2019s here. Matthias, you\u2019ve got the car. Drew, you\u2019d better not miss this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He sprinted off toward the welder\u2019s truck.</p><p>Matthias caught the keys Rowan tossed to him. \u201cYou will be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She grinned. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get him.\u201d She jogged off toward the fueling station before either of them could say another word.</p><p>Jessa stared after her. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the shape-shifters. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her arm. \u201cCome. We must go to the car before he sees both of you.\u201d</p><p>The tanker slowly entered the drive into the truck stop, and coasted to a stop. Jessa crouched behind Rowan\u2019s car with Matthias and watched as the tanker slowly turned toward the fueling station, where Rowan, still in Jessa\u2019s form, stood between the pumps. The truck carrying the pipes backed in behind her, and Matthias opened the door to the car and started the engine.</p><p>Rowan walked forward until Lawson could see her standing in the sunlight. With a grand sweep of her arm, she lifted her hand and flipped him her middle finger.</p><p>The tanker\u2019s engine gunned, and Lawson barreled toward her.</p><p>Lucan drove into the parking lot and saw Lawson driving the tanker toward a lone mortal female standing at the other end of the complex. He was too far behind to stop Lawson from running her down, and could only watch the woman die. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Lawson reached her, long copper pipes shot past her on either side, ramming through the windshield of the tanker and wrapping around the tires. If that were not unlikely enough, the pipes began to writhe like snakes and slither over the sides and roof of the tanker as it came to an abrupt stop.</p><p>Electricity crackled over the tanker\u2019s cab as Lawson forced open the driver\u2019s-side door and fell out of the truck. One of the pipes, embedded in his chest, came with him, and then wrapped around him like a boa, tightening until he threw out his arms and shrugged it off as if it were no more than paper ribbons.</p><p>Lucan got out of the car and started toward them, but stopped in his tracks as a sedan flashed past him. No one was driving it, but it was headed directly for the tanker, Lawson, and the woman.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to stop running away from me, Jessa,\u201d Lawson said as he limped toward the girl, dragging his shattered leg along. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime, pal,\u201d Jessa said, taking a short pipe out of her jacket and holding the ends in her hands. She was jerked up into the air a moment before Lawson reached her, and flew over the fueling station just as the sedan hit the back of the tanker and burst into flames. The fire spread to the tanker, which was leaking fuel now on all sides.</p><p>White bolts of electricity flared all around Lawson, who shouted the girl\u2019s name as he turned, watching her float down next to the diner. Copper pipes crept up and wrapped themselves around his legs, holding him in place. \u201cCome here, you bitch.\u201d</p><p>Lucan would never be sure what ignited the contents of the tanker\u2014Lawson\u2019s power or the fire spreading from the sedan\u2014but the truck exploded into a fireball that engulfed the fueling station and most of the lot around it, and blew out the windows of the diner and every vehicle in the lot by the diner. As burning fuel and parts of the tanker rained down, several cars parked on the far end of the lot caught fire as well.</p><p>A vague form struggled in the midst of the flames, and then fell to the ground, its lower limbs encased in melting copper.</p> <p>Lucan saw no sign of the mortal female who had flown in the air, or what had caused the pipes to impale and imprison Lawson. What he felt was indefinable, unfamiliar. He would have said he sensed another Kyn nearby, but they were not Kyn. They were something else\u2014and they were already gone.</p><p>He made sure none of the mortals was injured before he climbed back into the car and returned to the roadblock. Samantha ran to him before he could stop the car, and flung herself at him.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>He held her close. \u201cThis time, I believe he is.\u201d He saw an old pickup truck, driven by an older mortal with stooped shoulders, approaching the roadblock. His men glanced at the four dark-skinned farmhands sitting in the back and then waved them through. As the truck passed, the mortal\u2019s companion, a kind-faced woman, caught Lucan\u2019s gaze and did something that astonished him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he heard Samantha ask.</p><p>\u201cThat mortal who just passed us,\u201d he told her. \u201cShe winked at me.\u201d</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>Lucan squinted as Alexandra Keller blinded him with her penlight. \u201cThat is beyond annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d she said as she checked his other eye, \u201cbut somehow I manage not to stab you repeatedly in the heart with a copper dagger, no matter how often I am tempted.\u201d She stepped back and showed him three fingers. \u201cHow many do you see?\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms. \u201cNine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to check your retinas again?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI\u2019ll get the drops this time. I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She scribbled something on her notepad. \u201cWell, suzerain, it looks like you\u2019re going to live. I\u2019ll break the news to the jardin gently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an evil heart. I have always loved that about you.\u201d Lucan pulled on his shirt and began buttoning it. \u201cWas Michael able to learn more about the woman and her friends?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a lot,\u201d Alex said. \u201cBut Lawson\u2019s former employer, GenHance, was very interested in the remains we didn\u2019t recover from the wrecked sedan. They were expecting four bodies. They even gave us names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll adopted orphans, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cLooks like we missed meeting some Kyndred by the skin of your corneas. But our human friends in the FBI planted some cremated ash in the wreck and falsified a few documents, and that got the biotech corporation to back off. They think we recovered four bodies, all dead, with no viable DNA. That should give Michael some time to find out exactly who the bad guys are, what they\u2019re up to, and how much they were involved in what happened to Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did survey his remains?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cNothing remarkable. Human, normal DNA, extra crispy. Not a trace of pathogen or augmented genes. Whatever was in him, whatever made him so lethal, was burned out by the fire. I\u2019ll continue studying the tissue samples from the remains of his victims. Maybe I\u2019ll find something to explain what he was, and how he got that way.\u201d</p><p>Samantha came into the office. \u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my best,\u201d Alex said as she closed her medical case, \u201cbut sorry; you\u2019re still stuck with him, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have been worse, I suppose. No, Lawson\u2019s dead.\u201d She laughed as Lucan nipped one of her fingers. \u201cCut it out. Alex, I can\u2019t find anything on Jessa Bellamy. She simply doesn\u2019t exist anymore; it\u2019s like she\u2019s been erased. If she and these other people involved in killing Lawson were Kyndred, they\u2019re very good at covering their tracks. As good as we are, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I saw them do,\u201d Lucan said, \u201cI am not convinced we should be looking for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was Kyndred,\u201d Alex reminded him. \u201cSo was Samantha. We\u2014they\u2014may have been created by the Brethren for other reasons, but they are the only beings in this world like us. And if the Darkyn are going to survive, we have to find them.\u201d</p><p>Jonah Genaro stood outside the window to the lab as the latest acquisition was rolled in. Kirchner and two techs were busy hooking up monitors and adjusting the restraining straps, although the pitiful condition of the body in the glass coffin hardly merited either.</p><p>Beside him, Delaporte read from the crime scene report. \u201cThe remains of the four bodies in the sedan that hit the tanker were recovered. The consulting physician determined that they were too badly burned to offer any viable DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was a consultant brought in?\u201d</p><p>His security chief flipped through the forms. \u201cA Dr. Alexandra Keller. She\u2019s a reconstructive surgeon out of Chicago, doing a study on third-degree-burn patients. The FBI brought her in as a special consultant on the Lawson case. We barely had time to switch out Lawson\u2019s remains before Dr. Keller arrived.\u201d</p><p>Genaro nodded. \u201cRiordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill at large, but he should surface sometime in the near future. We weren\u2019t able to recover anything from his apartment, but along with the criminal charges we\u2019ve filed, we\u2019ve emptied his accounts and destroyed his credit. After what he did to our men in the park, I\u2019ve issued orders to shoot him on sight.\u201d Delaporte gave him an uneasy look. \u201cI hope you agree that\u2019s the best approach to take with this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. File the reports and keep me updated.\u201d After Delaporte left, Genaro switched on the intercom. \u201cHave you performed the microcellular tests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as it was delivered from the morgue.\u201d Kirchner\u2019s iron gray hair badly needed a trim, as it flopped over his glasses. \u201cCellular regeneration has begun on a limited level, as you can see from the eyes, but there isn\u2019t enough body mass to sustain it. If you want to keep it alive, we\u2019ll have to augment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that will not be necessary.\u201d Genaro studied his greatest failure. The black, twisted form appeared to be little more than a mound of charcoal sticks with eyes, which were open and staring up at Genaro\u2019s face. \u201cWill it take much longer for his tissue to begin regenerating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, sir.\u201d The geneticist checked the preservation unit\u2019s LED display. \u201cBP and heart rate are beginning to rise. Brain activity indicates consciousness as well. Once I\u2019ve completed the physical and neurological exams, we can begin harvesting.\u201d</p><p>Genaro watched as the thing in the coffin opened the hole that remained of its mouth in a soundless scream. It was evident that what remained of Bradford Lawson could not only see, but could hear as well. \u201cExcellent. Be sure when you\u2019ve recovered the cells to dismember the remains before you incinerate them.\u201d</p><p>He turned his back on the window and walked away.</p><p>Rowan shut off the lights in the bare kitchen and came out into the tunnel in time to bump into Drew, who was hauling out the last of the computer equipment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to take all that crap with you to California?\u201d she asked as she followed him out. \u201cWhy not buy new stuff when you get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a fugitive computer genius who just lost all his tech,\u201d he told her, \u201cone way to find him is to monitor specific equipment purchases.\u201d He stepped aside so she could open the hatch to the stairs. \u201cPlus I installed a duplicate setup over at the farm. The boss doesn\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Rowan remembered something Matthias did need, and turned around. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta grab something. I\u2019ll meet you at the car.\u201d</p><p>When Rowan caught up with Drew, she pushed a book into his hands. \u201cHere. Put this in with your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get you anything.\u201d Drew held it up so he could read the cover in the streetlight. \u201cGourmet Cooking for Two. Hell, Rowan, why don\u2019t you just go with me?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t pay me to move to California, pal. I\u2019m heading north, back to egg creams and civilization.\u201d</p><p>Drew tucked the book in the back of his car. \u201cOh, wait. I do have something for you.\u201d He turned around and caught her in a clinch so fast Rowan had time only to take the kiss that came with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere. We\u2019re even.\u201d He set her back on her feet and dodged her swat. \u201cTake care of yourself, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d She gave him a hard hug before she stalked off.</p><p>Matt had insisted on buying her a new bike to replace the one she\u2019d ditched in Atlanta, and she hadn\u2019t refused. She was never going to be a car chick, and she needed to be on the move again. The boss had already set up a guest room for her, and Jessa had practically begged her to stay with them, but while Rowan could be a good sport, she wasn\u2019t a masochist.</p> <p>Somewhere out there is someone for me, she thought as she straddled her bike. Someone who doesn\u2019t want a goddess. Someone who will never, ever eat a Filet-O-Fish in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d she answered herself. \u201cBut how will I know for sure?\u201d</p><p>Drew pulled to a stop by her bike in time to hear her. \u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does someone like me know if any guy really cares?\u201d she said without thinking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhen he holds your hand, you won\u2019t change into Angelina Jolie.\u201d He waved and took off.</p> <p>She watched his taillights disappear, and laughed all the way to the interstate.</p><p>Rowan rode through the night, and arrived in Tennessee just after dawn. She made her way across fields and down dirt roads that didn\u2019t exist on any map except the one in her head. Another hour passed before she arrived at the gates to the sprawling grounds of the farm.</p><p>Matthias had planted so many trees around the house she could hardly see it from the road. A small intercom next to the locked gates invited her to press its buttons, but as she looked out over the acres of good, rich soil waiting to be planted, she dropped her kickstand and got off the bike.</p><p>Before leaving Savannah, she had gathered a few things for them and bundled everything up in her favorite tablecloth. Now she tucked in a hastily written note and left it at the foot of the gates. With one last, long look at her friends\u2019 home, she strapped her bundle to the back of her bike, got on, pressed the call button at the gate, and took off, heading north toward her future.</p><p>Jessa woke to the sound of Matthias getting dressed. She stretched with the pleasure of a cat before she pulled off the covers and joined him.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is at the gate,\u201d he said before he kissed her. \u201cIt is probably Rowan. Go back to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI spend too much time in this bed already,\u201d she teased as she went to the closet they shared and took out a pair of faded jeans and a suede blouse. \u201cYou are going to talk her into staying with us, I hope. She won\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI will bribe her. She cannot resist organic plums.\u201d</p><p>When they walked down to the gate, Jessa saw no Rowan, only an oddly shaped red-and-white-checked bundle sitting outside the gates. Matthias opened the doors and then picked up the heavy bundle, untying the knot to reveal a blue teddy bear, the bronze sword from his library, and a folded piece of paper.</p><p>He read the note and then looked out at the road. \u201cShe said she could not bring herself to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>He handed her the note.</p><p>Matt and Jessa,</p><p>The bear is for the baby, not the blade. I wish I could stay, but I have to find someone. Drew told me how to look for him. I\u2019ll be in touch.</p> <p>Jessa, I have a bigger surprise for you. And we\u2019ll talk about it the next time I call. Just remember, whatever names we use, we\u2019re still friends. No matter what.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Aphrodite</p><p>Jessa felt shocked and confused and elated, all at the same time. \u201cRowan is my best friend,\u201d she said helplessly.</p><p>\u201cAnd mine.\u201d He kissed her brow.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find her. I mean ...\u201d She made a frustrated gesture. \u201cHow could she write this and then just leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will return someday, when she has found what she is looking for.\u201d He looked out at the road again, and put his arm around her. \u201cNow come. I have not spent enough time in that bed with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
