He knew that Dylan had a date with her last night, but hoping against hope and because he was an eternal optimist, he decided to log on while he was having his morning cup of coffee.</p><p>And just to see if maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 she might have answered him, even though it was now six minutes before seven in the morning. He figured she was still in Dylan\u2019s bed, probably going on for round seven (knowing Dylan), and there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that she would...wait, what?</p><p>He stared at his phone where he\u2019d logged into the app for the online dating site. Her little icon blinked rapidly \u2013 he\u2019d subscribed to her and her avatar had suddenly turned green.</p><p>Oh, holy hell, no! he thought. Hell, yes! a different voice answered in his poor, addled brain. Enough with the ridiculous self doubts \u2013 he had to grab his chance now. She was logged on to the dating site early in the morning after a date with Dylan. This meant \u2013 oh, the implications stunned him. Made him smirk.</p> <p>Mike took a swig of coffee and quickly tapped out:</p><p>Hi, there. Are you on right now?</p><p>She typed back,</p><p>I\u2019m just drinking my coffee and getting ready for work and I logged in and saw your message, so hi!</p><p>Wait a minute. Back up for a second. So if she was at home drinking her coffee, then that meant Dylan had struck out. Ooh! Well that wasn\u2019t quite what he wanted. He wanted Dylan to have some success but not to hit a home run. And so it looked like maybe he\u2019d hit a single? A double?</p> <p>The app stared at him, as if it were mortal. He quickly punched in:</p><p>Oh, good morning! Yeah, I\u2019m not really functional without two or three cups of coffee myself</p><p>with a little grin icon.</p><p>See, now, this was the problem with trying to find the right women. He didn\u2019t want to be the sloppy second that the women settled for. He wanted someone both he and Dylan could share, equally. When it came to their limited experience trying to find the right, single woman, Dylan had always been the front man and Mike had been the wingman. He was tired of being the wingman. Maybe it was time, really, for the best man to win. That comment to Dylan had most definitely not been just a joke \u2013 he\u2019d been very, intensely serious.</p><p>And that man was stepping up to the plate now, ready for his turn at bat. Oh God, he was getting sick of the baseball metaphors.</p><p>The app beeped as she replied with:</p> <p>So I see you\u2019re like, Mr. Triathlon and ski dude, and my idea of exercise is walking across the room to get the remote.</p><p>Oh, man. She was chatting him up. There was a natural opportunity here and he \u2013 he couldn\u2019t blow it. He couldn\u2019t blow it. He sat there in his boxer briefs, typing away with one finger on his ridiculous smart phone interface and realized that the boxer briefs were getting awfully uncomfortable. Because as he typed, he stared at her little avatar with those sweet dimples, and that amazing, intelligent look on her face and decided that his body\u2019s response was telling him pretty much all he needed to know.</p><p>He typed out something that sounded good on the surface, and then the second that he hit enter \u2013 augh! \u2013 he wanted to take it back.</p><p>lolol, yeah don\u2019t be afraid, we could just go for a hike if you want.</p><p>Oh, I think I just asked you out.</p><p>Yeah I did.</p><p>and then he ended it with a question mark.</p><p>Shit, a hike? A hike? God, could that be any lamer? Why couldn\u2019t you come up with something romantic? Beating himself up came naturally, and this time he had good cause \u2013 a hike? Dylan had taken him up on his advice and taken Laura out to the fancy Asian fusion place that so many of the women they had dated loved to go to but, then again, he could count \u201call of the women they dated\u201d on one hand.</p> <p>All of the women had also flatly and resoundingly rejected what they were offering, which was, he had to admit, pretty unique. However, settling for second best had left them both hollow and incomplete, and now they had an added complication. 2.2 billion of them, to be exact.</p><p>A hike, yeah, I\u2019d like that. That sounds really cool.</p><p>The words sat on the screen like fairy dust, as if some unseen spirit had conjured them from a mystical layer in the universe and plopped them on Mike\u2019s phone. Seriously? She said yes?</p><p>She liked the hike idea. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He sucked down more coffee, the hot liquid helping to regenerate his brain cells, making him come alive and think think think to say the right answer.</p><p>Which was...? Smacking his forehead, he ran twitchy fingers through his hair, his palm grazing a day\u2019s growth on his chin. Jesus. She was saying yes! The coffee felt like a pool of hot lead in his gut now as he raced to reply, typing out a response. OK, OK, breathe dude. Breathe, breathe, breathe. What could he say?</p><p>What could he say? Keep it simple. With a shaking finger, he wrote:</p><p>OK. So, how about this afternoon. After work? You wanna do lunch and then go for hike? I know a great spot in this State Park, a nice easy trail, it won\u2019t be too hard on you.</p><p>He hit enter and then realized that that was probably one of the stupidest things he could have said, his fingers itching to find some magical \u201cretract\u201d button, a switch he could flip to withdraw his words from cyberspace.</p><p>Fuck! He wasn\u2019t implying when she was out of the shape, he didn\u2019t mean to... oh, shit. Mike, you idiot! He buried his head in his hands and fully expected her little icon to go away and disappear, and for Laura to think he was just a double failure at this shit, to go running back to Dylan \u2013 who knew how to handle women. Then again, if he was that good, why was Laura chatting right now?</p><p>She replied:</p><p>Sounds good. I\u2019ll wear my hiking boots, don\u2019t worry. I have feet, I can walk, I can use them, I can even move them independently while chewing gum.</p><p>And funny, too! He laughed and wrote back:</p><p>OK, phew, good to know. I like bipeds</p><p>and typed down his phone number. Laura sent hers back and he realized that he needed to say something, yet had no idea what to say because this was the first time that he had actually found a woman, on his own, without Dylan.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah \u2013 technically Dylan had found her, but Dylan had no idea that he was independently pursuing her. The not-inconsequential fact that he had just essentially sniped her couldn\u2019t be ignored, either.</p><p>Wow! He just stared at his smart phone, dumbfounded, willing his erection to go away but it wasn\u2019t, and there was no hope that it was going to go away. He could tell as he just stared at the blinking cursor.</p><p>Finally she wrote back,</p><p>Hello, hello. Are you there, Mike?</p><p>Oh, Jesus. He startled as he realized he needed to respond, and quickly typed back,</p><p>Yeah, sorry. Not enough coffee yet. So, great, it\u2019s a date? And thanks.</p><p>She wrote back a little smiley face, and he realize as he leaned back in the chair that he may have just made the biggest mistake of his life.</p><p>Had she really just made a date less than three hours after sneaking out of another guy\u2019s bed? She opened up one of the seventeen texts from Josie which, as she scrolled through them, appeared to all be variations of \u201cPlease tell me about the hot guy.\u201d</p><p>So she finally decided to put Josie out of her misery and typed out, \u201cHey. Awesome night. Will tell you the deets later\u201c, hit \u201csend\u201d and almost instantly got back a response.</p><p>What do you mean later? Hell, no. I\u2019m coming over.</p><p>She wrote back:</p><p>Can\u2019t. I\u2019m late for work as it is. Let\u2019s just say I need a shower this morning.</p><p>and hit \u201cSend\u201d.</p><p>Squeeeee</p><p>was Josie\u2019s reply.</p><p>Do you have another date?</p><p>Do I have another date? Oh, yeah, Josie, I have another date. It\u2019s just not with the same guy. Ugh, how was she going to tell her this? She needed two showers. One to wash off Dylan and the other one to wash off her own skank.</p><p>This was getting ridiculous. She typed back:</p><p>There\u2019s a lot to this. Will write more later. Come over after work.</p><p>She hit \u201cSend\u201d and turned her phone over, leaving Josie hanging, and padded into the shower. Indeed, it was time to wash off Dylan and her own... er... her own sense of ambiguity? Indecision? Disappointment?</p><p>Revelation? For she had learned so much these past few days, mostly about herself. In some ways, she was surprised to realize, it didn\u2019t matter that Dylan was with someone else. In the past, that would have crushed her, but now \u2013 now she felt a renewed sense of power. Of strength. Stripping down and turning up the temperature on the shower\u2019s spray, she felt her body melt into the hot water, the sting of the jets tearing her away from her looping thoughts, putting the focus back on her body. Rivulets of water streamed over her breasts, down her belly, with its gentle curves and lush skin, pooling at her V and sliding down her thighs, a familiar heat rushing into her womanhood.</p><p>It may have been only a few hours since she\u2019d left his bed, but his mark really was on her. Closing her eyes, she remembered his touch and felt an incongruous sense of guilt. Guilt? He\u2019s the one who had a girlfriend or wife. Yet here she was, scheduling a date with a stranger hours after having Dylan in her. On her. All over her.</p><p>The detachable shower head was about to earn its keep. She knew exactly where to aim it, her hands practiced when it came to masturbating. All her normal fantasies, though, weren\u2019t cutting it \u2013 not the dream about Jake Gyllenhaal, or Matt Bomer, or even Zach Braff. Instead, her mind drifted to Dylan. And Mike.</p><p>As she parted her labia and zeroed the jet spray on her clit, she fought the image of Dylan. And Mike! Both? Yet nothing made it go away. Her body responded to the mere idea of it, of both of them at once, of four hands, two mouths, two cocks all focused on her. Laura. On her needs, on her pleasure, on her discovery. Ahhhhh...</p><p>This was crazy! She hadn\u2019t even met Mike yet. Had crawled out of Dylan\u2019s bed just a few hours ago, resolved never to see him again. Why was she letting them dominate her fantasies? She still had Dylan\u2019s juices in her, his saliva dried on her, his kiss and skin and lips all \u2013 well, now that the water washed the night away, that wasn\u2019t really true, but her neck tightened as her breasts swelled, her hands holding the shower spray in one hand, centered straight on her clit now, her other hand parting her labia and two fingers slowly entering her, the balance hard to achieve but easier as she propped one foot up on the edge of the tub and leaned back against the shower wall.</p><p>Her fingers encountered slightly sore flesh, her mouth spreading with an unexpected grin as she recognized why it hurt a bit, why the water\u2019s sting was so bittersweet. Ah, Dylan \u2013 he had been thick and huge and gentle and rough all at once, knowing exactly how to press her skin, tweak her tight spots, play her body to perfect orgasm over and over with his tongue, his lips, his fingers, his hands, and that gorgeous, veined cock.</p><p>Now she had a face for her menage fantasies \u2013 Mike\u2019s. Why not? Live a little, Laura. No one knew what went on in the privacy of her own mind, her own shower, and as she sighed deeply, the pressure of everything vanquished, she felt a familiar heat and bliss rise up in her as the water pulsed its way into her soul, her clit crying out for more, her fingers sliding in and out of her tight pussy not in a heated rush but, instead, slowly, stroking that spot on the top that always made her clench just a tad harder, made her breath hitch, made her imagine it was Mike\u2019s fingers in her, Dylan\u2019s tongue strumming her clit, both men eager and ready to enter her at once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMmmmm,\u201d Mike moaned in her ear, his thick, wiry runner\u2019s body sliding next to hers in the shower, beads of water darkening that blonde hair, toned arms lifting her up and plunging her down on his ready cock. And then \u2013 was that Dylan\u2019s mouth on her ass? Then gently parting her cheeks as Mike lifted her, had her straddle him across the waist as he effortlessly held her in place, strong legs bending slightly so Dylan could...</p><p>She snaked her pinkie finger down so it played with her puckered anus, the mere touch of her fingertip on her perineum enough to tip her over, imagining Dylan filling her, double entry almost too kinky to even let herself dream about.</p><p>\u201cAh, God, Laura, more,\u201d Dylan groaned behind her, his cock inching slowly inside her ass, Mike\u2019s tip pushing hard against her cervix, her body entombed between them as the water sprayed down. When Dylan\u2019s mouth found her earlobe she \u2013</p><p>Exploded. The shower head, her pinkie finger on her anus, her fingers exploring her g-spot, and her dream all combined to make her bend down and scream as a mad rush of orgasm pounded her instantly, no warning, no teasing, just a wall of everything that left her gaping, her mouth open and her throat hoarse as she let it all unleash, her shoulders twitching and bashing into the wall, her hands moving and milking this for everything she could find, her mind filled with images of Dylan and Mike simulfucking her, their faces strained and cumming, too, all from her. Her body, her presence \u2013 her.</p> <p>And then \u2013 nothing. Like a switch flipped, she pulled her hands out of all her orifices, turned the shower head off, washed up fast and got ready for work. Sated, but not distracted, she shifted from horny, bewildered single on the dating scene to Business Analyst for the megacorporation.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t last more than a few minutes, for she knew her mind would wander, soon. For now, though, it was a welcome and much-needed break.</p><p>Mike had no idea what he was supposed to say as he stared at the chat window. This was so out of his element and Laura seemed so out of his league, but he knew he needed to do something. He couldn\u2019t let Dylan be the one in charge of yet another woman. They were supposed to share her \u2013 that was the entire plan.</p><p>So he had typed,</p><p>\u201clolol, yeah don\u2019t be afraid, we could just go for a hike if you want.</p> <p>Oh, I think I just asked you out.</p><p>Yeah I did\u201d .</p><p>And when she typed \u201cYes,\u201d he couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 and panicked. Now he actually had to step forward. Dylan had always gone out and found the women and had been the one to find Jill, and no matter how desperately they both missed Jill, Jill was gone and they had to accept that.</p><p>Laura was pretty much the opposite of Jill, but he could see what Dylan saw in her. That was a sweet smile. She seemed accomplished, and there was something Mike couldn\u2019t put his finger on, a genuineness and authenticity, but he and Dylan were not exactly the most conventional package.</p><p>So he worried that maybe a business analyst at Stohlman Industries wasn\u2019t going to make the cut \u2013 or maybe he was more worried that they wouldn\u2019t make the cut with her. The office cubicle type wasn\u2019t exactly eager to go out on the slopes or to even watch him at mile marker twenty during a marathon, in his experience.</p><p>But Dylan was giving it a good try and Mike had to, too. The problem was that Mike had to do it in secret. He typed in a few more words, they scheduled the hike, and then she disappeared, off to whatever corporate job she had on whatever floor of whatever giant skyscraper downtown. That world was so alien to him; he worked at a ski resort, and in fact he was missing it already.</p> <p>You don\u2019t just work there anymore, a voice inside him said. You own it...</p><p>The season hadn\u2019t started yet, but he looked forward to it. He always did every year and when he wasn\u2019t skiing he was running. Between the two he kept his sanity somehow, for over the years he had learned that the endorphin kick that came from running and from the massive double diamond trails in the winter were what he needed most. Jill had fit in nicely with his life and with Dylan\u2019s life, spending time running with him. Man, was she an ace on the slopes, too.</p><p>She and Dylan had an affinity for action movies, for cooking and...he let himself get nostalgic, even let his eyes well up with tears. Letting the memories flood him was dangerous, his mind tipping over from nostalgia to deep grief, a mourning he\u2019d only recently been able to emerge from, the slam of Jill\u2019s inheritance making him ache all over again.</p><p>His body was consumed suddenly by grief at her loss. It hadn\u2019t been running, it hadn\u2019t been skiing, it hadn\u2019t been any of Dylan\u2019s crazy antics like sky diving or parasailing that had killed Jill.</p><p>It had been one cell that mutated and mutated and mutated until finally it had taken over her body, the lymphoma wasting her away and neither of them had gotten over her death from eighteen months ago. In some ways Mike had gotten over Jill even faster than Dylan, though Dylan had been the first to go out and find somebody to sleep with. Mike hadn\u2019t gone out and broken that physical barrier yet, replacing the memory of Jill\u2019s body with someone else\u2019s \u2013 he just hadn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Eighteen months, though. It had been a long dry spell and he was getting frustrated. Now he finally felt emotionally ready to at least give this a try, and he was more than physically ready. Who knew what the hike would bring? All he knew was that he had to try, and he had to try on his own. He couldn\u2019t be the tag along with Dylan. That had complicated their relationship with Jill for far too long. It wasn\u2019t until it was too late that Mike realized that it actually hadn\u2019t mattered. He had loved Jill. Jill had loved him and they both loved Dylan. And the three of them had made it work, somehow, in their own crazy way.</p><p>Now the question was, could the three of them \u2013 this time with Laura \u2013 make it work? He was getting ahead of himself. All that mattered was having one hike with the woman. He just needed to see if this could be his future \u2013 their future.</p><p>She had never gone on a date like this \u2013 hiking? Meeting Dylan last night had been a very public affair, even if it ended in the very private way. She thought about it and realized that she needed to call in some reinforcements, so she texted Josie:</p> <p>Hey, Jose, I have a date tonight. Can you help me?</p><p>Josie texted back:</p><p>Oh, cool, the firefighter? Awesome.</p><p>Laura winced and answered:</p><p>Well, no, not the firefighter. Someone different.</p><p>What?</p><p>Yeah, it turns out I\u2019m popular on that online dating site.</p><p>Josie texted:</p><p>Hold on, I\u2019m five minutes away from your house \u2013 why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? Thought you were late for work.</p><p>I am, but who cares. You have time?</p><p>There is no way you can have that kind of date like last night and now a new date and not give me the juicy details before work.</p><p>Laura walked over to the coffee maker, put the basket in, dumped in some grounds and started what she knew was going to be the first of many cups of coffee today. As promised, Josie arrived within five minutes, barreling through the front door and plopping down her suitcase-sized purse on the kitchen table, eyes ablaze with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cYou slut!\u201d Josie said it with a tone of admiration, not condemnation, and the expression on her face was so comical it made Laura burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I just mean \u2013 damn. So, how does this work? What the hell happened with the firefighter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s married. Or has a girlfriend.\u201d Josie\u2019s face fell, shifting from eager curiosity to self-righteous anger on Laura\u2019s behalf. What a great friend. Laura almost laughed at how bulldoggish Josie looked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I woke up in his bed at three in the morning and there were pictures of her everywhere. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was his sister?\u201d Josie asked, her voice going up high, as if hopeful and as if there was a snowball\u2019s chance in hell it was true.</p><p>\u201cIn a bikini at the beach? Being kissed by him? Uh, no. Unless she\u2019s Angelina Jolie and he routinely tongue-kisses his sister \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, ewww. Point taken. So the guy is a slimeball and took you home while his girlfriend\u2019s out of town. Fucker.\u201d She rubbed Laura\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHow did you handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up, saw the pictures, freaked out on the inside but stayed quiet, got dressed and almost cried in the cab.\u201d Laura gulped a hot mouthful of coffee down.</p><p>\u201cSo you sneak home after ditching a guy in his bed, after sleeping with him within what? Three hours, four \u2013 OK, four hours of knowing him. You find out he has a girlfriend, with pictures of her plastered all over his room, so you decide you\u2019re going to come home and write him off and...now you have a date with another guy?\u201d Josie\u2019s expression was, to say the least, comical. It was like a graphic of a \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d emoticon.</p><p>Only in real life.</p><p>\u201cIt is pretty freaking amazing,\u201d Laura agreed, nodding absentmindedly as she added two spoons of sugar to her coffee. She hadn\u2019t consumed coffee with sugar since tenth grade. Since returning home from her date, though, she\u2019d been doing a lot of out-of-character things, including dating two men on the same day.</p><p>\u201cSpill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came home, was about to shower, and this guy IM\u2019d me on the dating site. I had just blocked Dylan, actually, and made sure he wasn\u2019t in my \u2018Favorites\u2019 anymore. So then Mike \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSuddenly some guy pops up in the chat window on this website and asks you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth it?\u201d That was code for whether he was attractive.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like that actor who played Thor in the movie.\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cNot fair! When do I get Captain America hitting on me?\u201d</p><p>Laura laughed and dumped her coffee, pouring a fresh cup. She started to tremble inside, the urge uncontrollable. It was all too much, too intense, and spelling it out for her best friend was making it all too real.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSki instructor,\u201d Laura mumbled as she hurried to fill her mouth with more coffee and delay the interrogation. Josie rolled her eyes.</p><p>Her friend poured herself another cup of coffee, glanced at the clock and said, \u201cOh shit, I\u2019m late for work, but I don\u2019t care, this is, this is \u2013 this is awesome! Way, way better than any movie. Plus I have a front seat view!\u201d They both winced at each other and Josie added, \u201cUh, you know what I mean. Not literally.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I\u2019m meeting your entertainment needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, what kind of life do I have? I haven\u2019t had sex in seven months. I have to live vicariously through you.\u201d</p><p>Laura snorted, \u201cWell, it serves you right after years of doing it through you. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>Josie hung her head in mock shame. \u201cWell, yeah, OK, fair enough, but lay off the years comment. I haven\u2019t gone through that many men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to dif \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your whore mouth!\u201d Josie threw half an English muffin at Laura\u2019s head and, with catlike precision, she dodged it, both women howling with laughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laura paused, thought for a moment, and said, \u201cYou know, you can open your own profile and see what pops up. To solve that seven month problem you\u2019ve got going on there.\u201d She gestured vaguely at Josie\u2019s torso.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen what pops up. You know the phrase, \u2018shit floats\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Laura just laughed. Ouch. Then again, Josie\u2019s last date had been from an online dating site. Turned out to be a sixty-year-old neocon Tea Party activist who used a Groupon for dinner and made Josie pay her half before the coupon. Capitalism at its best \u2013 he\u2019d made money off their date. And all Josie had to remind her was a lovely restraining order when the guy wouldn\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cSo when is the date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah, right after work. Mike says there\u2019s enough daylight to make the climb in ninety minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe climb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hiking. One of those hills at the state park outside of town.\u201d If Josie rolled her eyes any harder they\u2019d pop out and wander down the hallway out into the street.</p> <p>\u201cHe hikes, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a triathlete.\u201d Laura coughed, the unveiling increasingly ridiculous. Was any of this really happening?</p><p>\u201cSo wait a minute, Mr. Ski Instructor Gorgeous Triathlete Thor Lookalike chats with you for a couple minutes this morning and already tonight, you,\u201d Josie looked her up and down as if surveying her from hair down to toes, \u201cwho are about as athletic as a slug, are going on a hike to the top of one of the biggest hills outside of the city where you will eaten to death by mosquitoes, you will become sweaty and ridiculously tired and then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so flattering,\u201d Laura muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re gonna what? Climb a mountain, Laura? You have a heart attack when you can\u2019t find the remote and have to actually stand up to change the channel.\u201d That gave Laura a reason to pause. What the hell was she going to do? By the time she met up with Mike it\u2019d be six at night. He said it was a ninety minute climb to the top. Granted, it was summer so there was plenty of sunlight until nine or so. But what had she gotten herself into? Did she even own hiking boots?</p><p>Josie continued, \u201cDo you even have any shoes that are going to work with any kind of an outfit for climbing a mountain?\u201d</p> <p>Laura just stared at her as if she\u2019d been reading her mind. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to figure that out. All I know is I\u2019m kind of in a super-emotional state right now, Josie. I got an unsolicited chat yesterday morning from a hot firefighter. Went out with him to one of the trendiest restaurants in town and ended up in his bed. When I woke up, I was surrounded with pictures of a women who looked like she was a combination of a beach volleyball player and a surfer. Which I\u2019m not. Ever. At all. It will take me four lifetimes to ever be like that. I slumped out of there and then \u2013 boom! \u2013 I come home and there\u2019s a chat from another guy. I, I don\u2019t even have time to think. I don\u2019t even know what to I\u2019m supposed to think. All I know is I\u2019m just saying yes to it all. I\u2019m saying yes to life, I\u2019m saying no to doubt and I\u2019m just grabbing the brass ring and \u2013 \u201d</p><p>Josie interrupted her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re throwing out the clich\u00e9s, like you\u2019re talking a mile a minute, you won\u2019t throw out the baby with the bath water, you aren\u2019t going to count your chickens before they\u2019ve hatched, like you\u2019re ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>Josie stopped and put her hand on Laura\u2019s arm. \u201cJust be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve got condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. You...I just don\u2019t want your heart broken again. You deserve \u2013 you deserve everything that\u2019s going on right now. You certainly deserve to be able to fuck two hot guys in twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Josie wiggled her eyebrows, \u201cI would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not you, Laura. And I\u2019m just saying, be careful with that heart of yours. You \u2013 you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Laura sighed. \u201cYeah, I know what you mean.\u201d She squared her shoulders, took in a deep breath, let it out. A nice cleansing breath. \u201cI\u2019m saying yes. I\u2019m saying yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Will you buy coffee this time on our way to work? I really need a triple latte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Laura shook her head as if clearing it. What was Josie talking about?</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019re saying yes. Say yes to buying me an overpriced coffee. Say yessssssssss.....\u201d</p><p>She waved Josie off and got out of the chat window and did what every woman does in the twenty-first century after being contacted by a guy from an online dating website. She Googled him, just as she had Googled Dylan.</p><p>\u201cWow. What a strange set of results, Josie. Check this out.\u201d Her friend craned over Laura\u2019s shoulder to see the screen. Mike\u2019s name appeared over and over, followed by a bunch of numbers. Some sort of times, like a race? Wait. The Tri-state Marathon. The Sunshine Regional Triathlon. Oh, my God. He wasn\u2019t kidding.</p><p>He really was a triathlete. More than that \u2013 he was a steady, longtime triathlete. This wasn\u2019t some guy who did it once for bragging rights.</p><p>She knew that guys could shine her on, that people lied in online dating sites and they often talked about being athletic \u2013 which was code for I watch TV on Sundays when the football game is on as an excuse to eat wings.</p><p>But this guy was the real deal. Page after page \u2013 she had to go twelve pages in before she found anything other than some race time. According to the dates, this guy had been doing this for at least the past ten years. Then she found a ski resort page. He worked at the ski resort. That\u2019s what he told her, so he had been telling the truth. He was a ski instructor and first aid person. Interesting. That was as different from her life as you could possibly get. Same with Dylan.</p><p>She pushed aside thoughts of Dylan. Dylan was, as far as she was concerned, off her radar screen. He may still be lingering on her skin in that deep, sensitive part of her belly, and the scent of him might still be on her sweater \u2013 and maybe in the crook of her elbow, and behind her earlobe and \u2013</p><p>Oh stop it, Laura, just stop it. The guy had a girlfriend. He was trolling the online dating sites, probably just to find a one-night stand or because he was a sex addict or \u2013 who knew? No more Dylan. In fact, she had blocked his number on her phone, removed him from her \u201cFavorites\u201d on the online dating website, and she was 100 percent done. Just wrote him off. No more Dylan.</p><p>Mike, on the other hand \u2013 Mike was new. Fresh. Untainted. What could she learn from Mike? Some protective voice inside her said, Are you a complete and utter moron? You\u2019re going to go at twilight, during dusk, and walk a multi-mile trail in the woods with some guy you\u2019ve never met yet \u2013 are you crazy?</p><p>Josie knocked her out of her reverie. \u201cHe seems interesting. I\u2019m trying to imagine you running a \u2013 \u201d Josie gasped, \u201c \u2013 marathon.\u201d Wheezy laughter. \u201cUh...I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just lost your free latte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me, I\u2019m a fast metabolizer of caffeine \u2013 that\u2019s what my genetic testing showed me. You have to get me one! This \u2013 \u201d she pointed to the cup of coffee Laura had just made her \u2013 \u201cisn\u2019t enough!\u201d She mooned a begging face.</p><p>\u201cDid your genetic testing show that you consume enough caffeine to mimic a sun-addled mosquito on crack every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did.\u201d Josie nodded soberly. \u201cAnd so therefore, that explains why I need you to buy me a triple latte, Miss I\u2019m Going to Say Yes to Life.\u201d Josie frowned, \u201cSo was the sex any good last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Why are you asking me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re talking about saying \u2018yes,\u2019 so it seemed like a natural segue...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it was good.\u201d Laura rolled her eyes, her chest heaving a bit as she sighed deeply. \u201cToo good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, too good? Is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s too good when it turns out he has a girlfriend. He was just, phew \u2013 oh boy, Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d Josie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she sighed heavily. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pictures made it clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Well, maybe you can say \u2018yes\u2019 to this guy you\u2019re seeing tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Huff, huff, huff. Laura was more out of shape then she\u2019d ever imagined. Her idea of exercise was lifting her hand from her mouth to the bag of Doritos or lifting the spoon out of the pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. No, she chided herself, that wasn\u2019t really true. She took the stairs at work, and that wasn\u2019t a joke, considering the fact that she worked on the thirty-second floor. And she and Josie power walked around her neighborhood (Josie jokingly called it their Mugging Prevention Program), but this kind of sustained, prolonged effort that used muscles that involved the hard work of uneven terrain, hiking along the trails and the woods? This she wasn\u2019t used to.</p><p>And that was OK. Really. Mike was a sweetheart who slowed his pace down and who was absolutely, fantastically interesting. Talking about everything from books that Laura hadn\u2019t read since college, but had always loved, to movies \u2013 who knew he had a Christopher Guest obsession, too? She couldn\u2019t wait for a second date where they could sit and watch Best in Show, and she could enjoy having that someone finally who appreciated the humor.</p><p>Second date? She was getting ahead of herself.</p><p>And she really liked that.</p><p>\u201cLaura, are you OK?\u201d Mike asked, a look of concern covering his face as she wheezed slightly while rounding a bend and staring at the tall hill leading to the summit. Too tall. Too high. Too little air. Ah, hell. What had she agreed to? Huff huff huff.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied. \u201cJust not used to these tall hills. I\u2019m more accustomed to doing eleven street blocks downtown while carrying my morning latte. Not hiking up a steep mountain while carrying a stainless steel water bottle. I\u2019m adjusting, though \u2013 I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a good sport you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be. I don\u2019t think I have the oxygen to run away.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed in unison and Laura felt a warmth spreading through her. She couldn\u2019t quite believe the way that the past two days had gone. First, she\u2019d had an absolutely amazing date with Dylan. She could still feel him on her skin, even though she had slunk out of his apartment like a sorority girl sophomore learning how to navigate the world of one-night stands. Then again, it wasn\u2019t exactly her fault that he had pictures of his girlfriend all over the place; funny how that killed the mood. All of that was (hours) behind her, for now here was this golden boy, smiling at her and standing there like Thor at the gates of Asgard, taking her on a hike. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike was about as opposite of Dylan as you could possibly get. Tall \u2013 if he was shorter than 6\u20185\u201d she\u2019d be surprised \u2013 blonde, maybe Danish, with piercing blue eyes and the lanky body of a thirty-something guy who walked like he was seventeen and still a little awkward. Just looking at his body told her he was a true athlete, and he had told her himself he was a ski instructor, so obviously he was coordinated, toned and balanced, and could move with fluidity and grace whether they were hiking, skiing, or...in bed?</p><p>She, on the other hand, felt like a giant cotton ball right now. A sweaty, huffing cotton ball. Who wanted nothing more than to relax in a hammock with a pitcher of sangrias.</p><p>And an oxygen tank.</p><p>Yet here she was, about a quarter mile from the summit of some crazy-ass hill that he wanted her to climb to the top of. She could expand her horizons. This was something new. He was sweet, quiet, kind of taciturn \u2013 but not in a bad way. Nothing was awkward. Nothing was uncomfortable. He was just was a man who didn\u2019t talk too much. He preferred, obviously, to act, to stretch, to move \u2013 to move up that damn hill. Which she now stared at as if she were looking at the top of Mount Everest.</p> <p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re really going to climb up that?\u201d she asked, trying to keep the skepticism out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cYep, we really are!\u201d he grinned. \u201cBut,\u201d he patted the log next to him where he\u2019d sat down, stretching out his long legs, his arms toned and golden, eyes kind and nervous. \u201cWe can take a short break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA short break?\u201d Eek. She didn\u2019t mean to sound so overwhelmed, but if she paused, took a deep breath, and did an inner inventory, she had to admit that this hike was killing her. This may be her true walk of shame, especially if Mike had to call 911 and have her hauled down this mountain on a hand-held stretcher. With her luck, Dylan would be the paramedic on call.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about Dylan!</p><p>\u201cOK, a long break.\u201d His hearty laugh put her at ease. What was most comfortable, though, was what he didn\u2019t say \u2013 how he just moved from laughter to quiet, the silence self-composed and genuine. He wasn\u2019t shifting around or twitching in his own skin. He just wasn\u2019t going to say anything if he didn\u2019t have anything to say, and yet his nonverbal communication was calm and sweet. Mike was just there, with Laura, and the two were spending time together. That was enough.</p> <p>She liked this. It was new. Time and space were enough, and as the seconds unfolded gradually into minutes, the minutes now more than an hour, she felt like she was spending time in a bubble with this new man, learning an entire new language of mindfulness.</p><p>\u201cWhew,\u201d she said, collapsing on the log next to him, trying to suck in her belly at the same time as her hamstrings cried out in relief.</p><p>Laura suddenly felt like a complete ass, her calm focus from just seconds ago vanquished, replaced by a self-consciousness that was most unwelcome. Not exactly experienced with dates like this, she\u2019d overdressed and now, many miles into this hike, she was dripping with sweat, her hair limp and plastered against the edges of her face, her body flushed with the heat and the exertion of this trek up this crazy tall hill. She felt about as feminine as a wet tissue and yet that kernel of woman in her did have a spark of femininity, because she was responding to Mike in ways that shocked her.</p><p>Her body should have been spent from the night with Dylan. Rather than finding herself halting or tentative, it was as if what she had done with Dylan the night before had opened her up like a flower blossoming, giving permission to show its true colors and to spread itself in full glory \u2013 and right now, Laura was ready to spread herself again.</p><p>Easy, girl, she told herself as she stole another look at Mike.</p><p>What was it about these two? Dylan was incredible last night and yet she\u2019d already crossed him off her mental list of eligible partners because the guy obviously had a girlfriend \u2013 or, worse, a wife. Who keeps the pictures of some gorgeous woman all over the place in their bedroom otherwise? And now here she was, less than fifteen hours after sneaking out of Dylan\u2019s house and heading home for what she thought would be a nice, big cry and a pint of ice cream, finding herself with yet another incredibly hopeful relationship staring her in the face.</p> <p>Literally. She looked up and realized that Mike was watching her, his head cocked to the side, a little half grin making him look boyish and absolutely adorable. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Laura?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d she stammered, completely unwilling to tell him what she was really thinking. \u201cOh, I was just marveling at how beautiful it is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s amazing isn\u2019t it?\u201d Was he staring at her to tell her that those words had a double meaning? She felt shy, suddenly, and tucked a clump of wet hair behind her ear, feeling her face flush with bashfulness. A rising heat between her legs didn\u2019t help, either. Her body was telling her that they were alone, out in the woods, he was gorgeous and attentive, and \u2013</p><p>\u201cSo you work here?\u201d She forced herself to ask the question, to break her thought loop out of its rush, because if she didn\u2019t, pretty soon she would just plain old jump him.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah in the winter, but I just thought I\u2019d bring you up here on a hike right now, because the canyon looks so much better. Different \u2013 when it\u2019s not covered with snow and skiers. Actually it\u2019s kinda nice to be here when I\u2019m not on duty and worrying about some teenager who breaks a leg or some eight year old who can\u2019t grab the tow rope properly and gets dragged up the hill.\u201d He chuckled and she joined him. That was the most she had heard out of his mouth in one continuous stretch since she\u2019d met him.</p><p>He seemed so good-natured, didn\u2019t talk much, was kind of quiet \u2013 and she liked that way more than she ever would have imagined. It was really different from Dylan, who was so gregarious, open and extroverted. There was a quiet depth to Mike that she found refreshing. Most guys she\u2019d met on the dating site were either out for a piece of ass or to just sit there on a date and talk themselves up. Nobody had ever asked her out on a hiking date and she was starting to realize that this guy was different, this guy was special \u2013 and she hoped she was special enough for him.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d he said, grabbing her arm suddenly, the pressure of his fingers more urgent than arousing. \u201cLook!\u201d he hissed, pointing into the woods. She leaned into him, craning her head to see what he was pointing to, taking advantage of the moment to get that much closer, to cross the silent boundary between them and to bridge the gap in those first seconds of contact that you never get back.</p><p>She could smell him this close and he smelled like pine and sweat and something more \u2013 a sporty musk that seemed to turn on her inner sensors, making her instantly flushed, a lump forming in her throat that told her that there was definitely a spark of chemistry here. An inner bliss poured into her veins, channeling through her, making every pore hum and relax as she reveled in the newness of Mike.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere \u2013 do you see it?\u201d Two deer stood deep in the woods munching on the bark of a tree. The mother perked her head up, turned to her fawn, and looked back at Laura and Mike with a precision only animals could possess. The doe nudged her baby and the two ran off into the woods, not so much scared as careful. You never know about humans; they\u2019re just as likely to be friend as foe, and Laura understood. Goodbye, little Mama, she thought.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Laura said. \u201cThat\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d A quick glance showed he was watching the animals as intently as she was, yet also attuned to the tension between them, now shifting from the sheer simplicity of first contact to a journey of unspoken communication. Blood pulsed through her, beating a rhythm of questions she hoped he could feel and that, in turn, he could decipher. I want you, it said, and the greatest hope inside her was that his return beat would be the message, I want you, too.</p><p>The pressure of his fingers lightened, shifting from a grab of urgency to a lingering touch that asked a question his mouth couldn\u2019t \u2013 or wouldn\u2019t \u2013 ask. Two seconds, Laura, she told herself, two seconds to just start to breathe before turning and looking at him. Was that his return beat? The feel of his fingertips was agonizingly puzzling, for it could mean nothing or, if she was right, it could mean everything.</p><p>When she turned, body perked like the doe\u2019s, heightened by animal instinct, he saw it in his eyes, too, as Mike leaned down and took her lips with his.</p><p>Bringing Laura up here had been a dicey move. He hadn\u2019t really thought much about his request to make a first date out of a hike, but then again he wasn\u2019t exactly Mr. Suave. And this was his life, so sharing it with someone upfront made a certain kind of sense to him. Get reality out of the way and if the other person still wanted to see him, then great. If not, they didn\u2019t waste their time and could move on. If only everything were so simple. Dating, so far, hadn\u2019t been, no matter how hard he tried to make it cut and dried.</p><p>He found solace \u2013 he found peace \u2013 he found meaning and fun and even excitement in the woods, on the slopes, on a long run. When he ran, his mind turned off and something deeper turned on. An awareness of being that he only got from the pounding of his soles against the pavement, against the dirt, on the trail.</p><p>Most people didn\u2019t like the way he lived. It was too different, too quiet, too introspective and too focused on doing and not focused enough on talking or posturing or obvious displays of status or of involvement in things that just didn\u2019t matter to him. He wanted to move. He wanted to run. He wanted to ski. He wanted to help people.</p><p>And to his surprise, as he\u2019d reached adulthood, he\u2019d found that there weren\u2019t many women, or men for that matter, who valued that. He watched Laura closely and had liked what he saw. She wasn\u2019t an outdoors type but she was gamely marching on up this hill; he could tell she wasn\u2019t a hiker. He could tell she wasn\u2019t the type who would, on her own, take the initiative and go for a long bike or a run or a swim. She certainly wasn\u2019t a triathlete, but she had a gentleness about her and openness and a willingness to just be that he didn\u2019t find in many people.</p><p>He didn\u2019t find it in any people other than, strangely enough, Dylan \u2013 and then in Jill. And so when he leaned in to kiss Laura, he surprised himself; that was the last thing he expected he would do on a first date. He wasn\u2019t exactly the kind of guy who wined and dined women, and yet this felt right. It felt perfect.</p><p>Something in him deepened as their mouths met, as he reached for her, as he claimed those curves for his own. In that moment, he rose up and a finesse, a sophistication that he knew was there but buried very deep, surged to the surface. This woman was his, in his arms as she softened, opening up to him, their tongues intertwining. He would definitely not be just sharing this woman with Dylan. They would be partners with this woman.</p><p>Arousal burst through his veins, like a pump turned on, a switch flipped, with a sudden explosion of want and need and lust. Hungry for more of her in his hands, on his lips, against his body, he searched her, like going on a journey through another person\u2019s land, and found that his need to explore was absolutely endless. His erection pressed against her leg as she leaned into him pushing, searching, wanting. The two joined in an obvious mutual exploration that made him wish he had asked her to his cabin for dinner so that a bed were handy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then his mind slipped into that place it went when he ran, when he skied, when he hiked. He had never been able to access that part of himself through anything but heavy exertion or laser-like focus on the kinesthetics of life, but here, here he found himself shifting. A subtle and then suddenly dramatic movement from one layer of life to another.</p><p>As her hands roamed over his shoulders, felt his back, tightened over his waist and went elsewhere, he filled with a warmth, with an urgency that eighteen months of grief and denial and restraint and constraint had allowed to grow into something so strong, something so big that it was in their kiss, and her touch unleashed it, here and now.</p><p>It just was. Endless and timeless and present, exactly as it had been with Jill.</p><p>But more.</p> <p>Oh, my God, what was she doing? She still had Dylan\u2019s taste in the back of her throat, Dylan\u2019s scent on parts of her skin in spite of her thorough shower this morning, Dylan\u2019s essence deep inside her \u2013 and here she was in the arms of another man. A godlike, amazing, muscular man. She felt his warmth underneath his clothes and wanted desperately to feel his skin without the layer between them.</p><p>How could this be happening? How could two incredible men want her and within twenty-four hours of each other? This was...her mind went blank as Mike probed her mouth, his tongue filled with more questions and answers, his hands thick and strong, grabbing and caressing and owning parts of her. Her own questions faded, melted into the warm wetness of his mouth and she knew, just knew on some deep level, some layer within herself that she didn\u2019t even know she had, that this was so much more than she ever anticipated when that little chat window had popped up this morning.</p><p>Thank whatever higher power she was supposed to thank for that little chat window.</p><p>His hot breath filled her and then cool air touched her lips as he pulled away. The sound of his deep breath, an intentional, centering breath that she recognized instantly, filled her with uncertainty. Was he having second thoughts? All these extra curves weren\u2019t exactly accessories she figured were standard features on the women Mike normally dated. Those were the weekend yoga babes, the women who competed in mini-triathlons for fun and who went on 100-mile weekend bike rides just because. They were a different kind of woman than Laura. Hell, they might as well have been a different species. What would Mike want with her, with all her soft rolls and overflowing cups and dimples and apple cheeks and \u2013</p><p>Had she gone too far in kissing him? Wait a minute, now \u2013 he was the one who initiated the kiss. He had kissed her. She had nothing to worry about; she done nothing premature. C\u2019mon, Laura, she thought to herself, just stop this. This is crazy. Her old insecurities flooded her as she tipped her head down, averting his eyes, his hand still on her shoulders, one trailing a lazy path down the side of her rib cage, brushing briefly against her breast.</p> <p>He let go of her shoulder and reached up to her chin, tipping it, forcing her to meet his eyes. What she saw there told her everything she needed to know. She laughed nervously, \u201cI don\u2019t normally do this, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d His voice was smoky with need. It had changed. The affable, slightly awkward man she\u2019d started this hike with had suddenly evolved into a determined, commanding, dominant man.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t normally go on long hikes with guys and then kiss them before we reach the summit. Typically, I wait until we get to the top.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOK, then I have something to look forward to. Come on.\u201d He pointed to the trail head.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cAll right, if you insist.\u201d</p><p>He held his hand out in a gesture of chivalry, \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise?\u201d she asked, the word popping out of her mouth before she could take it back.</p><p>He cocked one eyebrow, a lascivious look, \u201cOh, you can count on it.\u201d</p><p>What was she doing basically promising this guy that she was going to have sex with him when they reached the top of the mountain? Earth to Laura! She had to laugh at herself on the inside, trying to hide the racing thoughts from Mike. The pounding of her inner voice was so strong, so loud and so pervasive that she feared everything going on inside her head was so obvious that he could read her.</p><p>As he took her hand, intertwining their fingers, and they walked slowly at Laura\u2019s pace up to the top, she felt herself tip over. This was something new and this was something good and she wasn\u2019t going to let that ridiculous doubting voice inside her ruin it.</p><p>With each step she felt her energy rebound, her heart rate steadying and her body finding some sort of equilibrium to keep pumping herself up, to manage the trail and to climb higher. Perhaps it was the excitement of Mike\u2019s kiss, his proximity, of the promise of something more when they reached their goal. Silly though it seemed, that made her live in the moment, and when they finally reached the end, the view really was otherworldly.</p><p>So was Mike\u2019s touch.</p><p>Just don\u2019t sleep with him, that little voice chided her. Don\u2019t be that kind of woman. Wait one more date. In some ways, she hated that voice, but this time it really was right. Sleeping with Mike this soon after Dylan would seem crass. Over the top. Unfair to Mike.</p><p>Unfair to her. She needed a few days off from everyone to just think this through. Of course, she\u2019d never see Dylan again. That was a done deal. However, she still had unresolved feelings for him, and that meant clearing her mind. Couldn\u2019t do that with Mike\u2019s tongue in her mouth.</p> <p>Or his dick in her \u2013</p><p>\u201cHey? That\u2019s an interesting look. What\u2019s going on in that mind of yours?\u201d Talk about a loaded question. Laura struggled to answer. He peered at her, seemed to really study her, and it was as if he knew. Knew what she was thinking, understood the demons she wrestled with, and was being respectful \u2013 but still curious. If it weren\u2019t 100 percent impossible for him to have any idea about her date with Dylan last night (this morning) she would have thought he was giving her space to think things through.</p><p>That was just crazy, though.</p><p>His arm reached for her, pulled her into his embrace, her back to his chest, and he settled in, holding her as if they\u2019d done this a million times. Inhaling deeply, she relaxed into the hold, feeling like they had done this forever. How could this be? Why did she feel so settled with him already \u2013 and yet so excited to get to know him, all at the same time? She examined his forearms, bare and wrapped around her ribs and chest. Light, sandy hair dotted the arms, which were deeply freckled, though the spots were light. A few scars, but nothing that spoke of severe trauma. No ring, and no tell-tale white skin where a ring normally resided. He did wear an old-fashioned friendship bracelet, the kind she hadn\u2019t seen since she was a young teen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d She fingered the thin, braided band, faded from red and blue to a pale pink and blah-ish grey color. Changing the subject might help her escape more scrutiny about her thoughts.</p><p>He tensed, his wrist starting to pull back, and then he paused, taking a deep breath that she felt against her back. How rare, she thought. A man who took the handful of seconds to consider his actions, to be deliberate. Whatever response he was about to give her, she knew, would be forthright and honest, coming from a deep center she wanted to touch.</p><p>\u201cAn old friend gave that to me.\u201d She could feel him swallow, could sense the unspoken. Someone very, very special.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been beaten up and seems to have gone through a lot, but looks well-loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was she.\u201d Laura stopped breathing. His voice had gone quiet, the words a whoosh out of his lungs, like something he couldn\u2019t control but that he could barely stand to say. The mood had shifted abruptly, her innocent questions something she normally would wish she could take back, would normally berate herself for asking, for making everything awkward with one simple piece of chit chat.</p><p>Except she wasn\u2019t. Regretful. Asking that question may damn well have been the best choice she\u2019d made all day, because she got a glimpse into a very, intensely private man and his profound nature was revealed, even in a tiny sliver.</p><p>This was what she wanted. And Dylan. Go away, Dylan! she chided no one \u2013 the voice in her head \u2013 as if he himself had invaded her thoughts. Why was she experiencing this strange duality, in Mike\u2019s arms and feeling his pain for someone he\u2019d once loved all while thinking about a man she\u2019d been with last night \u2013 one with a hidden significant other?</p><p>It was madness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mike said, stepping back and turning her around. His eyes were sincere and warm, tinged with nostalgia and troubled. \u201cMentioning her is the last thing I should do on dates. Talking about a past girlfriend isn\u2019t exactly part of the blueprint for a successful new relationship.\u201d</p><p>Relationship? Did he say relationship? Laura\u2019s heart sang.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI understand. You loved her. You can\u2019t separate that from who you are and what you feel in any given moment.\u201d</p><p>He flinched but kept eye contact, obviously shocked by her words. Had she said the wrong thing? Her usual insecurity was gone, replaced by a steadfast calm. Whatever she said, it had been from the heart, and that is all that really counted.</p><p>How could she read him so well? Freakishly well. He felt like a complete idiot for talking about Jill right now, and yet somehow Laura made it seem fine. Natural. Like another extension of himself, just a perfectly typical part of life. Against all hope he had thought there might \u2013 just might \u2013 be a woman like this out there for him and Dylan. Someone sweet and nice and understanding and accepting. Not quite convinced she was out there, he had basically given up, and now Dylan had found her on a damn online dating site, of all places. The kind of place where men trolled for sex.</p><p>Dylan, though, had been seeking something more. And now here \u201cmore\u201d was, standing before him, telling him that who he was was totally fine. That talking about his dead girlfriend was OK because it was how he felt.</p><p>What had he done to deserve this \u2013 and how could he keep it all going?</p><p>Pulling her into his arms, he kissed her again, this time with more urgency and a deeper acceptance. Less questioning, more certainty. Was he imagining that she felt it, too? Her lips were less tentative, more confident, as her tongue slipped in and did its own claiming, her hands pressing against his shoulder blades and pushing him into her, her hips lifting up against his. She was shorter than he was used to, a good foot smaller than he, but her curves were addictive, his hands wanting to touch every inch of flesh, especially the expanse from the soft spot where her ass and thigh met up through to her breasts. Handfuls of Laura and her little sighs of pleasure made him harden even more \u2013 if that were possible \u2013 and by God, if they weren\u2019t heading toward dusk on a mountain where it wasn\u2019t safe to be unprotected at night, he\u2019d have spent the next five hours devouring her, right here, right now.</p><p>However, if they stayed, the bears might very well do the devouring, so with great reluctance he pulled back, cradling her face in his hands, smiling down at her lovely, flushed cheeks, those eyes eager and bright. \u201cWe need to go down the mountain now before it gets dark.\u201d He pressed his forehead against hers and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. \u201cI wish...\u201d He couldn\u2019t finish his thought, too overwhelmed by the crushing chaos of turbulence inside him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, making his head bob slightly, in turn triggering a grin on his lips. \u201cThat would be an inauspicious first date. \u2018Woman eaten by bear.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you assume the bear would eat you?\u201d He laughed and opened his eyes. She was looking at him with a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have more body fat and you can run faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would help you climb a tree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuys do that so they have an excuse to stare at our asses.\u201d</p><p>He craned his head behind her body and looked down. \u201cI don\u2019t need an excuse.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and looked up, a tight, amused smile on her lips. Had he gone too far? \u201cFirst date?\u201d she said. She seemed to be forcing herself to make eye contact.</p><p>Puzzled, he frowned. \u201cUh, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat implies there might...\u201d</p> <p>\u201c...be a second?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to you, Laura.\u201d</p><p>Not telling Dylan about Laura really was going to kill him, but he needed this second date to confirm his suspicions. When he came out of his bedroom and found Dylan hunched over his laptop, naked except for his boxer briefs, shoulders curled and face staring intently at the screen as he chowed down a bowl of cereal, Mike couldn\u2019t help himself. He snickered.</p><p>Dylan practically climbed the walls, startling, his face panicked and body spidery with a fight-or-flight stance. \u201cWhat the fuck, Mike? Why do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCreep up on people like that!\u201d He had one hand on his heart. \u201cFucking gave me a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t do anything weird. I walked into my own kitchen to grab breakfast. You\u2019re the freak. Why are you in another world?\u201d A quick glance at the screen gave him his answer: the online dating site.</p><p>With Laura\u2019s picture and profile.</p><p>Fuck. Suppressing his jealousy, Mike opened the fridge door and grabbed a half gallon of milk to pour a glass as he popped two pieces of bread in the toaster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2013 ah, hell, I guess I\u2019m stalking Laura.\u201d A rush of protectiveness hit Mike in the solar plexus like a punch. He knew Dylan wasn\u2019t going to harm her. Knew it was just because Dylan was crazy about her. Knew all that.</p><p>Still reacted.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought she blocked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did. Wait \u2013 I told you that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I made a new account and am trying that way.\u201d</p><p>Mike blinked. The toast popped. Dylan returned his attention to the screen. As Mike grabbed peanut butter, he asked, \u201cSo you created a new identity to try to trick her into talking to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My new account says it\u2019s me. I\u2019m not that crazy.\u201d</p><p>Yes, you are, Mike thought. Almost said it. Held back. Smearing the peanut butter, he shredded the toast with too much force, making the piece collapse and slime his hand and wrist with nut butter. What a mess.</p><p>Yeah. What a mess.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried she\u2019s going to be creeped out by you? I mean, she blocked you. Case closed. Move on.\u201d</p><p>Dylan shook his head and sighed, his six pack folding in and then out, the muscles rippling up through his chest. Mike admired it with a contentment, like looking at fine art. He didn\u2019t need to touch it; just seeing it was satisfying enough. Knowing it was there when he wanted it sufficed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Dylan. Any woman would be freaked if some guy went around chasing her like this. You tried messages on her old account. She blocked you. You tried calling \u2013 same. Now you\u2019re getting unhinged.\u201d</p><p>Beep-blip! \u201cWoot!\u201d Dylan shouted. \u201cShe\u2019s responding!\u201d</p><p>Mike rushed across the room to see. A swirl of good and bad mixed within him, for if she wanted Dylan again, would she stop seeing Mike? Or, hope against hope, would she consider seeing them both?</p><p>Please leave me alone, she wrote. Mike couldn\u2019t contain a snort of laughter. Dylan scowled.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Schadenfreude aside, Mike\u2019s inner thoughts mirrored Dylan\u2019s, because in the end while this was amusing, watching Dylan twist in the wind, the fact that he wanted to share Laura meant that somehow he had to find a way to make her see his partner again, to clear up whatever misunderstanding had developed that one night they\u2019d been together.</p><p>Of course, Dylan couldn\u2019t know that Mike was dating her \u2013 man, when had this become so complicated?</p><p>When you asked her out, Dumbass.</p><p>Oh. Yeah.</p><p>\u201cHow many messages have you sent her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHIRTY-FOUR?\u201d Mike howled with laughter now, unable to hold back, leaning against the counter and spilling the last bit of milk in the half gallon carton as it toppled over, sideways, then plummeted to the tiled floor. \u201cShit!\u201d he shouted, grabbing a hand towel and bending down to clean it up.</p><p>\u201cIs that a metaphor?\u2019 Dylan muttered, typing something in the chat window.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d Mike split his attention between the milk mess and Dylan\u2019s mess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking her to meet me for coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chianti and fava beans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Dylan\u2019s glare turned from simple annoyance to a simmering fury. OK. Mike knew when to let up. Half a minute later and the milk was cleaned up; time to get out of the house and let Dylan find his way through his heartache. He had a date tonight.</p><p>One that required some serious planning to pull off. What was Laura thinking right now, facing her own screen as Dylan tried again and again to talk to her? Was she scared? Intrigued? Pissed? She kept turning him down, and that didn\u2019t bode well for a future triad.</p><p>All Mike could do now was \u201cwow\u201d her with tonight\u2019s date. He left half-naked, brooding Dylan to find his way through her roadblocks, the man grousing about all the ways he might have screwed up on their date.</p><p>Same mountain, new date. Or, it seemed like the same mountain. They all seemed the same to her as her vision blurred, her veins unaccustomed to blood pumping this hard through her body for any reason other than sheer arousal.</p><p>Arousal was an issue here, though, too.</p><p>The view from the top of the mountain was breathtaking and Laura probably would\u2019ve appreciated it more if her attention weren\u2019t completely focused on Mike. He was all she wanted to watch as he surprised her. He\u2019d carried a back pack at his side through much of the walk. Not wearing \u2013 just carrying it. And now like some sort of a magician\u2019s hat, he pulled out a blanket, two bottles of red wine, a couple of glasses, a container filled with five or six different kinds of cheese, most of them names she couldn\u2019t pronounce, and a set of grapes and strawberries, a couple of them chocolate covered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d surprise us with a light dinner.\u201d He smiled shyly. \u201cI\u2019m too much of a gentleman to take a woman out and not feed her at least something. I may have dragged you along for this crazy hike and ruin my chances at the second date, but I\u2019m at least you can\u2019t say we didn\u2019t have dinner.\u201d</p><p>She surveyed the layout before her. Some sort of a camping blanket; thin, but well-worn. Actual stemware, wine glasses that he kept in a special case. And as he inserted the cork screw into the first bottle of wine, and very deftly opened it, she sampled one of the cheeses.</p><p>\u201cMmm, sheep\u2019s cheese?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cYes! You can tell from the taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hot damn! Who knew I\u2019d find someone who knows their fromage?\u201d he said, biting his lower lip, and smiling and nodding at the same time, as if he quietly celebrated a minor success.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cwho knew?\u201d Her face shifted in an expression of wistfulness, of serenity, of being very much in the moment.</p><p>She felt she could breathe around him, that she could appreciate each breath. And as he handed her the glass of red wine, she sniffed it, then took a sip. \u201cThis is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGuess what kind of wine this is.\u201d</p><p>She surveyed the bouquet, sniffing a couple of times, lapped at the red wine very ostentatiously, took a zip, and looked at him grandly, with as much pretension she could muster, and declared, \u201cIt\u2019s red.\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter. \u201cHow sophisticated.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSorry. I may know something about cheese, but I know nothing, absolutely nothing, about wine. But I like this.\u201d She reached for his hand as they stood and stared out at the valley. \u201cI like this a lot.\u201d</p><p>His warm palm closed over her shoulder and he looked down at her, standing a full foot above her frame, his neck leaning toward her, his face an inch away. \u201cYeah. I like it a lot too.\u201d</p><p>Making love outside, in the fresh air, had never been part of her bucket list. In fact, it was more a part of her anti-bucket list; bright light, no covers, on the hard ground? Who would find that appealing?</p><p>Uh, her. Right here. Right now.</p><p>As Mike stared at her, eyes burning with an intensity she fell into, an abyss of wanting, she found herself startlingly interested in trying this new experience. Was this why he had gone to so much trouble \u2013 the wine, the special blanket, the fromagerie of cheeses and such? It dawned on her that he wasn\u2019t just being a sweetheart, giving her a lovely, gourmet picnic for their second date.</p><p>As a matter of fact, what they had eaten was just an appetizer.</p><p>She was the entree.</p><p>His kiss wasn\u2019t a surprise; what shocked her most was the preternatural urge that welled up, unbidden, as his hands seized her ass and hips, his body knowing exactly what \u2013 and who \u2013 it wanted. He shifted, like he had on their first date, from a mild-mannered, lanky, zen-like dude to a ferocious, sexual alpha male.</p><p>And she \u2013 she \u2013 had triggered all that. It excited her almost more than his touch, the way his tongue conquered hers, how his palms were greedy for so much of her skin, his chest pressed into hers, the thick outline of his erection in such stark relief against her inner thigh she could probably sculpt it out of clay from memory. When he urged her, gently, to kneel, then recline, on the blanket, she knew her outdoor sex cherry was about to be popped, and the inner burst of need that felt like a thin membrane of restraint about to give way told her she was more than ready to bare all before nature.</p><p>\u201cMmmmmmmm,\u201d she sighed. His mouth moved from hers, hands tracing patterns of lust and hold on her breasts, as if he were memorizing the terrain, his flattened palm stealing down her ribcage as his lips caressed her neck. She had worn a skirt today a just in case move that she was grateful for, now, because the easy access meant that this would be so much simpler, more direct, less complicated.</p><p>Like Mike.</p><p>And, thankfully, she had shaved. Landscaped, if you will. Going nearly bald had been a new experience, the little landing strip like a giant, glowing neon sign pointing to her clit. She almost smiled to herself; would he like it? Hate it? Not care?</p><p>Barely functioning nerves kicked in and she couldn\u2019t turn off the lopping thoughts, the cluster of fears and insecurities, even with this gorgeous athlete\u2019s hands greedily touching every part of her, even as his lips brushed her abdomen, her hands in his hair and \u2013 oh! He was going... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The smooth, cold feeling of her skirt sliding up her thighs felt like butter melting on hot flesh as a light breeze blew up to her V, centered on the little bit of hair under her postage-stamp thong. She shivered and he nearly growled, his face about to descend on her womanhood, his eyelids heavy and his hands communicating his own, barely-controlled need. A deep sigh from him as his hands roamed up her torso told her more than words, that he was enjoying this, that her body was his and fine and enough.</p><p>As he slid the thin string of her thong down her legs she worried they were too plump, too full, too \u2013 and then, oh wow, he gently kissed her labia, a soft touch like a promise, so profound she nearly came in his mouth, the thought and feel of this giant, gentle man wanting her such a balm. A quick flash of Dylan \u2013 would he never leave her thoughts? \u2013 nearly ruined the moment for her, but she pushed him away and let Mike continue, surrendered to what was before her.</p><p>A man who very much desired her \u2013 and who was showing it, touch by touch.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh!\u201d she whispered, his hands slipping between her ass and the blanket, her naked bottom half exposed for the sun and clouds and sky to view unfettered. Modesty disappeared under the sun\u2019s rays in their secluded spot, and the knowledge that here, miles from anything that could judge her, they just were two people enjoying each others\u2019 bodies and minds. Muscled arms pressed in the right places, his fingertips gently folding back her labia and his hot breath teasing her just before his tongue did its dance, flicking against the tender, red skin that craved his mouth so much.</p><p>She bloomed with lust, every pulse of energy focused on her womanhood as he sucked her clit, slowly extracting the release within, entering and pulling back with two perfect fingers as he seemed to know exactly what to do to make her build to a climax. This wasn\u2019t some shy guy who didn\u2019t know his way around a woman\u2019s body; she couldn\u2019t control her shaking legs, a sign she was getting so close and, moreso, that he was a master at triggering a woman\u2019s touch points, making the different parts fall into place for the grand finale.</p><p>Letting go was so hard, but at one point Mike\u2019s hand came up and touched her hip bone, the simple, non-sexual gesture a symbol of a bond here \u2013 that this wasn\u2019t just sex, but it was something more. A connection. She looked down \u2013 something she never, ever did during oral sex \u2013 and her hands found their way into his hair again, her eyes wide open as she took in the cloud formations, the shine of sunlight on the side of the mountain, the lush greenery, the quality of the light and the chirping of birds. They were just mammals who were part of nature, yet so much more.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please!\u201d The words came out of her so abruptly she nearly pulsated as she came, her pussy walls slamming against each other as the orgasm hit her without warning. She groaned, pelvis grinding into his mouth and tongue, which danced maddeningly right where she needed it most. Then he lapped her, enlarging the surface area of his amazing tongue, changing between flat and pointed to tweak every pixel of flesh he could. Feeling both sensations led to a screaming rush as a huge, muscular wave tightened every part of her, her dripping hole clinging to his finger, fucking his face, his tongue eagerly catching up to her clit.</p><p>\u201cNo! Keep going!\u201d she groaned, hands curling into fists of orgasm, her pussy crammed into his tongue as she hissed, \u201cYou are so \u2013 oh, Mike!\u201d The vortex of lust, the churn of hope and disbelief and pleasure, didn\u2019t stop and she didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel so much so fast, his fingers strumming her and his tongue licking exactly what she wanted and where she needed, the blanket beneath her ass soaked, his breath coming in little pants now as she imagined he was ready to explode, too.</p><p>Keeping her pussy on his tongue, he maintained a steady pace, little laps followed by faster, eager strokes, tonguing her, working to extract every last bit as she came and came and came, comfortable enough to let her face contort and her body twist as she reveled in what he could do to her. One deep, full-body clench as she closed her eyes so hard she saw fireworks behind them and she was done, the peak ended, her prayers nearly silent, the breath leaving her body.</p><p>He grinned, then climbed up her body, his long, lanky runner\u2019s frame a muscled wall as he made his journey up to her. One hot kiss full of her taste made her red and engorged again, her clit tightening so much she came right there from just a kiss, her hips pushing into him, her own musk covering her lips, her nose, the intoxicating odor so powerful that she couldn\u2019t believe she was coming again. What kind of man could do this to her?</p><p>This kind.</p><p>Frantic hands that didn\u2019t feel like hers, but were, pulled at his waist. She wanted him in her now. Preliminaries first, of course \u2013 she had to give him some attention, too, as a wildflower patch nearly mingled with a low breeze to send an incredible, heady rush of pollen and perfume their way. Freeing him, she gasped.</p><p>She looked down at his cock, pausing a moment to really appreciate it, rising up to meet her.</p><p>\u201cLaura,\u201d he said, his voice gravelly and tight.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Then he reached for her and in one fluid movement stripped off her shirt, his eyes lighting up as her skin shone in the light. She hunched her shoulders forward, a bit embarrassed to be so exposed in bright, unrelenting sunshine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, his hands cupping her breasts, fingers playing with the light-pink lace at the top of her bra. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Alarm raced through her veins, mixing with the endorphins from the orgasms she\u2019d just enjoyed, leaving her cotton-headed and puzzled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide yourself. Oh, Laura \u2013 you are so beautiful,\u201d he whispered in her ear as he leaned forward, unclasped her bra, and pulled off his t-shirt. Within seconds he had unveiled himself completely, his body nude before her, and he gestured for her to do the same.</p><p>She had to stand to slide off her skirt and she sucked in her lower abdomen, wishing she\u2019d spent more time on pilates than dead-lifting, the pain of each fat roll of excess ruining her arousal.</p><p>Until Mike said, \u201cYou\u2019re like a model in a Renaissance painting. Perfect and real.\u201d He pulled her hand and brought her down to the blanket, kissed the nape of her neck, and she melted.</p><p>She was real.</p><p>As she grinned, she took one experienced hand, making sure she had his full, erect attention now. She ran her tongue over her lips, savoring the pleasure she was about to give, so the first touch would be perfect, not too dry or bothersome \u2013 and, of course, all-too-real.</p> <p>She clutched his swollen rod in one hand and teased his tip, ripples of muscle under his rib cage going crazy. Flicking the tip until he groaned, she perfected the friction level all the way down, completely aroused by his excitement. Thick runner\u2019s legs shifted, the hair against hair like the sound of light sandpaper, and his face was open, languid, even, as she touched him.</p><p>No one \u2013 not even Dylan \u2013 had made her feel this comfortable with her own sexuality. So pure. So real. So alive. Mike was so present with his arousal, so into the moment of her hand, her mouth \u2013 her.</p><p>Returning her attention to the tip, firming her grip and tonguing the soft rim of his mushroom, she knew he was getting close. Her hand rubbed the base of his cock while she very gradually moved her mouth up and down on him, accentuating the sensation of the roof of her mouth, her tongue and her lips, pumping him with her hand and hoping that she could give him the same pleasure he\u2019d so beautifully given her just moments ago.</p><p>One of his hands touched her head, stroking her hair encouragingly, the fingers trying to tell her something she already knew \u2013 this was good. Great. Amazing. She took her time to extend his pleasure, for making love on this blanket at the top of a mountain, jet trails above them the only testimony to civilization, was a once-in-a-lifetime event. She wanted to make it perfect.</p><p>She continued this motion, going slowly faster and faster as his fingers tightened in her hair. She gently touched his balls, knowing she was on the right track when she began to taste him as he released that little drop of fluid, and she groaned with enjoyment. She took him into her mouth as far as she could, as her fingers clutched the base of his cock while continuing to stroke it, his athlete\u2019s body tensing and clamping without regard for anything but the pending release.</p><p>Blowing more air on the sensitive skin while milking him, he groaned, neck muscles tense with the agony of holding back. She was ready to give him the release he so desperately needed and licked her palm to get ready for more when a firm hand covered hers.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not like this. I want to be in you,\u201d he commanded. It wasn\u2019t a request. Laura was more than ready to comply, but he beat her to it.</p><p>He searched for her clit, finding her willing again. \u201cYou make me want to take you right here, right now, in the wild open, Laura.\u201d A completely new wave of arousal came out of nowhere, slamming her, making her want to fuck him for the rest of time. Or, at least, for the next hour. She wanted to straddle him, to ride him, to feel that Greek-God body on top of hers, to be together and come together and so much more.</p><p>\u201cClimb on me, Laura. I want to touch you,\u201d he said, pulling her gently onto his hips. She was so wet as she reached beneath her, straddling his hips now, the little scalloped edges of muscle where his abs met his hips too tempting not to touch. As her fingertips brushed there he shivered and nudged her just so \u2013 making the tip of him go in her. It felt like sinking into the perfect, hot bath, like the first bite of a chocolate torte in a cafe in Paris, like \u2013 so cliched! \u2013 like coming home.</p><p>To a home you didn\u2019t know you had.</p><p>He pulsated and she moaned with pleasure as her thighs hit his balls. \u201cYou are so amazing,\u201d she moaned. Her entire body stretched up, catlike, her breasts thrusting forward and instantly covered with his enormous palms, the feeling of his fingers pinching her nipples like a direct, hot route to her clit. Something zinged on her arm, then again on her thigh, and she felt more inside her pussy walls, her body overcome with little zaps that hurt, then faded.</p><p>As she rocketed herself up to the mushroom cap, the friction made her shiver, growing an orgasm that felt like it might just very well be more supernova than any before. He licked one hand and stroked her nipple, then repeated on the other side, the pale pink skin pebbling at his touch, making her throat tighten and her passage wetter than she thought it could be. He was making her G-spot scream for attention. She shifted, changing her weight distribution, then drew him all the way out to the tip, clamped her pussy, hard, then impaled herself.</p><p>\u201cHow did you \u2013 What are you doing?\u201d he groaned. \u201cDo more,\u201d he urged, his hips thrusting up to catch her now, the rhythm clear. He was close, and so was she. She was at a loss, the feeling too intense.</p><p>Mike took charge, his hands on her ass, guiding her in rhythm as he used his glutes and thigh muscles to push up, then pull back. If he angled her hips just so, he could hit her \u2013</p><p>\u201cAh, God, right there, Mike!\u201d she gasped. She needed to touch herself, as he widened her pleasure zone by stretching his legs open a bit. Sitting up, she gave herself access to her clit, a bit shy. Some guys didn\u2019t like it when she touched herself, but \u2013 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he urged. \u201cTake the pleasure you deserve, Laura,\u201d he added, kissing the hand that had just touched her clit. She grinned and parted the soft, thick skin of her mons, finding her clit standing at attention and ready for explosion. A few strokes down to her hot cave, where Mike thrust in and out and moaned and clenched, and she had liquid to move and circle, to \u2013</p><p>She ground into him, the feeling so maddening, pounding beautifully into her cervix. And then she just...tipped over. That was it, and the release was there with very little warning, her hitched breath and sudden clamping the only clue poor Mike had. \u201cOooooohhhh!\u201d she moaned. She hollered and wriggled and thrust back, hot cream and sex bursting as their juices flowed, gushing.</p><p>\u201cThe heat! You are so warm, so \u2013 \u201d Fading out, Mike\u2019s voice disappeared but he bucked up, fucking her hard and fast as he drained himself of his orgasm, too, their bodies twitching and pushing against each other to use whatever the laws of physics would give them. Her body made her come repeatedly, her flesh too weak to manage anything but release.</p><p>He pounded and pounded, she slammed back, he stroked her belly, and took one hand to tweak her right nipple, the pain mixing with the thrusting and the explosion to make her scream an animal sound \u2013 and then it was just a tired feeling, all cock and slick and mouth.</p> <p>They slowed, little clenches from the remainders of their sex slowing down. The sounds of nature filled her ears, layer by layer \u2013 birds. A buzzing. A pinch. She smacked a mosquito off her shoulder and then relaxed. Laura was still full of him as Mike relaxed, trapping her, their wetness and his muscled body all she felt now. She had no thoughts, her body surrendered, everything good, all complete, all chaperoned by the winking sun.</p><p>Neither said a word. Not one. By the time Laura realized they needed to leave, the sun had begun to set. Had they really just relaxed there, naked as the day they were born, for hours \u2013 just staring at each other, watching the clouds, feeling the wind whip their sated skin? Time disappeared, and as they reluctantly dressed in the sunset\u2019s glow, she decided not to say anything until he did. Perhaps this was more spiritual than she knew possible, and speaking would end whatever this was.</p><p>Mike packed and carried all their gear in silence the entire walk down to the trailhead\u2019s parking lot, where both their cars sat, expectant and a bit miffed, like parents of children new to the dating scene. Laura laughed at the sight of their abandoned cars, the only ones in the lot, and Mike just looked at her quizzically.</p><p>He remained silent, but stepped forward and kissed her cheek gently. \u201cThird date?\u201d he whispered in her ear. She grinned so widely her cheek hit his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d he whispered, then strode to his car, popped the hatchback, carefully placed the backpack and picnic goods, closed the trunk door and climbed in his car, watching Laura carefully.</p> <p>By the time they both pulled out of the parking lot and made their respective turns, Laura\u2019s face was covered with tears.</p><p>Some things were just too personal to share even with her best friend. Laura was going steadily mad and if the itching didn\u2019t stop she was going to scream. Rubbing her butt against her kitchen chair wasn\u2019t working, damn it \u2013 why on earth had she ever bought vinyl covered seats? With good old upholstery at least she could have scratched her butt in a way that gave her some friction \u2013 and some relief.</p><p>This itching was slowly penetrating her every conscious move, making her one big, non-stop twitch, and she\u2019d only been conscious for an hour. Two cups of coffee hadn\u2019t helped. Finally, Josie, who had finished four cups to Laura\u2019s two, cocked her head and said, \u201cWhat in the hell are you doing, Laura? You look like a nine-year-old boy who just had an ice cream fest and a few shots of espresso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am just not comfortable.\u201d Understatement of the year. Rub rub rub.</p><p>\u201cDid you pick something up from one of the two guys you fucked within twenty-four hours?\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cOh please, it wasn\u2019t within twenty-four...and you can\u2019t get...oh, I don\u2019t even want to go there. Shut up, Josie.\u201d She reached behind and scratched her ass.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re scratching your ass in public. I mean, man \u2013 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in public \u2013 we\u2019re in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am public. I am a human being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...what is going on?\u201d Now Laura couldn\u2019t help herself and start to scratch her breast. Her nipple was throbbing with the hot, torturous itch that plagued her ass as well. \u201cWhy on earth are you scratching your boob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it itches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on Laura, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Josie\u2019s exasperation showed in her tone and, finally, Laura couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She stood up, pulled her pants down, pulled down her underwear halfway and reached for the tube of hydrocortisone cream that she\u2019d shoved in her purse to take to work.</p><p>\u201cLaura, oh, my God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Laura twisted around and stared at her own ass. Yup. It wasn\u2019t any better this morning. What had started out as a series of small mosquito bites was now a minefield of red, hot flesh, swollen up into these enormous hive-like bites. When she had returned home from her date with Mike, she\u2019d realized pretty quickly what had happened. While making love outside in nature, in a field, on top of a mountain, with the most incredible view possible \u2013 both of nature and of Mike\u2019s body \u2013 had been earth shattering, quite literally, the reality of nature had set in.</p><p>In her butt.</p><p>She had about fifty mosquito bites all over her ass down her legs, up her chest, and one had managed to land on her left breast areola. Those zaps? Those zings of pleasure? Not arousal! Nature\u2019s vampires.</p><p>As she smeared the hydrocortisone cream all over the top of her ass, Josie just shook her head and laughed, folding in half as she held her gut, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>Laura tried pointedly to ignore her but couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cIt itches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Laura, that is awful. On your boob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d She pulled her pants up and went over to the kitchen sink to wash her hands. \u201cHow do you think it feels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how it feels. I\u2019ve never fucked somebody on the top of a mountain where a bunch of mosquitoes decided to feast on me.\u201d She snickered. \u201cIf a mosquito bites you in the ass is that some way...is that nature\u2019s version of oral sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any on your, you know \u2013 on your hoo-ha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoo-ha? Who calls it a hoo-ha?\u201d</p><p>Josie fanned herself.\u201cYou know me. I was raised in Virginia, I\u2019m a good old Southern lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady? Yeah, right. Like you\u2019re a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake some Benadryl for that, you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Benadryl makes me sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I mean, because, if you don\u2019t do something more drastic you\u2019re going to go to work and you\u2019re going to look like a hyena who ate twenty-five Mexican jumping beans. You\u2019re a lot better off looking like you\u2019re just a little sleepy or hung over on antihistamines.\u201d</p><p>Laura thought about that one for a minute. It\u2019s not like she had a really busy work day. Could she just call in sick? Oh, no. The monthly management meeting was today. Shouldn\u2019t really have to do anything, but she had to be there.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Maybe if I take some Benadryl, it\u2019ll make it easier to get through the monthly meeting anyhow.\u201d</p><p>Josie nodded. \u201cSo, Laura,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWas it worth it?\u201d</p><p>Laura reached down her V-neck into her bra and found the offending bite, scratching it furiously, knowing full well that at this rate, she was going to break the skin but at least that would give her some sweet relief. \u201cYeah. It was worth it, but next time I\u2019ll wear a bug spray instead of perfume.\u201d</p><p>Mike sat in bed staring up at the ceiling, counting the little holes in the tiles yet again, for what felt like the thousandth time. Actually, it probably was the thousandth time. He\u2019d done it over and over and over ever since Jill died a year and a half ago. Except this time, he was doing it to keep his mind occupied, not to keep his mind distracted.</p><p>He was doing it because it was something habitual, something rote, something that he just could slip into so that he didn\u2019t have to deal with the actually messy emotional aftermath of his date with Laura. It had gone so much better than he ever could have expected. He never intended to sleep with her. And he certainly never intended to make love to her at the top of that mountain on that blanket.</p><p>Yet he had and he was glad.</p><p>The last time he and Jill had made love had been right there. While he wanted to reclaim the space with someone new, he hadn\u2019t planned to do it in quite that manner. Laura moved something inside of him. Her soft curves, her joyful laugh, the way that she focused and her face melted into passion as she came. It all was so overwhelming and too intense.</p><p>Mike needed to talk to someone about Laura. How intoxicating. How calm. How lush. How sweet. How \u2013 him. It was as if someone had hand-sculpted the perfect woman for him and forgotten to tell him that this was what he really wanted. No, she wasn\u2019t Jill. And no one ever would be Jill. That was OK, because it had to be OK. He didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>Always assuming he would never, ever fall in love again, Mike hadn\u2019t considered the idea that he might find a different love \u2013 one that was no more, nor less, than what he and Dylan had with Jill. Could life with Laura be as good? Better? Different? The sex had been astounding, though he could do without the damn mosquito bites. Next time he would take her to his cabin.</p><p>Next time. He didn\u2019t care that he was getting ahead of himself. But then...Dylan probably thought he had a next time, and Laura had shut him out. What was that about? He knew Dylan was tormented by her silence, but he couldn\u2019t exactly ask her about it, now, could he? Not without blowing his cover. Cover? What the hell, Mike? he asked himself. This wasn\u2019t some CIA movie or FBI plot. He wasn\u2019t the center of a sting operation or an undercover drug bust.</p><p>He was, however, being deceitful, and that felt very, very wrong. Laura had no idea that he and Dylan were a \u2013 what? What were they, exactly? Explaining their relationship hadn\u2019t been an issue with Jill. They just fell into their life as a threesome, as uncomplicated and easily as any other twosome. He and Dylan weren\u2019t gay. Not quite. But they weren\u2019t straight, either. They had tried, before Jill, to each date separate women but that first encounter, back in high school, where they both lost their virginity to the same girl had cemented their needs. What they wanted was the power of three, and it made them both complete.</p><p>Dating one woman, sleeping with one woman, was pleasurable. Hell, Laura had certainly proven that! Already, though, he felt a longing for more. He imagined Dylan did, too. The complication now, though, was that Laura was spurning Dylan and deepening her relationship with Mike.</p><p>In the short term this was fine, but in the long run...what could he do? How could he mend the relationship between Dylan and Laura to make the triad complete? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Worse, though, was a niggling fear in the back of his mind. His heart. What if she preferred Dylan over him?</p><p>Opening up to Laura would be a whole other mess. \u201cHi, Laura. My partner, Dylan, found you on that dating website and figured you might be open to a long-term threesome. And, by the way, we\u2019re billionaires. So...can we keep dating?\u201d The deception was already over the top, strung out too long. A week, though, really \u2013 how could a week create such joy and do so much damage? How could their lives change so abruptly, so deeply, in such a short period of time?</p><p>There was no choice here. Whatever Laura decided was final. He couldn\u2019t read her \u2013 just knew she liked him. A lot. Had she liked Dylan this much, too? If not, why? What had driven her away from him and into Mike\u2019s arms?</p><p>The only way out was through. Through his heart, and hers. And Dylan\u2019s. He would have to come clean to him, and soon, before this spiraled out of control.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t fear that made him keep his mouth shut. It was exhilaration. Excitement. The secret of mine. Mine. Laura was his, for now. Only his. While he knew that wouldn\u2019t sustain him in the long run, just as Dylan\u2019s dating her, alone, wouldn\u2019t do it for him, either, there was a heady confidence that came from scooping Dylan. He could never have imagined, never dreamed that Laura would spurn Dylan and turn to Mike, but here they were. This was how it had turned out, and now the only concern he had was that Laura would hate him once she knew that they knew each other.</p><p>Wait, Mike, he told himself. Savor this. After eighteen months of loneliness and pain, it was good to wake up in the morning with a smile on his face.</p><p>Even better, though, would be to wake up to two other smiles in his bed. God, the thought made him hard. Rock hard.</p><p>And so he found himself counting \u2013 879, 880, 881, 882 \u2013 counting, counting, counting. And then he looked down and saw the tent on the top sheet. Ah, shit. There\u2019s only one way to deal with this. A run.</p><p>He left the bedroom and nearly slammed into Dylan, who was coming out of the shower. \u201cHey, hey man, how was that date last night?\u201d</p> <p>Mike felt his expression shift to complete shock and he tried to cover up his feelings.\u201dOh, oh yeah, uh, yeah it was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dylan clapped him on the back, staring down at Mike\u2019s erection. \u201cYeah, thinking about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking about a lot of things,\u201d Mike answered, still stammering on the inside. Fuck \u2013 what if Dylan guessed what was going on before Mike could confess it? This was just too much. He spent most of his life trying to craft as simple a life as possible, and now he\u2019d created a huge romantic clusterfuck. Way to go!</p><p>Dylan said, \u201cYeah, I have been too. But, well, anyhow...\u201d He shook his head as if willing away something that was bothering him.</p><p>Mike knew he should ask, Mike knew that he should inquire, that this was Dylan\u2019s way of reaching out, of being emotionally open, and yet he couldn\u2019t. He just couldn\u2019t muster the energy to deal with anyone else\u2019s emotional struggles right now. Hell, he couldn\u2019t even deal with his own. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m gonna go for a run. I\u2019ll see ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, bye.\u201d</p> <p>They were just so articulate when it came to expressing their feelings. He could hear Jill\u2019s words echoing in his head: \u201cYou two are about as good at talking about your feelings as I am at shaving my own balls.\u201d</p><p>If he could get his feet pounding on the pavement, pounding on the trail, running in the dirt, the trees flying by, the buses groaning \u2013 whatever, wherever, whenever. Air in, air out, muscles up, muscles down. If he could reach that place within where everything disappeared and nothing was all \u2013 Mike knew he could figure out how on earth he was gonna tell Dylan that he had just stolen his girlfriend.</p><p>Dylan threw on a pair of shorts and some t-shirt from \u2013 he looked at the front \u2013 middle school? Yeah, middle school. He still had it. In fact, he never let go of any of his t-shirts; he probably had hundreds of them in various states floating around his apartment, everything from the Monsters of Rock t-shirt that he got when he was a kid from his older brother, down to the latest cheesy Daily Show shirt.</p><p>He opened up his laptop and he tried one more time. Clicking on Laura\u2019s profile, he typed in the chat window, \u201cHey, Laura, are you there?\u201d She had completely shut him out. He knew it had been a day, one day, that was it. Just a single day since she left his bed. But she didn\u2019t answer his texts, didn\u2019t answer his phone calls, didn\u2019t respond to his chat window \u2013 nothing \u2013 and she had slunk out of his house in the middle of the night.</p><p>Now he was certainly used to one night stands and having women sneak out \u2013 or being the one who sneaks out on a woman \u2013 but he had felt such a connection with her that this mystified him. And now, the great silence. What was that about? Why was she doing this?</p><p>He knew how to find her address. He knew where she worked. He even knew the floor; she had told him. But he didn\u2019t want to be a stalker. He didn\u2019t want to be that guy.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t that guy. It wasn\u2019t his style; he never did that kind of thing to a woman. This one, though? Oh, he could actually feel himself drooling, imaging her body, conjuring her touch, the way she shifted her hips, the way that she leaned against him, the way that her hair hung in his face, the way that her lips seemed to \u2013</p><p>Oh, man.</p> <p>He and Mike were a matching pair of tented shorts now.</p><p>What in the hell was up with Mike? He was acting awfully squirrelly. Not that that was anything new, but Dylan was going to all this trouble to find them another person. Not that anybody could replace Jill, but he wanted that closeness, he wanted that sense of family that only three could give him and Mike. And now, now he felt unmoored. Lost.</p><p>So he typed again. \u201cWell, Laura, if you\u2019re there, please, I\u2019m trying to reach you. Give me a call, text me, something. I just wanted to talk. I really enjoyed the other night and let\u2019s touch base\u201d. And with that, he shut down, he logged out, set aside his computer and went to join Mike on that run.</p><p>As he started to put on his running shoes he remembered, Oh shit, I forgot to email my mom. His mom\u2019s seventieth birthday party was coming up and he needed to give his dad some answer about some detail. His computer was already off. Oh, wait a minute, maybe I could just use Mike\u2019s, he thought.</p><p>So he went into Mike\u2019s room and yes, the laptop was open. This would be easy. He clicked on the browser and up popped the same online dating website where he met Laura. That\u2019s funny, he thought, maybe that\u2019s how Mike found his date last night. You would think he would have told me.</p><p>Blink, blink. Dylan wasn\u2019t sure what he was looking at, but a dull, creeping dread began to fill his veins. As he stared at the computer screen and read the chat windows, the account information, the all-too-familiar picture, and scanned over every detail on the screen, it slowly dawned on him that Mike was logged into his account and having a lovely conversation about his most recent date.</p><p>With Laura.</p><p>To be continued in Her Two Billionaires \u2013 the story of how Laura, Dylan and Mike become one.</p><p>A sample:</p><p>Bang bang bang. Fireworks exploded above her, the dazzling pastels blooming before her eyes in a furious cascade of sparks. As the hot coals showered down like burning rain, Laura jumped when one touched</p><p>her.</p><p>Bang bang bang! they exploded, the little pieces hitting her face, her legs, suddenly soft and caressing her like \u2013</p><p>\u201cLaura!\u201d Bang bang bang. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t lost your key I would come in!\u201d</p><p>Josie. Wha? Laura opened her eyes and fumbled for her phone. 7:22 a.m. She sat upright in horror.</p><p>\u201cHang on!\u201d she shouted, stumbling to the door, unchaining and unlocking it. Josie stood there, petite and jaunty, peering around Laura.</p><p>\u201cSo is he still here?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cIs that why you didn\u2019t answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs who still here?\u201d Laura yawned and stood on tiptoe, her muscles desperate for oxygen, blood rushing into her extremities and nearly giving her a calf cramp as she slowly went down to flat feet, rolling her shoulders and stretching her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhatever hot, eligible bachelor contacted you last night, because you are on a roll, Baby! One a day, right?\u201d She punched Laura lightly in the shoulder and stormed past her, banging and shuffling things as Laura stared at the back of her front door.</p><p>For the briefest of seconds she ran a frantic mental check \u2013 had she gone out last night? \u2013 and then cursed herself. This was getting out of hand. No, last night she had stayed home and finished up some quarterly reports, watched a few episodes of Mad Men, and gone to bed early. Apparently, she\u2019d needed the sleep. And, apparently, she had forgotten to set her alarm. Now she would be late for work, though she knew her boss wouldn\u2019t mind. Last night she had clocked an extra three hours; flex time and a salaried position made it easier to go in a bit late this morning.</p><p>Josie didn\u2019t have that luxury. As a geriatric nurse, she needed to be on shift on time, every time. At least she only worked three shifts a week, though. Soon her rotation would take her to midnight shifts, which Josie hated. So did Laura; it was hard to get together when her best friend kept a schedule better suited for vampires.</p><p>\u201cI took a break from my busy fuckbuddy schedule,\u201d Laura yawned, stretching again. Her belly felt cold as her shirt hiked up, and when she looked down her braless breasts hung lower, and off to the sides, like small,</p><p>smooth animals with the metabolism of a sloth. Josie had a chest like a boy\u2019s, if a boy had tight little breasts you could fit in a headphone cover. Mostly, they envied each others\u2019 figures, though Laura could never understand why Josie would want these boobs. At this rate, she\u2019d need a wheelbarrow by the age of fifty. Or to marry a</p><p>good plastic surgeon.</p><p>A quick thought of Mike, then a more surprising flash of Dylan, hit her. She couldn\u2019t get over Dylan \u2013 didn\u2019t want to, really. Mike had called her last night. Asked her out again. This time to his cabin up on the mountain. Maybe they could make love without a million uninvited, biting guests. That would be a step up, Laura thought, as she absent-mindedly scratched her ass over her flannel pajamas. She needed some Arnica for the bites and kept forgetting to buy some.</p><p>\u201cQuit scratching yourself and come have some coffee!\u201d Josie called.</p><p>How did she knew she was scratching? The woman was part psychic. Or heard the scrit scrit scrit of fabric as she scratched. Or watched her reflection in the hallway mirror. Ah \u2013 that was it. She looked and</p><p>saw Josie\u2019s cheesy, overstretched grin as she held up a mug and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cAhhhhh. Coffee tastes so much better at your house, Laura.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s free.\u201d</p><p>Josie sputtered and laughed. \u201cOK, you got me there.\u201d</p><p>Laura poured a cup of coffee and sat at her little kitchen table, taking deep breaths. \u201cWhat am I going to do, Josie? Mike asked me out on a date tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I really like him.\u201d She took a sip. \u201cMore than I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laura said nothing, then started to explain, but thought the better of it. \u201cNevermind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are stuck on Dylan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Josie\u2019s tone was incredulous. \u201cDid you ever figure out who that woman was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd has he tried to reach you?\u201d</p> <p>Laura blew air out her nose, laughing softly. \u201cI have 34 messages from him on the dating site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s playing it cool, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Josie frowned. \u201cBut I thought you blocked him?</p><p>\u201cHe created a new account.\u201d Josie made a low whistling sound of disbelief.</p><p>Laura smiled wistfully. \u201cYeah. I just can\u2019t go there, Josie. You know how much it hurt when I found out about Ryan...\u201d She had dated Ryan for the better part of a year. They\u2019d shopped for engagement rings. He\u2019d introduced her to his boss, went on double dates, and then one day she got an anonymous message on Facebook. A request to friend.</p><p>Someone with Ryan\u2019s last name.</p> <p>His wife.</p><p>Funny how he forgot that detail.</p><p>She had a pretty simple morality: don\u2019t date people who file taxes with other people as a married couple. Her rule was pretty simple. Too hard for Ryan, though.</p><p>And now she applied the same rule to Dylan: no dating people who were involved with other people.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be part of a threesome, Josie, it won\u2019t be as the invisible third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmm, a man sandwich with Laura in the middle. And those two men...\u201d Josie licked her lips with great exaggeration.</p> <p>Laura\u2019s hands reached out to shove Josie before she could think to stop herself. \u201cCut it out!\u201d Her face burned, though, with the thought. Josie just cackled.</p><p>A threesome. Menage. She\u2019d never done it. But she sure had thought about it. As her breath hitched with embarrassment and arousal she shifted in her seat, now painfully aware of the increased heat in her nether regions.</p><p>Regions that had seen more activity \u2013 and from more men \u2013 in two days than in two months.</p><p>\u201cLaura and Mike and Dylan, sitting in a tree \u2013 o!\u201d Josie joked, skittering away so Laura couldn\u2019t punch her again. Shaking her head, Laura buried her face in her coffee to hide her expression from her friend, who was about a hair away from figuring out that Laura would welcome the menage.</p><p>More than she could even acknowledge to herself, much less admit to her friend. There were lines in friendship. This was one of them. She couldn\u2019t take back the words if she blurted them out, and right now she was just too confused and tired to deal with the fallout of admitting what her heart really desired.</p><p>Besides, there was that pesky issue of Dylan\u2019s girlfriend. Funny how that put a screeching halt to any sandwich fantasies.</p><p>At least she had Mike.</p><p>\u201cYou still have Mike, though,\u201d Josie mused. \u201cPoor Laura. Have to settle for a guy who looks like something out of Asgard. Does he have a tongue like a god, too?\u201d</p> <p>Laura threw the empty half-n-half container at Josie, who just chuckled as she stood and walked out the door, leaving Laura to get ready for a torturous day at work, the hours before seeing Mike stretching out like years.</p><p>As she dressed, though, she remembered her drive home from their last date. For some reason she still didn\u2019t understand, she\u2019d started crying as soon as they\u2019d gotten in their cars. At first, she\u2019d almost jumped out of the seat and run after him, just needing something \u2013 more. More words? No. More sex? Ah \u2013 no.</p><p>Just more.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d arrived home she had been fine, so whatever triggered the tears seemed to have settled and found its place inside her. Could sex with someone she\u2019d only met a couple of days ago unleash emotions that strong?</p><p>Was it deeper than that? Her earring got stuck as she tried to shove the post through the ancient hole, the back of the earlobe grown over. A few layers of skin closed up the back of the lobe and she worked to center the end of the post over the spot where the lump of scar tissue was thickest. Gritting her teeth, she forced the metal rod through, the hot sting of newly-pierced tissue evolving into a throb.</p><p>Her favorite pearl earring dangled nicely. Was it worth the pain?</p><p>Sure. For the sake of wearing something that complemented her perfectly.</p><p>Maybe Mike\u2019s the same, she thought. You had to date a lot of painful jerks before you found the one who complemented you perfectly.</p><p>Hot tears filled her mouth and eyes.</p><p>Aha. Now she understood.</p><p>And yet Dylan \u2013 she closed her eyes and full drops poured out of her inner tear ducts and down her nostrils. An ache in her throat spread to her chest. Ignoring his messages had been agony. Sheer, unadulterated pain in the form of restraint.</p><p>She had held fast, though she had faltered only once. The (gorgeous, incredible, irresistible) idiot had gone and created a completely new online dating account to circumvent her blocking him! How stalkerish and weird and creepy and \u2013</p><p>Flattering.</p><p>Charming.</p><p>Arousing.</p><p>She had almost \u2013 almost, achingly almost nearly so close \u2013 broken down and agreed to meet him for coffee, just to hear his side of the story \u2013 which she already knew. It was a clich\u00e9 upon a clich\u00e9, right?</p><p>Holding fast, though, she had simply typed:</p><p>Please leave me alone.</p><p>And, like magic, he had.</p><p>The ache that his respect for her wishes created in her was so contradictory yet so pervasive it made her question her own sanity. Why was she so drawn to this guy? What was so special that she would override her own moral code for him?</p><p>Ah, but you didn\u2019t, her conscience reminded her.</p><p>Oh, how I want to, she retorted.</p><p>Dylan stared at the computer monitor, completely unsure and yet painfully, deeply certain of what he was reading. Mike and Laura? Mike was hitting on Laura at the online dating site? What? He scrolled through the history of the chat window and realized that \u2013 that the first chat took place the morning after his date with her.</p><p>Oof. His stomach twisted and his balls felt like lead. Stretching his neck and clearing his throat, he fought back a tearful rage. Ease up, Buddy. Last time you let your temper flare you had a $400 door to replace.</p><p>Now, he\u2019d been a bit confused when he woke up that morning and she had been gone. But he\u2019d had plenty of encounters where that happened \u2013 yet he\u2019d expected her to answer one of his phone calls or his texts. She had plenty of opportunities.</p><p>While he wasn\u2019t quite ready to stomp over to her house and hold a boom box over his head, with Peter Gabriel\u2019s In Your Eyes blasting from it, he was definitely in that uncomfortable zone where he expected to have a second date with her, anticipated it \u2013 really, frankly was excited by the prospect of it and had been stymied by her refusal to talk to him.</p><p>Mike had sniped her? This wasn\u2019t a rare baseball card on eBay, for fuck\u2019s sake.</p><p>Even though it had been less than twenty-four hours since he last saw her, and he knew he shouldn\u2019t be so eager, it stung. He had an inkling about why she was blowing him off now \u2013 some inkling. A 6\u20185\u201d inkling.</p><p>And according to the times on the chat window, it looked like within a few hours of leaving his bed, she was planning a date with\u2014Mike?</p><p>Mike? Mild mannered, boring old Mike?</p><p>This didn\u2019t make any sense! Dylan was the one who went out and found someone for them. Dylan had found Jill, who had been their one and only.</p><p>Jill.</p><p>He sighed, his shoulders slumping, and he leaned cradling his face in his hands, a wash of nostalgia, of mourning, of pain came over him. And this time he let it. Normally, he pushed it away, manned up and did what a lot of guys do \u2013 went for a run, watched the football game, ate too many wings, pumped iron. But right now he let his feelings sink in. Watching her die had been one of the most \u2013 no, the most difficult thing \u2013 Dylan had ever experienced. The helplessness had nearly killed him, too. Mike had just retreated into his own world. Running tens of miles, half marathons, day in and day out until his shoes wore out within weeks, until his feet blistered, until he put his body into a state of pain that let some of the agony in his heart leak out.</p><p>Dylan wasn\u2019t like that. Dylan had fought and fought, and fought some more. Had argued with the doctors, had argued with Jill. Bargained with God and anyone who could help. Tried to convince her to try all sorts of alternative therapies that he had read about on the Internet, from vitamin C to certain yoga positions to chelation \u2013 and while the doctors said none of it could hurt, none of it helped.</p><p>Jill had gently accepted her own fate after a valiant struggle; Dylan had never accepted it. Ever. And now here he was, a year and a half after her death finding someone like Laura, hoping that maybe she could help to repair some of the scars that were still fresh from Jill\u2019s death.</p><p>And then Mike goes and turns into a snake.</p><p>Why would he do this? This wasn\u2019t Mike\u2019s style at all. He wasn\u2019t the type to poach a girl. Mike was the beta. They joked about it. Dylan was the alpha and Mike was the beta and that was just the law of nature and how things worked between the two of them \u2013 between the three of them, with Jill. Jill had liked Mike\u2019s sensitive touchy-feelly, new-agey nature and she\u2019d loved Dylan\u2019s arrogance.</p><p>Oh, that had hurt. She had called him arrogant all the time, as if his self-confidence didn\u2019t have a bedrock foundation for his firm grounding. Here he was a fire-fighter, a paramedic \u2013 built, a former model and he was arrogant? He could wave it away most of the time, but now he just chuckled to himself, thinking about the times she had put him in his place. Frankly, he had needed that, needed her steady, sardonic wit, her \u2013</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it Dylan. She\u2019s gone. Just stop it.\u201d He looked up stared at the monitor again, and the nostalgia came to a screeching halt.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p>It was time for the alpha to put the beta in his place.</p><p>Whistling some Lady Gaga tune that he\u2019d caught in the car in the long drive home from the mountain, Mike was feeling pretty pleased with himself. He had just proven that he, on his own, could catch the same woman Dylan could catch.</p><p>And boy, what a catch Laura was. Way more than he ever expected. She was absolutely, positively nothing like Jill. And yet, he had a feeling that if the two had met, Jill would have really liked her \u2013 and probably would have given her approval. Laura accepted the fact that he was quiet sometimes and he was able to sit in absolute silence with her, out in a field, staring at the mountain. The two of them could just coexist in peace together. You couldn\u2019t find that in many people. Very few, in fact.</p><p>Jill had been one of them. Dylan definitely wasn\u2019t, but he had other traits that made him worth being with, hard as it may be these days to remember them. And so, as he pulled into his parking spot his mind was filled with nothing but plans to see Laura again. A niggling irritant scratched deep within his brain, though, ruining the absolute perfection of this new beginning.</p><p>Dylan.</p><p>He had to tell Dylan at some point and it wasn\u2019t going to go well. He and Dylan had been together since high school and he knew him backwards, forwards and upside-down. Even though Mike\u2019s intentions were pure, Dylan would view this as a threat, as a challenge, as some sort of \u2013 as Dylan put it \u2013 alpha-beta problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike just rolled his eyes and ignored the alpha-beta crap, because he knew that on the surface he looked like a beta. They weren\u2019t wolves, though, and this wasn\u2019t a pack; they were human beings who were complex and nuanced. He could show Dylan, and himself, that he was capable of going out on his own and finding a woman.</p><p>Well, OK, that wasn\u2019t quite accurate. Dylan had found the woman. Fair enough \u2013 but he could go out on his own and test the waters. Make sure the woman was attracted to him on her own and not as part of some package with Dylan at the lead.</p><p>And he had just done that today. Quite pleased with himself, that sense of pleasure faded, like a light switch being flipped off, the second he walked in the apartment and saw Dylan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou slept with her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Dylan wasn\u2019t just pissed. Betrayal was too mild a word to describe his feelings. Dylan was itching for a fight, his fingers clinching against his hot palms.</p> <p>Mike walked through the door, a cheerful smile on his face, a loose, languid quality to his joints that made Dylan want to throw him against the wall and beat the ever-loving shit out of him for taking his woman.</p><p>Their woman.</p><p>Funny, how history seemed to repeat itself. This was exactly what had happened with Jill almost ten years ago when they\u2019d all first met. Mike would deny it, but the reality was that Jill had been Dylan\u2019s girlfriend and Mike had been the interloper then. So, even though Dylan knew that they had this running joke, that he was the alpha and Mike was the beta, Mike was neither \u2013 he was really just a snake.</p><p>A snake Dylan couldn\u2019t live without.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch, you went and \u2013 you found Laura and you \u2013 the morning after my date with her, you contacted her and got her to go out with you!\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but stammer, and the sputtering made him feel small and insignificant, reduced to babbling like a lovesick teen. Fury plumed in him, hot and fast, with a taste like blood.</p> <p>Mike stopped dead in his tracks and shoved his hands in his pockets, staring dead ahead at Dylan, eyes boring into his.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>That enraged Dylan more than anything, because he knew at this point Mike would only give one-word answers. Like a robot, the man shut down and steeled himself, becoming an impenetrable fortress of quotidian bullshit. \u201cYou knew how important this date was, you knew that I was checking her out for us, not just for me, you jerk!\u201d Dylan seethed now, his anger fueled by Mike\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cWhy in the hell would you go behind my back and contact her? And a few hours after I slept with her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you slept with her!\u201d</p><p>Dylan cocked his head, rolled his eyes, and made an Oh please! gesture. \u201cRight, like any woman I wanna sleep with isn\u2019t going to sleep with me on the first date!\u201d</p><p>Mike let out a puff of laughter. \u201cDo you know how much you sound like a total douche? Like any woman I wanna sleep with is gonna to turn me down,\u201d he mocked, his hands gesturing like Dylan\u2019s, chest puffed up and prancing around like a peacock. Animated, mocking Mike was way worse than Robot Mike.</p> <p>Dylan could feel his heart rate zoom, and, he feared, his skin turn green as he morphed into something so angry he couldn\u2019t control it, a firefighter, billionaire Hulk.</p><p>And it was all aimed right at Mike.</p><p>Her Two Billionaires will be published in December 2012.</p><p>Her First Billionaire \u2013 a sample...</p><p>Read how it all starts, with Laura, Dylan \u2013 and Mike\u2019s entrance at the end \u2013 as the two men find their way to bringing Laura into a most unique, and decidedly hot, forever threesome. Here\u2019s a sample from Laura and Dylan\u2019s story:</p><p>\u201cHot, luscious piece of ass who can suck a golf ball through forty feet of garden hose seeks rippling-ab\u2019d firefighter who has a tongue that thrums like a hummingbird and enjoys painting my toenails and eating Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s out of the carton while watching Mad Men.\u201d</p><p>Laura Michaels stared at the online dating site\u2019s registration screen and frowned. That\u2019s what she really wanted to write. Here was the truth:</p><p>\u201cNeedy, insecure, overweight twenty-six year old Business Analyst with three cats, a corporate job with pension and no debt seeks Mr. Impossible for way more than friendship and lots of ice cream. I\u2019m desperate for some physical affection and oral sex with a guy who doesn\u2019t view it as some sort of favor he\u2019s granting me, and then expects to be praised like he cleaned my toilet. One night stands are better than nothing as long as you brush your teeth. Call me!\u201d</p> <p>Her best friend, Josie Mendham, punched her in the bicep. \u201cYou can\u2019t say either of those!\u201d Josie was Laura\u2019s opposite. Where Laura was 5\u20186\u201d, Josie was barely tall enough to ride roller coasters. Remove the 1 from Laura\u2019s size and you still had to go down to 2 to get Josie\u2019s. Where Laura had long, curly blonde hair and bright green eyes, Josie was chocolate all around. \u201cMutt and Jeff\u201d her mom had called them, and they\u2019d been besties since eighth grade.</p><p>Which meant Josie knew Laura too well. \u201cYou are going to do this, damn it,\u201d she said, wagging a finger in front of Laura\u2019s face. \u201cNo trying to be perfect. Perfect is the enemy of good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even found Mr. Good Enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the hundreds of Mr. Good Enoughs have walked past you, Laura, and you\u2019re blind to them.\u201d Josie nudged Laura aside and started typing, her long nails burning up the keyboard. How did she do that? Typing on the pads of her fingers seemed impossible, but Josie did it, keeping her manicure intact, little replicas of the famous grey necktie from Fifty Shades of Grey on each nail.</p><p>The two had been out at a club the night before and Josie spent the night, waking up chipper and springing this online dating thing on Laura before she\u2019d even had her first cup of coffee. As the machine gurgled and burbled, Laura willed it to hurry. Weighing out her entire dating future in a half-zombie state was not good.</p><p>Laura knew she had to lie, but how much was acceptable? Could she shave off a few sizes, or would she need to hack off an imaginary arm and leg to make herself seem \u201cfit\u201d and \u201cathletic\u201d? The drop-down box with its built in descriptors seemed like judgmental torment. No choices were there for \u201czaftig\u201d or \u201cjuicy\u201d or \u201cfull figure.\u201d</p><p>Being a size 18 with size F breasts wasn\u2019t a crime, she knew; in real life she was fashionable and flowing, plump and pleasing, and could arm wrestle most guys into submission, but reducing her accomplishments, personality and, yes, body into a vocabulary designed by some Internet start-up team of nineteen-year-old dropouts from Stanford and Carnegie Mellon made her irrationally angry.</p><p>No \u2013 rationally angry.</p><p>Seeing little choice, she pointed to the boxes on the screen and told Josie, \u201cPick the word \u2018fit.\u2019 I can deadlift 105 pounds. Which is,\u201d she eyed Josie, \u201cmore than you weigh.\u201d</p><p>Josie pointedly ignored her, biting her lower lip and deep in concentration. \u201cVoila!\u201d she shouted, her hands spread wide in a grandiose gesture. \u201cThere\u2019s your ad.\u201d</p><p>She announced:</p><p>\u201cLuscious, curvy Business Analyst seeks friendship and more. Financially independent and self-assured, I\u2019m a fit woman who wants a man (or, more than one! YOLO!) for stimulating conversation...er, yeah. Conversation. Message me (or massage me!).\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t write that!\u201d Laura groaned. \u201cIt makes me look like I want an orgy!\u201d She squinted at the screen. \u201cAnd what the hell is \u2018YOLO\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want an orgy?\u201d Josie wiggled her eyebrows lasciviously and stuck out her tongue, waggling it like she was performing a very bad imitation of oral sex. \u201cAnd YOLO stands for \u2018you only live once.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out. You\u2019re turning me on. It\u2019s been that long since I got some ass, and the last guy used his tongue like he was a Roto Rooter man. Like that.\u201d She pointed at Josie\u2019s tongue and bent over, laughing.</p><p>And then Josie, with a flourish, pressed the \u201cSubmit\u201d button. \u201cThank you for joining \u2013 your profile is now live!\u201d the screen read.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, Josie, did you just do that?\u201d Laura sputtered, spilling creamy coffee all over her sleeve as she grabbed the mouse. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Josie batted her eyelashes. \u201cLive a little. See who replies!\u201d She grabbed her heavy, over-full Vera Bradley purse that they had discovered at a local thrift shop for $3.99 and fingered her car keys. \u201cGotta go, Laura. And don\u2019t you dare delete that.\u201d</p><p>Laura laughed. \u201cYou know me too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Josie muttered. Her face turned serious. \u201cReally, Laura. You need to get out there. Some guy is being deprived of your awesomeness. And besides, your budget needs the break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy budget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. What are you spending in batteries for Bob?\u201d</p><p>Confused, Laura shook her head. It was like Josie spoke a foreign language sometimes. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour battery-operated boyfriend. You know \u2013 BOB.\u201d And with that she snickered, running for the door as Laura threw a section of a fashion magazine at her. Josie\u2019s evil laughter filled the apartment as she ran down the hallway, the sound fading once she hit the stairwell. \u201cHave a good day at work!\u201d she hollered from the street.</p><p>The coffee machine gave its death-rattle gasp that signaled the pot was done, and Laura went to drink it greedily, needing sustenance to kick her brain into gear. Enough caffeine and she could date anyone. Hmm, maybe she should do a search for baristas on that site. Free lattes would be a nice perk.</p><p>Dylan Stanwyck couldn\u2019t quite believe what he saw when he logged into the online dating site. Four months of weeding through so many crappy profiles had jaded him. Finding the right woman would be like coming across the proverbial needle in a haystack, but in this case he didn\u2019t want to face any pricks.</p><p>And yes, women could be pricks. So far he had been inundated with requests to chat, and he knew exactly why. Being a firefighter who competed in weightlifting competitions for fun, along with the occasional mini triathlon, made his pictures look quite nice. The problem with the women who were responding to him was that they were also the type to be drawn to appearances only. It seemed so shallow of him to think it, but sometimes being built the way he was could be a curse.</p><p>Curse of the Jersey Shore chicks. Because that was the type who seemed to seek him out, like moths to a flame. A trashy, Snooki-like flame of ho-dom. When he would meet up with these women he found himself in some alternate universe, where they licked their lips and offered themselves up in the alley behind the nice tapas restaurant where he liked to take women. A few goat cheese stuffed dates and pitchers of sangria later and he was being humped up against a slimy brick wall next to the trash cans.</p><p>And when he turned them down...he still had scars from one woman\u2019s long, overdone nails raking his neck as she screeched, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d over and over, requiring police assistance as passersby gawked, took pictures they probably uploaded to Reddit, and mercifully called 911 on his behalf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So when this new profile for Laura appeared, he peered at the description and leaned back in his chair, taking a deep breath. Cute. But not too cute. A little sassy. He liked sassy. He ran a hand through his thick, wavy hair. Time to get a haircut, dude. You look like a survivalist. And smell like one, too, he thought as he studied her picture and caught a whiff of himself. His morning run was done, 3.8 miles logged on his online fitness program, and he reeked.</p><p>She looked like a 1940s pin up girl. A little plumper, with soft curves to her shoulders, a fuzzy, lime-green sweater accentuating her breasts. Her jaw line seemed firm and gentle all at once, and what appeared to be naturally-blonde hair was swept up off her face in a pony tail. His mom would call her a \u201ccorn-fed farm girl\u201d and those lips \u2013 lush and grinning a half smile that seemed to say \u201cKiss me, Dylan.\u201d</p><p>Smart, too. A business analyst? Sounded suitably bland and yet signaled she was smart enough to carry her own in a conversation about something other than Kim Kardashian or Fifty Shades of Grey (really \u2013 why? Why had every date for the past two months mentioned it?). A real woman. What a refreshing change.</p><p>So he continued reading:</p> <p>\u201cLuscious, curvy Business Analyst seeks friendship and more. Financially independent and self-assured, I\u2019m a fit woman who wants a man (or, more than one! YOLO!) for stimulating conversation...er, yeah. Conversation. Message me (or massage me!).\u201d</p><p>Something fierce and hot inside him came to life. From that description it sounded like she...seriously? No way.</p><p>\u201cMike! Hey, Mike! Get in here!\u201d If there were a chance \u2013 any chance at all, here, then he had to act fast. Someone this amazing was about to get inundated by messages from needy weirdos.</p><p>And he needed to be the first.</p><p>His roommate wandered in. Where Dylan was all muscle and brawn, Mike Pine was tall and sleek, a marathoner\u2019s body of long, lean tissue. Dylan\u2019s dark, Italian, thick looks made him popular with women, but Mike was the golden boy, with blonde hair and blue eyes, the long distance runner with a soft heart, the guy women turned to and poured their hearts out, Mr. Sensitive to Dylan\u2019s Mr. Conquest.</p> <p>Dylan tapped the screen. \u201cTake a look at her.\u201d He smiled smugly as Mike\u2019s eyes raced across the screen. They\u2019d been waiting for a long time. Too long. His roommate\u2019s expression told him everything he needed to know. Score! It might finally be time.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that\u2019s some sort of code for being up for a threesome?\u201d Mike asked, eyebrows arched. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Dyl...I think it\u2019s just some sort of joke she\u2019s making. You know how nervous and weird people can be when they try to distill their entire life into a few sentences.\u201d</p><p>Dylan chewed on the inside of his cheek. Bad habit. \u201cGood point. Well, even if she isn\u2019t into a nice menage arrangement, she is one fine woman.\u201d A low whistle escaped from his lips. \u201cI have a project on my hands now, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded, peering at the screen, eyes lingering. \u201cYou are going to have a lot of competition.\u201d</p><p>Dylan snorted. \u201cLike I give a fuck. May the best man win.\u201d</p><p>Mike went silent, then grinned, his fresh-faced boy-next-door look morphing into a Wall Street trader\u2019s predatory smile that made Dylan suddenly uncomfortable for no reason he could pinpoint. \u201cYeah. I hope he does.\u201d</p> <p>Ding! The little chat box on the online dating site lit up like a Christmas tree. Laura sucked the last mouthful of her coffee and gaped at the screen. You have got to be kidding me, Laura thought. Already? She clicked and read a message from \u201c9inluvr\u201d:</p><p>Hey, babe. I live in the city and so do you, so let\u2019s hook up for some FWB action.</p><p>She snorted. Oh, sure. Just like that. Yer a catch, Bud. A real romantic.</p><p>Ding! This one was from some guy named Dylan. Before she read the chat she looked at his profile.</p><p>Well hellooooo there, Mr. Firefighter. A thin line of drool formed at the corner of her mouth, an instant response to the picture before her. It was a professional picture, the guy wearing no shirt, a fireman\u2019s hat perched at a jaunty tilt. Like a stripper\u2019s picture in a firefighter\u2019s role. Oh, God. I can\u2019t date a stripper, she thought. He\u2019d have nicer g-strings than mine.</p><p>But no \u2013 he was a real firefighter. The picture, he explained in his profile, came from a charity bachelor auction he was in. Bachelor auction? How much had he gone for? As she studied the picture she figured it had to be a solid four figures. Hell, she was ready to empty her life savings for a night with this guy.</p><p>On a whim she Googled \u201cDylan charity bachelor auction firefighter\u201d and her drool increased so much she would soon need a bucket.</p><p>Oh, holy hell. The image search showed the same man, whose name was Dylan Stanwyck, in firefighter\u2019s pants, boots, a fireman\u2019s hat and suspenders, perched on the floor of a fire station right next to the pole. He was leaning on one elbow and had smears of soot on him, with well-oiled muscles and a smug-ass grin. Whoever set up that photograph needed to be recruited for her company\u2019s marketing department because damn \u2013 she was ready to use up every available dollar on her credit cards to get a night with him.</p> <p>Maybe she could save a bunch of money and just set herself on fire. Or her car. It probably wasn\u2019t worth much, but if she found out his schedule and whether he\u2019d be the one responding...</p><p>And he was pinging her on the dating site? She dropped her coffee and scrambled to write back in the chat room.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, all inspiration and creativity vanishing as the heat forming between her legs apparently melted her brain.</p><p>Hi. I\u2019m Dylan. Nice to \u201cmeet\u201d you. :)</p><p>Think, Laura. Think. Man, where was Josie? Of all the times for that girl to be on time to go to work. She needed help figuring out something witty to say.</p><p>Hi. I\u2019m Laura. Nice to \u201cmeet\u201d you, too!</p><p>She wrote back. Then he answered:</p><p>You\u2019re probably on your way to work analyzing businesses, or businessing analysis, or whatever it is you do ;). I was hoping you might be interested in going out? We can do coffee, maybe? Or go to a nice tapas bar?</p><p>Tapas! Her favorite! But wait \u2013 Josie always said any guy who likes tapas must be gay. Laura checked the photo again. No way. And even if Dylan was gay, she would still sleep with him. Cute, polite, and loves tapas?</p><p>Tapas sounds great! When?</p><p>Dammit! Now she sounded too eager. And then he waited. And waited. No reply. Shit! Maybe he was having second thoughts. Or she sounded like a moron. Or he realized he didn\u2019t like tapas after all. Or he really was gay. Or this was his cat impersonating him. She began to pace, willing the chat bar to ping. If she stared hard enough, maybe it would come \u2013 now! No, now! Or...now!</p><p>Finally:</p><p>Uh, this might seem too eager, but I don\u2019t care. I am free tonight. I work a 24 tomorrow, so this is my last chance for a few days. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, asking you on short notice, but...please tell me you\u2019re free tonight.</p><p>Yes! Yes, yes, yes, she wanted to write. But she needed to play that stupid game, the dance of meeting someone new. Her turn to wait. She reread his message. What was a 24? She puzzled over that one as she chewed on her nailbed, pulling on it until it bled. Brilliant! Screw up your manicure when you have a hot date tonight, Laura.</p><p>Might have. Might have. Don\u2019t put the cart before the horse.</p><p>I am free. Prince William is now taken and so I have an opening in my busy social schedule.</p><p>She hit \u201cSend\u201d before she could change her mind. Too cheesy?</p><p>LOL. Sounds great. Meet me at Tempo Bistro after work. At 6?</p><p>Tempo Bistro? The most expensive, chi-chi restaurant in town? Not tapas, either \u2013 something she couldn\u2019t quite remember. Asian fusion? How on earth could a firefighter afford that? Not your problem, Laura. And she was making terrible assumptions. She needed to assume they were going dutch. Good thing she was a careful saver.</p><p>\u2018lo?</p><p>The chat window pinged. Geez, Laura. Get out of your head. She typed furiously:</p><p>Sounds even better. I\u2019ll see you there and you know what I look like.</p><p>And he replied,</p><p>Oh, yes. :P</p><p>What was that supposed to mean? Her eyes swept over the clock \u2013 now she had eight minutes to shower. Damn! Laura just shook her head and walked to the bathroom, stripping naked by the time she crossed the threshold and turned on the hot water.</p><p>Sliding under the spray was bliss, the beads of water trailing their way down her body, her hair wet and ropy within seconds, the curl relaxed and the strands stretching long enough to tickle the top of her sacrum. Eh \u2013 why not leave the ad up? Who knew. Maybe she\u2019d attract a better breed of guy. Or, at least, a different kind. She eyed the shower head \u2013 did she have time? Eight minutes?</p><p>More than enough for the last guy she dated.</p><p>Just enough time for some intimate attention from Mr. Showerhead, though. Josie was wrong. It wasn\u2019t her battery bill that was getting expensive. Her water bill, on the other hand...</p><p>Good thing her vibrator was waterproof. As she soaped up she was cognizant of the time, knowing she had minutes to finish. Pulling up the old standby fantasy always worked. Two men, luscious and thickly-muscled, both in the shower with her. Mmmm...</p><p>The extra tip of her vibrator slid along the soft, sensitive skin of her clit as she perched one foot on the tub, opening up for access to slide in her fantasy lover, who was soaping her body with his sculpted, large hands, hands that smoothed over her curves, cupping her ass to pull him toward her, sliding his enormous cock in her while the other nameless, faceless lover kissed her, hard, his tongue lashing against her and exploring as the spray rolled down in rivulets between them, gathering at her folds and adding to the tease on her clit.</p><p>Her passage tightened as she imagined him bending down, on his knees, his tongue now lapping where the vibrator\u2019s little antennae tweaked her, not her own hands moving the thick shaft in and out but the lovers\u2019, four hands at once on her as one mouth descended on her eager, red nub, the other man thrusting her up against the shower\u2019s wall, her body ready for more.</p><p>She tensed, knowing she was so close, craving all these hands, more than enough for two men who wanted and needed her, the familiar muscled cresting of her climax so innate she barely cried out, the release perfunctory but oh, so welcome.</p><p>And, now, the guilt. Because how could a \u201cnormal\u201d woman really want two men at once? As she absent-mindedly rushed through the rest of the shower, quickly washing off her trusty toy, a persistent voice said, You, Laura. You. </p> </body></html>"]
