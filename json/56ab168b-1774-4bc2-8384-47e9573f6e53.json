There it was at the bottom, drifting ever so lightly with the current, looking almost like...a woman.</p> <p>She looked to her left and saw that Vic Damon was just feet away, concentrating on a jutting coral ridge that created a cavelike effect in the pristine waters. With what they had recently learned about the La Do\u00f1a, they were trying to see what might be hiding more or less in plain sight.</p><p>The easy, rhythmic sound of her own breathing filled her ears, and she looked at her air gauge. She still had twenty thousand psi, and her depth monitor showed she was hovering between forty-five and fifty-five feet beneath the surface. She could check out the strange form without compromising her own safety.</p><p>The water was like crystal, a shimmering color between blue and green. The temperature, too, was absolutely perfect. It was a wonderful afternoon in which to take the time to explore the smallest detail that drew her curiosity.</p><p>Last week, when they had started working the area, it had been different. Their first day out, three members of their five-person crew had been violently ill, including Marshall Miro, the owner of Deep Down Salvage. Gen didn\u2019t get seasick, but with everyone around her heaving...it hadn\u2019t been pleasant. But now the winds had died down completely. The surface was nearly as smooth as glass. The sand had settled.</p><p>Visibility was good.</p> <p>It was almost as if the shape in the water was beckoning to her. Still hearing the rhythmic sound of her own breath, she gave a kick of her fins and started toward whatever it might be.</p><p>As she drew closer, she thought that someone had dropped a mannequin in the ocean. From a distance, it had looked like a woman. The closer she got, the more that impression became set in her mind. Yes, it was some kind of mannequin. She wasn\u2019t easily frightened, but she could feel a frown of curiosity creasing her brow as she moved closer.</p><p>Blond hair floated freely in the water, creating a halo effect around the mannequin\u2019s head. There was something soft and beautiful\u2014eerily lifelike\u2014about it. Kicking to propel herself directly in front of it, she saw that it was dressed in a white gown, which billowed with the movement of the water.</p><p>The serenely molded face stirred a feeling of deepest sadness in her.</p><p>She almost reached out in sympathy.</p><p>Almost...</p> <p>With a shock, she realized that it was down here on the ocean floor because it was weighted. There was rope around the ankles, connected to a canvas bag full of what seemed to be bricks.</p><p>The sound of her breathing stopped abruptly.</p><p>She had to force herself to breathe again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a mannequin. The body was real.</p><p>The blood in her veins turned to ice. Sickened, she did reach out, knowing she had to touch the face. There was no hope the woman was alive. There were no escaping air bubbles; there had been no other boat for her to have come from...and yet she knew she had to touch her, find out if there were some way she might be saved.</p><p>Just as her fingers were about to make contact with the woman\u2019s lifeless skin, her head rose. Her huge blue eyes opened and rested on Genevieve\u2019s. They were filled with sadness.</p><p>Her flesh was grayish-tinged white. Her lips were blue.</p><p>She stared at Genevieve, her mouth forming a silent O, and she lifted her hand, reaching out to Genevieve, as if seeking a touch of consolation.</p> <p>She started to smile, as if heartbroken.</p><p>It was a terrible smile, a knowing smile. A lifeless smile.</p><p>Then she formed a single word with those blue, dead lips.</p><p>Beware.</p><p>1</p><p>\u201cH ey, no one ever said the sun made people sane,\u201d Jack Payne, an old-time and expert diver, said, staring at Thor Thompson with an amused cant to his head.</p><p>Thor, in turn, was staring at the woman.</p><p>He\u2019d first seen her earlier that day, when his boat, The Seeker, had met up with the group the state had hired. They were both involved in the same exploratory mission, and there had never been any reason, as far as Thor was concerned, not to co-exist with other companies and other divers. Especially on this project. The state of Florida, along with the environmentalists and the historians, was solidly against some of the methods treasure seekers had used in the past. Coral reefs were fragile. It was one thing to disturb a little nature when there was a verified find; it was quite another to rip the sea floor to shreds in the pursuit of a find. Though the historians were the ones who had set this project into motion, they were going on a theory, and there had to be proof of that theory before the state allowed in any of the big machinery that might tear up the beauty of the reefs\u2014the state\u2019s real treasure, as far as tourism went.</p><p>Thor was working for the federal government, not himself, and since the Deep Down Salvage group was working for the state, it wasn\u2019t as if one of them was going to seize the treasure from the other. If it turned out to be true that the Marie Josephine was hidden beneath sand and coral and the continuous reef life, and they did discover a pirate cache, they would both make out well, but it wasn\u2019t as if the proceeds wouldn\u2019t be divided, or as if the state and U.S. governments\u2014and maybe others\u2014weren\u2019t going to be taking the majority of the haul. As a diver who\u2019d spent his career working on old wrecks and salvage, he had done well, and it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t appreciate his creature comforts. But he had never been in it for the riches that some salvage divers continually sought. He liked the work, the history and the thrill of discovery.</p><p>With the recent discovery of the wrecked La Ni\u00f1a just off Calliope Key, all sorts of people had once again become excited about the fact there were thousands of undiscovered wrecks off the Florida coast. It was more than plausible that at least some of those wrecks had been hiding pretty much in plain sight. Too often, people simply didn\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t recognize what they were looking for. The sea could totally camouflage the remains of a ship after centuries, something researchers had learned much more about in the recent past when vessels of various kinds, having outlived their usefulness, had been purposely sunk to help create artificial reefs. Along with the passion, however, had come the cautionary voices of the historians and environmentalists. A number of the search areas where archives suggested the Marie Josephine might be found were marine sanctuaries. Solid proof of a find\u2014more than a few pieces of eight, some ship\u2019s silver, or even cannons\u2014would have to turn up to allow for any dredging, hauling or sifting equipment to come out.</p><p>Thor\u2019s group, known as the Seekers, along with their lead research boat, wasn\u2019t on call for just fantastic finds. There were times when the work was far more painful than exciting, when they went looking for survivors or the remains of a crash, times when they didn\u2019t dive into the extreme beauty of the Caribbean, the Florida Straits or the Gulf of Mexico. There were dives into swamps, as well, and those were excruciating. The work here, though, was something he enjoyed\u2014at which he hoped he excelled. They were on the trail of pirates. The initial work, done by the state historians, had sent them straight into some of the most beautiful water he had dived anywhere in the world. He liked what he was doing right now. It was the intimate kind of work that was the most exciting. Because they were going on speculation, this was real underwater exploration. Sure, they had sonar and radar, but because storms and time could play such havoc with the remnants of the past, they were also going back to basics, using their own eyes, their own instincts.</p><p>Big money\u2014despite the possibility of a big payoff\u2014was hard to get in the speculation stage. Still, people were more important than equipment right now. That was why he was there, and that was also why she was there.</p><p>The woman he was watching was an expert diver, so he\u2019d been told. But he and his crew had been about half a mile from the Deep Down Salvage boat when he\u2019d seen her bob frantically to the surface. He would have rushed in for a rescue, but her own people had been quick to recover her. When they had come broadside just to make sure everything was okay, she\u2019d sounded like a lunatic, going on and on about a body in the water. He\u2019d gone down.</p><p>And found a lot of parrot fish and tangs.</p><p>Since they were all staying at the resort, she was there now, with her buddies, and from the look on her face, they were still ribbing her. The whole thing felt strange to him, because she looked like the last woman in the world who would ever lose her cool. Frankly, she had a look that instantly aroused whatever was sexual and carnal in the male psyche. She was very tall\u2014five eleven, at least\u2014and everything about her was elegant. Even now, she appeared both calm and confident. She had long auburn hair, striking green eyes, dark, well-formed brows, a heart-shaped face and features that exemplified the phrase \u201cperfect symmetry.\u201d He\u2019d seldom seen anyone look better in a bathing suit. She would have made a hell of a model, then again, she also would have made a hell of a stripper.</p><p>Her mere presence in any room was enough to draw the eyes of any red-blooded male within range.</p><p>It was a pity she seemed to be certifiably crazy.</p><p>\u201cConchs are the worst of the lot,\u201d Jack said, breaking into Thor\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Thor looked back at the older man.</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Jack told him, lighting his cigar, \u201cthat Conchs are known for being crazy. You know, Conchs. Like me. Native Key West folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you added a subcategory there,\u201d Thor told him.</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re a Jacksonville boy. North of the state\u2014might as well be a different breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sane breed?\u201d Thor said, offering a dry smile.</p><p>Jack puffed on his cigar and watched the flame. He was somewhere between fifty and sixty years old, hair still long and iron-gray. He wore a huge skull-and-crossbones earring in one lobe and a chain with a Spanish doubloon around his neck. He was built like a man half his age who spent hours at the gym. In his own words, he\u2019d been diving since the rest of them had been in knee britches. He was a man who knew what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cEver hear of Count Von Cosel?\u201d Jack asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thor stared at him.</p><p>Jack smiled. \u201cHe was a German immigrant\u2014not a real count\u2014working down here in the hospital. He fell in love with a Cuban girl named Elena. He knew she had tuberculosis. He made up some weird kind of cure, but despite his efforts, the girl died. Family had her buried. A few years later, he decides she should be buried in a great mausoleum, so he builds it, and supposedly that\u2019s where the girl\u2019s body is interred. But as time goes by, folks start to notice odd things about his place. Like it looks as if he\u2019s dancing with this huge doll. Turns out the poor bastard dug up Elena and tried to put her back together again so that he could try some whacked-out thing to bring her back to life. Bastard slept with the corpse for years, repairing her constantly. Finally the family got wind of it, and the sister goes to see him. There was an uproar, but there\u2019s a statute of limitations on whatever crime they figured it to be, so he gets off. This is Key West, after all. He not only gets away without being charged, he winds up with people sending him money to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lying sack of shit, Jack,\u201d Thor told him.</p> <p>\u201cI swear to you, it\u2019s a true story. Ask anyone. Look it up. Newspapers all over the country carried the story.\u201d He paused and took a puff of his cigar. \u201cThe point is, comparatively speaking, the young lady you\u2019re staring at is as sane as they come. And damned better looking than any other I\u2019ve ever seen with these old eyes.\u201d</p><p>Thor shook his head and lifted his beer. \u201cI saw her out there today, and when you\u2019re diving, the last thing you need is someone going off the deep end, no pun intended. Ask her out on a date, Jack, but don\u2019t bring her on my boat. There\u2019s too much at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone diving with that girl many a time, Thor. She knows what she\u2019s doing. As far as hooking up with her, hell, I could be her father. And I\u2019ve known her forever, since she was a kid.\u201d</p><p>Thor shook his head again and turned his focus to the water. Late summer. Hot days, gorgeous nights. There was always a breeze coming off the ocean. And the sun, when it set, was glorious. It was eight at night, and the sky was getting ready to change. Now it was light. Soon it would be pink, purple, gold, yellow, blue...streaks of color that would slowly deepen. Then, around eight-thirty, it would suddenly go dark.</p><p>He was staring at the water...and then he was staring at her again. It was hard not to stare at her, he thought, realizing what it was about her that drew him so powerfully. She emanated a natural, easy sensuality. It was evident in her every movement. Nothing forced, nothing overt. Something she herself wouldn\u2019t even know she possessed.</p> <p>\u201cSun\u2019s going down now,\u201d Jack commented. \u201cYou could take off the shades.\u201d</p><p>Thor smiled again. Hell, no. He liked the ink-dark Ray-Bans. No one could tell when his eyes kept turning toward the other table.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t take your eyes off her, huh?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to appreciate about eye candy? I just don\u2019t think any rational man\u2014especially a diver\u2014should get too close to a loose cannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to hear about the guy who thought his doll was alive and all the folks who think it\u2019s cursed?\u201d</p><p>Thor groaned. \u201cJack, give it a rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s all real stuff. Know where the name Key West came from? When the Spaniards first arrived, it was one big boneyard. An Indian tribe that died out? Killed in a massacre? No one knows. But there were bones everywhere, so they called it Cayo Hueso, Island of Bones. The English didn\u2019t bother to translate the Spanish, just turned it into words they knew. I\u2019m telling you, Thor, Key West is a unique place.\u201d</p><p>Thor smiled slowly. \u201cJack, if you\u2019re trying to convince me that she\u2019s totally right in the head, you\u2019re not getting anywhere. The woman claims she saw a body in the water. And that it talked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey...for every tale out there, you\u2019ll find a grain of truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard about a missing person in the area? Anybody looking for a murder victim? I had the news on\u2014far as I can tell, everyone\u2019s accounted for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sounding like a callous son of a bitch, and I know better,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cWhat you are is so focused on diving that you don\u2019t mind going through women like Kleenex.\u201d</p><p>Thor arched a brow. \u201cYeah? Haven\u2019t seen you settle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever knew a woman could keep up\u2014in my generation. They probably existed somewhere. We just didn\u2019t cross paths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play where I work,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>Jack let out a guffaw. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause the one woman on our team is married and an Amazon to boot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, who\u2019s being a son of a bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I think Lizzie\u2019s great, but she\u2019s all business. Tough as nails, and I think she could take me if we were arm wrestling. And if she couldn\u2019t, well, who the hell would want to mess with Zach?\u201d</p><p>Thor shrugged, amused. Lizzie\u2014Elizabeth Green\u2014was not a woman to be taken lightly. She wasn\u2019t an inch shorter than his own six-three. Her husband, Zach, had been a professional basketball player, and between them, they were a daunting pair. Lizzie waged a lot of the company\u2019s battles when they were seeking permits for projects. She could best almost any man. \u201cLizzie\u2019s tough. And down to earth. She isn\u2019t going to fly off the handle, seeing corpses that aren\u2019t really there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Everyone\u2019s been spooked by something once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a pile of crap yourself, Thor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have your tongue on the pavement if she crooked her little finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Bull.\u201d He spoke coolly, but he knew he was lying. The nutcase was almost explosively hot. But he hadn\u2019t been lying when he said he didn\u2019t fool around where he worked. Even on a long haul, they put into port somewhere, and that\u2019s where he did his playing. Complications on a job were something nobody needed.</p><p>\u201cI call \u2019em like I see \u2019em,\u201d Jack said flatly. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever accused me of lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m accusing you right now,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Jack laughed, noticing that Thor was watching the other table again. \u201cRemember, Thor, the mighty can fall,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ve been hearing that \u2018mighty Thor\u2019 shit all my life,\u201d Thor told him, then waved to the bartender, the owner\u2019s son, ordering another round.</p><p>\u201cWe all looked, Genevieve,\u201d Victor said. \u201cThere was nothing there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I saw a woman\u2019s body,\u201d Genevieve repeated stubbornly, her jaw set. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know if it was some kind of a joke, or if there\u2019s a real murder victim down there. But I didn\u2019t hallucinate. I saw it.\u201d</p><p>Bethany Clark touched Genevieve\u2019s knee. \u201cHey, honey, all of us see things down there sometimes. It\u2019s the mind playing tricks. The water playing tricks, causing visual distortion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave another beer,\u201d Victor said dryly. \u201cIt will make everything better.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve groaned, gritting her teeth. She couldn\u2019t say they hadn\u2019t tried. She had kicked her way to the surface with the speed of lightning. Thankfully, she hadn\u2019t been deep. The moment the woman had opened her eyes and smiled, she had felt such a sense of sheer panic that she had rocketed to the surface, which could have been deadly if she had been down deep. When she\u2019d reached the surface, she had nearly choked on salt water, spitting out her regulator and waving her arms madly.</p><p>Marshall Miro, head of their unit, had been on board, and she knew she\u2019d been babbling as he\u2019d helped her out. Victor had surfaced right after her, having seen her ascent. Then Bethany and Alex, not too far distant, had come up, and Bethany had stayed aboard while the others had gone down, searching for the woman\u2019s body. The Seeker, one of their fellow ships, had been in the vicinity, as well. Her crew had gone down, too.</p><p>And none of them had seen anything.</p><p>Maybe she had imagined the eyes opening, the woman reaching out, but she had seen a body. She just didn\u2019t know what had happened to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had babbled something about the eyes and the fact that the dead woman had moved, even tried to speak, and now even Bethany, her best friend, thought she was crazy.</p><p>She glanced around the small resort in the old-town area of Key West where they were staying. She actually owned a house not even half a mile away that her great-great-however-many-greats-grandfather had built on the island years before the Civil War.</p><p>But this place was a local hangout. Jack kept his beat-up old fishing boat here, and there was one slip where three of the area cops kept their boats berthed. They liked to come here just to have coffee, or drinks in the evening.</p><p>She\u2019d stayed here on purpose to be able to work this project at the blink of an eye with the others. Their dive boat was right there, where they needed it, along with The Seeker. There was no spa or twenty-four-hour room service, but what it did have was true old Conch charm. The main house had been built in the 1800s. Bungalows had been added right around World War II and were spread out over a sandy beach, and each offered an outside table and chairs on a little individual patio. There was also the tiki bar and \u201cmunch house,\u201d as they called it, which opened at seven in the morning and stayed open until midnight or so. The night bartender was the owner\u2019s son, so he kept it open as long as he was having fun. The menu wasn\u2019t gourmet, but it was fresh and delicious.</p><p>Despite the fact the divers following her garbled directions hadn\u2019t found a body, Genevieve had insisted on reporting what she had seen to the police\u2014by then calm enough to report the body but not the fact it had seemed to move of its own volition. It had been late when they had actually returned to shower and change and meet here at the bar to dine on fresh fish sandwiches, and the resort\u2019s own coleslaw and potato salad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, guys, laugh at me all you want. I saw a body,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>Bethany lowered her sandy head. Victor, Alex and Marshall all stared at one another, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gen,\u201d Victor teased her. \u201cThere\u2019s a lady at the bar who wants to buy you a drink...look\u2014Whoops, no, sorry, you didn\u2019t act fast enough. She\u2019s disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve glared at him through narrowed eyes. She wanted to wring his neck. Of all people to be so taunting...They\u2019d gone through school together. He was a year older, but she\u2019d matured faster, and having a shape in high school had been tantamount to being cool back then. She\u2019d taken him with her to every social event in their adolescent past.</p> <p>In college he\u2019d finally filled out and grown a few hairs on his chest. He\u2019d grown into his features, as well, and now he was tall, dark and good-looking. They\u2019d never ruined a good friendship by dating, but he could irritate her as thoroughly as if they were a married couple.</p><p>\u201cVictor...\u201d she began.</p><p>Grinning, he waved a hand. \u201cYeah, yeah, I know what I can go do with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, kid, it will be all right,\u201d Marshall said, but he, too, was still secretly smiling. At least someone was amused, she thought. Marshall was the owner and founder of Deep Down Salvage as well as a local. As a kid, he\u2019d been fascinated by the history of Key West, which was inextricably entwined with tales of wreckers and salvage divers. It was a mixed history. Sometimes they had saved the lives of the poor souls on a ship that came to ruin on the dangerous reefs.</p><p>Sometimes, however, they waited like vultures\u2014hoping ships carrying rich cargos would flounder and sink. Such a system had created many a rich man throughout the centuries.</p> <p>Marshall was at least ten years older than most of their group. He had made his name by working in the northern waters off Massachusetts, doing heavy-duty, cold-water salvage. But Key West was his home, the place he loved. He had used his earnings to come back and open his own company, buy his own boat and equipment, and set up shop. He made a good income, but he was always pleased to work on any historical effort, and he had a tremendous respect for the reefs, the water and the past. Deeply tanned and buff, and dead even with her own height, he kept his head shaven, a look that went oddly well with his almost ebony eyes and dark brows.</p><p>Sitting with his feet up, shades on despite the setting sun, he grimaced. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out that there was something down there. You know...flotsam and jetsam of some kind.\u201d</p><p>Alex hummed a version of The Twilight Zone theme song. \u201cYeah, flotsam and jetsam with a face and hair,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She glared at him, hiking a brow. Alex was from Key Largo, a different world from Key West, since the city of Miami was barely an hour north. He was blond, bronzed and a child of the sea and sun, a graduate in history and a master diver, but she\u2019d shown him secrets of the reefs here that only the natives knew.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2014\u201d she said, then broke off in aggravation and rose, taking her beer with her to the little fence that looked out over a deep channel where the resort\u2019s pleasure crafts and fishing boats were berthed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go away mad!\u201d Alex called.</p> <p>She spun around, shaking her head and forcing a smile as well. \u201cJust wait, my dear, devoted friends! Somewhere along the line, you will get yours. I\u2019m not going away mad, I\u2019m just going away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d Genevieve insisted.</p><p>She walked on down to the dock, nursing her beer, looking out at the sunset. It was beautiful and tranquil, but she was roiling inside. Why had she been so panicked? She\u2019d twice worked rescue situations that had become retrieval situations, and they had found bodies both times, once after a plane crash in the southern Glades, and once after a boating accident off Key West.</p><p>But the dead hadn\u2019t looked at her then.</p><p>Digging a flower bed at her house, she\u2019d dug up bones once\u2014but that hadn\u2019t been as shocking as it might have been elsewhere, not in Key West, the Island of Bones.</p><p>But those bones hadn\u2019t disappeared.</p><p>She felt a presence next to her, tensed and turned, certain that one of her friends had joined her to continue the torture.</p> <p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>She turned at the soft masculine query to see Jay Gonzalez. He was still in uniform, hat low over his forehead, sunglasses dark and concealing his eyes.</p><p>She smiled. She liked Jay a lot. He was in his late thirties now, and had been young himself when she had first met him. He\u2019d pulled her and a few friends over when they\u2019d been in high school, and, admittedly, there had been a few beer cans in the car. He hadn\u2019t brought them down to the station, though. Instead, he\u2019d taken every one of them home.</p><p>He was one of the cops who kept his boat here. He didn\u2019t go out on it often anymore. He\u2019d been out on it when his wife had fallen overboard and died. But he still kept it up. Maybe he even visited it now and then because he somehow felt closer to his wife when he was on it.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t there now for the boat, she knew. He was there for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014if you think having all your friends convinced you\u2019re crazy makes you fine.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThanks for listening to me today.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, leaning against the little wooden rail next to her. \u201cI know you\u2019re not a ditz,\u201d he told her, grinning.</p><p>\u201cBless you.\u201d</p><p>He stared out over the water. \u201cI just wish I could help you. I don\u2019t have anything that would correspond with what you told me. Then again, someone might be missing and it hasn\u2019t been reported yet. I sent some men out after I talked to you. They couldn\u2019t find anything, either.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBizarre as it may seem, given the amount of drinking that goes on down here, Key West itself doesn\u2019t have much of a murder rate. I deal with boozed-out kids and car accidents more than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJay, I saw a woman down there.\u201d She hesitated before going on, hoping he wouldn\u2019t take what she was about to say as a slap on his professional knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s not like no one ever gets killed here. There was the husband who went nuts and shot his wife a few years back. And there was that almost-super-model who disappeared when I was in high school. No one believed she would ever be found alive. Oh! And just last year, in the middle Keys somewhere...another young woman disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say we never have murders, but in comparison to Miami, our numbers are low\u2014single digits. And, Gen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. There\u2019s no missing blonde on the radar right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could find out later there is,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut let\u2019s hope it was a prank of some kind, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am definitely hoping that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThere could be a bunch of frat boys laughing their asses off somewhere. We may never know. But I believe you saw something. In fact, it\u2019s you, so I know it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled her thanks. \u201cCan I buy you a beer?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m still on duty. I just wanted to make sure you were all right.\u201d He made a face. \u201cThere\u2019s some trouble up on Mile Marker 6. You take care, all right? And call me\u2014whatever comes up. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her chin affectionately with his knuckles, then walked away toward the sand-and-gravel parking lot.</p><p>She thanked God for him. At least he believed her. He was an interesting guy, she mused. He was a perfect sheriff\u2019s deputy. Tall, dark, quiet. He exuded an air of competence and assurance. She always felt a sense of sympathy for him; his wife had died about five years ago, when they\u2019d been on vacation. He\u2019d kept pretty much to himself after that.</p><p>But he was a good guy. And it was comforting to know he had taken her seriously.</p><p>Upsetting, though, to know that no one had found any sign of anything.</p><p>Staring back at the horizon, she took a long swallow of the Miller Lite she\u2019d been holding so long that it was growing warm. When she felt someone beside her again, she thought that Jay had returned.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>\u201cHey, cutie. Long day, huh?\u201d</p><p>It was Jack Payne, one of her favorite people in the world, though he was working on The Seekers this go-round. Crusty as a crab, Jack was weathered and leathered by the sun. He wore one of the coins he had found around his neck, a Spanish gold piece hung from a chain, and in one ear a gold earring in the form of a skull and crossbones. He worked out of the area a lot, but they\u2019d shared several assignments, and he was a great diver with whom to work.</p><p>She flushed, seeing the semi-smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, Jack. Give it a good laugh, okay? But thanks for calling me cutie. At my height, I don\u2019t hear that word too often,\u201d she said wearily.</p><p>\u201cHey, I believe you saw something. And maybe \u2018cutie\u2019 isn\u2019t the right word. How about, hey there, gorgeous? And, as to the other, there\u2019s nothing else anyone can do right now, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He slipped a fatherly arm around her shoulders. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll hear something soon about someone going missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. I\u2019d much rather it have been my imagination,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cRight...well, this is a pretty kooky place. We\u2019ll probably discover that some prankster did sink a mannequin in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ve got to get past it right now,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou will. It will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She swung around, leaning on the wooden railing as she surveyed him. \u201cI\u2019d swear you\u2019ve been sitting there with your hotshot friend, trying not to agree I should be taken off the project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Never. I\u2019d dive with you any day, Genny.\u201d</p><p>She risked a quick glance at the man remaining at Jack\u2019s table. Thor. Who the hell had a name like Thor? Yeah, yeah, he had a reputation. And in another place and time, he might have fit the name well, having the height and build and rugged features of some ancient thunder god. But this was Key West, and they were living in the real world, and down here they didn\u2019t care how many times someone had managed to make it into the newspapers. She didn\u2019t know why\u2014maybe it was because he had been so ready to rescue her that afternoon\u2014she felt an instant dislike for the man. Pretentious. Arrogant. Those adjectives definitely applied. And it wasn\u2019t because she had a thing about working with other groups. She just didn\u2019t like him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome meet him. He\u2019s really not such a bad guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jack said lightly. \u201cYour buddies are doing a pretty good job of ribbing you right now, too, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve shrugged. Yes, this one was going to take a very long time to live down. No\u2014they\u2019d never let her live it down.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come meet Thor.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes but followed Jack back to the table.</p><p>To his credit, the man stood. She could see little of his face because he wore a pair of Ray-Bans, but he had the kind of high-set cheekbones and strong jaw that certainly defined his personality. No-nonsense, rugged, probably fearless. Totally confident and determined. She decided that even without what had happened today, she probably wouldn\u2019t have cared much for him. He didn\u2019t appear to be the kind of man who worked and played well with others.</p><p>\u201cThor, meet Genevieve Wallace. Gen, Thor Thompson.\u201d</p> <p>He offered her a hand. He didn\u2019t smile, however. He wasn\u2019t treating her experience with the same amusement as the others. Apparently he found it dangerously annoying.</p><p>\u201cThor,\u201d she murmured, shaking his hand but extracting her own quickly. \u201cInteresting name.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help the bit of disdain in her tone.</p><p>The hint of a smile curved his lips at that. \u201cSorry\u2014my grandparents were Norwegian. They started out in Minnesota. It\u2019s common enough in those circles. Genevieve, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily name, as well. St. Genevieve. My antecedents were old-school Catholics, I suppose,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cGen. It\u2019s easier,\u201d Jack said cheerfully. \u201cSit. I\u2019ll get you a beer. Ah, you already have one. Well...sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She hesitated. She should have been quicker with an excuse. Anything. Actually, I\u2019m already sitting with friends over there. Excuse me, but I think I\u2019m wiped out, I\u2019m going to my room. There\u2019s a cat in a tree I have to rescue...Anything!</p> <p>But she hadn\u2019t thought fast enough. Jack already had a chair pulled out for her.</p><p>\u201cStrange you two haven\u2019t met yet,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Genevieve saw a tawny brow shoot up over the Ray-Bans. \u201cJack, it\u2019s a big world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve worked the Keys before,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Thor nodded. \u201cI haven\u2019t been down this far south that often, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jack said cheerfully, \u201cit\u2019s a great project to be working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Working,\u201d Thor murmured.</p><p>Genevieve stiffened instantly. Despite the Ray-Bans hiding his eyes, it was more than apparent that he thought of her as a liability. \u201cI am working, and I take my work seriously, Mr. Thompson,\u201d she informed him coolly.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Thompson?\u201d Jack said. \u201cGen, we\u2019re all working together. He\u2019s just Thor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting work method,\u201d Thor said, as if Jack had never spoken.</p><p>His voice let her know he was staring at her as if she were a total flake.</p><p>\u201cI would be willing to bet, Mr. Thompson, that I know these reefs far better than you ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he replied, leaning forward. \u201cJust what is it that you think you know about these reefs, Miss Wallace? That you mysteriously see the past? People floating down there? Strange, if that were the case, one would think you\u2019d know exactly where to look for all the sunken ships. Wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d Jack demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s with this Mr. and Miss stuff?\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to ignore Jack.</p><p>\u201cMy reputation as a diver is absolutely spotless, Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, why don\u2019t I go over and say hello to your buddies, Gen?\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>His chair scraped back. He was definitely in a hurry to quit their company and the wave of tension that had seemed to materialize around them.</p><p>Thor Thompson was still staring at her. Then he leaned forward suddenly and removed the sunglasses so he could stare into her eyes. \u201cSpotless?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cMaybe until today. We might as well get this right out into the open. I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about your reputation. Even though we\u2019re not working at great depth, every man has to pull his weight. I\u2019ve seen too many \u2018experienced\u2019 divers pop up dead. If you see dead bodies that open their eyes and try to communicate with you, Miss Wallace, we\u2019ve got serious problems ahead. You might want to get some help before you go down again.\u201d</p><p>For several long moments Genevieve stared at him, so shocked by the hardball vehemence of the attack that she didn\u2019t even blink.</p><p>The man had blue eyes sharper than jagged ice and a jaw that seemed set in concrete. Her heart pounded. He didn\u2019t know her; didn\u2019t know anything about her.</p><p>He\u2019d simply judged her.</p><p>She sat forward, as well, met him eye to eye, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a better diver than you could ever hope to work with again. And I\u2019m known to find what I\u2019m looking for, so if you don\u2019t like me, well, then excuse me for being crude, but I really have nothing to say other than \u2018Fuck you, asshole.\u2019\u201d Still smiling pleasantly, she stood and walked away.</p><p>Jay Gonzalez drove down Roosevelt, wondering why the situation had left him so perplexed.</p><p>Nothing. There had been nothing down there.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d been in and around the water long enough. Vision was distorted beneath the waves.</p><p>The crime rate was low, just as he\u2019d told Gen. Most of it had to do with petty theft. Some grand larceny, and of course there were the drugs. But murder didn\u2019t happen often.</p><p>There couldn\u2019t be anything to it. Genevieve thought she\u2019d seen a body. The body had been gone. A prank, perhaps? According to Marshall, there hadn\u2019t been any other boats in the immediate area. But, hell, he knew kids, and they were willing to go to great lengths to play a trick.</p><p>Still, it disturbed him. He liked Genevieve, really liked her, and always had. He hated to see her upset like that.</p><p>Ghosts were big business in Key West, as they were in many places. Hemingway was said to walk around town, and sometimes it seemed as if every house on Duval Street claimed to have a ghost, thanks to the Indian bones and the wreckers and plain old human frailty. But Genevieve wasn\u2019t the type to make up a story for the fun of it.</p><p>What the hell had she seen?</p><p>Murder wasn\u2019t common in Key West.</p><p>But it did happen. Had happened.</p><p>Hell, yes, it had happened. He knew damned well it had happened.</p><p>He gritted his teeth; he was already reaching US1. His siren blaring, he wove through the stopped cars. There was an accident just ahead. He looked at the cars as he approached and prayed he wouldn\u2019t be seeing any bodies himself. Not that night.</p><p>2</p><p>T he following day, Thor was one of the first divers up and about. The plan was to meet early every morning at the tiki bar to grab coffee and a light meal. Just fifty feet from the little hut, the resort offered a small dive shop, where their tanks were filled and any damaged piece of equipment repaired. He stood on the dock for a few moments, enjoying the sunrise. It promised to be a beautiful day, or at least a beautiful morning. They planned to spend the next couple of weeks taking the boats out early and calling it quits by about three, when the late summer rains traditionally rolled in. Those afternoon storms often came on with ferocity, but generally they raged for half an hour or so, then were gone.</p><p>He sipped his coffee, aware that others were beginning to emerge from their cottages. Marshall Miro\u2019s crew was impressive. They were all in excellent shape, and comfortable in the water no matter what the circumstances. They had the proper respect for the ocean\u2019s power. Which was good\u2014he didn\u2019t intend to lose any divers. Even Genevieve Wallace had sounded sane enough when she\u2019d snapped back at him. He liked her air of determination, in fact.</p><p>He saw her walking from her cottage, meeting up with Bethany, the second woman on Marshall\u2019s crew. She was the opposite of Genevieve, probably a respectable five-five or five-six, but next to her friend, she appeared short. She was attractive, compact but nicely muscled. She also seemed to be far more cheerful and easygoing than her long-legged counterpart and was waving to Lizzie and Zach even as she met up with Genevieve. Lizzie made even Genevieve look short, and when Zach moved up, he dwarfed them all. Jack was already over by the tiki hut, and Clint\u2014long and lanky at twenty-two, bronzed, his hair flopping in his face\u2014was setting out platters of doughnuts and fruit. Rounding out the group, Vic and Alex came running up along the beach, heavy packs of equipment over their shoulders. They were of an age, and, like the others, physically fit and mentally sharp.</p><p>\u201cHey! Thought you were lolling around in bed. Didn\u2019t see you down here,\u201d Marshall called to Thor, walking down the dock.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in search of the find of the century,\u201d Thor said dryly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to oversleep and miss all the excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to find anything?\u201d Marshall asked, rubbing a hand over his bald head and squinting against the sun.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t believe there was something to find. I\u2019m just curious what the state guys have planned if nothing shows up here. People have been diving this area for years. Admittedly, we\u2019ve been finding signs of metal down there, but hell, that could mean just about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we need is proof that she\u2019s there, and then it\u2019s up to the ecologists and historians to start arguing about the next steps,\u201d Marshall said with a shrug. He stared at Thor. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d just like to go down in the books as having been in on a real find. If determination means anything, we\u2019ll find something for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetermination is always an asset,\u201d Thor murmured. He was looking back at the others. Victor Damon gave Genevieve a teasing bump as they walked along the path. She turned and pointed a finger at him, saying something. They were probably still ribbing her. He said something else, and she stole his baseball cap, then slammed it back on his head. Still, they were all laughing. That cop, Jay Gonzalez, seemed to hold her in regard. If she\u2019d been a fruitcake, it was doubtful the man would have listened to her so attentively or sent divers out in search of a body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a tight-knit crew,\u201d Thor commented.</p><p>\u201cThose two,\u201d Marshall said with a nod toward Genevieve and Victor, \u201cand Bethany all went to school together. Best friends. Poor Alex is the new guy. He\u2019s only been around for about three years. All the way from Key Largo,\u201d he added dryly. \u201cWhat about your people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best,\u201d Thor assured him. \u201cLizzie and Jack have worked it all\u2014rescue, recovery, salvage. They\u2019re a great team. And you must know Jack. Probably better than I do. The invitation to join this search came kind of suddenly, and several of my people were already committed to other projects. I\u2019m missing some of my regulars, but I\u2019ve known Jack forever and I\u2019m glad to have him on my team.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack has more experience than all of us put together,\u201d Marshall said.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Thor said, checking his watch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be down before nine to take advantage of the visibility before the storms roil up the sand.\u201d He let out a whistle, drawing the attention of his crew, who hurried for their coffee.</p><p>Genevieve Wallace walked by, her eyes like sharp crystals as she assessed him without a word.</p><p>\u201cNice morning, wouldn\u2019t you say, Miss Wallace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, a perfect morning,\u201d she replied politely, and hurried on by.</p><p>It was a perfect morning, and the day passed uneventfully. Three different dives, hours under water. Just before three, with the regularity of a factory whistle, the storms started rolling in.</p><p>Thor had seen the sky change on the horizon, seen the rain when it had begun farther out at sea. When the divers came up for the third time, he motioned to Marshall that it was time to call it quits. With the boats lashed together, he could hear Marshall\u2019s people talking as he waited for his own crew to stow their gear.</p><p>\u201cI think we were closer yesterday,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because of that woman you saw?\u201d Alex teased her.</p><p>She slapped him on the arm. \u201cBecause I have a hunch. I think we need to back it up a bit, Marshall. We didn\u2019t give yesterday\u2019s location a thorough search. I mean, a relic isn\u2019t going to just jump out of the sand into our hands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it,\u201d Marshall assured her.</p><p>By then the motors were purring, they had cast off their ropes and weighed anchor, and were moving away.</p><p>\u201cThink Genevieve might be right? Should we move back?\u201d Lizzie asked.</p><p>He shrugged, though privately he admitted that they should retrace the area. There had been too much excitement yesterday\u2014too much time spent looking for a woman\u2019s body are not enough for signs of a wreck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Marshall about it tonight.\u201d</p><p>He was startled when his cell phone started to ring. \u201cExcuse me, guys,\u201d he told them. When he moved forward and answered, he shook his head when he recognized Sheridan\u2019s voice. \u201cYep, that will be fine.\u201d He hung up and swore. The preliminaries had been done. But now...well, hell. It wasn\u2019t his nickel. If Sheridan wanted to come down and talk again, so be it. \u201cMeeting at the tiki bar tomorrow morning\u2014seven-thirty sharp!\u201d he called to the others.</p><p>Thor felt suddenly irritated. He didn\u2019t know why exactly, but Sheridan bugged him. The man had even hinted that perhaps Thor should find another diver for his team. He didn\u2019t like bringing in someone he didn\u2019t know well. Maybe he\u2019d have to hire someone else, he decided. They were looking for needles in a really giant haystack, and he wanted to do more of the actual diving himself. Well, tomorrow, at least, he would have an extra body around, if needed, with Sheridan there. That would work, for now, although he wasn\u2019t sure how long he wanted Sheridan on his boat. Maybe it would all work out without bringing in untested strangers.</p><p>The day had yielded nothing, but Genevieve still felt on top of the world.</p> <p>She had slept with every light in the bungalow on, dreading the darkness. But she had drifted off at some point and actually slept reasonably well.</p><p>She had tried to appear completely calm, competent and rational throughout the morning, even allowing the others to joke at her expense. She simply wasn\u2019t going to live this down for a while. And yet, despite her apparent calm, she had been terrified all morning, praying silently not to have any visions this time, not to see a dead woman telling her to beware.</p><p>All day, she had stayed closer to Victor than usual, all the while trying not to let him know what she was doing. But if she saw something, she was determined he was going to see it, too.</p><p>There had been no finds. But there had been no corpses in the water, either. That made the day a great success, as far as she was concerned.</p><p>By five she had washed down her own equipment, helped with the boat, showered and changed. She wasn\u2019t fond of hanging around by herself, so she hurried out to the tiki bar.</p><p>She was the first arrival from either of the crews. Clint saw her, and brought over a Miller Lite. \u201cYou do want a beer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s the only appropriate libation for kick-ass women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany likes pi\u00f1a coladas,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWell...some chicks can get away with it,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAh, the big guy himself.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve thought he had to mean Zach\u2014she hadn\u2019t met many people in her life quite as tall as Zach. But then she turned and realized Clint wasn\u2019t referring to Zach. He was talking about the man she had personally dubbed asshole.</p><p>To her displeasure, he headed right for her. Then again, the only other guests enjoying the thatched shade of the tiki bar right now were an elderly couple who had told her earlier they hailed from Ohio. A nice couple, but not exactly people any of them knew.</p><p>Not that he exactly knew her, Genevieve thought as he approached.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask if he could join her, just nodded\u2014eyes shaded behind dark glasses again\u2014and slid into one of the chairs. By the time he was seated, Clint had returned with a beer.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days, do you think I can head out with you guys?\u201d Clint asked him.</p><p>Thor shrugged, accepting the beer with a quick \u201cThanks.\u201d He looked up at Clint. \u201cWhat kind of a diver are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good one. I have a master\u2019s certification.\u201d</p><p>Thor gave Clint a long assessment, not a muscle in his face so much as ticking. \u201cSure. Take time off next week. But out on the boat, I\u2019m not just captain, I\u2019m God Almighty. If you can live with that...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, yes,\u201d Clint said, then caught himself. \u201cSorry, Genevieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s all right with the word,\u201d Thor said, smiling. Evidently he hadn\u2019t forgotten a single one of her words to him.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Clint,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd if you want, I\u2019m sure you can go out with us, too, one of these days.\u201d She hoped her sunglasses were every bit as opaque as Thor\u2019s and her smile every bit as pleasant.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Clint was still looking at Thor, as if for approval. After a moment, he moved away awkwardly, giving them a thumbs-up sign.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d Thor asked her once Clint had moved on.</p><p>\u201cFine, just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing down there, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there had been, I would have reported it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing strange, I meant.\u201d</p><p>She forced another smile. \u201cYou know, I really don\u2019t know who you think you are. I\u2019ve been out on these reefs all my life. I know every landmark. And I\u2019ll bet I make a discovery before you do.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, a small smile curving his lips. \u201cYou think you can outdo me, Miss Wallace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I can.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, amused. For a brief moment, she wondered what the hell she was doing. He had a sixth sense when it came to finding what was lost beneath the sea.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really throwing down the gauntlet.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was. And that, she realized, seemed to take him from believing she was nuts in one way to believing she was nuts in another, saner, way.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded icily.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIs this a dare? For real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a real relic\u2014not imagined,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cAll right. What\u2019s the bet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. The stakes hadn\u2019t entered her mind.</p><p>\u201cA round of beers?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cFar too cheap.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cI planned on a friendly wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friendly wager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So we\u2019re far from being friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have so little faith in yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be betting my house?\u201d she inquired lightly, feeling ever-so-slightly ill in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>He shook his head, his smile deepening. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of taking your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019d take it? And what would I be getting\u2014when I win?\u201d</p><p>He laughed out loud then, truly enjoying himself. \u201cI have a nice place in Jacksonville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have no desire to leave the Keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I have no intention of taking your home, either.\u201d</p><p>He was intent on winning, she knew\u2014despite the fact she couldn\u2019t see his eyes. There was a tightening, barely visible, in his muscles. His male ego was taking over. Testosterone was racing. It was pathetically immature, she thought.</p><p>She had started it.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get a chance to take my home,\u201d she assured him coolly.</p><p>\u201cWell, a round of beers is too paltry, claiming your house too serious. I guess we could give this thing some thought overnight, hmm?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish, Mr. Thompson,\u201d she said stiffly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, whatever you wish, Miss Wallace,\u201d he replied mockingly.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning, then, we decide the bet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d he murmured, looking amused. \u201cBut you won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>She was suddenly certain she knew the nature of his wager. It should have infuriated her. Instead, it just made the challenge greater.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d she murmured, suddenly aware of her own muscles tightening with the same tension, the same sense of challenge and ruthless determination, as his. Worse, his air of sexual innuendo only increased her fighting spirit.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to know. It\u2019s a pretty wacko thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do know, Mr. Thompson. The question is...what do I get when you lose? Sorry, a night in the sack with you isn\u2019t my idea of a prize.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cYou made quite an assumption there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She fought the wave of crimson that threatened to splash her cheeks and tried to bluff her way out of it. \u201cWhat kind of prize would be wacko to you?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p> <p>He smiled, for once a simple, deep and, she had to admit, very nice smile. \u201cWacko doesn\u2019t necessarily mean...The Seeker,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Seeker. You\u2019d get The Seeker.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThe boat is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom bow to stern, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...she\u2019s your livelihood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve sat back, totally confused. \u201cYou\u2019d wager your dive boat? Against...?\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, and this time it was far too sexy and seductive. \u201cWell, it was your suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mind wasn\u2019t moving in that direction until you said something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would have voiced it if you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she felt at that moment</p> <p>\u201cYou are joking, right?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He leaned forward; she found herself doing the same. The bet was between them; no one else would be in on it. \u201cI\u2019m not joking. If I lose, I\u2019ll pay up. Will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d risk your boat for a woman you think is crazy?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou have to be crazier than you think I am.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNot really. I won\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a bet?\u201d</p><p>She noticed that Jack had made an appearance and was dragging another table over. She realized that in a few minutes the tiki bar would be crowded, as the crews from both boats all began to put in an appearance. In fact, she could see Lizzie and Zach approaching. Bethany, Alex, Victor and Marshall would no doubt be over in another few minutes.</p><p>\u201cPeople are coming,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He gripped her wrist where it lay on the table. \u201cIs it a bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed quickly.</p><p>\u201cOne of us will have to lose,\u201d he said, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be me,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take excellent care of my boat.\u201d</p><p>A touch of dry amusement entered his eyes, and he leaned close.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll take excellent care of you.\u201d</p><p>The others were there before she had a chance to reply, and she rose to greet Elizabeth and Zach.</p><p>Maybe she was just being paranoid, but it seemed as if Elizabeth and Zach were looking at her oddly. Then again, it might not be paranoia. She hadn\u2019t been in great shape when she had surfaced yesterday. But Elizabeth had sympathy in her eyes as well as the same speculative look that Thor Thompson usually wore. \u201cYou doing all right? Everything okay today?\u201d Elizabeth asked, taking the chair her husband offered her and drawing it up beside Genevieve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m really sorry I caused such a commotion yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few weird experiences in the water, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie ran into a head once,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cWe were diving a small plane crash in the Everglades. It was pretty grisly.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve nodded, staring across the table at Thor, who was smiling at Bethany. Asshole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done some recovery in the Everglades, and it is brutal,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cThe muck...you can\u2019t see anything until it\u2019s in your face\u2014then, suddenly, you\u2019ve found a body part,\u201d Elizabeth agreed. \u201cBut...well, you must have seen something. Maybe we\u2019ll find whatever it was in the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Genevieve said. She looked at Thor again, clenching her teeth. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked rescue and recovery all that often, but we\u2019ve gone up to the Glades a few times. I don\u2019t know what this was.\u201d She waved a hand in the air. \u201cIt had to be someone\u2019s idea of a joke. A mannequin or something.\u201d She didn\u2019t believe it for an instant, but she was sick to death of the topic.</p><p>\u201cHey, anybody want to head out for dinner?\u201d Bethany asked as she and the others came walking over.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about eating here,\u201d Alex said. \u201cWe were planning a pretty early morning, at least three dives. I\u2019m going straight to soda water after this beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Genevieve inquired skeptically.</p><p>\u201cWe should call it an early night,\u201d Thor said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to meet back out here on the patio tomorrow at seven-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven-thirty?\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI thought it was eight-thirty? All we have to do is get up and walk out to the boats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur advisers are going to be here in the morning,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cPreston from the Coast Guard and Professor Sheridan, from the university.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cThor got the call when we were out today. Sorry, I missed telling you,\u201d Marshall said.</p><p>Had her own boss decided she was too far gone to receive information like everyone else? she wondered. Didn\u2019t he want her in contact with the higher-ups?</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess we should call it an early night.\u201d She started to rise, but Marshall smiled, putting a hand on her shoulder to stop her.</p><p>\u201cI say we let the crew of The Seeker buy us dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Elizabeth said cheerfully. \u201cThe hamburgers here are cheap enough. We\u2019ll let you guys buy us steaks after our first discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go give Clint our order,\u201d Thor said, rising. \u201cThough what Marshall isn\u2019t telling you is that all our meals go on an expense account. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers? Any vegetarians in the group?\u201d He looked at Genevieve.</p><p>Of course, she thought. He already considered her a bit strange, so no doubt she must be a vegetarian in his red-blooded, rough-and-ready, American-male world. She suddenly wished she were a vegetarian, just so she could see the look on his face when she told him.</p><p>She decided not to answer him. Instead, she rose determinedly. \u201cI think I\u2019ll skip dinner. I\u2019ll see you all at seven-thirty in the morning. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth looked at her in concern. \u201cYou really should have some dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bethany said, frowning.</p><p>Easier for you all to talk about me, if I just disappear, she thought, forcing a convivial smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got snacks in the bungalow,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She left then. Thor, ordering the food from Clint, didn\u2019t even glance her way.</p><p>The bungalows were set no more than twenty feet apart, but they managed to feel private. They were nestled against a thin forest of sea grapes, pines and spindly oaks that shielded them from the rush of Duval Street and beyond. A stretch of beach lay in front of some, while the deeper water and the docks flanked others. The property wasn\u2019t big; there were only three piers, one with local boats and two for guests. She could see Jack\u2019s ramshackle fishing boat and Jay\u2019s pleasure craft rocking gently at one pier, their work boats at another, awaiting the morning.</p><p>She entered her bungalow and looked around, admiring the casual plan. Each unit offered a refrigerator, microwave and wet bar, with a screen between the parlor/kitchenette/sitting area and the bedroom.</p><p>She turned on the television, feeling restless and eager for the sound of a human voice. Luckily, the television wouldn\u2019t rib her the way her so-called friends had.</p><p>She had a package of breakfast bars by the sink and decided they would have to do for a meal. She would be seen if she tried to leave their small resort, and she didn\u2019t want anyone to know she had just been seeking her own company\u2014or company other than theirs, anyway.</p><p>Munching an oat-and-honey granola bar, she stared at the television, then started flicking the channel changer. Nothing drew her attention. The sound of laughter filtered to her from the bar area, and she found herself annoyed that they all seemed to be getting along so well. She\u2019d been disturbed enough that her own friends were making fun of her. The Thor Thompson thing was more than she could stomach. The man was arrogant beyond belief.</p><p>She threw herself on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. She had to make the first discovery now.</p><p>The bet was ridiculous. Totally immature. She should just tell him in the morning that it was off. Except that she was the one who had started it.</p><p>Eventually the exertion of the day began to take its toll. She left the television on for company but changed into an oversize T, turned off the lights and tried to get some sleep. At first she could still hear the sounds of conversation and laughter, just as annoying as before.</p><p>But she needed rest. Last night she had slept at last but not long enough. At least today, she hadn\u2019t seen a thing in the water except fish and coral.</p><p>The world was well, she told herself.</p><p>A little voice crept in. Bull!</p><p>At last she drifted to sleep.</p><p>In her dreams, she was diving again. The sound of her breath through the regulator was soothing. The water was clear. Tangs and clown fish darted by. A very large grouper, a good six feet, hovered by the reef. The sun struck the water, the rays arrowing down. Anemones wafted with the current. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then...</p><p>She saw the woman. Hair drifting in golden streams. Head bowed, arms lifted in the easy current. White fabric drifting against the length of her body Feet tied to the weight that held her down.</p><p>Her head lifted. Her eyes opened. Her mouth worked. No sound came, but her eyes pleaded, filled with an infinite sadness.</p> <p>Then, from behind her, they rose....</p><p>Skeletal forms with decaying flesh cloaking their bones. Skeletal forms brandishing knives and swords, bodies rotting, clothing streaming from them in oddly colorful tatters.</p><p>They marched. Marched across the seabed, sightless eye sockets staring at Genevieve, bony jaws locked with determination.</p><p>She was frozen at first, unable to move.</p><p>She had discovered something, she realized. Something she wasn\u2019t meant to know.</p> <p>And now...</p><p>The sound of her breathing stopped.</p><p>The army of skeletons was almost upon her. She turned to swim away, only to discover that she was surrounded. There was no escape.</p><p>A rotted arm in a tattered jacket reached out for her. Suddenly skeletal arms were rising all around her, bony fingers nearly touching her flesh.</p><p>She sensed the girl\u2019s soundless warning. Beware...</p><p>She could almost smell the overwhelming scent of decay.</p> <p>Rotting flesh. A breath away...</p><p>It was impossible, she told herself. Impossible to be smelling death and decay beneath the surface, breathing through a regulator.</p><p>She awoke, jerking bolt upright in the bed, filled with dread and panic. She forced herself to breathe deeply. It was a dream, only a dream. Inhale, exhale.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. Ridiculous. She wasn\u2019t like this!</p><p>She felt thirsty, anxious for a glass of water, for something tangible. Tea. She could make tea. Maybe it was close enough to morning that she could just stay awake.</p><p>The television was still on. Paid programming. Some buff guy talking about his new cardio machine. She could see him past the screen dividing the room.</p><p>She let him keep talking. She liked the voice, and the light cast by the television. Actually, she needed more light. She turned on the bedside lamp.</p><p>It was only when she stood that she realized she was wet. And salty. As if she\u2019d really been in the sea. Swallowing hard, she rushed into the bathroom, turning on the main lights on her way. She started to splash her face with cold water, then looked into the mirror of the medicine cabinet above the sink.</p> <p>Her heart thudded; her breathing ceased.</p><p>There was seaweed in her hair.</p><p>3</p><p>T he strangest clattering noise was going on, as if someone was throwing pots and pans\u2014or as if chains were being furiously shaken.</p><p>Marshall Miro was aware of the sound, deep in the fog of sleep. He twisted and turned. He almost awoke. The sound was unsettling. It reminded him of...</p><p>What?</p><p>Something...unpleasant.</p><p>He fought the sensation and the noise. His body clock informed him it was too early to wake up.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Jack Payne was vaguely aware of a noise. It fit right in with the video game he was playing in his dreams. The game was called Kick-Ass Karena, and kick-ass it was. Gorgeous animated women battled one another and the player for supremacy. And when a guy won, it was all his: the booze, the women and the victory, hot or ruthless.</p><p>The sound just seemed to be part of the game.</p><p>Victor heard a noise and woke up with a start. For several seconds, he just sat up in bed wondering what the hell had woken him up.</p><p>He heard nothing. Nothing at all.</p><p>Groaning, he lay back down and prayed for a little more shut-eye.</p><p>Jay Gonzalez never quite made it up. The noise seemed to be coming from a distance. He wanted to get up. Wanted to stop it. But there were times when he fell asleep with the lights or the television on, then wanted them off but couldn\u2019t quite rouse himself enough to do it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even open his eyes, despite the fact that the sound disturbed him deeply. It brought to mind things that were...uncomfortable. Painful. It touched memories that....</p><p>That he wished would remain lost.</p><p>Ignore it, he told himself. Sleep.</p><p>The sound would be gone by morning.</p><p>Thor bolted up. What in God\u2019s name was going on?</p><p>He slid his legs over the side of the bed. He didn\u2019t turn on a light, having learned it was better to cloak oneself in darkness to check whatever might be going on in the light. Barefoot, he walked softly to the door of his bungalow and looked out.</p><p>A benign moon fell over the sand, water and nearby cottages. It was a serene picture. A semitropical night in paradise, all as it should be.</p><p>So where the hell had the noise come from?</p><p>Looking at the next bungalow, he saw that it was alive with light. It was Genevieve\u2019s bungalow, he was certain. Okay, so she liked things bright. Couldn\u2019t hang her for that.</p><p>Not that he wanted to hang her. Just...</p><p>Why the hell couldn\u2019t the woman be normal?</p><p>He started, suddenly certain he had heard a scream.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>It almost seemed as if the sound had come from inside his own head. He studied the cottage next to his own. If anything was wrong...</p><p>Swearing, he strode toward her lighted window.</p><p>Genevieve stared at her reflection in the mirror, all but paralyzed.</p><p>Okay, this was frightening. A dream was one thing. Hopping out of bed to plunge into the water in the middle of the night was another. What the hell was happening to her?</p><p>She nearly jumped out of her skin when she heard a hurried knocking at her door. She glanced at her watch. Five-thirty-five. Not as late as she had wanted to sleep, but early enough to get up for the day. Early enough for someone to be knocking at her door?</p><p>Then she heard her name called, softly but urgently. \u201cGenevieve?\u201d</p><p>She froze, recognizing the voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right in there?\u201d</p><p>She strode to the door, opening it to see Thor Thompson, as expected.</p><p>But for once he wasn\u2019t laughing at her; he actually looked concerned.</p><p>\u201cUh, good morning,\u201d she murmured, holding tightly to the door. \u201cOf course I\u2019m all right. Why are you asking?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as if she were suffering from something contagious. She realized she still had seaweed in her hair. Self-consciously, she reached for it.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear a...racket?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, pointing to the neighboring cottage. \u201cThat\u2019s me, next door. It sounded as if something was...clanking over here, and then it sounded like a scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClanking?\u201d she repeated blankly.</p><p>He shrugged, looking ill at ease. With her\u2014or himself? \u201cYeah, clanking, clanging...like chains. You can\u2019t mean to tell me you didn\u2019t hear anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I must have been sleeping,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOr swimming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwimming. You\u2019re all wet, and you\u2019re wearing...seaweed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I like a morning dip now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he murmured, staring at her flatly. \u201cYou just wake up, feel the urge and plunge right in? In the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and then,\u201d she said lightly. I am losing my mind, she thought. But he was the last person in the world with whom she would ever share that information.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right, I\u2019m going back to bed.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t all right at all. But there was no way in hell she was going to tell him so. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAre you all right? It sounds as if you\u2019re hearing things. You know. I see them, you hear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething was making a racket,\u201d he told her flatly.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been. You were swimming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to make coffee. If you\u2019d like some...?\u201d she added, praying her words were perfectly casual. Indifferent.</p><p>Hands on his hips, he looked at her as if she\u2019d just made another entirely insane suggestion, but then he shrugged. \u201cHell, I guess I\u2019m up for the day.\u201d</p><p>He followed her in. She went straight for the coffeemaker and then the sink, filling the pot with water, then setting the premeasured bag into place to brew. He\u2019d taken a seat on the futon that served as the sofa\u2014or guest bed. She realized he was studying her, and she was pretty sure she made an absurd picture, dressed in the long, soaked T-shirt, seaweed still in her hair.</p><p>Act like it\u2019s perfectly normal, she warned herself.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like your coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacho, huh?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNope. Best way to learn to drink it when you might be out for a while with milk that goes sour and a crew member who forgot to buy sugar or creamer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Perfectly sensible.\u201d</p><p>She sensed his shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe crazy people like it light,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s a new day,\u201d he said politely.</p><p>The coffeemaker chimed. She poured two cups, handed him one, fixed hers the way she liked it and sat across from him on one of the two wicker chairs that faced the futon.</p><p>\u201cI saw something down there,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cToday I\u2019ll figure out for myself what it was\u2014while discovering the first relic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just going to find it, you\u2019re going to find it today?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I\u2019m arrogant,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She lifted a hand. \u201cWhen the shoe fits...\u201d</p><p>He looked as if he was going to rise. To her deep annoyance, she realized she didn\u2019t want to be alone. \u201cWhat are they going to talk to us about this morning?\u201d she demanded quickly.</p><p>\u201cThe usual, I imagine. Stuff we\u2019ve already heard about preserving the reef while we excavate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working as carefully as we can,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThey just want to keep putting in their two cents, that\u2019s all. And I have to hand it to Preston\u2014his research was top-notch, and his logic appears to be the same.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. I read the letters written by Antoine D\u2019Mas, the pirate who watched the Marie Josephine go down. It all makes sense to me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. We agree on something,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>They both heard the sound of footsteps pounding on the sand and the knock at the door. \u201cHey, you up in there?\u201d Bethany called.</p> <p>Genevieve stood and opened the door. Bethany was ready for the day, it appeared. She was wearing cutoffs over her one-piece Speedo. Her hair was tied back, out of the way.</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re up early!\u201d she announced. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sit around alone any longer. There\u2019s nothing on the TV\u2014hey!\u201d she said suddenly, seeing Thor on the futon.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself,\u201d he greeted her, standing politely.</p><p>Bethany suddenly stared at Genevieve, as if really seeing her for the first time. \u201cYou\u2019re soaked. And there\u2019s seaweed in your hair. What the hell...?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve looked meaningfully at her friend, her back to Thor Thompson. \u201cYou know me. I woke up early and just couldn\u2019t resist the lure of the water.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy the dock?\u201d Bethany said incredulously.</p><p>Genevieve made her stare fiercer. \u201cOn the beach side,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t resist the water sometimes, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Right,\u201d Bethany murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you want coffee?\u201d Genevieve asked quickly, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cSure, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Bethany plopped down on the futon, where Thor joined her. \u201cYou still on for tonight?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Genevieve nearly spilled the coffee.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBarhopping,\u201d Bethany told Genevieve. \u201cWe\u2019re all going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we be barhopping?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to drink at every bar. But Thor, Lizzie and Zach haven\u2019t spent much time here. We\u2019re going to show them the must-do tourist places and then our own favorites. Hey, we\u2019re always in by four o\u2019clock. We can shower, eat somewhere cool, show them a few spots and be back by eleven-thirty. Marshall\u2019s coming, and Thor\u2019s the boss of his team, so...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you suddenly turn into such a stick?\u201d Bethany demanded.</p><p>\u201cHere. Take your coffee. Entertain yourselves. I\u2019m going to shower,\u201d Genevieve said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to shower\u2014to go diving?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want fresh seaweed in my hair,\u201d she said, and left the two of them together on her futon. She walked into the bathroom and closed and locked the door. She stared at her reflection in the mirror again. She realized she was deeply irritated and didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>She also didn\u2019t want them to leave.</p><p>Determined not to dwell on the situation, she hopped into the shower, washed her hair, then hopped out. Her suit from the day before was on the rack, and she slipped back into it, then found shorts and a denim shirt, and slipped them on over the suit. When she emerged, the two were still talking.</p><p>\u201cIt was weird. I thought it was coming from here, too,\u201d Bethany was saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Genevieve asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cWeird noises.\u201d Bethany laughed. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you better, I\u2019d have said you were cooking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard noises, too?\u201d Genevieve demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a real racket. I don\u2019t usually get up way before I need to\u2014especially when I\u2019m hoping to have some energy left at night,\u201d Bethany told her. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I was swimming, remember?\u201d Genevieve said curtly. It was enough to make her nuts. She saw a body, no one else did. Thor heard noises, so did everyone else.</p><p>She felt a disturbing, creeping sensation along her spine. How much did that matter when she had awakened wet with seawater? And she didn\u2019t remember a thing about leaving her cottage.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve probably got the tiki bar open by now. I\u2019m hungry,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thor and Bethany rose at her obvious suggestion that they all leave. He headed off to the cottage next door, waving a hand behind him. \u201cSee you in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Bethany stared after him. \u201cCool,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s just great.\u201d</p><p>Bethany looked at her in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? He\u2019s got a great reputation.\u201d She giggled. \u201cAnd damned good buns, too. And pecs. And biceps. And those eyes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not flirting with him or anything. He never fools around on a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read it. There was a magazine article on him not long ago. He\u2019s the kind who\u2019s married to his work. He grew up on the wrong side of town. Father walked out on his mother, she wound up dying of a heart attack at forty, trying to raise the kids on her own. He just doesn\u2019t want a family, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow noble,\u201d Genevieve muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter with you? I\u2019d think you\u2019d want to work with someone who wasn\u2019t hitting on you all the time. Everything with him is all business. Though I guess he\u2019s been a little hard on you over the...what you thought you saw in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little hard? He thinks I\u2019m certifiable.\u201d</p><p>Bethany giggled, sobered quickly and apologized. \u201cGenevieve...we\u2019ve all seen what we haven\u2019t really seen in the water at some time.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but have we all awoken soaked in seawater, with seaweed in our beds? she nearly asked aloud.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat. We have to make the first discovery. And we have to make it today,\u201d she said, catching her friend\u2019s arm and urging her toward the tiki bar.</p><p>Thor knew the history; he never went into anything without studying every shred of information about the project. Still, for some reason\u2014perhaps to enforce the part about avoiding destruction of the reef in any way\u2014they were seated on and around the picnic tables and benches by the docks, listening to what they knew already.</p><p>If ever a man had looked like he should be a professor of history, it was Henry Sheridan. He wore the kind of glasses that had Coke-bottle lenses, black frames, and, sure enough, he must have broken them, because they were held together between the eyes by a Band-Aid. His hair\u2014a combination of mousy-brown and gray\u2014stuck up in tufts from his head, without benefit of mousse. His face was very thin, ascetic, and his form was equally meager. Thor had the feeling the man seldom thought about eating, so lost was he on some intellectual plane.</p><p>Coast Guard Lieutenant Larry Preston was the antithesis of Sheridan. He was big, tall and hardy. He could swim and dive with the best of them, and though his job was to see that they followed the dictates of the state, Thor was pretty sure that history itself bored him. Preston liked action. He was wearing sunglasses and a uniform hat, along with his white shorts and shirt, and beneath those glasses, Thor had a feeling the man was keeping his eyes closed.</p><p>To the credit of the divers from both boats, they were at least putting on the pretense of rapt attention.</p><p>\u201cAs you all know, I\u2019m certain, we estimate that there are at least two thousand undiscovered wrecks in the waters around the state. But the sea is harsh. Ships don\u2019t usually sink intact. Winds and rains crack masts, and timbers split. On the way down, ships are at the mercy of tides and currents and their own weight and construction. Sometimes small vessels fare better, but huge ships\u2014even broken up\u2014can be an easier find. A ship such as the Marie Josephine might have left a field of discovery a mile long. She was brutalized by pirates in the midst of a storm. It\u2019s more than likely her remains are in far more than two or three pieces. Despite that, and as you\u2019re aware, we\u2019re not going in with any vacuuming devices. Especially since we\u2019re working on nothing more than speculation right now. It\u2019s likely that, should you succeed in finding the ship\u2019s resting place, you\u2019ll begin to find small relics. Coins, of course. Pottery, porcelain. Last year, as Thor can tell you, we unearthed a Civil War barge in the St. Johns river because an 1860s razor was found. By Thor.\u201d Sheridan nodded his way in acknowledgment. Lizzie applauded, and Alex Mathews let out an appreciative whistle.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Bethany murmured, offering him her generous smile.</p><p>Thor felt restless, anxious to be out on the water. He found himself studying Genevieve Wallace, who was staring straight ahead at Sheridan, her face betraying not so much as a flicker of emotion. The woman was fucking weird. She walked out in a nightshirt and jumped into the water?</p><p>While all kinds of noises were coming from her cottage?</p><p>\u201cRaccoons,\u201d he heard someone whisper.</p><p>Victor Damon was leaning casually against the edge of the next table over. He wasn\u2019t listening at the moment; he was grinning as he looked at Bethany.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Lieutenant Preston snapped.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d Victor said. \u201cBethany heard some kind of commotion last night. She forgets just how many cats and raccoons we have around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they won\u2019t be under the water!\u201d Preston reminded him.</p><p>\u201cRight, sir, absolutely not,\u201d Victor agreed.</p><p>Sheridan cleared his throat. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that you all understand the full history of this wreck. The Spanish settled Florida in the early 1500s\u2014St. Augustine is the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in the United States. The English got nervous about the Spanish being so close, and the French were trying to get a piece of the action, too. In 1763, Britain gained control of Florida in exchange for Cuba. Then came the Revolutionary War, and Florida remained loyal to the mother country. In 1784, the Spanish gained control again as part of the peace treaty that ended the American Revolution, but in 1821 they ceded Florida to the United States.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alex yawned. He caught the others staring at him and sat up straight.</p><p>\u201cHey, sorry, but I grew up here. I learned all this stuff in school,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but were you listening then?\u201d Victor asked.</p> <p>\u201cThis is important,\u201d Sheridan said impatiently. \u201cIt explains why our ship is where it is. During the American Revolution, the French helped the U.S. Unofficially, the Spanish helped the French give us help. Before he was a pirate, Jos\u00e9 Gasparilla was in the Royal Spanish Navy. He knew these waters from his military experience, and he continued his career as a pirate until he died in 1821. Rumor has it that before his ship could be taken, he cast himself overboard with weights tied to his feet\u2014one of his favorite ways to do away with prisoners. But shortly before his death, he heard of the Marie Josephine.\u201d He paused dramatically.</p><p>\u201cAn English ship, despite her name,\u201d Genevieve said into his silence.</p><p>\u201cYes, and Gasparilla was loyal to Spain. Unless, of course, there was a good Spanish ship to be attacked.\u201d He laughed, then continued. \u201cAt any rate, he heard that the Marie Josephine was nearby, having taken a late exchange of prisoners to Cuba, and heading back to jolly old England laden with the ransom that had been paid,\u201d Sheridan said.</p><p>\u201cHe probably felt he had a right to steal it,\u201d Marshall said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Sheridan agreed.</p> <p>Thor was startled when Genevieve disagreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was it at all. Gasparilla had fallen in love with the captain\u2019s daughter, Anne, who had managed to travel with her father and the prisoners to Cuba, because she wanted to be with a young Spanish nobleman they were exchanging. He and Anne had both been Gasparilla\u2019s prisoners previously\u2014that\u2019s how they\u2019d met\u2014and had been ransomed together by the English, who then made the young Spaniard, Aldo Verdugo, their own prisoner. Rumor has it that Anne tricked her father and managed to become a passenger on the ship once again to remain with Aldo. And Aldo, who should have been safely in Cuba, had stowed away on the ship so he could remain with his beloved Anne. Gasparilla, however, had also fallen in love with Anne when she was his prisoner. He had returned her to the English because of the ransom, and his fellow pirates wanted the money. He, however, wanted her back. That\u2019s why he went after the Marie Josephine.\u201d</p><p>Alex snorted. \u201cGen, that\u2019s nuts. Let\u2019s see...all that ransom money\u2014in gold\u2014or a woman. Come on! Women would have been a dime a dozen to a pirate.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve waved a hand in the air dismissively. \u201cHe wrote letters about his love for her,\u201d she claimed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are these letters?\u201d Sheridan demanded, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYour university,\u201d Genevieve said. Everyone was staring at her. \u201cHey, I made a trip up and studied everything in the library about the Marie Josephine, Gasparilla, the storm, everything. I was cross-referencing, and that\u2019s when I found the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you can\u2019t put a romantic spin on pirates,\u201d Victor teased her. \u201cThey were dirty, nasty thieves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have read the letters,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cEven a nasty, dirty pirate can fall in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have had tons of women,\u201d Victor insisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, but she was the one he wanted. Who knows why someone falls in love. Or maybe it was only an infatuation. The one he couldn\u2019t have. Anyway, he wrote about her in those letters, and he said he was in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to a girl,\u201d Victor countered, rolling his eyes and sighing.</p><p>Genevieve laughed. \u201cLeave it to a girl to beat the pants off you,\u201d she countered lightly.</p><p>Thor sensed camaraderie in their teasing. It was apparent this group knew one another well, that there was a deep underlying friendship between them. He realized that he envied it. He had a damned good crew, but they didn\u2019t always work together. Zach and Lizzie were totally reliable, but they were too close as a married couple to bond with anyone the way Marshall\u2019s people were bonded, even when they were teasing and testing one another. He\u2019d thought he liked it when business was business, but there was something approachiing an actual family relationship between Marshall\u2019s divers, and it not only appeared to be fun, it clearly worked.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby, please don\u2019t beat me up,\u201d Victor said in mock fear. \u201cHey, Alex, watch out. Our Gen is tough.\u201d He paused, grinning and sliding closer to her on the bench to set an arm around her shoulders. \u201cExcept, of course, when she\u2019s seeing things in the water.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve shook off his arm and smiled sweetly in return. \u201cEat shit and die, Victor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, hey! Knock it off, all of you. This is serious business,\u201d Marshall said.</p><p>\u201cHey, I meant it,\u201d Victor protested innocently. \u201cShe\u2019s the best. Ouch, Gen! That wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d she said, staring at him sharply with those mercurial eyes that could so easily light with laughter, then narrow on a dare. \u201cI did my homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Obviously...I haven\u2019t read everything in our archives,\u201d Sheridan said. Thor had the feeling the man would be finding the letters immediately on his return to the university.</p><p>\u201cIf Gen says they\u2019re there, they\u2019re there,\u201d Victor said, suddenly dead serious.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Marshall said wearily. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why Gasparilla attacked the ship, only that he did. And right as he was savaging her, a storm came through. Gasparilla got away, but the Marie Josephine went down. He purportedly came back to find the treasure, but the storm had shifted the sands and he couldn\u2019t find her, so the ship remains at the bottom of the sea with her complete treasure, or so we imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, that\u2019s about it,\u201d Sheridan said, sounding somewhat huffy. He\u2019d always been a nice-enough guy, if a little geeky, but it was obvious he hadn\u2019t liked being shown up by a diver. \u201cThe letters I do know about were left by one of his men, and from his descriptions of their position while awaiting the Marie Josephine, and calculating the currents, the effects of the storm and the natural shifting due to time, I firmly believe I have you exactly in the right area. But you need to find proof positive of the ship\u2019s final resting ground before we allow any disturbance of the reef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do you think we\u2019ll have to listen to this speech?\u201d someone murmured softly. Thor looked around. Jack Payne was shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cAs many times as Professor Sheridan wants to give it,\u201d Marshall said, staring at them. \u201cWe\u2019re being paid by the state,\u201d he reminded them. \u201cMoney raised mainly by the efforts of Professor Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>Thor leaned forward to speak at last. \u201cWe took more than simple pirate history into account while plotting our coordinates. When the ship sank, remember, half of what is land today wasn\u2019t then. The area has been dredged, filled in, blown away and literally remade by the army, the navy\u2014and Henry Flagler. When he was building his railroad, they didn\u2019t have a place for a depot, so he told them to make one. All that has been taken into account, along with weather charts and the tidal phenomena over the years. One of the main points we need to remember is that our ship\u2019s probably broken into many pieces, most of them entirely unrecognizable without careful scrutiny. And she\u2019s probably spread out over a wide expanse of ocean floor.\u201d</p><p>He was pleased to see that he\u2019d captured their full attention. And they remained riveted when Sheridan spoke again.</p><p>\u201cAnd the state will take full possession of the find, with each of you receiving a percentage,\u201d he reminded them.</p><p>Marshall rose suddenly, arching a brow to Thor. He nodded, knowing what Marshall was about to say. Sheridan had advised them both of the plan. For some reason the man seemed very wary of the divers he had chosen. He wanted the two crews mixed up, so there wouldn\u2019t be any chance of one group hiding anything from the other. Sheridan was not a trusting soul. The names had been mixed in an old bait bucket last night, to be drawn at random this morning, before the meeting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re mixing up the crews today. We\u2019ve done it by lot, so there\u2019s no complaining\u2014there shouldn\u2019t be complaining, anyway. We\u2019re all in this together. So forget your old buddy system, because you\u2019re getting new buddies. Here\u2019s the roster for today. Bethany, you\u2019re with Zach. Vic, you\u2019re with Lizzie, and I\u2019ll be the man on deck. Alex, you\u2019re teaming up with Jack Payne, and, Gen, you\u2019re with Thor. Preston will be staying topside.\u201d</p><p>He was going to be working with Genevieve?</p><p>That was something Thor hadn\u2019t known. Great. Just great.</p><p>Well, at least he could quickly dispel the notion that she was seeing dead people smiling at her in the water.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re retracing ground we\u2019ve been over where the sonar has indicated there is metal somewhere beneath the water. We may find a lost diving watch from last weekend, but hey, we\u2019re looking for a needle in a haystack, so...everyone ready?\u201d Marshall asked.</p><p>If he was unhappy, it certainly didn\u2019t seem Genevieve Wallace was thrilled with the arrangements for the day, either, Thor noticed.</p><p>But as they walked, heading out for the boats, Jack Payne slipped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cShould I grab that equipment bag for you?\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019ve been hauling my own gear forever, you know that,\u201d she said, but she smiled at him as she picked up her own bag and they all made their way down to the docks.</p><p>So he was partnered up with her, Thor thought.</p><p>He still felt the uneasy sensation of waking to the strange noises, then seeing her, soaked, salty and wearing seaweed in her hair.</p><p>She was a wild card, no doubt about it.</p><p>So why the hell was he so damned fascinated with her?</p><p>On shore, fine.</p><p>In the water?</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>It was going to be one hell of a day.</p><p>4</p><p>N either Genevieve nor Alex had been on The Seeker before, and Thor couldn\u2019t help a moment\u2019s pride when he watched them survey his boat. She was nice, with a great cabin, powerful motors and a large dive platform, allowing for easy exits and access. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took the helm himself as they headed out. Lieutenant Preston was at his side. \u201cSheridan\u2019s a jerk,\u201d he said above the roar of the motor.</p><p>Thor shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s all right. He\u2019s just really passionate about history, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Preston snorted. \u201cYeah, but did you see his face when Genevieve knew something he didn\u2019t? Thought he was about to have a stroke. I guarantee you he\u2019s on the phone right now to some grad student, reaming them out for missing a cross-reference.\u201d</p> <p>Thor shrugged. \u201cHey, finding the ship is the important thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, she\u2019s nice,\u201d Preston murmured then, studying the console. \u201cThere a second helm in the cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRadar, sonar, GPS...she all but drives herself, huh?\u201d</p><p>Thor turned, aware they were no longer alone. Genevieve was standing behind him, wearing her wet suit. Beyond her, the other divers had already attached their buoyancy control vests to their tanks, and tested their regulators and air, ready for the water when they reached the reef.</p> <p>Gen had a touch of challenge in her manner. \u201cGreat boat,\u201d she told him seriously. \u201cI\u2019m really going to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>He had to smile, then glanced down at his instruments to hide his pride. Marshall was leading at the moment, and in fifteen minutes, they would be dropping anchor and tossing out their dive flags.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re point man,\u201d Thor said to Preston, who nodded. Thor headed back to don his own gear. One of his fellow divers had already taken care of his BCV and his tank. Nevertheless, he checked out his regulator and air, along with the security of his tank.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust me, eh?\u201d she said softly, next to him, sliding down on the seat to secure her vest.</p><p>\u201cNever trust anyone when you\u2019re getting into the water,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t. But if you\u2019re with any of us, that\u2019s all you have to do. Final checks. We take care of each other.\u201d</p> <p>He felt his teeth grate. Was she suggesting that he\u2019d never dived with anyone trustworthy before?</p><p>She stood, balancing perfectly with the weight of her tank. Preston hurried up behind her, but she was already moving. \u201cHey, we\u2019re partners!\u201d Thor called after her.</p><p>She waved. \u201cI\u2019ll be hanging at the surface. Waiting. Take your time,\u201d she added sweetly.</p><p>Sweet? Like hell.</p><p>He was quickly ready, stepping off the dive platform to land beside her in the water before sinking slowly.</p><p>Ten feet away, Jack and Alex gestured, indicating their parallel paths.</p><p>Thor believed strongly in the methods they\u2019d used to determine the location for this search, but down here now, their depth a little over fifty feet, he wasn\u2019t at all certain they would make a discovery. They were a little west and south of the customary beaten dive areas, but they might as well have been pleasure divers off any tour boat. The reefs were majestic here, dangerous for anyone who didn\u2019t know the path to navigate through them\u2014or forced onto them in the midst of a roaring storm. There were areas where the coral outcrop\u2014with its rich abundance of life\u2014gave way suddenly to greater depths, and then fan coral would suddenly shoot sharply toward the surface. The colors seemed brilliant today. Purple fans, then a riot of fire coral. Blue-and-yellow tangs. Clown fish. A huge grouper...a lone barracuda. Something seemed to glisten in the sand deep below, and he propelled himself past the coral and downward.</p><p>The object was covered in sand. He dug, adrenaline racing through him. His fingers curled around the object, and disappointment washed through him. There was nowhere near enough sea growth on the object for it to have been in the water any length of time.</p> <p>He had found someone\u2019s lost dive knife. A nice one, actually. But definitely new.</p><p>He looked back, ready to let his dive buddy know it was nothing. She was right behind him, as ever, perfectly still and buoyant. She nodded her understanding.</p><p>He swam on.</p><p>No! Good God, no.</p><p>She was there. Thor was just ahead, but she was there. The woman with the long blond hair.</p><p>I don\u2019t see you! Genevieve raged inwardly.</p><p>The woman\u2019s head rose. The woman smiled with poignant, aching sweetness.</p><p>She was a ghost, Gen told herself. She wasn\u2019t there. But she was. She reached out...but didn\u2019t touch Genevieve. Then it seemed that a ghost of a ghost, an image of the woman but even paler still, rose from the creature weighted to the bottom. Rose...and pointed.</p><p>Thor looked back. Genevieve tried to stare back with perfect calm. She pointed.</p><p>Apparently he saw nothing. He frowned and looked in the direction of the woman, then swam toward the area bordering the coral where Gen indicated. He stopped just to the side of the ghost and gently began to sift through the sand.</p><p>So she was insane.</p><p>But the ghost\u2019s specter or aura or whatever was pointing, as well. Genevieve forced herself to breathe, listening to the lulling sound of her regulator. Okay, she was crazy. But the ghost wanted her to go in a certain direction.</p><p>She went.</p><p>Nothing. Nothing at all. Sand, without a hint that something might be lying beneath it. He looked back again. His partner was moving. She looked back at him and indicated that he should follow her.</p><p>She had the strangest expression on her face.</p><p>Shit! The woman was seeing things again. He was sure of it.</p><p>He waved, determined to get her attention, to snap her out of whatever strange hallucination had seized her. He had no idea where she was going, or why.</p><p>She nodded to acknowledge him but ignored his signal, indicating that they should circle around the coral outcrop rather than move on.</p><p>She didn\u2019t appear to be distressed; maybe he was jumping to conclusions. But neither did she seem willing to allow him to take the lead. With a controlled motion of her fins, she went shooting on farther to the southwest.</p><p>He followed her. She had stopped again, as if following some unseen guidance.</p><p>She dove deeper, past a strip of high fan coral, down to the seabed, another fifteen feet or so. He followed. It was as if she knew exactly where she was going. There was no hesitation in her movements.</p><p>At the bottom, she stopped and stared at the sand, then began searching.</p><p>She had lost it, he decided. Completely.</p><p>It was just sand. No different from the sand she had pointed to moments ago.</p><p>All right. He would give it a go. They were searching for a pack of needles in a pile of very large haystacks, so what the hell.</p><p>He began to search, as well, carefully, trying not to roil the sand. He unearthed a small ray. Disgruntled, the creature shot away.</p><p>She was sifting the sand, as well. She dug calmly, at first, but then she began to search frantically.</p><p>He watched her, ready to haul her up and, once they reached the surface, explode. Hell. He wasn\u2019t diving with her anymore, and that was that.</p><p>He reached out for her. She was strong; he hadn\u2019t planned on that. She wrenched her arm away from him. When she did, her hand hit the sand, hard. The granules danced up into the water, darkening it. He was about to go for her with a more powerful grip when he noticed something that didn\u2019t quite belong. Something that looked like a black, crusty blob.</p><p>He reached for it instead of for her.</p><p>When the object was in his hand, he felt the familiar\u2014and pleasurable\u2014adrenalin rush. He wasn\u2019t sure, but...</p><p>He reached for the dive knife in the sheath at his ankle, snapped it out and scraped carefully at the piece. He looked up as the black coat of time, oxidation and sea growth slowly gave way.</p><p>She was staring at him, waiting. Dead calm, perfectly buoyant, as if she were floating in air. Those eyes of hers, behind the mask....</p><p>She knew.</p><p>He looked at her and nodded slowly.</p><p>Gold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Bethany said, seriously confused. She untangled a length of her freshly washed hair with her fingers. \u201cYou should be on cloud nine. That was a Spanish gold piece you found. Minted in Cuba, Marshall thinks, though he admits he isn\u2019t sure yet. But if so...then it has to have come from the Marie Josephine.</p><p>Genevieve nodded, brushing her own hair out before the mirror. \u201cI am delighted.\u201d Delighted? Did she dare tell the truth, even to Bethany?</p><p>\u201cWell, Thor picked it up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who actually found the piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bite my head off. You two were together. The first discovery goes to you as a team. That will teach them to rib you! As if you could possibly be crazy in any way. They\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d She giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you Victor is sorry right now. I mean, you are his diving partner, really. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s kicking himself right now for what he said.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s brush paused halfway through the length of her hair. She turned and studied Bethany. \u201cWhat if I told you I saw her again?\u201d</p><p>Bethany laughed, flinging herself back on the bed. Then she realized Genevieve wasn\u2019t laughing and sat up soberly. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Please tell me you\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you repeat this, I will call you the worst liar in the world,\u201d Genevieve said forcefully, taking a seat on the edge of her bed. Bethany was staring at her with worry in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, Genevieve...you are teasing me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Bethany closed her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...then I won\u2019t say any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You have to talk to me.... I just don\u2019t think I want to hear it.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cPlease, Gen, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve sighed. \u201cI was down there with Thor. He was moving a little ahead. I felt as if I were being called, so I looked back, and...there she was. Exactly where I saw her before.\u201d</p><p>Bethany frowned. \u201cI...wow. I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing. Have you ever seen one of those movies with...astral projection, except that it wouldn\u2019t be exactly that...or heard about people who died on the operating table and were floating above themselves, looking down at their own bodies?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re seriously scaring me.

And led me\u2014pointing exactly to the place where I should look.\u201d</p><p>Bethany just stared at her.</p> <p>\u201cDid Thor see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the honest to God truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the woman again?

Just don\u2019t repeat anything I\u2019ve said. He\u2019d have me locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who. Thor Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gen, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d manage to get me thrown off the dive, I guarantee you.\u201d</p><p>Bethany walked over to her, setting a hand on her arm. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. I think...I think you\u2019d better not talk about any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to you, everything I\u2019m saying is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue in your own mind,\u201d Bethany whispered gently.</p> <p>\u201cI saw her. I promise you, what I saw was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Thor...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. Thor didn\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd today you weren\u2019t...scared?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. I was terrified at first. And then I had to pretend I wasn\u2019t seeing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused. The first day you nearly choked and drowned, it shook you up so much. And then...today...it\u2019s become your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know. Maybe today I gave her a chance because I was more afraid of Thor than I was of seeing a ghost. Bethany, I know this will sound strange, but I think she wants us to find the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Bethany murmured. \u201cI want us to find the ship, too.\u201d She stared at Genevieve anxiously. \u201cSo this is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve hesitated. She was still afraid. And not just of what had happened in the water.</p><p>She was afraid of what had happened this morning.</p><p>Waking up soaking wet, wearing seaweed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to slip out during dinner and see Jay Gonzalez.\u201d</p><p>Bethany sighed. \u201cOh, good move. Like Jay doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy, too. You talked to him, remember? He wanted to help. He couldn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can try again. Some poor woman is snatched somewhere every week, maybe every day. And there are always runaways who end up dead and unidentified,\u201d Genevieve reminded Bethany.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve...if you\u2019re seeing a body, a...ghost who seems to want to help you find a lost ship, don\u2019t you think the ghost should be someone from that era? I don\u2019t believe this. We\u2019re talking about a ghost. As if it\u2019s...real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is real,\u201d Genevieve said, wincing. \u201cI swear, Bethany. I don\u2019t think Thor Thompson would admit to seeing a ghost\u2014even to himself\u2014if one smacked him in the head. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, and why I should be seeing this...her, but I am. And it...it has to mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I know who you should see,\u201d Bethany murmured.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey Lynley,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cAudrey? The We-went-to-school-with-her Audrey Lynley?\u201d Genevieve said. It was her opportunity to stare at Bethany as if she were completely mad.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bethany said firmly.</p><p>Genevieve shook her head. \u201cOh, come on, Bethany. She doesn\u2019t even pretend that anything she does is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but aren\u2019t you the one telling me you\u2019re seeing a ghost?\u201d Bethany demanded belligerently.</p><p>\u201cShe reads palms, Bethany. Or she pretends to read palms. And she does tarot cards. I think she even has a crystal ball and pretends to see the future in it sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting as if you don\u2019t like her,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cI like her fine\u2014mainly because she uses her act for tourists and she entertains them\u2014she doesn\u2019t pretend she really has any answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could it hurt to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve sighed. \u201cIf it got back to the guys that I was talking to her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, she\u2019s an old friend. There\u2019s no law against talking to old friends.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve shrugged and started to speak but broke off when she heard a voice calling them from outside her front door. \u201cHey, in there!\u201d It was Victor. \u201cAre you guys ready yet? I\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Bethany called back. Then she turned back to Genevieve and spoke more quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve got Audrey\u2019s number, if you want it. Then again, she\u2019s got it posted all over Key West. If\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have her number. We live in a really small place, remember?\u201d Genevieve said softly, shoving Bethany toward the door. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare whisper a word of what I\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in ghosts at all, Thor?\u201d Bethany asked, sitting across from him at one of the group\u2019s favorite seafood places on Whitehead Street.</p><p>She was cute, he thought, and apparently an excellent diver, as well, with a round, charming face that made her appear even younger than her twenty-something years. There was a simple eagerness and honesty about her that was very appealing. Different, of course, from the way Genevieve Wallace was appealing. Genevieve seemed to throw off a musk of sensuality and sophistication without the least awareness. Bethany was like a puppy, ready to be cuddled.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Bethany cried suddenly, reaching down for her leg.</p><p>He\u2019d felt the kick. Genevieve was seated next to him, so there was no way he could miss knowing that she had kicked Bethany beneath the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an innocent question,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>He glanced at Genevieve. She stared at him, her expression unfathomable. She was close to him. Very close, in the small booth. Once again they\u2019d ended up together. Not that he would normally have had anything to complain about. Her perfume was subtle, an underlying tease. She\u2019d worn yellow, a halter dress that contrasted perfectly with her dark hair and bronze skin, and set off the elusive green of her eyes. Her every movement aroused his baser instincts, a fact to which she seemed indifferent, maybe even unaware. She was accustomed to being with friends. She obviously took pride in her appearance but did little to enhance what nature had given her. He was in a polo shirt and shorts. The sleek feel of her leg\u2014stretching out as she kicked Bethany\u2014had rubbed along his like a brush of living silk.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSorry. After the other day...you know.\u201d She stared firmly at Bethany. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just asked if Thor believed in them,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly, and stared at Genevieve again.</p><p>\u201cPass the bread, will you, please?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to our cemetery?\u201d Bethany persisted.</p><p>\u201cBethany, drop it,\u201d Genevieve warned. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say he did. If he hasn\u2019t been there, it\u2019s kind of a cool place, that\u2019s all,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cWe used to try to walk the girls by there late at night and scare them,\u201d Victor put in from across the table, next to Bethany. \u201cIt is a cool place. It was established in the 1840s, after a hurricane washed up a bunch of old coffins. You should check it out. The graves aren\u2019t set up like in New Orleans, though there are a bunch of mausoleums. They\u2019re stacked on top of one another. There\u2019s a nice little memorial to the Maine. And if you go by at night...it\u2019s creepy. I tried to make out with Genevieve there the first time.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve let out a sound of exasperation. \u201cThe first time?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, the only time. It was sad. She was three feet taller than me at the time. I needed a ladder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Genevieve told him.</p><p>He blew her a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWe could take the ghost tour,\u201d Bethany suggested.</p><p>Genevieve groaned aloud. \u201cI do not want to take the ghost tour. I thought we were going barhopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are barhopping,\u201d Alex said from the end of the table.</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s when most people see ghosts,\u201d Jack chimed in ruefully.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the Hard Rock Cafe is supposed to be haunted,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to the Hard Rock,\u201d Genevieve said. She had sounded a little impatient and looked at him with just a hint of apology. \u201cThe Hard Rock is fine, and the building is supposed to be haunted. One of the Currys committed suicide upstairs and a prominent citizen shot himself in front of the fireplace. The staff tends to be super nice and the food is fine. But you don\u2019t believe in ghosts anyway. It\u2019s still a fine place. It\u2019s just that...we\u2019re going to our local friendly favorite places. Hey, Clint is playing tonight, you know. We\u2019ve got to take our guests to hear Clint.\u201d She looked at Thor again. \u201cHe can do anything. His own stuff, country-western, Buffett, the Eagles\u2014and U2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, the girl down at Duffy\u2019s is good, too!\u201d Marshall called.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s great,\u201d Genevieve agreed.</p><p>Their entrees came, some fish, some chicken, some steak. Just like the appetizers, their main courses were delicious.</p><p>Just then the check came, and Thor picked it up.</p><p>Genevieve turned to him. \u201cAre you going to put it on a card? I\u2019ll just give you cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re all on a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m paying. We get reimbursed for meals,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll divvy it up later?\u201d Marshall called to him.</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make any difference. I\u2019ll just put it on the expense report.\u201d</p><p>Marshall gave him a thumbs-up sign. Genevieve flushed uncomfortably and hoped no one noticed.</p><p>By the time he had paid the check and returned to the table, the group had risen and was milling outside the front door. This town wasn\u2019t as insane now as it was during Fantasy Fest or the dead of winter, when the snowbirds flocked down, but the streets in Key West were busy year round. People did what they called \u201cthe Duval crawl\u201d\u2014just shopping and barhopping up and down Duval Street\u2014into the wee hours. In Old Town, shops, restaurants and bars often kept their doors open, air-conditioning wafting out onto the street. With the amount of people around them as they headed to the first bar, Thor didn\u2019t realize at first that both Bethany and Genevieve had disappeared.</p><p>In the bar, they found tables near the street-side door, far enough from the singer to be able to talk, enough inside that they weren\u2019t deafened by the crowds outside. \u201cChampagne all around,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe can toast our first find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Where is the rest of our party?\u201d Alex asked. \u201cGenevieve and Bethany are gone. Why would Genevieve disappear? She and Thor were the ones who made the discovery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d they go?\u201d Alex demanded.</p><p>Victor shrugged. \u201cSome errand...I don\u2019t know. They know the path we\u2019re following. They\u2019ll find us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, I say we toast without them,\u201d Alex said, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe should wait,\u201d Lizzie said politely.</p><p>\u201cToast,\u201d Marshall said, shaking his head. \u201cThey\u2019ll get here when they get here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChampagne will give me a splitting headache tomorrow\u2014mind if I toast with a beer?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>The sentiment went around. Marshall shrugged. \u201cBeer will be a lot cheaper. All right, beer all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrder two extra\u2014if our delinquents don\u2019t show up soon, we\u2019ll drink them anyway, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>Thor glanced out the open door, letting the conversation flow around him.</p><p>Thanks to Genevieve\u2019s height, he was certain he saw her.</p><p>She was just passing into an alleyway at the far end of the block.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d he said, and left to follow her.</p><p>\u201cThis is nuts,\u201d Genevieve told Bethany.</p> <p>Bethany stopped walking to stare at her. Genevieve had explained pretty much everything that had happened to her. She\u2019d had to, since Bethany knew she wasn\u2019t prone to simply walking out into the surf in her nightshirt. Bethany had been practical at first.</p><p>\u201cNo pirate bones are going to rise up and come get you,\u201d she had said thoughtfully. \u201cI mean, think about the time and the conditions. The sea, storms, sand...those skeletons are not intact anymore. Unless, of course, the pirates were buried. But then why would they be coming at you from the sea? Can you imagine being here after that storm when all the bodies floated up? Ugh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the skeletons were just a dream,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cBut you were all covered in seawater\u2014and seaweed,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cAnd then you saw the ghost again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was trying to help me. That\u2019s what\u2019s so weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you have to talk to Audrey. I called her and told her we\u2019d have about ten minutes. She\u2019s waiting for us. She\u2019s a great researcher\u2014that\u2019s where she gets all her ghost stuff when she tells visitors who\u2019s following them down Duval Street\u2014so she may know something after all. Hey, what can it hurt?\u201d</p><p>They had come to a small wrought-iron gate that led to a walkway between two buildings. A small cottage from the late nineteenth century was sandwiched in at the end of the walk. On the sign above the gate were written the words: Oracle; Tarot and Palm Readings. Appointments Suggested, Walk-ins Welcome.</p><p>Genevieve let out a sigh and opened the gate. Bethany followed her through.</p><p>Audrey was, as promised, waiting for them. She was standing at the wooden door to the house, opening it wide as she saw them arrive. \u201cHi, guys! Amazing, we live and work in the same town and hardly ever see each other. But your new project must be really exciting, huh? Welcome. Come in, come in.\u201d</p><p>Audrey wasn\u2019t quite as tall as Genevieve, but she was a respectable five-nine, and she bowed a bit to give Bethany a hug, then reached up just a shade to welcome Genevieve. She was a pretty woman, with long dark hair and flashing dark eyes. Genevieve had been afraid she would find her old friend dressed up in a shawl and scarf, calling herself Madam Zena or something. But Audrey was wearing a simple, fashionably casual cotton skirt and halter top, with sandals.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you, Audrey,\u201d Genevieve said, feeling guilty. They did live in an incredibly small community. Why didn\u2019t they keep up with old friends?</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cSo do you two. But then again, you\u2019re athletes, huh? Living in bathing suits, diving, diving, diving. So what\u2019s up? I can\u2019t believe you came for a tarot reading,\u201d she said, and looked curiously at Genevieve. \u201cBethany said you only had about ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seeing ghosts,\u201d Bethany said cheerfully.</p><p>Audrey\u2019s brows shot up as she looked at Genevieve. \u201cYou?\u201d she said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, tell her the truth!\u201d Bethany exploded.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I think I\u2019m seeing a ghost near the site where we think a wreck is lying. But she\u2019s turned out to be a helpful ghost,\u201d Genevieve said, feeling ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cI can do some historical research for you, see what I can find.\u201d She shrugged and grinned, looking at Genevieve. \u201cI\u2019ve never, uh, seen a ghost. I mean, this is a cool way to make a living, but...\u201d She shrugged wordlessly. \u201cAnyway...I\u2019m sure I can find something if I look into your wreck more deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done all kinds of research,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure who this woman might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Bethany protested. \u201cYou said Gasparilla was in love with the captain\u2019s daughter. Maybe that\u2019s who you\u2019re seeing. Maybe she spurned him and he drowned her.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve stared at Bethany. She didn\u2019t know why she hadn\u2019t thought of that possibility.</p><p>Yes, she did. She hadn\u2019t believed the first time that she\u2019d really seen a ghost. She\u2019d been looking for a prankster\u2014or the victim of a recent murder.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s an idea, certainly.\u201d She winced, looking back at Audrey. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t freak out at the sight of her the second time I saw her, she led me to the first find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Audrey said, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell any of this to anyone, please?\u201d Genevieve begged.</p><p>Audrey shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t. But if anything comes out of this...I\u2019m working on a book of Key West ghost stories right now. If there\u2019s something to this Gasparilla connection, can I use this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But for the moment, if my co-workers think I\u2019m seeing a medium so I can communicate with the dead, I won\u2019t be working on this project much longer,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Audrey smiled and said softly, \u201cI\u2019d never betray a friend. But, hey, let me see your palm.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was tempted to lock her hands behind her back like a frightened child.</p><p>\u201cGive her your hand,\u201d Bethany said impatiently.</p><p>When Genevieve did so, she was instantly disturbed.</p><p>Because Audrey seemed disturbed. She frowned deeply, her mouth pursing. \u201cInteresting,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Genevieve asked warily.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing, really. I just go by the books. It\u2019s all a lot of bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey, what the hell do you see?\u201d Genevieve demanded.</p><p>Audrey stared up at her for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cSee your lifeline? It doesn\u2019t stop here...but it suddenly gets very jagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cUm. Well...a tremendous disruption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cListen, like I said, it\u2019s all a load of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Genevieve persisted.</p><p>Audrey shrugged unhappily. \u201cA disruption in life...catastrophic illness\u2014or a deadly peril. According to your palm, you\u2019re going to face an incredible danger. And there\u2019s a break that means you may survive it and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Genevieve demanded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you may not.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>\u201cO h,\u201d Audrey continued, \u201cwait, it\u2019s...it\u2019s not really all that bad. It looks as if the line does continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to die and come back to life, is she?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cBethany!\u201d Genevieve snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to become a zombie,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cI...well, I\u2019ve just never seen anything like that line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis just gets better and better,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cIt probably means nothing at all,\u201d Audrey said with a shrug and a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve told you\u2014this is just how I make my living.\u201d She grinned. \u201cWe have ghost tours down here, too. Do you think all the guys leading those tours believe in ghosts? We\u2019re all vulnerable to the power of suggestion. It\u2019s how I keep \u2019em coming back. And if you repeat that...\u201d She tried\u2014and failed\u2014to look threatening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch soon,\u201d Bethany suggested. \u201cWe\u2019re not diving on Saturday.

I don\u2019t open until five on Saturday, when the tourists are filling the bars,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cI give my very best readings to drunks,\u201d she assured them with a trace of wry amusement.</p><p>\u201cSaturday, then,\u201d Genevieve confirmed. \u201cAnd, Audrey...thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. See you two then,\u201d Audrey said.</p><p>She stood in the doorway, watching as they left.</p><p>\u201cThat was kind of stupid,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>\u201cSeeing Audrey?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cSeeing Audrey for five minutes,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI feel guilty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd freaked out,\u201d Bethany added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not freaked out,\u201d Genevieve protested.</p><p>\u201cWell, what she said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat she said was that she\u2019s a fake,\u201d Genevieve said sternly. \u201cAnd I feel guilty for not being a better friend and keeping up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to see her for lunch,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m getting a little worried, even if you\u2019re not.\u201d She held open the wrought-iron gate to the walkway so Genevieve could follow.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m cracking up\u2014or that a ghost is after me?\u201d Genevieve asked wearily, closing the gate behind her as they reached the street.</p> <p>Then she froze.</p><p>He was there.</p><p>Thor Thompson. Casually leaning against the wall. He smiled as they saw him, nonchalantly glancing up at the sign that announced Audrey\u2019s business.</p><p>She could have held her temper, she told herself afterward. Should have held her temper. He hadn\u2019t said a word.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to. She saw the way he looked at the sign, then looked at her.</p><p>She walked up to him furiously. \u201cYou followed me,\u201d she accused him.</p><p>He seemed a lot taller. She wasn\u2019t short, especially in heels, but he was able to look down at her.</p><p>\u201cWe ordered your drinks for you. We didn\u2019t know where you were. Nothing quite as bad as warm beer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou followed me,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou son of a bitch. You had no right.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cMaybe I followed Bethany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Bethany ought to be getting out of here right now,\u201d Bethany said nervously. \u201cIf you\u2019ll both excuse me\u2014\u201d</p><p>They turned to her simultaneously. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Bethany said, acutely uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cFor your information, Mr. Thompson, we were just stopping in to say hello to an old friend from school,\u201d Genevieve advised him. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your concern.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the sign again, then cast her a disdainful look. \u201cEverything you do right now concerns me. I need you sharp and on the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me sharp and on the ball? Have you forgotten something? I don\u2019t work for you. I work for Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cYour group got hired because I recommended you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMarshall and I make decisions together, sure. That\u2019s how good work is done. But I get the final say. On everything.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve narrowed her eyes as she stared at him. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never threaten people. I take action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have any difficulties with me today?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did you follow me?\u201d she demanded again. \u201cNever mind. But don\u2019t do it again. I\u2019ll quit before I\u2019ll stand for being treated like a prisoner.\u201d</p><p>Not a muscle twitched in his face. She was suddenly afraid the man wanted her to quit. \u201cDon\u2019t be melodramatic. It\u2019s immaterial to me whether you stay on or not, but if you do...then it\u2019s important that you live in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou son of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, whoa. Come on, you two. The others will be missing us by now,\u201d Bethany said lightly. \u201cThis was a great day. Can\u2019t we just be happy with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the moment,\u201d Thor said. His eyes hadn\u2019t left Genevieve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Bethany urged, slipping her arm through Genevieve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRight. Fine,\u201d Genevieve said tightly.</p><p>She managed to walk a full five feet before spinning around to point a finger at him. \u201cStop it. Just stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cJudging me, worrying about me, following me. Thinking that I\u2019m crazy and dangerous and shouldn\u2019t be on this project.\u201d</p><p>His hands went to his hips, he tilted his head, and his jaw seemed to lock. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m walking behind you and that\u2019s it. If that disturbs you so much, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be on this project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better than you are. I proved it today.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cI actually found the gold,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOf all the insufferable assholes! I led you to it. I knew where we should be digging. I\u2019m the one who made the find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce again, I repeat, I picked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pathetic. A man of your reputation stooping to such a desperate attempt at glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked it up. That\u2019s a simple fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but you two are both missing something. We\u2019re working as a team here. Does it matter who actually picked up the gold?\u201d Bethany demanded</p><p>It mattered. Oh, yes, it mattered, Genevieve thought.</p><p>\u201cWe really need to join the others,\u201d Bethany continued. \u201cWe might have taken the first step today toward a historic discovery. Let\u2019s go celebrate with a drink. You two can fight later, if you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I can fight with this asshole later,\u201d Genevieve snapped.</p><p>To Thor\u2019s credit, he kept his mouth shut, making Genevieve wish she\u2019d had the control to do so, as well.</p><p>This time Bethany stepped between them, joining arms with both of them and determinedly making her way down the street.</p><p>Genevieve strode into the bar quickly. The singer was on break; the sound system was piping out something with a beat, and couples were filling the floor. Without hesitating, she headed straight for Victor, dragging him out on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you guys?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust down the street,\u201d she said, swirling beneath his arm. One good thing about Victor: they\u2019d known each other forever and danced well together. She didn\u2019t feel badly about using him tonight; he dragged her out on the floor whenever he wanted to make sure some hot female knew he was capable of moving to the music. Right now, spinning about in a high-speed hustle was definitely a good way to release some of the energy she was feeling. And the anger.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you tonight?\u201d Victor asked quizzically. \u201cI\u2019m the one who should be in a huff. You\u2019re my partner, but you wait until you go off with the stud to come up with the goods.\u201d</p><p>She turned under his arm and faced him again. \u201cI\u2019d rather dive with you, believe me,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we come up with something before? Oh, right. Because you were busy seeing bodies in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it, Victor.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBoo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gen. Ease up.\u201d</p><p>Ease up? Yes, she needed to. She didn\u2019t want to quit. He might be in charge, but this was her home. She wanted\u2014deserved\u2014to be a part of this.</p><p>And she was the one who had found the relic.</p><p>\u201cGen?\u201d Victor said, breaking into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody looks ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, they had to pass under Audrey\u2019s sign to reach their next destination. Genevieve made a point of ignoring it and walking ahead. She linked arms with Marshall, keeping up with him, ahead of Thor Thompson. She tried to talk with Marshall as casually as she always did, but she could tell she was talking too much. She tried to slow herself down.</p><p>She\u2019d never touched a drop of her beer in the first bar. When they entered the second, she hailed the bartender and made a point of buying the first round and delivering the drafts to each member of their party\u2014even Thor.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to remain at the table, but Victor shook his head when she tried to get him out on the floor. When she tried again, he pleaded exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hit the dance floor with you,\u201d Thor said, standing.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make anyone dance,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you\u2019re not,\u201d Victor piped in.</p><p>Flushing, she found herself spinning out on the floor. The band was playing a rumba. She had no idea what to do, but apparently Thor Thompson had\u2014somewhere, sometime\u2014learned how to dance. He knew what he was doing, leading her, not pushing her around. Under other circumstances he would have been an exceptional partner, even the perfect height for her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good music. A nice place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a great place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange. You don\u2019t believe much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell the truth all that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we all see different things as truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not even telling me what you see as the truth,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want the truth,\u201d she said quickly, looking downward. Then she stared up at him again, \u201cAnd you\u2019re not great at telling the truth yourself.\u201d</p><p>He drew back slightly, looking at her, lips twitching. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made the find. You lost, but you don\u2019t want to give up your boat, so you\u2019re believing what you want to believe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed. \u201cI made the find, and you don\u2019t want to have sex, so you\u2019re believing what you want to believe.\u201d</p><p>She was startled to find herself blushing to her roots. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it is to me.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAll right. On this matter, let\u2019s call it a draw.\u201d</p> <p>She arched a brow. \u201cBecause I won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I won.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cLook\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call it a draw,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she felt so comfortable about that.

Not with him!</p><p>Why not? a voice at the back of her head teased.</p><p>Because he was an idiot. Because of the patronizing way he treated her.</p><p>Still...sex, just sex...he was great to look at, would be exciting to touch....</p><p>\u201cA draw,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cGreat. With you trying to get me to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, I\u2019m worried. I think you\u2019re exceptional, but...you\u2019re just not on your game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m a big girl. I\u2019ve been on my own in the world for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She turned beneath his arm. \u201cMy folks were killed in a car crash when I was nineteen. I\u2019m an only child,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad things, hurtful things, are never long enough ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we learn to live with them.\u201d</p><p>She realized suddenly that the music had ended and they had stopped moving, but she was still leaning against him.</p> <p>She stepped back. \u201cTruce. But please, don\u2019t follow me, and don\u2019t worry about me. Not unless I do something terrible, and I won\u2019t. I swear, I\u2019ll be courteous, hardworking and entirely professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re working?\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cOf course while we\u2019re working,\u201d she said, nodding.</p><p>They headed back to the table. She took a seat between Alex and Victor. Bethany was across from her, beaming.</p><p>\u201cYou two looked great out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Victor protested. \u201cShe looks great with me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they were getting along so nicely,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t get along?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>Genevieve took a long swig of her beer. \u201cWe get along just fine,\u201d she said, staring hard at Bethany.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jack echoed, lifting his beer. \u201cTo all of us. One big happy family,\u201d he said, and grinned.</p><p>A toast went around the table, and Genevieve finally let go and felt comfortable. Eventually she danced with Jack, then Marshall. Lizzie and Zach got out on the floor, too.</p><p>Finally Marshall broke it up. \u201cOkay, time to go home. Tomorrow is a workday.\u201d</p><p>The streets were a little quieter as they walked back to the resort. By then Genevieve had ditched her shoes. When they reached the cool sand leading to the cottages, it felt good beneath her feet.</p><p>The night was beautiful. The dead heat of the sun was gone, and there was no hint of rain. A soft breeze blew in from the water.</p><p>\u201cGood night. Tomorrow at eight sharp, guys,\u201d Marshall called.</p><p>\u201cEight?\u201d Victor protested. \u201cOh, God, not another history lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019re seeing a few computer printouts of how the ship might have broken apart,\u201d Thor informed them.</p><p>Alex groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t they know we\u2019ve all been on a zillion wreck dives?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt will be useful. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Victor said, giving a wave and heading off. They all began to do the same. Genevieve hurried toward her own cottage.</p><p>She was suddenly anxious to get inside.</p><p>Before she was left out on the sand all alone.</p><p>Once inside, however, she found she wasn\u2019t any happier. She was afraid to go to sleep.</p><p>Since it was her cottage and she was alone, she could do whatever she wanted to, so she turned on all the lights and the television, and forced herself to brush her teeth, wash her face and get ready for bed.</p><p>It occurred to her that anyone noticing her place would realize she kept it brilliantly lit all night, but she was going to operate on the premise that it simply wasn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business. She thought about calling Bethany and suggesting they share a place for the night, but she was loathe to do that if she wasn\u2019t in an actual panic. And she wasn\u2019t\u2014not yet, anyway.</p><p>She found a good movie on the SciFi channel. She didn\u2019t believe in aliens, so the creatures taking over the earth didn\u2019t scare her. She kept the remote in hand though, just in case she dozed off and awoke to something about ghosts.</p><p>She prayed she would be able to get a decent night\u2019s sleep. She desperately needed it if she was going to be the ultimate professional on this dive.</p><p>\u201cThat would be cruel,\u201d Alex said, his hands cradling a bottle of beer. He, Jack and Victor had decided on one last drink, just hanging by the tiki bar. It wasn\u2019t late, not even eleven, and none of them had consumed more than two beers during their supposedly wild night of barhopping.</p><p>The night was really nice. A cool breeze, no mosquitoes. It felt good to chill out at the tiki bar. No one else was around, just the three of them.</p><p>Jack was staring at Victor as if he\u2019d entirely lost his senses. \u201cYou want to what?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Victor said, leaning forward, a mischievous glint in his eyes. \u201cGen thinks she saw something, so we set something up to scare her, she sees that it\u2019s not real, we all get a laugh, and she feels better about the whole thing. It\u2019s not cruel at all.\u201d</p><p>Alex shook his head. \u201cVictor, you are one sorry liar. You want to scare her. Face it. You\u2019ve had a hard-on for Gen since you\u2019ve been kids. Now she\u2019s getting into Thor, and you\u2019re pissed.\u201d</p><p>Victor frowned, sitting back. \u201cThat\u2019s bull. She\u2019s my best friend. We\u2019d never mess up our friendship. And she hates Thompson. Can\u2019t stand him. Can\u2019t you tell? Wait. Don\u2019t repeat that, Jack. I keep forgetting you\u2019re with his crew.\u201d</p><p>Jack arched a brow. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? We aren\u2019t two crews anymore. We\u2019re one crew. One big flippin\u2019 happy family. But I\u2019ve got news for you, Victor. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really hate we\u2019re seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeat,\u201d Jack said, grinning. \u201cYou mark my words\u2014something is going on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks she\u2019s a lunatic,\u201d Victor said flatly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never wanted to sleep with a woman you thought was off the wall?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cWhat man out there hasn\u2019t found himself dying to bang someone gorgeous, no matter what he thought of her sanity, brains or anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe resents him. Big time,\u201d Victor said flatly. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t sleep around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to you,\u201d Alex said, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re getting all big-brother over there. And you\u2019re the one who wants to trick her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in or out?\u201d Victor asked him.</p><p>\u201cJust what the hell do you intend to do?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing major. Just put a blond mannequin on her porch for when she wakes up,\u201d Victor said. \u201cHonestly, don\u2019t you think she\u2019ll get a laugh out of it, too, and then she\u2019ll be past all that panic the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going to get a mannequin at this time of night?\u201d Jack demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from here. I know half the shopkeepers on Duval Street,\u201d Victor said, grinning.</p><p>Sometime, right around when the aliens had managed to evolve from being pod people, Genevieve at last managed to drift off.</p><p>She never knew just when restful sleep departed and the dreams began. She saw nothing but darkness.</p><p>And then, from the darkness, the woman emerged.</p><p>She strode forward with purpose. In her dream state, Genevieve groaned.</p><p>Go away, she begged.</p><p>The woman moved in a cloud of white. It was some kind of beautiful, floating negligee. Her hair was long and blond, drifting as she walked, as if she were perpetually touched by the sea\u2019s current, or by a breeze off the shore. Her eyes were large, tragically sad.</p><p>\u201cBeware...\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>\u201cGo away, please! Oh, God, please, go away. I can\u2019t help you, I don\u2019t understand. Why are you torturing me?\u201d Genevieve pleaded silently.</p><p>\u201cBeware...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeware of what?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer. She was roused from sleep by a small noise that was real enough to jar her from the nightmare.</p><p>Dragged from sleep, she lay on the bed, blinking. The lights remained on, as they had been. On the television, a space ship was whizzing by planets and stars. She blinked and looked around. Everything looked the way it should. She couldn\u2019t tell what had awakened her.</p><p>She rolled over to look at the clock on the table. Five-thirty. Late enough to get up.</p><p>She crawled off the far side of the bed and headed for the bathroom. She was loathe to look in the mirror\u2014afraid she would find seaweed in her hair again. But there was nothing disturbed about her appearance, other than the state of her hair, which was in wild tangles. With a breath of relief, she leaned down to brush her teeth and wash her face. She grabbed for her towel, dried her face, then hesitated, once again afraid to look in the mirror, wondering if a face would appear beside her own.</p><p>But there was nothing. She headed into the living area and started her coffeepot brewing, still wondering what had woken her up. While she waited for the coffee, she walked back into the bathroom, found one of her bathing suits, slipped into it, then tossed on one of her terry cover-ups. The coffee was done.</p><p>Outside, the pink-and-yellow streaks that heralded morning were beginning to shoot nicely across the sky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened her front door to step out and check the weather.</p><p>Sheer panic seized her.</p><p>She was staring at a face. At a woman her own height. She nearly screamed at the top of her lungs.</p> <p>But she managed not to. Then she gritted her teeth, fury replacing abject fear.</p><p>The blond wig was slightly askew, the part somewhere over the ear. The dummy was arranged at an odd angle, one arm raised as if it were double jointed.</p><p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d she muttered. Then she said it more loudly, just in case the culprits were hanging around to catch her reaction. They were probably somewhere like a pack of adolescents, waiting for her to scream.</p><p>She swore, dragging the mannequin to the far side of the porch. \u201cI hope it\u2019s ruined, and I really hope whoever lent it to you charges you big bucks,\u201d she said more loudly. \u201cAre you guys out there?\u201d she called. \u201cFunny, very funny, ha-ha.\u201d</p><p>She stood, tense and seething, for several seconds, then decided that Victor\u2014it had to be Victor\u2014and whoever had joined him in this prank had to pay. She dragged the dummy off the porch and across the sand, then dumped it into the water. She dusted her hands and returned to her cottage, irritated that no one seemed to have been waiting to watch her reaction. She had hoped Victor would come running from some hiding spot, alarm on his face when he saw she was about to destroy the mannequin.</p> <p>In the cottage, a sense of satisfaction guiding her, she poured a cup of coffee and wandered back into the bedroom, planning to catch a bit of the morning news.</p><p>As she reached the near side of the bed, she came to a halt, a feeling of deep apprehension seeping into her.</p><p>She looked down at the rag rug that lay beside the bed and beneath her bare feet.</p><p>It was soaked. A glacial chill began to sweep through her. She closed her eyes. Don\u2019t panic, she told herself. One of those idiots got in here, too. That\u2019s all it is.</p><p>No. They couldn\u2019t have known about her dream. They couldn\u2019t have known she had seen the walking dead woman, heard her warning.</p><p>Beware.</p> <p>She groaned, sinking down on the bed.</p><p>It was then that she began to hear the shouts and the bloodcurdling scream. She raced outside, her fingers locked around her coffee cup.</p><p>From the cottage next to hers, Thor Thompson had emerged, as well.</p><p>He was looking down at the beach, a fierce frown knitting his brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She looked over at him, then at the cluster of people down by the water, hovering around something she couldn\u2019t quite make out.</p><p>Her heart sank. Bethany was down by the water. So were Marshall and Bert, the owner of the resort. Lizzie and Zach were there, too, staring down at the mysterious form.</p><p>\u201cCall 911!\u201d she heard Marshall bellow.</p> <p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a body,\u201d Thor said, watching the shore, not even glancing her way. \u201cThey\u2019ve found a body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God! No, it\u2019s not a real body. One of those idiots was playing a joke on me with a mannequin. I dumped it in the water.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, his frown deepening.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, I\u2019m telling you!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, as if he should have been aware before speaking that she wasn\u2019t sane. Then he started to sprint toward the group by the water.</p><p>She set her cup on the porch railing and started toward the water herself, ready to point out to them that they were all victims of a cruel joke\u2014just as she had been.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see\u2014\u201d she began, brushing impatiently by Bethany.</p><p>But then she saw for herself.</p><p>It was no mannequin lying on the shore, tiny crabs crawling over it, seaweed draping it.</p><p>It was a woman\u2019s body.</p><p>Mottled, gray...eaten away in places. She lay faceup, her sightless eyes turned toward the cottages.</p><p>6</p><p>F or hours there was no discussion about anything other than the body found on the beach. They were horrified, saddened\u2014and glad. The woman had been a stranger. She had been brought into their lives by her death, but they hadn\u2019t known her in life.</p><p>By ten o\u2019clock the body had been removed. Despite the excitement previously generated by finding the coin, they were breaking off operations for the day. The discovery of the body was a police matter. None of them had known the woman, and as yet, no one even knew who she was. Still, with detectives and forensic units combing the beach and the docks, yellow crime-scene tape everywhere, and the police struggling to keep curious tourists and locals at bay, there was too much confusion going on and no point trying to work.</p><p>Hours passed. None of them left the tiki bar unless they were asked to talk to Jay or one of his officers.</p><p>Jack\u2014who had actually been the first one to see the body\u2014had spoken with Jay Gonzalez the longest, while the others had provided what they could, which was pretty much nothing.</p><p>The woman had been in the water several days, at least, before she had washed up on the beach. Where she had gone in, no one knew. In the next few days, forensic techs and medical examiners would analyze clues on and in the body, as well as currents and tidal patterns, trying to discern just where she might have gone in to arrive on the beach where she had.</p><p>A computer image was already being created from a photograph of her face. It would be shown on the evening\u2019s news, not just locally but all over Florida, and ultimately, around the country if necessary, and with luck they would soon know her identity.</p><p>Though the police hadn\u2019t made any announcements as yet, Thor was pretty sure he knew part of her story. Ragged marks at her ankles indicated that she\u2019d been tied to some kind of weight\u2014alive or dead, he didn\u2019t know. A medical examiner would be able to answer that question, however.</p><p>\u201cBoy, and we all thought you were seeing things,\u201d Jack said suddenly, looking at Genevieve.</p><p>She had been deep in thought and started when he spoke to her.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you saw a woman in the water. And there was a woman in the water,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Thor thought at first she would nod\u2014not pleased, because who could be pleased by such a circumstance?\u2014but at least glad she hadn\u2019t been crazy.</p><p>But she just stared back at Jack.</p><p>\u201cThough God knows, we all searched exactly where you had been, and we couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she lodged in the coral somewhere,\u201d Victor said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see how.\u201d He looked glum and quiet.</p><p>Genevieve hadn\u2019t offered an opinion. She had turned toward the beach where police and bystanders were still milling. Only the little patch of sand where the body had actually lain was still cordoned off.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Lizzie murmured.</p><p>Genevieve turned her attention back toward the group. \u201cI wonder what happened to the mannequin,\u201d she said, staring at Victor.</p><p>He flushed, then frowned. \u201cWho told you what we were planning?\u201d he asked, staring accusingly at Jack.</p><p>\u201cHey! I didn\u2019t say a word,\u201d Jack protested, adjusting his big skull-and-crossbones earring. \u201cI thought we all decided not to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you know what we were up to?\u201d Victor asked. Thor was surprised to feel a sense of growing unease. So that was what she\u2019d been talking about, spouting about a dummy when there was a pathetically dead woman lying on the beach.</p><p>Genevieve stared at him, shaking her head. \u201cYou asshole, Victor! When I woke up, there was a mannequin on my porch, right in front of the door, waiting to greet me. I threw it in the water.\u201d She looked decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cShe became real,\u201d Bethany whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, good God,\u201d Marshall groaned. \u201cWhat the hell is the matter with all of you? Victor, did you put a mannequin on Genevieve\u2019s porch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Victor protested.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Well she was there,\u201d Genevieve said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Victor protested, staring at her. \u201cAlex said it would be cruel. I just thought it would give you a jolt, make you laugh, get you over the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Get her over it,\u201d Zach said, fingers curling around his wife\u2019s as he gave her a grim smile. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, though, isn\u2019t it? Somehow, Genevieve saw a woman in the water, and now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Victor said, shaking his head. \u201cI was diving with her and didn\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all went into the water and didn\u2019t find the...the woman,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d Bethany agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe sea is amazing,\u201d Lizzie reminded them. \u201cWhat she can do\u2014the secrets she can hide. But we should have been able to find that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, the police divers went in, too,\u201d Zach pointed out. \u201cThe fact is, no matter how well we think we know it, the sea is huge, the coral is treacherous...things disappear. Hell, we\u2019re looking for a ship that no one has seen in nearly two hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Jack said to Genevieve. \u201cAnd we all gave you such a hard time.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a wisp of a smile. \u201cExcuse me, you all. It looks like that reporter we\u2019ve been dodging all morning is heading back in this direction. I\u2019m going to get out of here. If we\u2019re off for the day, I\u2019ve got errands to run.\u201d</p><p>She headed back for her cottage. Thor quickly rose, as well. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s become a good day for errands.\u201d</p><p>Marshall groaned, rubbing his bald head, a sure sign that he was irritated. \u201cMaybe this was a mistake. Maybe we should be out on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to be listening to another one of Sheridan\u2019s speeches?\u201d Alex asked, grinning. \u201cAbout ships. And how they break apart in the water. As if we\u2019re all two-year-olds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were going to steal a mannequin and put it on Genevieve\u2019s porch, you all are like two-year-olds!\u201d Marshall chastised.</p><p>\u201cHey, we didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Victor protested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThor, think we should still head out? Sheridan canceled when he saw all the cop cars out there, but we could still dive,\u201d Marshall said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Alex protested. \u201cYou can\u2019t give people a day off, then haul them back to work,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Marshall agreed glumly.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine starting up again Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday,\u201d Thor said, and left them. He strode to his own cottage, certain Genevieve had yet to leave hers. He couldn\u2019t shower and change and keep his eye on her cottage at the same time, but at least he could clean up quickly.</p><p>Hell. He was following her. Becoming obsessed. Why?</p><p>At the moment, he told himself, it was because she had behaved so strangely when Jack had connected the woman she had seen in the water with the corpse on the shore, which certainly seemed to have vindicated her.</p><p>Dressed, he stood in his living room, looking out the window.</p> <p>Hell, he wasn\u2019t just following her. He was becoming a damned stalker.</p><p>She came out of her cottage wearing a pale yellow halter dress that complemented the golden color of her skin and the rich, radiant darkness of her hair. She set off on foot, heading out of the resort.</p><p>He paused, gritting his teeth, then went after her.</p><p>One by one, the others had drifted away. Frowning, Victor noticed that only Bethany stayed. But then, it wasn\u2019t usual for Genevieve to walk off without waiting to see if anyone had a plan or wanted to join in on whatever her plan might have been.</p><p>This was one weird day, he thought.</p><p>At last he got up and headed for his own cottage.</p> <p>He strode in and paused, startled that the floor just inside the entry seemed to be wet. The watery trail led around the half wall to the bedroom area. He followed it.</p><p>Staring at the bed, he nearly let out a scream. He stopped himself in time.</p><p>There was a soaking-wet mannequin lying across his bed.</p><p>Sightless blue painted eyes stared up at him. A scraggly blond wig was soaked and askew. Plastic arms were lifted up toward him, as if pleading for his help.</p><p>What the hell...?</p><p>Victor felt a strange sense of panic. If he were caught with this thing in his cottage...when there had been a real dead woman on the shore...shit!</p><p>He had to get rid of the damned thing, and fast.</p><p>How? How the hell was he going to do that with no one seeing him?</p> <p>He wondered how the hell someone had gotten it into his cottage in the first place.</p><p>Who had brought it?</p><p>And why?</p><p>She was heading south on Duval Street.</p><p>Since Genevieve seemed to be distracted, it wasn\u2019t difficult to follow her. She greeted some of the shopkeepers she passed but didn\u2019t pause to look at anything. At the La Concha Hotel, she ducked into the Starbucks. He held back, leaning against the building.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s haunted,\u201d a woman said, huge sun hat atop her head, dark glasses in place, tour book in her hands. \u201cHerb, it\u2019s haunted. It\u2019s the tallest building in town. People have jumped from the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s haunted. Can we check in?\u201d Herb asked. He was leading two large suitcases by their straps and wore a heavy backpack. He grimaced at Thor. Looked like a nice guy.</p><p>\u201cOh, Herb, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d his wife said, and Herb shrugged, still looking amused. The two looked as if they\u2019d been together forever. Happily. Nice thought.</p><p>He gave Herb a thumbs-up sign, and Herb grinned and moved on.</p><p>Genevieve reappeared with a paper cup of coffee. She started south again. He followed.</p><p>Just a few blocks farther along the road, she made a sharp turn. He followed. The street was lined with old houses, all handsomely kept. A few advertised rooms for rent, or had signs announcing that they were bed-and-breakfasts. One dared to proclaim, \u201cBest breakfast in Key West.\u201d Genevieve went past, then turned up a walk. Three steps led to a handsome porch and a door that boasted a beautiful cut-glass window in the upper half.</p><p>She pulled a key chain from her pocket, opened the door, then let it swing closed behind her.</p><p>He stood on the street and surveyed the house, slowly walking closer. It was a striking Classical Revival mansion. It was two stories, with an arched attic, and had wraparound porches on both the first and second floors. There was Victorian gingerbread on the rails, and it looked as if Genevieve lovingly tended the place\u2014the paint was fresh, the lawn mowed, and there wasn\u2019t a flaw in sight. As he stood there, he was surprised to see the door fly open again.</p><p>She walked out on the porch, hands on her hips as she glared at him. Great. He wasn\u2019t just a stalker. He was a stalker who had been caught.</p><p>\u201cWere you just going to stare at the place, or did you want to come in?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You were just on a walking tour of Key West, right?\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands. \u201cWhy? I\u2019m not crazy. There was a body in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just worried,\u201d he said, and added honestly, \u201cbecause of your reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all human, and that kind of thing is...horrible. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve been on a hundred search-and-recovery missions, or that we\u2019ve all seen a human body turned into such a grisly mess before. It\u2019s still horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. It just seemed...as if you were disturbed beyond...never mind. You\u2019re right. It was a tragic discovery.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, then shrugged. \u201cDo you want to see the house? Though I didn\u2019t take you for the kind who\u2019d know much about architecture or old buildings.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, following the path to the house. \u201cSorry, you\u2019re wrong. I like history. And this house has got to be one of the oldest in Key West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not the oldest\u2014the oldest house is a museum now. The Wreckers Museum. This house was built in 1858. My great-great-whatever-grandfather built it. He was a wrecker.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe almost lost the house and everything else when the Civil War rolled around. Fort Taylor stayed in Union hands, but most of the people were Confederate sympathizers. Grandpa Wallace decided he could best serve his country as a blockade runner. At the end, he was caught by a friend\u2014a Yankee, stationed at Fort Zachary Taylor. Luckily his friend was a bit of an entrepreneur, as well. The two split the proceeds, my grandfather didn\u2019t hang, and I still have the house today.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the parlor area. The house had the typical southern breezeway\u2014a hall that went straight from the front door to the back, allowing for the air to circulate and cool the rooms. The entry and parlor took up the front portion of the place; there was a Duncan Phyfe sofa beneath the window, a spinet piano, and upholstered chairs on a knit rug before the fire. A staircase to the left of the hall led up to the second story.</p><p>\u201cDown here,\u201d she said, starting down the hall, \u201cis the library\u2014once upon a time an office, when Gramps was in the wrecking business. And the kitchen. Originally it was a downstairs bedroom, and the kitchen was outside. The kitchen burned down in the late 1800s. But there\u2019s still an outhouse back there. My grandmother had that made into a birdhouse,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She was chatting nervously, he thought. Smoothly, charmingly\u2014but nervously.</p><p>\u201cA rude comment here,\u201d he said, going along, \u201cbut this place must be worth a fortune in today\u2019s market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you glad I didn\u2019t agree to let you use it as collateral in a bet?\u201d he queried.</p><p>Her lashes fell; a grin twitched on her lips. \u201cYou know I really won that bet,\u201d she told him lightly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been on The Seeker now. That boat must be worth a fortune, too.\u201d She turned, heading back for the stairway. \u201cThere are four rooms upstairs, and an attic. There are definitely bigger places on the island. Have you been to Artist House? It\u2019s an absolutely gorgeous bed-and-breakfast now. Once Robert, our very weird Key West doll, lived there. He took the blame for all the bad things that happened to his owner and now he takes the blame for all the bad things that happen in Key West. He\u2019s in the East Martobello museum now, ruining the tourists\u2019 film.\u201d</p><p>They had come to the top of the stairs. \u201cMy office,\u201d she said, pushing open a door that had been ajar. White eyelet drapes shaded the windows, and even her computer desk was antique. There were pictures on the walls, many of them. He didn\u2019t need to be told which pictures were of a young Genevieve with her parents. The older Wallaces had been tall, as well; her mother had been the one with the full head of rich auburn hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s Jack,\u201d he said, eyeing a group of children with snorkel equipment standing around an older man.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s Jack. About fifteen years ago. He was great. The PTA liked to hire him for special field trips. We believed he was really a pirate. He loved to tell stories.\u201d</p><p>Thor walked closer to another of the pictures on the wall. It was Genevieve and the group from Deep Down Salvage. Marshall, bald head shielded by a straw hat, was in the center. Bethany and Alex were on one side of him, Genevieve and Victor were on the other. Genevieve had an arm around Marshall, while Victor had an arm across her shoulders. They looked like a happy, close-knit group, which it certainly seemed they were. Except....</p><p>Did it look like Victor was just a very good friend? Or was he a bit too possessive?</p><p>And what about Alex? Being from Key Largo made him an outsider. Was he really just the good old boy he pretended to be?</p><p>And why the hell was he suddenly wondering about all this? Because a body had been discovered on the beach, he answered himself.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually my favorite piece in the house,\u201d Genevieve said, pointing to a very old brocade daybed. \u201cMy grandmother called it a \u2018fainting couch.\u2019 She taught me all these things about the way young ladies behaved. She was actually the toughest thing I\u2019ve come across in all my life.\u201d She started out of the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve turned this room into a media center. Being technically challenged, I\u2019m very proud of it,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He poked his head in. She had huge speakers and a great stereo system, a wide-screen television, a DVD player and comfortable furniture. Shelves held hundreds of books, magazines, DVDs and CDs.</p><p>\u201cGreat place,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your place like in Jacksonville?\u201d she asked him. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Ultramodern. Every convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think my house actually has a few years on yours. But, sadly, I\u2019ve never taken the time to fix it up the way you have yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought an old house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to fix it up. I\u2019m just never there enough. I probably shouldn\u2019t have bought the place. The historic board would probably like to do me in.\u201d</p><p>She smiled vaguely and started back down the stairs. He followed. She turned at the foot of the stairs and started along the hall, then on out to the backyard. Though not heavily planted, there were flowers here and there. It was simple and attractive.</p> <p>She pointed to a raised bed that sported a riot of bougainvillea. \u201cWhen I was digging to create that little stand, I dug up bones,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked at him. \u201cVery old bones. I called all the right government agencies. Forensic anthropologists came out. They decided that the bones were Calusa Indian, a tribe that disappeared hundreds of years ago. No one was terribly surprised. When the Spaniards first came, there were bones everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Cayo Hueso. Island of Bones,\u201d he said. Her eyes seemed troubled still, and her tone, when she spoke, was strange. She didn\u2019t seem to mind he was there. In fact, she seemed almost grateful for his presence.</p><p>Not because it was him specifically. It was as if, although she had chosen to leave the group, she didn\u2019t really want to be alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting at something,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure what. Feel free to spit it out anytime,\u201d he said, wondering if he had spoken with the right tone.</p> <p>Apparently he hadn\u2019t. Either that, or she simply didn\u2019t intend to divulge what was really bothering her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Do you want some coffee?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI had enough coffee standing around at the tiki bar to last until I\u2019m old and gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoda, beer, anything else?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated slightly. \u201cHow about I take you to lunch?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, as if thinking, then determining lunch just might fit into her plan. \u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of touchy about that meal thing. It doesn\u2019t have to be a date. Don\u2019t forget, I can put in for expenses.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI just want to choose the place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChoose away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She locked the back and started toward the front again, pausing only to sift through the mail on the Victorian occasional table by the door. \u201cNothing dire,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She locked the door as they left, and started back down Duval Street.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She glanced at him with a trace of amusement. \u201cThe Hard Rock Cafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you preferred your Conch insider places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cool Hard Rock,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised when they arrived and she knew the young people acting as hosts at the door. He wasn\u2019t surprised, either, when she opted to sit inside\u2014Deep South natives of any kind usually preferred air-conditioning to the charming notion of dining in the sunshine and garden atmosphere of an outdoor caf\u00e9.</p><p>The restaurant was located in a handsome historic home, late 1800s, with some of the old incorporated with the customary decor of the chain. After they walked up the stairs, she pointed out a guitar signed by Jimmy Buffett, and a number of pieces of Elvis Presley and Beatles memorabilia.</p><p>After they had ordered drinks\u2014she opted for alcohol that afternoon, choosing an island concoction with an umbrella\u2014she told him the place was supposedly haunted.</p><p>\u201cIs anywhere not haunted here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAsk our waitress,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He did. Their waitress was a pretty young college girl whose eyes widened when Genevieve encouraged her to tell Thor about the ghosts.</p><p>\u201cThe place really is haunted,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne man committed suicide here, and suicides always return to haunt the place where they died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly. Another man died downstairs...but I personally think it\u2019s only Mr. Curry doing the haunting. His father was a millionaire, but he managed to go broke in a year. And then his wife left him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s adding insult to injury,\u201d Thor agreed pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been up here alone when a black shadow kind of sweeps around...cleaning towels move. And Brett set up a table one time only to have all the forks and napkins moved to another table,\u201d she said, eyes wide. \u201cTrust me\u2014I do not stay up here alone at night.\u201d</p><p>Thor thanked her for taking the time to tell her story. After she left, he looked at Genevieve, lifting his glass, arching a brow. \u201cSo you think that the place is haunted? You\u2019ve seen shadows, things moving around?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tell good stories here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut lots of people believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the table, frowning, barely aware he had set his hand over hers. \u201cThere are shadows at night. Shadows when the light changes. People might forget which table they\u2019ve set up\u2014or someone else might move the table settings.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand away, picking up her glass. \u201cAbsolutely true,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Once lunch was served, Genevieve determinedly changed the subject from ghosts, asking him when he first got into diving.</p><p>\u201cI had this great book when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cStory about a sunken ferry discovered right in the St. Johns, near where I lived. I was hooked. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily vocation. My grandfather was a frogman in World War II. I think I was thrown in the ocean before I could walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it goes, growing up as a Conch, huh?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFor lots of people. I have friends who hate the water. Some of them still love Key West. They just love the streets and the atmosphere, the sunsets. A lot of people just kind of find Key West. And then stay here.\u201d She tilted her head at an angle, smiling ruefully. \u201cYou know, we really are the Conch Republic. In 1982 there was a big stink about the number of illegal aliens and drugs that seemed to be flowing into Miami from the Keys. The Border Patrol set up a blockade on US1 in Florida City, trying to get a grip on the problem. Traffic was so backed up, people couldn\u2019t get in or out. The mayor of Key West went to the Miami courthouse to seek an injunction, but nothing was done, so Key West seceded from the United States. After a few minutes of rebellion, the \u2018prime minister\u2019 surrendered to the admiral at the navy base and demanded a billion dollars in foreign aid and war relief.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe made his point, and now it\u2019s great for the local businesses. You can buy Conch Republic passports, T-shirts...you name it.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Thor grinned, glad to see that her mood had lightened.</p><p>The check came just then, and she reached for it. \u201cExpense account,\u201d he reminded her, taking it from her.</p><p>She stood as he laid money on the bill. \u201cCome on, then. I\u2019m taking you for an after-lunch drink. And I am paying for it.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, he found himself in Captain Tony\u2019s Saloon.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking me on a tour?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cThis is where Sloppy Joe\u2019s was originally, although it wasn\u2019t called that then. If I remember the story right, Joe Russell refused to pay the extra dollar a week when the rent went up in the thirties. All his patrons just picked up their drinks and the furniture and moved down the street to where Sloppy Joe\u2019s is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d she asked, indicating a table by a tree trunk. The tree grew next to the bar and disappeared at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sticking with beer,\u201d he said.</p><p>He took a seat at the table by the tree while she waited at the bar for their drinks. Looking up, he saw that the rafters were covered with hundreds of bras, some signed.</p><p>A table away, two women were sitting with two children, a boy of about six and a girl who was maybe five years old. The kids had drinks that looked like Shirley Temples, while the women were nursing more exotic concoctions. One of the women noted him and flushed\u2014he guessed she was embarrassed to be in the bar with children. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to cover the hot tourist spots,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled back and pointed to a table closer to the street. A man there had two boys with him who were about eleven or twelve. \u201cIt\u2019s my guess it\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked relieved. Her companion turned to him and smiled, as well. \u201cI told her it would be okay.\u201d The second woman stared at him for a minute. Her eyes widened in recognition, and she leaned forward and whispered to her friend. They both stared at him and flushed, then looked at each other again and started whispering.</p><p>They both stared again and smiled. He heard the mom whisper, \u201c...really handsome....\u201d He had enough of an ego that he couldn\u2019t help a moment\u2019s bemusement\u2014and deep appreciation.</p><p>But where the hell did they know him from? They didn\u2019t look the type who were into diving magazines.</p><p>Then again....</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he felt uneasiness settling in. There had been a number of news crews down by the beach that morning. Most of their group had politely refused to be interviewed\u2014neither he nor Marshall particularly wanted their project associated with the tragedy of the young woman\u2019s death. But he was pretty sure he had seen Alex and Lizzie answering a few questions before managing to escape the reporters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Genevieve joined him then. He waved a hand toward the bras.</p><p>\u201cHave you got one up there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the tree,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a legend that a woman was hanged from that tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe supposedly haunts this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore hauntings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts are all over in Key West,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cThey say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never believed in them?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him.</p><p>As she spoke, the little girl at the nearby table began shrieking. \u201cNo! No, Mommy, no! There\u2019s a lady in there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAshley, shh. Honey, that\u2019s just a story,\u201d the mother said, distressed. \u201cAshley, please, let me take you in there. We\u2019ll have an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Genevieve told Thor, then walked over to the other table and hunkered down. She flashed a smile to the woman. \u201cYou need to go to the bathroom, huh?\u201d she said to the little girl. \u201cAnd you heard the story about the ghost lady who haunts the bathroom, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to hurt a little boy once,\u201d the little girl told her, wide-eyed. \u201cA man told us the story, and how the lady is still in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, think about it,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cIf you were a ghost, would you really want to come back and hang around in the bathroom? Ugh! There are much better places to haunt. I\u2019ve lived here my whole life, and my mom and dad came here with me lots when I was little. I\u2019ve used the bathroom. Your mom will go with you. It will be fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>The mother looked at Genevieve gratefully. \u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t have let them hear quite so many stories,\u201d she said apologetically.</p><p>Genevieve laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, won\u2019t you?\u201d she asked the girl.</p><p>Ashley laughed suddenly. \u201cUgh! Who would haunt a bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve rose. The woman stood, too, taking her daughter\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou people are divers, aren\u2019t you? And you\u2019re the diver.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve frowned. \u201cI\u2019m a diver,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou were on television.\u201d The woman lowered her voice. \u201cWe saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw that body they discovered this morning. In the water. You saw it days ago, but the police divers couldn\u2019t find it\u2014and then it washed up this morning,\u201d the woman said softly.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Ashley tugged at her hand, apparently really ready to go to the bathroom now, ghost or not.</p><p>\u201cUm...have a lovely time in Key West,\u201d Genevieve said. She spun around, her face pale. She hadn\u2019t touched her drink, and she didn\u2019t reach for it then. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said to Thor. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She was halfway down the block when he caught up with her, even though his strides were long and he moved fast.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve!\u201d</p><p>She stopped, turned around and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, taking her by the shoulders. \u201cYou knew there were news crews crawling all over the beach this morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give anyone an interview saying I\u2019d seen that woman in the water,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThen someone else did. Why are you so upset? I mean, you did see her down there. So what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away. She just stared with fixed interest at a middle-aged man walking his dog down the street.</p><p>\u201cI...it shouldn\u2019t be so sensationalized,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cA woman has been murdered,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s serious news. Especially in a place where that isn\u2019t\u2014thankfully\u2014a daily occurrence. People are going to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be involved,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Gen shook her head. He kept his hands firmly on her shoulders, forcing her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, it\u2019s tragic, but it all makes sense, and you were right all along. There was a woman in the water.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, and her eyes suddenly held a veiled shield of bitterness. A dry sound, almost a rueful laugh, escaped her. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a woman in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wrong. I saw a woman in the water. But not the same woman!\u201d</p><p>He stared at her blankly. She wrenched away from him and, nearly running, disappeared into the crowd on Duval Street.</p><p>7</p><p>J ay had been a cop a long time.</p><p>He\u2019d seen pretty bad stuff. Not much could compare to some of the auto accidents he\u2019d seen on US1.</p><p>But that afternoon...</p><p>He\u2019d been the city officer on the scene, while Charlie Grissom had been the lucky one from the county. They\u2019d stood in the cool, antiseptic morgue alongside the medical examiner, Dr. Freeland, while the M.E., brusque and businesslike on all occasions, had pointed out the most important features of the body.</p><p>The ankles\u2014what remained of them\u2014were given a lot of attention. Despite the many things he had witnessed through the years, Jay felt ill. Maybe it was the smell in the morgue. It was clean, but it had a chemical odor that reeked of death. Maybe it was the fact that the bloated body had filled with gas that was now escaping, and there was no disinfectant on earth that could disguise that fact. Maybe it was the girl\u2019s face, which was now almost a caricature of life. Nothing seemed real, and yet it was painfully real at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhen she went into the water, she was alive,\u201d Dr. Freeland told them. \u201cShe drowned. That was her cause of death. She fought the ropes that were holding her down. If you\u2019ll look, you\u2019ll see where the skin on her ankles is ripped. And then there are her fingers. She tried desperately to free herself. I set the rope aside. I\u2019m sure the crime lab will be able to discover something useful about it. This here\u2014\u201d he indicated the torn flesh and white bone at the ankle \u201c\u2014is where she broke free at last.\u201d He gave them a weary grimace. \u201cWe all know the sea is a pretty brutal place. The fish ate away at the flesh and the fiber and...that\u2019s how she surfaced.\u201d He stared up at the two men. \u201cGentlemen, I\u2019d guess, based on the tides, she went into the water off the southwest side of Key West. She was probably in deep water when she went in. It was five to seven days ago.\u201d</p><p>Freeland had a few more comments for them. They\u2019d scraped her nails, but would have to wait for the lab results. She\u2019d had a sexual encounter shortly before death, whether consensual or not, he couldn\u2019t say from the evidence, but he tended to believe not. However, their perp had protected himself, and they weren\u2019t coming up with any DNA.</p><p>Freeland looked up at them. \u201cI\u2019ll have more for you in the next few days. I\u2019m sorry to say this, officers, but it looks like you\u2019ve got a murderer on your doorstep.\u201d</p><p>Jack enjoyed watching the news report over and over again. He thought he looked pretty damned good.</p><p>He stared up at the screen in the bar. Every imaginable channel had showed footage of the morning\u2019s discovery of the corpse\u2014well, not the corpse itself. They showed the beach, the sheriff\u2019s men, the crime-scene units and the people milling around. They had recorded several tourists\u2019 reactions, the very brief seconds that Marshall had grudgingly given them, and then they showed him. It was great. As he spoke about the fact that one of their divers had actually found the corpse, they had caught a good picture of Genevieve, auburn hair billowing out behind her in the breeze, eyes sad, haunted, as she stared out at the water. The editor who had cut the segment had made good use of the footage. As Jack explained that the sea was an unforgiving resting place, so the killer\u2019s intent to keep her hidden might well have worked, Genevieve, leaning against one of the support beams at the tiki bar, looked as if she might have been a sea goddess herself\u2014or the figurehead from an ancient ship, fearing such a fate herself. He looked good, too, and they\u2019d done a hell of a job making it into something more than a simple murder. Not that a murder was ever really simple. The dive hadn\u2019t actually had a thing to do with the murder. And, cold as it sounded, people died on a daily basis. Even so, murder generated excitement. And he couldn\u2019t help it\u2014he was a publicity hog. He loved it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t notice at first when Bethany slid into the seat beside him. He hadn\u2019t realized any of the group were still around.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>He turned to look at her. She was staring at the television screen. \u201cHow sad. Her whole life ahead of her, and she ran into the wrong person. It was hard to tell, but she looked young.\u201d</p><p>He looked up and felt a little pang. The woman who stared back at him was lovely, with a wistful look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five to thirty...I would imagine,\u201d he said. She gave a little shiver, looking back at him. \u201cJack, do you think she was killed here? In Key West?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most likely she was killed up the coast. Probably one of the beautiful people hitting the clubs on Miami Beach. You don\u2019t need to be afraid. You\u2019ve got a pack of he-men around you all the time, right?\u201d</p><p>Bethany laughed. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d She stared back at the television and shivered again. \u201cI might be hanging pretty close to you guys in the near future.\u201d</p><p>He set an arm around her shoulders and hugged her. \u201cYou can hang with me any time you want, cutie.\u201d She was cute. She and Genevieve had always made a nice complement to each other. One tall and sexy, one small and sweet. In appearance, anyway. He gazed at Bethany with affectionate amusement. She\u2019d had her wild times in high school, just like a lot of kids. But she\u2019d grown into one damned fine woman, and he enjoyed her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she murmured, nodding a thank-you to Bruce, the evening bartender, as he handed her a light beer, \u201cwhat have you done all day?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack thought for a moment. \u201cHmm. Ate lunch, had a beer. Sat here, had a beer. Ate dinner, had a beer. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I ran home. My place is on the northeast corner of the island, off Roosevelt. I\u2019m not as close as Genevieve.\u201d She shrugged, grinning. \u201cActually, most of us could go home at night, but it\u2019s a lot easier and kind of cool staying at the resort. You still live on Stock Island, right? That\u2019s not much farther than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m still on Stock Island,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019d sure love one of those old Victorians like Genevieve\u2019s, but who the hell can afford one now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll all be able to afford one\u2014if we find the ship,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Jack was startled when a hand fell on his back. \u201cJack, old buddy. You going to buy me a brewsky?\u201d</p><p>He turned. Victor had arrived. One thing about their group and Key West, at some time during the evening, they were all going to show up at the bar.</p><p>Victor had spoken lightly, but he looked strained. Like he needed a beer.</p> <p>\u201cSure. Draw up a chair.\u201d</p><p>Without being asked, Bruce brought over another beer. \u201cFirst round is on the house tonight. From the look of the news, you guys need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Victor took a long swig from the bottle.</p><p>\u201cSo what have you been doing?\u201d Bethany asked him.</p><p>Victor shrugged moodily. \u201cOh, this and that. Stuff to take care of\u2014you know.\u201d</p><p>They all stared silently at the television again. Alex arrived just as an artist\u2019s rendition of the dead woman\u2019s face appeared. He took the beer Bruce offered him. \u201cAt least with that picture out,\u201d he said, \u201cthey might find out who she is. Someone must be looking for the poor woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Jack,\u201d Victor said as the interview was shown yet again.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t feel quite the same pleasure he had earlier. He didn\u2019t like the way Victor had spoken. His words had carried a strangely bitter edge.</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019re famous,\u201d another voice commented. He looked up to find that Marshall had arrived. His arms were crossed over his chest, and he sounded weary.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was better to talk to the woman than piss her off,\u201d Jack said defensively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure we needed to tell her that Genevieve had spotted the corpse earlier, but then none of us could find it,\u201d Marshall commented.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Not even the police divers saw it that day,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cBruce, get Marshall his beer, huh?\u201d</p><p>They were all still staring at the television, even though the anchor had gone on to report an accident in Florida City, holding up traffic in and out of the Keys, when Jay made his way into the bar. He was there, standing beside Jack, for several seconds before anyone noticed he\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cSad day, huh?\u201d Jay said after a moment.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know anything more?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cPreliminary reports. The M.E. said she\u2019d been in the water five to seven days,\u201d Jay told them.</p><p>Bethany swallowed. \u201cWas she...drowned? Or...killed first, then weighted down?\u201d</p><p>Jay looked at her, wincing. \u201cWeighted down...and drowned.\u201d</p><p>Bethany trembled. \u201cShe must have been terrified. I mean, she must have known...must have been desperate for breath....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have any idea where she was killed?\u201d Victor asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the water,\u201d Jay said dryly.</p><p>Genevieve came in then, and they all turned toward her as she neared the bar. \u201cGen!\u201d Victor said, raising his beer bottle.</p><p>Jack watched her walk in. Jeez, she was something. Casual and elegant all in one. She perched atop a bar stool next to Jay.</p><p>\u201cAnything new?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t hear his reply, because he lowered his head to speak with her. She said something back to him, her expression anxious, but Jack couldn\u2019t hear that, either.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk. We can have dinner some night this week,\u201d Jay said, his tone normal. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hang with this sorry bunch every night, do you?\u201d he teased.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. And I really need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Though she had spoken very softly, Jack was able to make out the words.</p><p>Just then Thor Thompson arrived. Jack studied his employer. Thor wasn\u2019t the tallest guy he\u2019d ever met, or the buffest. But he had something. A presence. A way of walking, maybe, or just being. When Thor entered a room, no matter how softly he moved or how quietly he spoke, everyone knew it.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said simply, taking a seat on a bar stool.</p><p>\u201cBruce, a beer for our northern comrade!\u201d Alex called.</p><p>\u201cNorthern?\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cJacksonville. You\u2019re practically a Yankee.\u201d</p><p>Thor shrugged and laughed, but Jack thought he looked distracted. He noticed as Thor glanced toward Genevieve and seemed relieved to see her sitting next to Jay. He had clearly been anxious about her. Jack couldn\u2019t help but wonder why. Genevieve certainly didn\u2019t look like a lunatic now, in light of the day\u2019s grisly discovery.</p><p>The newscaster returned to showing a picture of the murder victim, asking the viewers for help in discovering the woman\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cGo figure,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want another lecture from Sheridan, but I sure didn\u2019t want to get out of it this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still getting the lecture from Sheridan,\u201d Marshall said dryly. \u201cMonday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Thor informed them all, his eyes on the television. \u201cHe\u2019s made a model of the ship. Sounds kind of cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, has anybody seen Zach and Lizzie?\u201d Marshall asked.</p><p>\u201cThey decided to play tourist,\u201d Victor informed them. \u201cThey were going to do the Conch Tour Train, Audubon house, Hemingway\u2019s place\u2014all that stuff. And then they were going to take a sunset dinner cruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cBethany, if anyone invited you on a sunset cruise, you\u2019d look at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind,\u201d Victor informed her.</p><p>\u201cNot true. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019ve been here my whole life. A sunset cruise is still romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so, because we\u2019ll probably stay out a lot later Monday to make up for this,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt will be a great sunset cruise as we all head back in.\u201d</p><p>Jack watched as Genevieve slipped from her bar stool and said something to Bethany, who nodded. Then Genevieve gave them all a wave, saying she was heading out.</p><p>Jack noticed that everyone in their group watched her leave. Odd. Everyone still seemed concerned about her or...</p><p>Suspicious.</p><p>He shook his head and swigged his beer. Genevieve. What the hell was going on with her?</p><p>Thor made no pretense of doing anything else. As soon as she left, he followed her.</p><p>Okay, he was a stalker. Definitely a stalker. But he was more worried about her than ever.</p><p>She stopped a block from the bar, turned and waited for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about you,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d Strange, after the day they\u2019d spent, the last thing she wanted was for this man to be worried about her. She didn\u2019t want to like him, but she did. She wanted admiration and respect from him. She even, she admitted to herself, wanted him to think she was cool, savvy and sexy. What she didn\u2019t want was for him to be worried about her.</p><p>\u201cYou walked off on me all of a sudden,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou ran away. Great way to end a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t on a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat way to end lunch and a drink with a friend, then.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was just...well, this hasn\u2019t been a great day.\u201d</p><p>She started walking again, not that she really knew where she was going, but just because she felt awkward standing around on the sidewalk. He fell into step beside her, silent for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, what did you mean that...the woman you saw in the water wasn\u2019t the woman we discovered today?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI must have been mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really might have been,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tiptoe around my feelings as if I\u2019m really ready to be committed,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She saw him half smile, shaking his head. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m not. Any time you\u2019re in the water, you can be taken by surprise. The water can play tricks and she was, well, she wasn\u2019t in good shape. You might have seen seaweed or fish moving around her, and that might have made her seem alive, hard to recognize when you saw her again later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you could be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again, maybe you did see a different woman, and that\u2019s a much more frightening and serious thought.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him sharply. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI mean the killer might have had more than one victim,\u201d he said.</p><p>A chill snaked along her spine, and she shook it off.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, at the moment, it doesn\u2019t seem as if anyone in the area is panicking. It\u2019s sad, but it feels distant to people. I certainly hope there won\u2019t be any panic, but I think women need to be careful,\u201d Thor murmured. \u201cUm, where are we going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She paused, half laughing. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know. I guess I just needed to get out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou keep going into bars, then running out of them. It\u2019s as if you don\u2019t want your own company, but you\u2019re not sure you want any other company, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not sure what I want,\u201d she told him, then hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m also certain that either Victor or Alex played a prank on me this morning, and that\u2019s still driving me crazy. There was a mannequin on my porch when I got up, and I dumped it in the water. Then it was gone\u2014and the real corpse was there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it bother you,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey were talking about it this morning. Victor denied it, but after what had happened, who would want to admit it? The point is, Genevieve, don\u2019t drive yourself crazy. There are explanations for the things that have been happening. You just have to wait and find out what they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d someone called from behind them.</p><p>They turned. Bethany was hurrying toward them, the others following. Jay had come with them, and he was talking to Jack as they walked.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get some dinner,\u201d Bethany said, catching up. \u201cDo you two want to come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just ate lunch,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Thor looked at his watch. \u201cActually, we ate lunch six hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two had lunch...together?\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>Genevieve felt color threatening to flood her cheeks. \u201cI found him wandering the streets of Key West,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cHe\u2019s a northerner,\u201d she added. \u201cHe might have been lost.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnybody into Italian?\u201d Marshall asked, breaking into the awkward conversation. \u201cThere\u2019s a new place and the owner-slash-chef is the son of one of my first diving instructors. I feel the urge to be supportive. I\u2019ve also heard it\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the owner really Italian?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but he really likes Italian food,\u201d Marshall assured them.</p><p>\u201cSounds like an important factor,\u201d Victor said. \u201cGen? Sound good to you?\u201d</p><p>Bethany fell into step with them as they headed for the restaurant. When Thor paused to say something to Marshall, she caught Genevieve\u2019s arm and whispered, \u201cAre we still on for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeeting Audrey, you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you had plans. Which would be fine.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve frowned, looking at her friend. \u201cWhy would I make plans when I already had plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you just took off today. I was worried about you. I\u2019m still worried about you. I would have thought you\u2019d be happy\u2014no, not happy, relieved\u2014to find out you weren\u2019t crazy. Or seeing things.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve hesitated. The others were too close for her to want to continue this conversation. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But...well, I wasn\u2019t even sure you still felt you needed to see Audrey anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing Audrey because she\u2019s an old friend.\u201d</p> <p>By then, Marshall and Thor had caught up to them. \u201cThe restaurant is around the corner.\u201d</p><p>As they entered the restaurant, Victor finagled his way into the seat next to Genevieve. Jack wound up on her other side. As everyone else got settled, Thor\u2019s cell phone rang. Genevieve could hear him speaking with Lizzie, telling her where they were, and saying she and Zach should come over. They must not have been far, because they arrived almost immediately, having apparently decided to forgo their cruise. While they took seats at the head of the table, Jay caught them up on the murder, until Marshall said they were having dinner and it was time to talk about something more cheerful.</p><p>The owner was a young man named Bill Breton, who thanked them for coming, and suggested he do appetizers and a family-style meal for them, and they all agreed. Alex, who claimed to be a wine connoisseur, chose a Bordeaux for their table. After that the conversation turned to Zach and Lizzie\u2019s day.</p><p>\u201cWe saw Robert, that doll,\u201d Lizzie announced. \u201cThat\u2019s one creepy toy. What parent would give that to a child? They had all kinds of letters on the wall about him\u2014one from the mayor, thanking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanking him for what? Being a creepy doll?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>\u201cFor taking the blame for everything that\u2019s gone wrong in the area since the turn of the last century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had something like that at home,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cI was one of five kids,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd we all denied doing anything wrong all the time. When my mom couldn\u2019t figure out who had done what, she\u2019d stare us all down and demand to know if we were really living with an invisible jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems there\u2019s always an invisible jerk around,\u201d Genevieve said, staring at Victor.</p><p>He stared back at her. He looked hurt, angry and, she thought, strangely afraid.</p><p>\u201cHey, when I\u2019m a jerk,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI own up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a mannequin on my porch this morning,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI believe you. But I didn\u2019t put it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, will you look at that?\u201d Jack said, breaking the tension by indicating the huge plates of food that were being set before them. \u201cWow, Marshall, you done good. Look at all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalamari,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cThat\u2019s for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese peppers look great,\u201d Lizzie announced.</p><p>The platters were passed around; more wine arrived. Gen knew that anyone watching would see what appeared to be a comfortable gathering of friends. And why not? She\u2019d worked with her own group forever. Jack was as much a part of their lives in Key West as anyone, and it was good to have Jay with them. Lizzie and Zach were great. And she had even found herself not just drawn to Thor Thompson but almost painfully attracted to him. Except...</p><p>Except she felt Victor\u2019s presence next to her the entire meal. And not as she always had. He really was just about her best friend, other than Bethany. He didn\u2019t say anything about the mannequin again, and neither did she, but the whole time, it was there between them. Someone had put it on her porch, and if not Victor...</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d he said softly at her side.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been Alex. We were talking about it together. And Jack was there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor, you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. It didn\u2019t scare me then, and it doesn\u2019t scare now me. Okay, so someone played a trick. Then there was a real corpse and the trick wasn\u2019t so funny. But it\u2019s over, and the stupid mannequin has disappeared, so it can\u2019t really matter anymore, right?\u201d</p><p>Victor let out a breath and stared at her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter...if you really believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to believe you believe me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cVictor, please, I just don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you not to care. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>She slipped an arm around his shoulders for a quick hug. \u201cYou\u2019re like my brother. I care very deeply. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He remained tense. There seemed nothing she could do. Across from her, Marshall and Thor were deep in discussion on where they should anchor and how they should extend the search. Jay and Bethany were talking together, and Genevieve was somewhat surprised to see what a close little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate they seemed to have going on. At the far end of the table, Lizzie was speaking excitedly about Key West architecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see Genevieve\u2019s place,\u201d Jack advised her.</p><p>\u201cYou have a historic home?\u201d Lizzie asked her excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Genevieve told her. She leaned on an elbow, glancing across the table at Marshall and catching Marshall\u2019s eye. \u201cMaybe I should have a barbecue on Sunday at the house.\u201d</p><p>Marshall grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re asking for my blessing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour opinion would be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Lizzie announced. Then the pasta arrived, lasagna, angel hair with shrimp and pesto, and ziti with marinara sauce.</p><p>Genevieve passed a plate across to Alex. He seemed to be studying her strangely.</p><p>So had he played the trick with the mannequin? Was he worried she wasn\u2019t going to let it go?</p><p>But she already had.</p><p>Sometime during the meal, she realized that everyone seemed to be staring at her strangely.</p><p>Tonight, the night of her vindication. When everyone had supposedly decided she wasn\u2019t crazy, because there had been a dead woman in the water.</p><p>Just not the dead woman she had seen.</p><p>She decided she was going home. Not to her cottage, but home. She wasn\u2019t going to sleep where mannequins appeared on the porch, corpses were cast up on the beach\u2014and ghosts came to her, dripping, giving dire warnings in the middle of the night.</p><p>It was late when the meal ended. After the pasta, there had been fish, chicken and meat platters, then dessert, coffee and liqueurs. Finally, they ambled out to the street. When everyone else turned toward the water, Genevieve stood still. \u201cHey, guys, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. And don\u2019t forget, barbecue at my place on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Thor was staring at her, frowning.</p><p>\u201cGen, you\u2019re going home?\u201d Victor asked; he sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cYeah, home,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Marshall asked, sounding a bit concerned, and yet not sure himself why he should be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. My house is just down the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should walk you there,\u201d Alex said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cActually, not a bad idea,\u201d Jay agreed.</p><p>\u201cThere are tourists still out everywhere,\u201d Genevieve said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Good night. Go away, all of you.\u201d</p><p>But Thor strode past Bethany, Marshall and Jay to reach her side. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your place,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, go on,\u201d he told the others. \u201cIt would be ridiculous for all of us to walk her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. As if we\u2019re incapable of being ridiculous,\u201d Victor said dryly.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, I didn\u2019t mean to create this big a deal. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here my whole life. I\u2019m only a few blocks away. I\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea to let Thor walk you home,\u201d Jay said. \u201cOr I can walk with you, if Thor wants to get back.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m going, guys. Later!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She started down the street. But she could hear them talking as she left.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll walk her,\u201d Thor said, and in a split second he had caught up with her.</p><p>She glanced at him, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not following you. I\u2019ll just see you to your door. There is a killer out there.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve shook her head. She knew she should be more concerned about the very real dangers out there. But she wasn\u2019t. She just didn\u2019t want to see any more ghosts. \u201cThe streets are full of people. You don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cSadly, and most likely, we\u2019ll find out she was a prostitute, or running with a drug crowd. Or she was a trophy wife seeking excitement on the side. I doubt that, since we\u2019re not in any of the same circles, we\u2019re in any of the same danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust walk. We\u2019ll be there before we finish discussing the situation.\u201d</p><p>He led her straight to her door. She unlocked it and looked up at him. He was standing very close. Large, powerful. She felt almost as if they were touching. She breathed the scent of him, a pleasant cologne, something of the sea, something of bronzed flesh. Her heart was pounding far too quickly. There seemed to be something magnetic, electric, in the space between them. She was sure he was going to touch her, and if he did...</p><p>\u201cLock your door once you\u2019re inside,\u201d he said sternly, stepping back. \u201cGo on. Get in.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and opened the door. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>That was it; he was gone, and she was surprised by the measure of loss and disappointment she felt. She didn\u2019t want to question her feelings too closely. It had been so much more comfortable to hate the man. He didn\u2019t become involved; he didn\u2019t date where he worked. So Bethany had said. She had read it. Then again, he had bet his boat against a night with her. A whim? Or sheer ego? Surely that meant the man at least found her appealing....</p><p>There was a difference between sex and love. She didn\u2019t want to become a number in a list. She gritted her teeth. She wasn\u2019t going to torture herself over a man any more than she was going to torture herself over...</p><p>Ghosts.</p><p>She checked her doors, but first she got out one of her dive knives, and then she searched the house, down to the closets. She felt a little like a fool, but at least she knew she was alone. She felt resentful; she\u2019d never been afraid in her own house before. She had wished once upon a time that there were ghosts, so her parents could have appeared, could have come to her and whispered that they were okay, that they were together and watching over her.</p><p>No such ghosts had ever come to her, though.</p> <p>After a while she felt more comfortable with being home, though most of the lights in the place were on. This was home. Everything was real and familiar. No ghosts, she was certain, would darken her door.</p><p>She went through her mail and paid bills, then studied some of the copies she had made of documents regarding the Marie Josephine. Her interest was drawn not so much to the ships involved, as to Gasparilla the pirate. He\u2019d had a real streak for cruelty, it seemed.</p><p>Had he fallen in love, been rejected...and murdered the beautiful young woman who was the object of his affection? Thrown her into the water, her body weighted...</p><p>As the current killer had apparently done?</p><p>Even if he had, what could be the possible connection to what was happening now?</p><p>Coincidence, she told herself. Or sheer insanity.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about it, and she pushed the papers away. Then, after she\u2019d walked away once, she returned and slammed them into the drawer of the desk. She fixed herself a cup of tea and headed into the living room. She intentionally kept the television off. She knew about the murder. She doubted she was going to hear any good news.</p><p>At last, she went to bed. She was surprised to find herself critically studying her choice of night attire. A large T-shirt. Cotton, worn, extremely comfortable. Dopey on the front, holding a cup of coffee. Hardly the apparel of a femme fatale.</p> <p>The same thing she always wore, she reminded herself. And, anyway, she was sleeping alone.</p><p>But in bed, just as she had for the past several nights, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to turn the lights out. And she wanted the noise of the television. She turned it on, careful to choose a station that didn\u2019t carry the news.</p><p>She was desperate to sleep and simultaneously terrified to do so, but at last she drifted off.</p><p>The pirates came again. Tattered and filthy as they walked through the water. Ragged clothing fell from skeletal arms. Shimmering weapons were raised. Rotted teeth showed through decaying lips.</p><p>They encircled her. Staring at her, moving closer...</p><p>And then the woman came. With her drifting hair, long white gown. Her sad smile. Her whispered word.</p><p>Beware...</p><p>Sheer panic set in, rousing some instinctive place where the human psyche fought to survive.</p><p>She awoke, gasping, sitting up.</p><p>The room was empty. The lights were still on.</p><p>The TV was showing an ancient sitcom.</p><p>Shaking violently, she forced herself to breathe. And then to rise.</p><p>And as she did, she saw the water.</p><p>Gallons of it, surrounding her bed.</p><p>8</p><p>T hor didn\u2019t go straight to bed. On the walk back to the resort, he discovered that Jay Gonzalez had stayed with the group, which was making a final stop at the tiki bar before splitting up for the night. And Jay interested him.</p><p>He was able to get a seat next to Jay at the bar and ask, \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Jay, sipping a beer, stared at him, well aware what he was talking about. \u201cWhat do I think?\u201d he murmured. \u201cI think there\u2019s a maniac out there. Of course, there\u2019s always a maniac out there, but this one is close to home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the killer is local?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But then, I don\u2019t want the killer to be local. There\u2019s no reason to expect the perp to be from here, of course. These waters are a playground for a lot of South Florida.\u201d He hesitated, lifting his beer. \u201cBut was she killed around here? Yes. For the body to have surfaced where it did...she was killed somewhere off the islands, close to Key West. But she was definitely dumped off a boat, and that boat could have come from almost anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was weighted down. Surely that gives you some clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPieces of rope, but I have a feeling we\u2019re going to discover it\u2019s the kind that can be found at any hardware store or any boating-supply place in the country. We have no idea what kind of weight was used to keep her down.\u201d Jay stared at Thor with serious eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll send police divers down again at the coordinates where Genevieve first saw the body. If we can find the weight that was used, it will be another piece in the puzzle. Of course, finding out who she is should help a lot, too.\u201d</p><p>Thor kept Genevieve\u2019s conviction that this body was not the woman she had seen in the water to himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll be keeping an eye out, as well,\u201d he assured Jay grimly. He hesitated. \u201cAny chance I can see the body again, speak with the medical examiner?\u201d</p><p>Jay seemed surprised, and he studied Thor for several seconds. Then he grimaced. \u201cI imagine I can arrange it. Since you\u2019re in charge of the hunt for the Marie Josephine, what you discover underwater could be as important to our current crime as to your own search. I\u2019ll get back to you tomorrow.\u201d He handed Thor his card, and Thor returned the gesture.</p><p>At that point Bethany crawled off her bar stool and said good-night. Alex and Victor had followed suit, along with Lizzie and Zach. Marshall, too, yawned and left, and only Jack, Jay and Thor were left. Jack groused over the fact his beloved home had been besmirched by a vicious murder, and then, shaking his head, departed. The bar was empty\u2014even Clint had gone to bed\u2014when Jay and Thor said their goodbyes.</p><p>Thor was back in his cottage barely long enough to shower when there was a knock on his door.</p><p>It was two in the morning. Not so late for island barhoppers, but still...</p><p>A towel wrapped around his waist, he went to see who it was.</p><p>\u201cThor?\u201d</p><p>He was stunned to hear Genevieve\u2019s voice.</p><p>He opened the door. She shot in, apparently not noticing the fact that he wasn\u2019t exactly dressed.</p><p>But then, she looked a little strange herself. Her hair was wild, as if she had been asleep, the rich auburn length sexy with just-out-of-bed appeal. She was wearing a long, cotton nightshirt similar to one he\u2019d seen her in before. She had on sandals with heels, and she was carrying a casual evening bag.</p><p>\u201cUh...yes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She sailed past and right on to the futon in the living area, taking a seat and staring at him.</p><p>\u201cI...couldn\u2019t sleep. I was hoping you were up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid something frighten you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she lied with a flat smile.</p><p>\u201cI see. You left your house, where you were safely locked in, and walked back through the city\u2014where the victim of a nasty murder was recently found\u2014because you felt chatty in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>She stared straight at him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He stared straight back at her. \u201cWell,\u201d he said after a moment, \u201cI guess I\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>She looked a little startled, as if suddenly realizing how strange it was that she had come to him, of all people.</p><p>She was frightened, he could tell, no matter what she said.</p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head slowly, as if considering. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He sat down on the futon, a foot away from her, folding his hands idly. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t stand being away from me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re actually fine,\u201d she murmured, \u201cwhen you\u2019re not being insufferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually okay, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes shot to his. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not being insane, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more than okay, but I\u2019m sure you know that. You not only look like you walked out of some teenage boy\u2019s wet dream, you have a smile that lights up a room, you\u2019re bright, curious and\u2014\u201d he smiled \u201c\u2014an excellent diver.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes widened as he spoke, as if she were genuinely surprised at the compliment.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You know I\u2019m attracted to you. Very attracted. I wouldn\u2019t bet my boat for a night with just any woman,\u201d he told her with a wry smile. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have spoken quite so honestly while wearing a towel, he thought.</p><p>She flushed and looked away. \u201cAs if you have difficulty with women,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThe magazines call you...what was it? Oh, yes. A bronze god. A Viking adventurer. Indiana Jones of the sea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m careful never to believe the press,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t come here to sleep with me, did you?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cOr maybe you did. Except I really don\u2019t want you to decide to sleep with me only because you\u2019re afraid and it\u2019s a better alternative to sleeping alone.\u201d</p><p>That brought a deep flush to her cheeks, and she didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cThere\u2019s the fact that I really did lose the bet,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI admit that\u2019s debatable. And that\u2019s not an easy admission, because I\u2019m not good at admitting defeat,\u201d he assured her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I admitted that I find you attractive?\u201d She turned to him at last.</p><p>He was a fool, he thought. A sad excuse for the male of the species. Here she was...smelling divinely, alone with him, inches away. Her body warmth and that scent seemed to reach out to him, attack his senses. But for some stupid reason he just didn\u2019t want her this way. Though he did want her. He felt the blood throbbing in the erection beneath his towel.</p><p>He damned himself. Her skin was golden. As soft as the cotton of the thin T-shirt that covered her body but did nothing to disguise the shape and curve of it. What the hell was the matter with him? He\u2019d never made such ridiculous rules for himself before. If a woman he wanted wanted him, that had always been enough.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here, sleep here,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwithout having to sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>He could almost feel her heart beating. A few inches, and he could touch her. A few minutes, and he could have her, take her with the kind of excitement that swept away time and circumstance, that pounded and pulsed with carnal pleasure. Had he lost his own sanity?</p><p>She looked up at him, something that might have been a wistful, even poignant, smile curving her lips. \u201cI thought you found me attractive?\u201d she said. Her voice was a whisper, as if he wasn\u2019t already in enough agony. The sound seemed to touch him. Reach out, seep into his bloodstream, brush against the inside of his flesh.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in sex for any reason other than pure desire,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t desire me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Again that sound in her voice. Something husky, almost like purring.</p><p>\u201cI like the concept of being wanted for myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want a bronze god?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be a decent human being, which isn\u2019t all that easy right now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>To his astonishment, she stood up and pulled the T-shirt over her head. She wore a delicate lace thong beneath\u2014and the strappy, low-heeled sandals. Her auburn hair, like a cascade of night fire, fell over her naked shoulders and curved around the fullness of her breasts. She was long and sleek, with curving hips, a concave abdomen, and a tan line that seemed as provocative as all get-out.</p><p>It was the shoes that did it, he decided, emphasizing her long legs and...upward.</p> <p>\u201cA woman doesn\u2019t usually bet a night of sex with a man unless she finds him appealing,\u201d she informed him, and smiled, a come-on smile that rocked his libido and bit into his soul. And with that, she strode into the bedroom area of the cottage, where her silhouette, dimly outlined, beckoned insanity into his mind.</p><p>He was so stunned that for a second he just sat there. Then he shot to his feet and followed.</p><p>The bedside light glowed softly. They stood across the bed from each other. She stepped out of the sandals and walked around to his side of the mattress, straight up against him, her arms snaking around his neck, fingers threading into his hair. The towel fell. He made no move to retrieve it.</p><p>She barely had to stand on her toes to find his lips. He dipped his head, allowing her to ease back to her feet. She could have no doubt of his desire for her as they seemed to meld together, the toned flesh of her body hot and vibrant. He caught her chin, formed his lips over hers, pressed deep into her mouth with his tongue, and felt the spiraling tightness within himself. Purely sexual sensations ripped through him like a storm surge at sea. He felt as if he were consuming her mouth, his blood electric with the response to her taste, scent, touch.... She was sweet, so sweet, everything his dreams had whispered and he had been so determined to deny. Vital and passionate, the shape of her body was simple sin.</p><p>He kissed her, felt that he died a little with the pleasure, his hands sweeping over her. He felt her quivering and he drew his lips away from hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOf you?\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, definitely.\u201d It was a teasing statement, but it was the truth, though in what way, he wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>\u201cOf...the night?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He wanted to know why. What demon plagued her. But stark desire overrode sanity. He didn\u2019t care. At that moment...screw decency. His mouth found hers again. He felt her fingertips riding down his back, over his buttocks. He held her fiercely. Dragged her down to the bed, rose above her. Her breath was coming in heady bursts. Her eyes were glittering as they touched his. And that smile curled her lips again, an expression of pure sex. She reached for him. Her fingers swept down his chest, curled around his erection. He gave a low groan, then lay against her again, catching her mouth as his hands swept over her skin, his lips following suit. He caressed her with fascination, finding the line of her collarbone, touching it with the delicate brush of his fingers and tongue. His hand curved over her breast just before his mouth fastened over her nipple, his lips circling the peak. His palm slid over her midriff, felt the tautness of her abdomen, lowered to feel the curve of her pelvic bone and the delicate lace of the thong. His body rubbed erotically against hers as he lowered himself, fingers sliding beneath the lace, tongue moving sensually atop the thin wisp of fabric between her flesh and himself.</p><p>She rocked beneath him. He caught the slender strand of lace, removed it, found her again beneath it. Caressed, ravished...felt the shiver of excitement that ran down the length of her, moved to spur her to an ever more desperate fever. She cried out and was up, meeting him, crashing into his arms, seeking his mouth with her own. They held each other while the world thundered out the beat of their passion. He caught her thighs, wrapped them around him, and thrust into her with a staggering hunger. Locked with her, he felt her inner pulse reach a frantic edge, fought his own desire to explode, felt the fantastic, delicious agony soar, felt her stiffen, shudder, shake in his arms, and allowed himself to catapult into final climax. He couldn\u2019t let her go, nor did she seem to mind. Tremors rippled through her as he embraced her, adjusting himself to lie beside her, to allow himself to grow soft within her, still hungry to touch, to maintain their connection. His body cooling at last, he felt the slickness of heat that covered them both and cradled her even closer. He listened as the pounding of their hearts lowered to a normal speed, felt every little quiver and movement within her, buried his face in the wealth of her hair.</p><p>Then he forced himself up, looking at her. Her eyes remained steady and wide on his.</p><p>\u201cThat was...\u201d he whispered, then ran out of words.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNot bad,\u201d she said, a slight smile teasing her lips.</p><p>\u201cNot bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of like being with a Nordic god for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cThunder and lightning and all that,\u201d she murmured. She reached out, touching his face. \u201cToo much like a god, maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever too much,\u201d he assured her. Her lashes swept to her cheeks, hiding her thoughts. \u201cThen again, never put a man on a pedestal,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be on a pedestal?\u201d she asked lightly, meeting his gaze again.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to fall off.\u201d Then he asked her seriously, \u201cWhy would you be afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you, exactly,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyself,\u201d she murmured, looking away once more. Then she stared up at him again. There was a very strange\u2014given the circumstances\u2014prim and almost shy tone in her voice as she asked, \u201cMay I stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would somehow dredge up the violence of my ancestors, conk you over the head and bodily hold on to you if you tried to leave,\u201d he assured her solemnly.</p><p>The gratitude in her eyes touched him to the core, tore at his heart as deeply as her sensuality affected his desires. Deeper, if at all possible.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and eased into his arms. He rested on an elbow, fascinated just to let his fingers stroke down the length of her back. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to explain what you meant before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I meant about what?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cBeing afraid of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He felt the subtle tension in her as she tightened in his arms. \u201cNothing,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He wanted to press the matter, but he didn\u2019t. Right now, he wanted her at ease and comfortable beside him more than he wanted the truth. He laid his head down by hers, still stroking the long and elegant line of her back. In a while, he realized she had fallen asleep. He wasn\u2019t sure what kind of a comment that was on his sexual prowess, but he was gratified she had found the serenity to sleep at his side.</p><p>Later in the night, he awoke when she shifted against him. That time their lovemaking began with the brush of her fingers against his stomach, then a slow fusion of their bodies. Soon he was fully awake, just as impassioned, as desperate, as volatile as before. The climax was just as shattering, the aftermath just as sweet, as lazy, with no words spoken\u2014just her body curled against his trustingly as she drifted to sleep once again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lay awake while she slept. She was incredible. Hot, bright, electric. He was crazy, letting himself become involved with her. Because she was...</p><p>Seeing ghosts. And he was being swept into her world as if into a vortex. He was crazy to let this happen, because...</p><p>Because it was crazy to fall for someone who might be totally insane.</p> <p>There was no way Genevieve regretted what she had done. She had never become involved with anyone lightly, never without feeling something real\u2014except, of course, when she entered into the ridiculous bet with Thor. But even then...as incredibly arrogant and obnoxious as she had found him, she had also found him compelling, even if only sexually at the time. Sadly, she mused, awaking in the morning, still comfortable and ridiculously secure in his arms, she had discovered she found him fascinating, not as arrogant as she had assumed, and not at all obnoxious. She cared about him. Worse, she really liked him and admired him.</p><p>He had been kind to her last night.</p><p>Kind? She didn\u2019t want kindness. Although, she mused, they also had incredible chemistry. Which didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t still questioning her sanity. After all, she had literally stripped for him and asked him to bed. Not too many men would have turned her down.</p><p>So they hadn\u2019t sworn eternal vows. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted such a relationship, anyway. Real involvement meant so much more than sex, a true learning about each other. But...she did care about him. She didn\u2019t want this to be an \u201cI\u2019m afraid and you\u2019re great in bed\u201d situation.</p><p>But no ghosts had darkened her dreams when she had been with him. She had been completely involved, felt completely protected, even in sleep.</p> <p>He rose. She heard him enter the bathroom, heard the shower start. A few minutes later, he walked out in a towel\u2014damn, he wore a towel well\u2014and strode out to the kitchenette to put coffee on. She rolled out of bed, headed into the shower herself, and emerged in a towel, as well, just in time to be offered a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cGood morning. Are you sorry you\u2019re here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI came here of my own free will, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not sure why,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She was tempted to ask him if it really mattered so much. She refrained. \u201cGood coffee,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to mess up when it comes premeasured,\u201d he said, studying her. He set his cup down and put his hand on her shoulders. \u201cI actually thought you\u2019d try to disappear by first light or something,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cShould I slip you out somehow, pretend you were never here?\u201d he asked, his voice pleasantly soft, a bit amused.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not unless you don\u2019t want people to know I was here,\u201d she said.</p><p>That brought a deep smile. She wasn\u2019t sure what it meant.</p><p>\u201cI do have a lunch date, though. With Bethany. We\u2019re going to see an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. The mystic.\u201d He made his voice spooky for the final word.</p><p>She hoped she kept her tone level and her voice indifferent. \u201cDon\u2019t go telling anyone else, but Audrey is the first to admit she doesn\u2019t see a thing. She does what she does to make money, and apparently she does well. Not a bad business to run in Key West.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, waiting.</p> <p>\u201cActually, though,\u201d she admitted ruefully, \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly dress to be seen, and I imagine others are up and about now. Then again, I did walk through town in high-heeled sandals and a nightshirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitch the sandals. The nightshirt could just be a bathing suit cover-up,\u201d he told her gravely. \u201cIt will be just fine. Or, if you\u2019d rather, you can give me the key and I\u2019ll walk over to your cottage and get whatever you\u2019d like. But first, you might want to tell me why you decided to walk through the streets of Key West in high-heeled sandals and a nightshirt.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the last. By morning\u2019s light, he seemed taller and far more solid and entirely businesslike\u2014sane, no-nonsense, living in the real world\u2014more so than ever before. And, as she stood there, feeling his eyes on her, his hands on her shoulders, even more arresting. She was startled by the little pang that teased not just her senses but her heart. He was perfect. He loved what she loved. He seemed to have ethics she had never suspected. She wanted to...</p><p>Sleep with him, yes. But also have breakfast, walk on the beach...curl up to watch a movie, go horseback riding...spend endless time with him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d go to my cottage for some clothes, that would be really great,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>But he was still staring at her. Then he began to smile. And she knew from that smile just what he was feeling. Like a current, the heat of arousal raced through her, quickening her muscles.</p><p>He took the coffee cup from her, and then she was in his arms again. The towels were lost somewhere before they reached the bed. His every whisper, every move, was erotic. She wondered vaguely if that was simply because he was such an incredible lover, or because it was him. His breath against her flesh was a rapid-fire arousal. The brush of his fingers...the liquid of his kiss. And touching him...each ripple of muscle, pulse and tightness she created in him seemed to deepen her own sense of urgency and desire. In the end there was wildfire, sweet excitement, agony, longing, a climax that was violent and shattering...and the feel of his arms around her, as if she were the most wonderful woman in the world, the most cherished.</p><p>And then, a soft sigh of regret. \u201cI guess we should try the coffee thing again,\u201d he murmured. He rose; she heard the shower again. She was tempted to rise, to slip in with him.</p><p>But she had plans for the day, and they were important.</p><p>Desperate, actually.</p><p>He emerged, and she was somewhat surprised to see him dress as if for a casual business meeting, wearing black trousers and a short-sleeved tailored shirt. But he had refrained from pressing her, so she decided it wasn\u2019t her business to ask him what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cGive me the key and tell me what you want, and I\u2019ll try to find it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, he returned, bringing her a choice of clothing. She thanked him, showered and dressed. He was sipping coffee on the porch when she emerged.</p><p>\u201cI imagine everyone is going to know we\u2019re having an affair,\u201d he told her, looking out across the sand. \u201cI ran into Jack and Alex when I went to your cottage earlier.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cThey\u2019ll all be talking about us today.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when he studied her gravely. \u201cI seldom, if ever, do anything I\u2019d have to hide,\u201d he told her. \u201cUnless I was asked.\u201d Then his smile returned. \u201cAre we having an affair?\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the simple question seemed to give her a little thrill, a renewed sense of warmth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d certainly hate to think I wasn\u2019t going to be with you again,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, then.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and started across the sand. Then she paused and turned back. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the tiki bar later, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some things to do today. But I\u2019ll make sure to end up there.\u201d</p><p>It was frightening to feel such a burst of happiness at his words. But she merely waved casually and started over to Bethany\u2019s cottage.</p><p>Bethany must have been watching, because the door opened before Genevieve even reached the porch.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Bethany said. She was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Bethany grabbed her by the arm, practically dragging her inside. \u201c\u2018Hey?\u2019\u201d She took a moment to stare into Genevieve\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh, my God\u2014you slept with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it. I knew it from the first second I saw you two together. It was in the air. I got hot just watching the two of you stare at each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he incredible?\u201d Bethany asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cBethany!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now can we go to lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch? You wound up in his cottage for a night of total abandon, and you\u2019re worried about lunch? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually here.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve groaned. \u201cBethany...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cBethany, I still need help,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Bethany sobered instantly, putting her arm around Genevieve and pulling her tight for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine. Really. But...wait,\u201d she said, studying Genevieve\u2019s eyes. \u201cSomething else happened. Oh, my God! That\u2019s why you wound up at his cottage. You\u2019d gone home, so what happened that made you come back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened. I just decided I wanted company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t like being alone.\u201d</p><p>Bethany looked at her shrewdly. \u201cLet\u2019s see. You\u2019ve known me all your life. And Victor. And Alex is on our team. Marshall is like, well...he\u2019s practically Uncle Marshall. Hell, you\u2019ve even known Jack since you were a kid. But who did you run to? Thor Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany, we have to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s go. You can give me the details as we walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you finally got Gen over to your place, huh?\u201d Jack said, grinning. \u201cYou should feel privileged. That girl doesn\u2019t play around. She\u2019s seriously discriminating. She is one woman who can pick and choose. But she\u2019s great, huh? Sorry, that\u2019s not from experience. I just remember watching her grow up. She always promised to be extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a beautiful woman,\u201d Thor said, regretting the fact that he\u2019d stopped at the tiki bar before taking off. A phone call from Jay had come less than ten minutes after Genevieve had left. He was to meet him at the station at Stock Island in an hour. He was only here because he\u2019d known he could get breakfast fast. But Jack had been here already, savoring an omelet. Victor appeared just as Jack finished speaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it was hard to escape when he\u2019d just ordered food.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey...so those who discover together sleep together, huh?\u201d Victor teased, taking a seat at the bar alongside Thor and Jack.</p><p>Apparently, it didn\u2019t matter that Jack had been talking about Genevieve; the fact that she had walked into his cottage late last night and walked out that morning might as well have been on wide-screen TV.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as our Gen is happy,\u201d Jack said. He was still grinning, but there seemed to be a paternal warning in the words despite the fact that he was working for Thor.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy,\u201d Thor said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Victor accepted a cup of coffee from the morning bartender and turned to Thor. \u201cBut you think she\u2019s crazy, right? What the hell. If I met a stranger who looked like Gen and she was willing, I\u2019d give it a go\u2014even if I questioned her sanity. I mean, you don\u2019t have to be sane in bed. In fact, I think it\u2019s better when there\u2019s a little insanity going on.\u201d</p><p>Screw breakfast. Thor stood, trying to remember that these people were her friends, that they cared about her. And he had to admit, he was feeling a little guilty.</p><p>Part of him did want to keep his distance. He didn\u2019t want to find himself inextricably involved with someone who hallucinated on a regular basis.</p> <p>\u201cI have an appointment. I think I\u2019ll skip breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>Alex came walking toward the tiki bar just as he was leaving. \u201cHey, hey, hey. I hear you\u2019ve got a new thing going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a great fucking day, Alex,\u201d Thor muttered, and headed for the parking lot.</p><p>9</p><p>A udrey looked pretty and completely normal\u2014just as she had always looked\u2014when they met. They chose Pierre\u2019s, an off-the-beaten-path local place up by the Bahamian village. Anthony, Audrey informed them as they waited for the owner to prepare them a special table, believed in her powers.</p><p>\u201cWhat powers?\u201d Bethany asked. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe powers I don\u2019t have,\u201d Audrey explained ruefully. \u201cOh, there we go\u2014the table by the fountain.\u201d As they were seated, she introduced them to the tall, thin Bahamian who owned the place.</p><p>He smiled and shook Bethany\u2019s hand, first, but when he took Genevieve\u2019s hand, his smile faded and he looked worried.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come for help,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>She shook her head, suddenly uneasy. \u201cI\u2019m just here for lunch with my friend,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cAnd what a lovely place. I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t been here yet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t take her comment lightly. He didn\u2019t even thank her for the words. He shook his head, muttering something in a language she didn\u2019t understand, then told her, \u201cI will pray for you, our special prayers. We know the dead walk among us. Others are blind. They are afraid. They think pretending not to see things will make them go away. They are mistaken. The dead come back for a reason.\u201d</p><p>He nodded somberly at her, then gave himself a shake and offered them a broad white smile. \u201cEnjoy your lunch.\u201d</p><p>After he left, they all sat in stunned silence for a minute.</p><p>Bethany reached across the table, covering Genevieve\u2019s hand with her own.\u201d That was the luck of the draw. He had to say something like that to one of us. He happened to pick you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBull!\u201d Audrey exploded. \u201cAnthony knows things.\u201d</p><p>Bethany stared at her wide-eyed. \u201cYou\u2019re a fake. You told us so yourself.\u201d</p><p>Audrey sighed. \u201cI\u2019m a fake, yes. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know people who are real, that I don\u2019t hear the buzz on people who really do...know things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>Audrey looked at Genevieve. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the liberty of calling in...a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Genevieve groaned softly.</p><p>Audrey shook her head. \u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t understand. I got his number from a friend who got it from a friend...he handles investigations for the government, for God\u2019s sake. He\u2019s the real thing.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve sighed. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I read all the articles, and I go to meetings and...Trust me, the only way I pull off any of this is because I know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s like any job. I do my research. I know when I\u2019m reading about a bunch of fakes\u2014like me\u2014versus the real thing. Go ahead and look him up yourself. His name is Adam Harrison, Harrison Investigations. He and his company don\u2019t troll for business. He isn\u2019t in it for the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why...?\u201d Bethany asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cHe lost someone years ago. Anyway, he has a knack for knowing when people are seeing someone, getting a message from someone beyond the grave. He doesn\u2019t have the gift himself, but he can recognize it in others. Even though he doesn\u2019t see them himself, he isn\u2019t blind, like Anthony said. He knows.\u201d She reached into her handbag and handed Genevieve a folded sheet of paper she had apparently ripped from one of her psychic journals. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, once you read it. Look, weird things are happening to you, right?\u201d</p><p>Their waitress arrived, so Genevieve didn\u2019t answer until they ordered.</p><p>\u201cYes, weird things are happening to me,\u201d Genevieve murmured once the waitress had gone.</p><p>\u201cSo weird she wound up in a hot new relationship with Thor,\u201d Bethany said, grinning.</p><p>Audrey stared at Genevieve. \u201cThor Thompson, huh? Cool. Except that...well, it will probably be different with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will be different?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not known for sticking around anywhere,\u201d Audrey murmured. \u201cBut then, you\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>She was different, all right. She was worse. Far worse. She was crazy.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>Audrey shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that came out wrong. You know what\u2019s freaky, though?\u201d Audrey asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know how I keep telling you I\u2019m a fake? But I don\u2019t even know everything that\u2019s happening to you, but...I get a creepy feeling. As if there\u2019s an aura around you. In fact, when you two left the other night, I was afraid. As if some kind of dark shadow remained when you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her, not me,\u201d Bethany said quickly.</p><p>\u201cBethany!\u201d Genevieve snapped.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t worry. Like I said, Adam Harrison is coming himself. He\u2019ll talk to you, probably bring in a few investigators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey, no! I can\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019ll be thrown off the project so fast you won\u2019t believe it,\u201d Genevieve told her.</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t the kind of people who come in and make a big splash. Trust me. Adam will be discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like you know the man, but you don\u2019t. You got his number from a friend, who got it from their friend,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, please, have some faith in me,\u201d Audrey implored.</p><p>\u201cI do. I just wish you hadn\u2019t asked anyone in without talking to me first,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go on just being scared and miserable?\u201d Audrey asked.</p><p>\u201cIt will be okay,\u201d Bethany said quietly. \u201cLook, as long as people are discreet, who\u2019s to know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a great feeling about this,\u201d Genevieve said doubtfully.</p><p>Audrey waved a hand in the air. \u201cMost people think ghosts are fun. They enjoy being a little bit scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re not really seeing ghosts,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cOpen up a little. That ghost is probably trying to help you.\u201d Audrey sighed. \u201cI wish a ghost would help me find a treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found one coin,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cNot exactly a treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s leading you to the treasure. Let her,\u201d Audrey said. She reached down into her bag again and brought out a stack of papers. \u201cI looked into the ship you guys are trying to find. Which I know you already did, but I had my own reasons.\u201d She stared shrewdly at Genevieve. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe the woman you\u2019re seeing is the poor dead girl they found on the beach, do you?\u201d</p><p>Gen stared at her in shock. \u201cHow did you...? No, never mind. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cSo listen, Gasparilla had quite a crush on this one woman. Interesting, because he could kind of plunder, pillage and rape at will. Maybe all guys just want the girl they can\u2019t have. Anyway, apparently he had a real thing for the captain\u2019s daughter, Anne. But even when he got hold of her, she spurned him for her young Spaniard, Aldo. Gasparilla was known for his violent temper and you\u2019re talking about a time when people were hanged for the least offense. Life was cheap. To Gasparilla, execution might have seemed like the right punishment for a woman who spurned him. So maybe your ghost is Anne, the captain\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Genevieve heard herself say.</p><p>\u201cYou know it makes sense. She likes you. Maybe she knows you care about more than just the treasure. Whatever. I truly believe once Adam gets here, he\u2019ll find a way to explain things and make you comfortable with what you\u2019re seeing. Your days are going to be a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do I do about my nights?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Audrey grinned. \u201cKeep sleeping with the stud.\u201d</p><p>Despite the savage damage done to the body by the sea, salt, exposure and hungry ocean creatures, it was still possible to see that the young woman had been pretty. Once. Even the fact that she had been sewn back together after the autopsy couldn\u2019t hide the fact that she had been blessed with great bone structure. Her hair had been a soft, natural blond. As the M.E. discussed the way the marks at her ankles gave evidence of her desperate effort to free herself, Jay\u2019s phone rang. The M.E. continued speaking unemotionally to Thor, detailing the water in her lungs, and the blood marks in her eyes. Because of the man\u2019s dispassionate tone, Thor was surprised when he met the doctor\u2019s eyes across the width of the gurney and saw sadness there. \u201cPoor thing,\u201d the M.E. said. \u201cAll that potential, lost. She was young. She wanted to live,\u201d he added softly. Looking up at Thor, he told him, \u201cI have a daughter just about this age. And as long as I\u2019ve done this, there\u2019s a part of me that is still staggered by man\u2019s inhumanity to man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jay came back into the room. \u201cShe has a name,\u201d he said. \u201cAmanda Worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily?\u201d the M.E. asked.</p><p>Jay shook his head. \u201cNone known. We got her name because some guy called in anonymously to tell us who she was. What she was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what was she?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>Jay looked at him, troubled. \u201cA working girl from Miami. Drifted south from somewhere up north. I guess she started out as a cocktail waitress on the beach, then found out that in certain clubs she could make a lot more money by being a little bit friendlier. The years went by. Younger girls came in. Then guys with the bigger bucks weren\u2019t so interested. Business had begun to slide for her.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOld and used up\u2014at thirty. She\u2019d picked up a cocaine habit, too, and started hitting the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that seems surprising, even if it\u2019s sad,\u201d Thor said. \u201cShe got mixed up with the wrong guy in Miami, I guess. He took her out on a boat and...hell, boats in Miami. There\u2019s a needle in a haystack for you.\u201d</p><p>Jay shook his head. \u201cThe caller seemed to know her pretty well. He said she had been all excited about a week or so ago, thought she was going to hook up with someone who might turn out to be more than a john.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...?\u201d Thor prodded.</p> <p>Jay stared him, then sighed.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the caller, she said she\u2019d be heading south. The guy wanted her to see his home. In Key West.\u201d Jay shook his head sorrowfully. \u201cIt sucks. I\u2019m looking for a local murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen people need to be really careful,\u201d Thor said softly. He was disturbed to feel a deep sense of unease. He tried to talk himself out of his fears. After all, the people he knew, the people he worked with, weren\u2019t hookers and coke addicts. Even so, he found himself thinking with relief that the dead girl was a blonde, not a redhead, like Genevieve, not that that was necessarily even a factor. Besides, Bethany was a blonde, so maybe she needed to be especially careful.</p><p>He was bothered by the bizarre turn his thoughts were taking. He found himself realizing he was becoming involved, something he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d intended to do, and it made him feel...disturbed. It was the only word he could think of. He was falling for a woman who saw ghosts. And there was a murderer on the streets.</p><p>None of it connected, he told himself.</p><p>He and Jay thanked the M.E. When they left, he asked, \u201cThink your higher-ups would let me use a police computer?\u201d</p> <p>Jay shrugged. \u201cSure. With your connections...don\u2019t see why not. Just what are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>Thor hesitated. \u201cDisappearances...murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much of a crime rate down here,\u201d Jay said, his tone slightly defensive.</p><p>\u201cShould make it easy, then,\u201d Thor told him.</p><p>Marshall didn\u2019t know quite what possessed him that day. He knew that any significant discovery could take not just days, but weeks or months. Sure, they had a coin, but the debris field could stretch well over a mile, taking into consideration the battle was fought just before the storm delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe in diving alone. Even top-ranked divers died that way. And he had a crew, a great crew.</p><p>A crew that included Genevieve Wallace, who despite having suddenly gone off the deep end on him\u2014no pun intended, he assured himself\u2014had made the first discovery. So...</p><p>So everyone had Saturday off. And God knew what they were all doing. Trying to take their minds off things, probably. It wasn\u2019t every day a body washed up on the beach.</p> <p>His own mood wasn\u2019t great, but the urge to dive was on him. It was like a senseless itch, as if someone were pushing him to do something he didn\u2019t want to and knew he shouldn\u2019t. He fought it for a while. Then, just after lunch, he took off by himself. He found his coordinates, set out a dive flag and plunged in.</p><p>The reefs here were familiar to him, as familiar as the back of his hand. For people who spent their time in these waters, there were landmarks, just like tall buildings, statues, even curves in the road. He knew where Genevieve and Thor had found the coin; they had left a bright blue marker to identify the spot.</p><p>Staghorn coral covered the seabed beneath him. Beds of brain coral also found a home in the area. The fish life was rich and varied, as well. Fish in a myriad of colors darted all around him. He kept close to the bottom, searching the sand for any little ripple or oddity.</p><p>He had painstakingly covered about twenty feet of the ocean bed when he felt the first bump against his right thigh.</p><p>He straightened instantly, reaching to his calf for his dive knife.</p><p>His first thought was, shark.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t frightened by the thought; he\u2019d been in the company of sharks\u2014lemons, hammerheads, blue, reef tips\u2014on many occasions. This was the ocean; it was where they lived. They preferred to stay away from divers most of the time. Every once in a while though, a shark would become curious and get close. Sometimes one would even butt a diver. But it was true, in his experience, at least, that clanging a knife against a dive tank or simply landing a good punch on the creature\u2019s nose would quickly send it away, even if it was a pretty big boy.</p><p>Or it could be a grouper, which could grow to huge sizes. They could be friendly. In fact, divers often found a grouper hanging around the same reef on a daily basis; they would name it, and sometimes tourists would come and pet the damned fish.</p><p>But when he looked around, he saw nothing. There was no six-hundred-pound grouper nearby that could have given him a friendly nudge. And if it had been a shark, it had disappeared damned fast.</p><p>He took his time, surveying his surroundings in all directions. Nothing. He turned back to his study of the ocean floor. He covered another twenty feet.</p><p>And then it came again.</p><p>A feeling that he\u2019d been...</p><p>Pushed. Shoved.</p><p>And that he wasn\u2019t wanted here.</p><p>Which was absurd. He was too old, too experienced and too levelheaded to believe anything so foolish.</p><p>But the sense of unease had settled in, just like the itch to get into the water had settled over him earlier. He told himself that he was a rational man. He held still, listening to the sound of his own breath through the regulator.</p><p>After a moment, he went on once again.</p><p>The next shove came almost immediately. And it was hard. It sent him flying through the water.</p><p>Marshall didn\u2019t pause to think at all. He didn\u2019t even look around. He shot to the surface, then swam for all he was worth until he reached his boat. Even as he threw his flippers up on the dive platform and wrenched off his mask, he felt a tug. On his leg. A forceful pull that threatened to drag him down into the depths...</p><p>No, he thought. Not like this.</p><p>Another jerk, hard against his ankles...</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d</p><p>There was a screaming, keening sound that seemed to tear across the blue sky, scattering the powdery clouds...</p><p>The sound was him.</p><p>There was no one at the tiki bar when Genevieve and Bethany returned from their lunch. Bethany yawned. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to take a nap,\u201d she said, then looked at Genevieve. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not going to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany, I\u2019m fine. I can\u2019t spend my entire life around other people,\u201d Genevieve told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but let\u2019s wait until you meet that Adam guy, huh?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve, staring down the docks, noticed that Marshall\u2019s boat was gone. She turned to Bethany, ignoring her friend\u2019s last comment. \u201cMarshall went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall is impatient,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cHe was the one who said we should take things slow, that this job was going to take time, and we shouldn\u2019t forget to have lives, so we wouldn\u2019t get sick of the work,\u201d Genevieve reminded her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he went fishing,\u201d Bethany suggested.</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Bethany yawned again. \u201cDamn it. Go take a nap,\u201d Genevieve told her.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can do something lazy, like watch a DVD.\u201d</p><p>Looking around, Genevieve saw that Victor\u2019s door was ajar. \u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cLook.\u201d She set her hands on Bethany\u2019s shoulders, turning her friend so she could see Victor open the door. \u201cI won\u2019t be alone. I\u2019ll go visit Victor. Quiz him about his latest conquests. He\u2019ll enjoy that. I\u2019ll be fine. You go and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he isn\u2019t entertaining a conquest right now?\u201d Bethany demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause his door is open,\u201d Genevieve told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you have a good point. But if you need me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I need you, I swear, I\u2019ll be on your doorstep. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Bethany at last gave her a hug, yawned again and started off for her own cottage. Genevieve turned to head toward Victor\u2019s.</p><p>She walked across the sand, then paused on his porch. There seemed to be a lot of thumping and banging going on inside. As she stood there, debating whether to knock, the door started to open.</p><p>\u201cVictor,\u201d she said.</p><p>Then she gasped.</p><p>He was standing there with a head in his hands. A mannequin\u2019s head. The hair was stiff and flattened to the skull. Wide, blue, unseeing eyes stared out at Genevieve.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed instantly as she stared at her friend.</p><p>Victor appeared stricken. \u201cGenevieve, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d she said softly, and started to turn.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he cried.</p><p>He tried to catch hold of her shoulders, but she shook him off. He raced around in front of her, the offending head still in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he told her anxiously.</p><p>She stopped dead, staring at him coldly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand?\u201d she said coolly. \u201cRight. Get away from me, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, please, I swear to you. I\u2019m not the one who did it,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, staring at him. She\u2019d known Victor forever, and she wouldn\u2019t have put the joke past him. And the fact that he had fished the mannequin out of the sea, once the real body had surfaced, was only common decency. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he was staring at her with what seemed to be sincere apology and complete honesty.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said smoothly. \u201cThe mannequin just appeared in your cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to you, it\u2019s the truth. We can go to church and I\u2019ll swear to you right before the altar, I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Was she an idiot to even consider believing him? While he was standing there with a head in his hands?</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I thought it would be funny to put a mannequin on your porch. But not to hurt you. You\u2019re like my best friend forever. I would never hurt you. Ever. I thought it might smack you back into reality, that\u2019s all. But I didn\u2019t do it. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who did?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cAnd how did it wind up back in your cottage?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He\u2019d either gotten pretty damn good at acting, she thought, or he was telling the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you holding the head?\u201d</p> <p>He flushed, looking away for a moment before turning back to her once again, eyes steady, cheeks flushed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be caught with it. I was dismantling it so I could take it to some Dumpster piece by piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, you can ask at every store on the street. I never went to anyone trying to borrow or buy a mannequin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will check on it, you know,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he repeated pleadingly.</p><p>Glancing down the beach, Genevieve saw that Alex was out, walking toward the tiki bar. She hadn\u2019t noticed them arrive, but Liz and Zach were seated there, as well.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better hide the evidence then,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He swallowed, following her glance toward the tiki bar, and nodded. \u201cGen, I swear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I believe you. But if I ever find out you\u2019re lying to me...well, friends don\u2019t do stuff like this to friends. A joke is one thing\u2014even if it wouldn\u2019t have been funny to me in the least. Lying about it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hide that head. Especially under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He headed back toward his cottage, trying to nonchalantly tuck the head under his arm. He looked back at her. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she told him. And followed.</p><p>It looked like a strangely bloodless massacre had taken place inside. Arms lay atop his bed, legs were strewn on the floor. The torso had been tossed on the futon. The white gown lay crumpled and ruined beside it.</p> <p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Genevieve breathed.</p><p>\u201cHey, it was a mannequin. Not real,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She shook her head. He had a box of heavy-duty garbage bags by the coffeemaker. Standing by the door, Genevieve watched as he bagged an arm.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to help?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cVictor, you shouldn\u2019t be getting rid of it. We need to find out who did this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy? So that we know!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf I showed this to anyone, I\u2019d be blamed. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one the trick was played on. If I\u2019m not mad, what does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe me, but who else will? Not your new Romeo, that\u2019s for certain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Victor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to help or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re my friend, Victor, and I believe you. So it\u2019s important to find out who did this.\u201d</p><p>Again, he stubbornly shook his head. \u201cIt was a prank. It was put in here afterward just so I\u2019d be blamed. We need to make it disappear. Whoever did it will eventually start to get nervous and want to know what happened. He\u2014or she\u2014will start asking questions.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve folded her arms across her chest. \u201cShe? What woman could have done this? Not Bethany, I can assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put that in for political correctness,\u201d he said indignantly. \u201cBut what do we really know about Lizzie or her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so forget the she. And Zach. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have done this. They don\u2019t seem to have a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, because this was so funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please just help me, before someone else shows up?\u201d</p><p>She stared at Victor. Was she a fool to believe him? \u201cAll right. But like I said, if I ever find that you did this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, once the body parts are bagged, what next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we take a little walk and start to get rid of them. I\u2019ll even buy you a drink along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a deal,\u201d she murmured. She was surprised to feel queasy when she picked up a disconnected leg.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t real, she thought to herself.</p><p>Then again, were ghosts?</p><p>Jay got Thor started on the computer, showing him how to run the program. There hadn\u2019t been a problem. Jay\u2019s superiors seemed to believe that Thor had government connections, and that as head of the current salvage project, Thor should have access to information regarding criminal activity in the area.</p><p>Thor wasn\u2019t exactly sure why, but he found himself looking back over the last twenty years.</p><p>Some of the files contained crimes that had spanned both Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. The frequency of violent crime in the big city was frightening; but heading south, into Jimmy Buffett-ville, violence decreased. Live and let live. But there were still a number of murders on the books, most of them solved. Husbands who had killed wives. Wives who had killed husbands. Drug deals gone bad. Accidental killings. There were also files that contained crimes that hadn\u2019t been solved, or where the solutions were questionable. A two-year-old, drowned in a swimming pool. The child had suffered from severe birth defects. Had the agonized mother decided death was better than life? The police had been suspicious, but they had found no proof, and she had never gone to trial, with the death officially ruled accidental.</p><p>After a while, Jay excused himself, explaining he had paperwork to do.</p><p>After Jay left, Thor began to wonder what he was doing, just what he was looking for.</p><p>He moved on to missing persons reports.</p><p>Many of the missing had been found. Children were not always abducted; sometimes, they were runaways, and the Keys were a nice place to run away to. Warm weather, easy work, tourists willing to give handouts. Dina Massey, a blue-eyed blond sixteen-year-old from Ohio had made it down on a bus. After two months of panhandling, she had been questioned by a police officer. She had broken down, eager to go home but afraid of how her father would react. A picture showed tearful parents who had come for her, forgiving all. Donald Leto, of Fort Lauderdale, hadn\u2019t been so lucky. He, too, had run away. He, too, had been sent home. A notation at the bottom of the file noted that he had died back in Fort Lauderdale, a victim of vehicular homicide.</p><p>His father had been driving the car that killed him.</p><p>Thor decided he was looking for victims over twenty-one.</p><p>Right before he switched screens, however, he found a missing persons case that hadn\u2019t been solved. The bulletin had been sent from Miami. The girl in the picture, Maria Rico, was a beautiful blonde. She had disappeared just the year before. Friends suspected that either her abusive stepfather had killed her\u2014though police had found no evidence to support such a scenario\u2014or that she had run south. A \u201cfriend\u201d she had met on the Internet had suggested he could give her a haven from her abusive stepfather if she afforded him the opportunity.</p><p>No one knew the identity of the friend. And she hadn\u2019t been seen in Key West, though her photo had been plastered across the island.</p><p>Thor stared at the girl\u2019s picture. She had been seventeen at the time of her disappearance. Every inch a woman. He wondered why no one had suspected the woman found on the beach that morning might have been this runaway. He needed to ask Jay. Filing away the mental note, he went on.</p><p>The first unsolved disappearance he could find that was directly linked to Key West had occurred almost eight years ago. The woman\u2019s name had been Shea Alexandria. She\u2019d been born Mary Brown, but since she had intended to be the world\u2019s next supermodel, she had changed her name accordingly. She was blond and beautiful. Her picture seemed to jump off the page with attitude and humor.</p><p>Work in New York had led her to bathing suit jobs on the South Florida beaches. A promotion with a liquor company had brought her to Key West. After a party at which the attendees had imbibed heavily, she had vanished. She had left the party alone and never returned to her hotel room. There had been no signs of violence along her route.</p><p>She had left the party alone.</p><p>Somewhere, in a five-block area, she had simply disappeared. The case remained unsolved.</p><p>Thor flipped back through the files. There were two other still-unsolved missing persons cases that had been flagged by the locals, but there was no specific information that the women had been heading for the Keys. Both cases, however, were definitely on the curious side\u2014especially in light of the morning\u2019s findings.</p><p>He started searching the murder files again, looking for cases that specifically referred to Key West.</p><p>Then he stopped.</p><p>Hope Gonzalez.</p><p>Dead at thirty-two. Survived by her husband, Jay Taft Gonzalez.</p><p>Jay\u2019s wife?</p><p>Because of the suspicious nature of her death, Hope Gonzalez had been autopsied. The final verdict had been accidental drowning.</p><p>Thor sat back, still staring at the particulars. Hope and her husband had been out on their boat. While they\u2019d been snorkeling on one of the reefs, she had suddenly disappeared beneath the waves, according to Jay. He\u2019d dragged her up and performed CPR after calling in desperately for help.</p><p>The death had raised flags. But Jay Gonzalez had never faced trial, an internal investigation, or any repercussions from her death. Not according to the case file.</p><p>Thor had a creeping feeling that he wasn\u2019t alone. He looked up. Jay was standing by the desk. \u201cYou knew that I\u2019d find this,\u201d Thor said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew you\u2019d find it. Anyone could have told you, anyway. Hope...Hope has been gone several years now. No one has ever forgotten her. No one should ever forget her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one suspected that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I killed my wife?\u201d Jay asked.</p><p>Thor lifted his hands.</p><p>\u201cI loved her,\u201d Jay said. He rolled back his sleeves. Thor saw the scars on his arms. \u201cI loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to commit suicide\u2014and the department let you stay?\u201d Thor asked skeptically.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I had an accident. I was on medical leave for a few months.\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a good cop,\u201d Jay said quietly, and with conviction.</p><p>Thor nodded, rising. \u201cAre you off? Want a drink? There are some questions I\u2019d like to ask you about some of what I found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They walked out of the building. Thor felt as if the picture of Hope Gonzalez had been emblazoned in his mind.</p> <p>Because she, too, had been blond. And very beautiful.</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cD o you have enough ketchup?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>Genevieve hadn\u2019t really needed help shopping, but after having disposed of the mannequin with Victor, she had found herself at the tiki bar where talk had turned to her planned barbecue, and that in turn had reminded her that she had to have something to put on the barbecue. She, Bethany, Victor and Alex had wound up at the grocery store together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got ketchup,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLots of it, I hope,\u201d Alex said, grinning. \u201cVictor puts ketchup on everything in sight. Including grilled fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s an American vegetable, remember?\u201d Victor said defensively.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I have ketchup,\u201d Genevieve assured them. She swept out a hand, indicating the cart. \u201cBeer, wine, soda, water. Ribs, chicken, hamburger, and we\u2019ll stop at the fish market for whatever\u2019s fresh. Fruit salad, coleslaw...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSalad salad,\u201d Victor said. \u201cWithout any of that weird grassy stuff the restaurants all seem to think is gourmet now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench fries, corn on the cob, onion rings,\u201d Genevieve continued. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019s dessert?\u201d Alex demanded. \u201cAnd appetizers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany is baking a Key lime pie. And making conch fritters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re having conch chowder,\u201d Bethany put in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cooking?\u201d Victor said dubiously. \u201cWant to grab some cookies or ice cream, just in case?\u201d</p><p>Bethany slugged him lightly on the upper arm. He grinned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop at that new pastry shop, too, how\u2019s that? It\u2019s not like we\u2019ll have to throw a bunch of stuff away. We can bring it all back to the cottages if we have leftovers. Pack up some ice chests to take out on the water Monday,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Alex groaned. \u201cUgh. Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll actually be glad to go back in the water,\u201d Genevieve said. She meant it, and she was actually surprised. Was the ghost going to show again? she wondered. The ghost who was not the unearthly remains of the poor woman found on the beach.</p><p>She was also anxious to find out why she kept seeing the vision\u2014and just what the vision wanted from her. She wasn\u2019t sure how she knew it, but she felt sure the ghost had some kind of message for her. A trade-off? If she helped the ghost, the ghost would help her find the treasure? But she wasn\u2019t in this business for the riches, though naturally she wanted to make a living, just like everyone else. Still...</p><p>I\u2019m being haunted, she thought. And it was better to face it than to...what?</p><p>Be terrified, time and time again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be happy to get back out in the water, too,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Alex agreed. He made a face. \u201cBut first we\u2019re getting another of the professor\u2019s lectures Monday morning. The one we didn\u2019t get on Friday. Could he possibly be more boring? His students must be ready to jump out the window. And when we\u2019re trying to find an old wooden ship that\u2019s decayed and covered with sand and coral, is it really going to matter if we know exactly what she originally looked like? Wait a minute! We already know that. We\u2019ve seen pictures.\u201d He shook his head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cIt matters,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Alex demanded.</p><p>Victor clamped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cState financing, buddy. State financing.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve wound up in line with Alex, while Victor and Bethany headed out to bring Victor\u2019s truck around front so they could pile the groceries into the back. She started stacking their purchases on the conveyor belt. She was startled when she turned to see Alex watching her with concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes...why?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNone of my business.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no...nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Alex, spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared, right?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a \u2018you freaked out in the water\u2019 kind of way, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m the one you usually spill your guts to, but I\u2019m here and I care about you and...well, hell. Gen, you\u2019re not sleeping with that guy just because you\u2019re scared, are you?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve felt her jaw clench in anger and shock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business, except that...hell. It is my business. We\u2019re like family. You could sleep on my couch without me so much as making a bad joke if you need to. Hell, I\u2019d give you the bed and take the futon.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stay angry. His eyes were so filled with concern.</p><p>She started to smile, but a niggling suspicion still teased at her. If Victor hadn\u2019t played the joke with the mannequin, the next best suspect was Alex.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to be scared, why did you play the joke with the mannequin?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t flush or betray the slightest guilt. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded. Then he did flush slightly. \u201cHey, we talked about it, but we nixed the idea.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, wishing she had the skill to know if he was telling her the absolute truth.</p><p>The clerk cleared her throat to get their attention. \u201cCredit card, debit or cash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebit,\u201d Alex said, producing his card.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is my invite,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supplying the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was my idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d the clerk said, popping her gum, \u201cbut there is a line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, please,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Thank you,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Victor and Bethany hopped out of the truck when Alex and Genevieve reached the street, and the loading went quickly.</p><p>As planned, they stopped at the pastry shop to pick up dessert\u2014just in case.</p><p>\u201cEven though I\u2019ve actually been making Key lime pie all my life?\u201d Bethany asked indignantly.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt to have extra munchies when we\u2019re diving,\u201d Victor told her. \u201cAlthough I have, um, complete faith this is going to be the best Key lime pie I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get any,\u201d Bethany said huffily.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can actually cook,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, we\u2019re not putting you to the test. The kitchen is too small, and Bethany has already called dibs on the baking,\u201d Genevieve said, lifting a hand as if she were interceding in an argument between siblings.</p><p>At her house, with the four of them unloading, the kitchen was soon filled with bags.</p><p>Victor, who, as one of her oldest friends, felt totally at home in her house, mumbled some excuse and lazed on the sofa, flicking the television on. He was looking for sports, she knew. Alex quickly joined him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get ice tomorrow,\u201d Bethany commented, lining up the bottles of soda and beer on the counter. \u201cThis stuff won\u2019t all fit in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Alex called.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Genevieve responded.</p><p>\u201cCome out here. They\u2019ve identified the body on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Thor asked. He\u2019d headed straight for the tiki bar when he got back to the resort.</p><p>Jack sat alone, looking depressed as he nursed a beer. He looked up like a puppy when Thor talked to him. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Thought I\u2019d find someone to talk to here,\u201d he said. He pointed across the tables. \u201cNew couple at the resort. They\u2019re here on their honeymoon.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cThe guy is some kind of an Indian, I think.\u201d</p><p>Thor glanced at the attractive couple across the way and sank into a chair opposite Jack. He waved to Clint for a beer.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAround,\u201d Thor replied vaguely. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really asking if I\u2019ve seen Genevieve, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really asking if you\u2019ve seen anyone,\u201d Thor said levelly.</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cAll right. I think Zach and Lizzie went up to the Dolphin Research Center on Grassy Key. You know how Lizzie loves dolphins. They were talking about doing that at one point, anyway. And Marshall...his boat is gone, so I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s out on the water, somewhere. The Conch kids and Alex? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Thor\u2019s beer arrived, and he smiled his thanks, wondering why he felt so on edge. Why? How about because there was a murderer on the loose in Key West.</p><p>He had barely taken a sip of his beer when Jack slammed a fist on the table and laughed. \u201cHell, I\u2019m an idiot. I know where they are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGenevieve\u2019s place. Barbecue tomorrow, remember?\u201d</p><p>Thor stood. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d</p><p>Jack rose, as well. \u201cWait up. I\u2019m not sitting here by myself anymore.\u201d</p> <p>When they arrived at Genevieve\u2019s, Victor let them in, eyeing them both warily. \u201cHey, hey, half the gang\u2019s all here,\u201d he muttered. He stood in the doorway, as if loathe to let them enter. Thor had the definite feeling it was him; after all, Jack was a Conch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Jack asked jovially. He swept past Victor as if he had every right to be there.</p><p>\u201cWe were just watching the news,\u201d Victor said glumly. \u201cThey\u2019re warning single women in the Keys to be careful. The victim on the beach has been identified. Haven\u2019t you guys seen a TV anywhere? Shit, every bar in town must be running the coverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I sit around bars all day?\u201d Jack demanded gruffly, then smiled. \u201cSo, got a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself, Jack,\u201d Genevieve called from the kitchen.</p> <p>Jack headed that way. Thor took a seat on the sofa, staring at the television. The news had moved on to the weather, though. There was a storm in the Gulf, but it was headed west.</p><p>\u201cCreepy, huh?\u201d Victor murmured, taking a seat next to Thor.</p><p>\u201cThe storm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cops thinking that the killer might be from around here. Hope it doesn\u2019t hurt tourism any, the way they\u2019re talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople rarely see themselves as potential victims,\u201d Thor told him. \u201cEspecially since the dead woman was a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope so. We survive on tourism,\u201d Victor murmured.</p> <p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Jack said cheerfully, coming from the kitchen and tossing a beer in Thor\u2019s direction. Taken by surprise, he was glad to catch it. \u201cUp in Miami, a few years ago, a guy killed a bunch of prostitutes around Eighth Street. It didn\u2019t cause a scare, though, since he only killed prostitutes. Now, if I\u2019d been a hooker, I\u2019d have found some long-lost relatives to visit until the guy was snagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, how can you be so cold?\u201d Bethany demanded, appearing in the doorway with a mixed drink. \u201cYou saw that poor dead girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it, but in my line of work, I\u2019ve seen dead people before. We all gamble with our lives. Girl like that, she gambled more than most. Hey, are we having dinner here tonight?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Alex laughed. \u201cThe last of the great sympathizers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry and lonely. Every one of you took off today. I saw the professor this morning, and I was almost desperate enough to have lunch with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are mean,\u201d Genevieve offered, coming out of the kitchen. Her eyes met Thor\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s not that bad a guy. He\u2019s an academic, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArmchair diver,\u201d Alex sniffed. \u201cCan\u2019t cut the mustard himself, so he thinks he\u2019s going to tell us all what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice,\u201d Genevieve warned him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about food?\u201d Jack asked, fingering the skull and crossbones in his earlobe.</p><p>\u201cWe bought lots of food,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cFor tomorrow,\u201d Bethany said firmly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere with upbeat music,\u201d Alex said thoughtfully. He looked around. \u201cJack is right, you know. I don\u2019t want to say anyone deserved such a fate, but...she was a prostitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right the first time,\u201d Genevieve said firmly. \u201cNo one deserves what happened to that girl.\u201d</p><p>No. No one deserved it, Thor thought. So what about the runaway who had disappeared, and the almost-supermodel?</p><p>And Jay Gonzalez\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cThor, what\u2019s up?\u201d Bethany asked, catching his thoughtful look.</p><p>He shrugged, forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m with Alex. Let\u2019s find some good food and good music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s do the Hog\u2019s Breath tonight,\u201d Bethany said. They all stared at her. \u201cHey, someone has to make decisions around here.\u201d</p><p>Thor rose. \u201cHog\u2019s Breath it is.\u201d</p><p>They opted for a table near the lone musician, a guitarist and singer. Thor had seen many talented singers with synthesizers at their sides, but this guy was a cut above. He joked with the crowd between songs. He wasn\u2019t a Conch, he told them, just a wannabe. At the end of his first set, he proved himself to be a decent human being, as well, speaking on a somber note. \u201cLadies, gentlemen, you are in Key West. And Lord knows, we want you here. We want you to buy lots of booze\u2014and my CD of original songs, of course\u2014but we also want you staying responsibly sober and careful. Know the one you\u2019re with, ladies Take care out there. Help us out. If you see or hear anything helpful to the police, let them know. I want you coming back to see me. And I want you to buy more CDs and eat more Key lime pie. Thank you all.\u201d</p><p>Thor rose. He felt Genevieve\u2019s hand on his\u2014he\u2019d made sure that this time he got the seat next to her when they sat down. She was looking at him with a frown and a question. He smiled at her. \u201cI like this guy so I\u2019m buying lots of CDs.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him with a smile. Something in him did a flip. He was falling too deep. Drowning. But he liked it, and couldn\u2019t quite stop himself. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>He found out when he bought the CDs\u2014he picked up three: one for his secretary in the Jacksonville office; one for himself; one for Lizzie and Zach, who he thought would enjoy it\u2014that the singer knew all about the dive. \u201cYou\u2019re working with Marshall\u2019s crew, right? And Gen?\u201d There was something soft in his voice when he said her name. \u201cWatch out for her, huh? She\u2019s a Key West treasure, kind of like the sunset.\u201d</p><p>When he got back to the table, Bethany was saying, \u201cI really hope they catch this guy. People need to be warned, but our whole economy is tourism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the navy, too,\u201d Victor said without conviction.</p><p>Bethany shivered. \u201cJust think. There\u2019s a killer here. He could be right here on the patio listening to the music and having supper, just like us. He could be right next to us when we walk down the street.\u201d</p><p>Just as she said the words, Thor looked up to see Jay Gonzalez, in a casual long-sleeved shirt and jeans, walking in.</p><p>Could it be...?</p><p>No, the guy had let him into the autopsy. He\u2019d arranged for him to access police files.</p><p>Cover-up?</p><p>All he knew was that he would keep his eye on the man until...when?</p><p>There were killers out there who were never caught.</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t realize just how long he\u2019d been staring at Jay until Genevieve nudged him. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all set,\u201d she said, her expression curious.</p><p>\u201cThe bill?\u201d</p><p>Victor cleared his throat. \u201cMy turn. I already picked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can expense meals,\u201d Thor reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I was starting to feel like a kept woman or something,\u201d Victor said, grinning easily. \u201cAnd tonight was probably the cheapest opportunity I was going to get. Reasonable place, and we\u2019re minus Lizzie, Zach and Marshall.\u201d</p><p>As they left, Jay Gonzalez raised a hand in greeting. Genevieve pulled away from Thor for a moment, walking over to Jay, giving him a hug, exchanging a few words. Thor realized he didn\u2019t like it. He wanted to drag her away from the man. He refrained, forcefully holding himself in check.</p><p>As Genevieve started walking back, Jay Gonzalez smiled and waved to him. He found he was forcing a smile in return. It was probably not a good thing to let the local cop know he was considering him as a candidate for the possible serial killer they were seeking. The guy had been good to him, getting him in to see the body, letting him search through police files. He owed him.</p><p>Still...</p><p>This was getting ridiculous. He was becoming suspicious of everyone.</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t so bad. Because the killer had to be someone.</p><p>Maybe someone they knew well.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Jay,\u201d Genevieve called out to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, see you tomorrow,\u201d Thor repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Jay called back.</p><p>Thor kept his smile glued in place. Fine. The guy was welcome to see them all anytime. Welcome to see Genevieve. Just as long as he was with her.</p><p>As they left, Genevieve linked her arm with his. \u201cI was thinking of going home tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, to be ready for the barbecue tomorrow and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He turned to her, smiling slightly. \u201cWe\u2019re walking with the others toward the resort, you know.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cYes, I am aware of that fact. I just want to make sure Marshall\u2019s boat is back,\u201d she told him gravely.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the resort, however, Marshall\u2019s boat wasn\u2019t back.</p><p>Genevieve was worried and said so.</p><p>\u201cYou know Marshall. He had the time off, so he went off somewhere. That\u2019s all,\u201d Victor said. \u201cHey, we\u2019ll call his cell, okay?\u201d</p><p>But Marshall didn\u2019t answer his cell.</p><p>\u201cWe should put out a missing persons report,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Victor groaned. \u201cHoney, he\u2019s a grown man. He hasn\u2019t even been gone twenty-four hours. He knows what he\u2019s doing. He has plenty of fuel capacity. He could\u2019ve headed up to the mainland for all we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still worried,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cGen...\u201d Victor set his hands on her shoulders. \u201cMarshall is a big strong guy. He\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s not a pretty blonde like the killer seems to be after. We\u2019ll see him tomorrow. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Genevieve said. Then she sighed. \u201cBut I guess there\u2019s no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, it\u2019s really okay. Victor is right. We found a dead woman,\u201d Jack reminded her gruffly. \u201cNot a man like Marshall. He can take care of himself. The guy who killed that woman...he likes the ladies, not gorillas like Marshall who can fight back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were all silent for a moment. Then Bethany said, \u201cVictor, I\u2019m on your couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can come to the house,\u201d Genevieve said. Did she sound a little nervous? Thor wondered, or was he imagining it? And if she was nervous, was it because she\u2019d opted to be alone with him, or because Bethany was going to be alone with Victor?</p><p>\u201cWith the two of you? No, thanks!\u201d Bethany laughed, then yawned. \u201cCome on, Victor. Let\u2019s go to bed. I\u2019ll just get a few things from my cottage for the morning.\u201d</p> <p>Victor groaned. \u201cYour cottage isn\u2019t a minute\u2019s walk from mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my toothbrush,\u201d Bethany insisted.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Victor grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHey, me having a toothbrush is for your benefit, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Are we getting that close?\u201d Victor teased.</p> <p>Bethany stared back at him. Victor laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It would be gross, like sleeping with my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m gross?\u201d</p><p>Victor stared at the others. \u201cI can\u2019t win here, can I?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>They laughed, but Thor wondered why Genevieve still looked uneasy.</p><p>They said their good-nights. Genevieve was quiet as they walked back to her house.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>She looked at him, startled. \u201cNothing\u2014well, other than the fact that the police believe the killer comes from the Keys.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAre you worried about Bethany?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! She\u2019ll be with Victor,\u201d she answered too quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou suspect Victor?\u201d he asked very softly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly! I\u2019ve known him my whole life.\u201d She smiled. Her words were both sincere and, somehow, a little uncertain.</p><p>He stopped walking.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re the least bit worried...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she insisted. She stared at him, shook her head and smiled. \u201cReally, I\u2019m not. We all know exactly where Bethany is.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, and they started walking again. \u201cI wish I knew where Marshall was,\u201d she said softly after a minute.</p><p>\u201cMarshall is a big guy. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Again she was silent for a minute. Then she looked at him, and he was certain her worry was just as much for him as for Marshall. \u201cThe biggest, most confident, toughest guy in the world can fall...if taken by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall is fine,\u201d he assured her. He believed that, right? So where the hell was the guy?</p><p>And just what was he doing?</p><p>Thor gritted his teeth silently, forcing an expression of complete calm over his features. He slipped an arm around her shoulders as they walked. \u201cMarshall will show up tomorrow. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew about the barbecue, so if he wasn\u2019t planning on coming, he would have said so,\u201d she agreed. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>Despite her words, she still seemed uneasy. When they reached her house, Thor tried to reassure her again. \u201cMarshall is fine, and so are we.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded. \u201cThor, if he doesn\u2019t show up tomorrow, I want to look for him, okay? And we\u2019ll call Jay, too. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m worried. Marshall is a social creature. He always hangs around with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Thor said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re all friends, as close as a pack of siblings\u2014but you don\u2019t date one another. Marshall is a good-looking guy. Maybe he went out on a date, huh?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that. \u201cYes, that is a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have been so worried if all\u2014\u201d he weighed his words before opting to say \u201c\u2014this wasn\u2019t going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tomorrow, if he doesn\u2019t show for the barbecue, we call the cops, and we look for Marshall. And when we find him, he\u2019ll probably be surprised, and maybe a little pissed, thinking he needs a life, too, and we should have respected that. So let\u2019s give this place a really good once-over\u2014or twice-over, if it makes you happy\u2014and make sure we\u2019re locked in, alone and safe and sound, okay?\u201d</p><p>His words seemed to help her. And once they got inside, he did walk through the entire house twice, with her following right behind him.</p><p>\u201cNothing in the closets or under the beds,\u201d he swore. \u201cShe\u2019s locked up tight. You\u2019re safe and sound. Except from me,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cYou still think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He found himself standing in front of her, his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI think you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>His words were the right ones, and they were true.</p><p>He didn\u2019t notice how they made it up the stairs and into the bedroom. It was as if she was instantly in his arms, their clothing melted away rather than taken off, with something like pure, wet, hot, primal fusion taking place. At one point some sense of sanity returned, and he murmured, \u201cI know you\u2019re worried. We don\u2019t have to...we don\u2019t have to...\u201d</p><p>Her eyes touched his. A slight smile teased her lips. \u201cI\u2019d crawl into your skin, if I could,\u201d she said, and her lips fell against his again instantly while their flesh burned together and their limbs entwined.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how other thoughts managed to stay in his mind as his sexual desire rose with volatile speed to madness. But she was beautiful in so many ways, body, mind and essence. Tall, vital, muscled, competent, proud, unique...lips full and sensual, hips capable of such extraordinary movement...His mouth savored and teased her flesh, his body, heart and head pounded...</p><p>It seemed he climaxed in a million ways, that he came to life when he should have been limp, her slightest movement awoke every erotic impulse in his system. Time seemed unending. Then she curled against him. And they slept.</p><p>He would never understand what happened then, in the middle of the night. He prided himself on his awareness. He\u2019d started that in the navy, on guard in the Middle East. He\u2019d made it a way of life when diving in foreign ports where safety wasn\u2019t even a suggestion. He usually awoke at the drop of a pin.</p><p>Instead, he woke slowly when he felt her shivering, trembling at his side. His mind seemed fogged. He became aware by degrees that he was surrounded by a strange dampness.</p><p>It seemed that he could smell the sea.</p><p>At last, somehow, he roused himself enough to realize he wasn\u2019t actually holding her, that she was a breath away from him. He wrapped his arms around her, listening then, fighting the mist in his mind.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply. She moved closer. Flesh on flesh so tight she might have crawled into his skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare. But you\u2019re here. Nothing...I\u2019m all right. I\u2019m all right.\u201d The first statement was said with a quiver. The second was stronger.</p><p>Her conviction allowed him to draw her tighter. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she murmured. She was silent a minute, close against him. He was amazed to realize how incredible it felt just to sleep beside her.</p><p>Just to hold her.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, drew her closer.</p><p>He was still tired. And sated. And ready for more sleep.</p><p>The fog returned. Darkness. Exhaustion. He fought it, waiting for her trembling to cease. And when it did, he gave way to sleep.</p><p>He knew when she awoke in the morning. Just as he should have been, he was alert at her first shift, as she slipped from his arms and arose.</p><p>She knew he had awakened. She planted a kiss on his lips.</p><p>He reached for her, but she slipped away. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d she said. \u201cNearly noon. We\u2019ll have company soon.\u201d</p><p>He lay in bed for a few minutes longer, closing his eyes, oddly tired. True, they had spent a lot of the night awake.</p><p>But he felt as if he\u2019d been...fighting all night. There was a feeling of exhaustion after sex, but that feeling was good, sated....</p><p>Damn, this was strange.</p><p>At last he rose himself.</p><p>As he did, he paused. There was a hint of something in the air. A teasing scent. He paused a moment; then he knew.</p><p>Seawater. The distinctive scent of the ocean.</p><p>He gazed at the bed. It was still...damp. He tried to tell himself they\u2019d indulged in some strenuous lovemaking, the kind that couldn\u2019t help but dampen the sheets.</p><p>He walked around the bed.</p><p>The floor was soaked next to the side where Genevieve had slept. He hunkered down and touched the Persian rug. The scent rose more strongly around him.</p><p>Seawater.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cT his is my uncle, Adam,\u201d Audrey announced, entering Genevieve\u2019s house. \u201cAnd Uncle Adam...this is everyone.\u201d</p><p>They were virtually the last to arrive. Jay Gonzalez had been first, with Bethany and Victor right behind him. Zach and Liz had been next. Then Jack, proud as a peacock as he arrived with a perfectly sized grouper, freshly caught that morning. Alex had arrived just seconds before Audrey and her uncle.</p><p>Only Marshall still remained among the missing.</p><p>And as for Uncle Adam, Thor was suspicious of him from the start, mainly, he had to admit, because he had arrived with Audrey.</p><p>Why Audrey irritated him so much, he couldn\u2019t say. It was just the entire idea of being a medium, a soothsayer, a tarot card reader, whatever.</p><p>Uncle Adam was tall, thin, almost gaunt, a man of perhaps sixty-something to seventy years in age. For all that, he was a handsome man with strong features and fascinating gray eyes. He was soft-spoken, polite, interested at every introduction.</p><p>Except, Thor thought, the guy stared at him a little too long. Made him feel uncomfortable. He\u2019d never in his life felt he was being read before, but that was the impression Adam gave him. He didn\u2019t like it. He liked it even less when he saw the older man speaking with Genevieve, who was smiling back and chatting, looking at the man as if he were her long lost uncle.</p><p>\u201cHey, want to give me a hand with the grouper?\u201d Jack asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t really want to, of course. He wanted to eavesdrop on whatever was being shared between Audrey, good old Uncle Adam and Genevieve.</p><p>Hell, he had to get a grip.</p> <p>He went outside with Jack. Genevieve had a nice setup for cleaning and preparing fish. The knife Jack handed him was sharp, and he was able to gut and fillet the fish as if it were butter.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think Marshall has gone off to?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall, remember? Your co-worker. Co-boss of our operation. This isn\u2019t like him. He loves a barbecue, and he loves Gen\u2019s place,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But we\u2019ve got a cop right inside. Maybe it\u2019s time to report him missing,\u201d Thor said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and maybe he\u2019ll have us all by the balls if we do,\u201d Jack said dryly. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s off getting hot and heavy with some woman.\u201d He grinned. \u201cCould be why he\u2019s not answering his cell. I mean, who wants to be interrupted in the middle of something, if you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t reply. He was anxious to finish with the fish.</p><p>Victor, cradling a cold bottle of beer, walked out to join them. \u201cNeed any help out here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jack indicated the pile of fillets they had just cut. \u201cYou\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI think I could cut up a fish in my sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Victor looked distracted as Jack pulled out a box of aluminum foil. \u201cTrust me, these fillets are going to be great. Loosely wrap them in the foil, add a pat of butter, a squirt of lime, dash of salt and pepper, and one clove of garlic...can\u2019t get any fresher. They\u2019re going to be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Victor murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Thor asked him.</p><p>Victor stared at him, startled. \u201cUh, nothing.\u201d</p><p>Thor shrugged and started wrapping the fish according to Jack\u2019s instructions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that guy,\u201d Victor blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cAudrey\u2019s uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Thor asked casually.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s...creepy,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cHe need a bath or something?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s just...creepy. Those eyes of his...kind of pale. And his skin is almost white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just not from the land of sun and fun, I guess,\u201d Thor murmured, though he felt uncomfortable, too. But the guy himself wasn\u2019t creepy. Rather, the guy gave him the creeps. Strange. Who the hell was he?</p><p>Then again, a lot of things were making him uneasy these days. And he didn\u2019t believe in feeling uneasy. Not like this. The world was full of known dangers. It was okay to be uneasy about going out in heavy seas. It was all right to have a sinking heart when you were going into a swamp after a plane crash.</p><p>But this...</p><p>\u201cHere you go, Victor. You want to be useful? Give Jack a hand. I\u2019ll go check up on Uncle Creepy, how\u2019s that?\u201d Thor said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for an answer but headed on into the kitchen to wash his hands. Genevieve came up beside him. Her eyes were sparkling; she seemed more alive, easier, happier, than he had yet seen her. She glowed. His stomach seemed to pitch and toss. She hadn\u2019t said anything about last night to him, and he hadn\u2019t had a chance to say anything to her. When he\u2019d gotten downstairs, guests had already been arriving.</p><p>She smiled at him, wrinkled her nose. \u201cTastes much better than it smells after cleaning, huh?\u201d she teased.</p><p>He slipped an arm around her, and brushed her lips with a kiss, heedless of anyone else who might be nearby. She didn\u2019t seem to mind. She hugged him back enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that all about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just feel as if a weight has been lifted.\u201d</p><p>She started to walk away.</p><p>He pulled her back.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Uncle Adam?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She pulled back and looked him in the eye. \u201cA very nice man, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He dried his hands and walked into the living room. The stereo was playing. Adam was sitting on the sofa, next to Audrey. Bethany and Alex were trying some kind of a dance step. Lizzie was laughing at the two of them, and Zach was warning her that he would make her learn if she wasn\u2019t careful. Jay was just watching, nursing a beer.</p><p>Thor sat down next to Adam.</p><p>\u201cSo, Adam, where are you down from?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>\u201cVirginia. You?\u201d</p><p>The man had a smooth, cultured accent that seemed reminiscent of mint juleps, Southern breezes and total refinement.</p><p>\u201cJacksonville,\u201d Thor answered. \u201cWhat brings you down this way? Or have you come just to spend some time with Audrey?\u201d he asked. On his other side, Audrey flushed. He hoped she was a better actress when doing readings for her clients. She couldn\u2019t have looked more guilt stricken.</p><p>\u201cKey West is a great place to visit,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Thor agreed. Like hell. This guy didn\u2019t look like a boater or a fisherman. Definitely not a diver. He didn\u2019t even look as if he was particularly fond of heat. And he was too old for the more ribald shenanigans Key West was known for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a chance to talk with you alone, under quieter circumstances,\u201d Adam said. Again Thor had the feeling he was being read. Being read? Hell, no. This guy had taken one look at him and it was as if he had finished the final chapter. Creepy.</p><p>Thor shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re diving again as of tomorrow. No lunch breaks on land, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fond of breakfast?\u201d the older man queried, a slight twist to his smile.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we meet early, then?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized he had hesitated until Audrey looked at him. Her eyes were wide, sincere. \u201cYou should. You two should get to know each other,\u201d she said. Her tone had a hint of a tremor.</p><p>He decided grimly that he would definitely meet with the man. Alone. They needed to have a discussion before the man tried to convince Genevieve she merely needed to commune with the dead or something equally ridiculous to banish her nightmares.</p><p>Seawater. There had been seawater beside the bed.</p><p>No. She had showered, then dripped on the rug, and the seawater smell was coincidence. The air of the Keys smelled like seawater in general, a good smell, one that was everywhere.</p><p>This was ridiculous. They were sucking him into some bizarre fantasy world. He wasn\u2019t going to let it happen. \u201cI\u2019ll see you early then. I have to be on the dock by seven-thirty, so let\u2019s say 6:00 a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. I\u2019m staying at La Concha. Let\u2019s eat there.\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded and rose, wondering if he looked as grim as he was feeling.</p><p>He went to find Genevieve, who was in the kitchen, setting raw vegetables on a tray. She arched a brow as he caught her hand. \u201cThe carrots can wait a second,\u201d he told her. She smiled back, bemused and still curious as he pulled her into his arms for a kiss.</p><p>They were interrupted when Victor announced that the fish was ready, and suggested everyone grab a plate and step out back, where the burgers and chicken were already waiting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a second. Let me throw out some of this garbage first,\u201d Genevieve said, heading for the living room to clean up the empties. Thor followed to help.</p><p>Victor had left his empty beer bottle sitting on the coffee table. Thor picked it up, then froze and stared at it in shock.</p><p>The label had been viciously shredded, almost as if torn apart by the talons of an enraged bird.</p><p>Beyond a doubt, it was an interesting day. Genevieve wasn\u2019t sure why. Nothing had changed, but just meeting Adam Harrison had somehow made things better.</p><p>She wondered if she would still see the ghosts in her dreams.</p><p>The pirates, clothes tattered, bones sticking out of their rags, faces grim, weapons in hand, marching silently through what seemed like the deepest regions of the sea, stalking her...</p><p>The beautiful woman, white gown flowing, hair wafting on an invisible current, standing protectively between her and the decaying pirates, whispering her warning...</p><p>Beware...</p><p>Haunting her mind, her soul.</p><p>Fighting the dream each time, waking.</p><p>And then, for terrible seconds, the fear gripping her like a vise. Hard and torturous, squeezing her heart. Each time, she fought to breathe. To believe again in the light of day. She dared to say nothing, questioning her own sanity even when the visions faded and she knew she was alone. She thought gratefully of the solidly real man who had been at her side this morning. His being there gave her strength, made her long to describe each second of the strange, terrifyingly real dream, but she didn\u2019t dare.</p><p>She knew she would lose if he questioned her sanity much longer.</p><p>Somehow, she believed, Adam Harrison would change...everything. And so, during the course of the barbecue, she felt as if she were on cloud nine.</p><p>Except for one thing. She thought she was the only one worrying about it until Bethany\u2019s Key lime pie and coffee were served.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jay,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of worried. Marshall didn\u2019t show up today.\u201d</p><p>Jay looked at him, forkful of Key lime pie halfway to his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about Marshall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us has seen him in a couple of days,\u201d Jack explained.</p><p>Jay didn\u2019t look particularly worried. \u201cMarshall is...Marshall. He has a private life. I know you guys share a lot, but I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t feel he has to tell you if...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s getting some?\u201d Alex finished dryly.</p><p>Jay shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to file a missing persons report,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Bethany said, \u201cthat we\u2019ve waited this long. But if Marshall doesn\u2019t show for work tomorrow, it\u2019s definitely time to worry.\u201d</p><p>There were murmurs of agreement all around. Gen tried to convince them otherwise, but by then everyone was too busy with dessert to listen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shortly afterward they all began to split up. Jay left first, hugging Genevieve warmly, thanking her, warning her gruffly to be careful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful,\u201d she assured him. He looked over her shoulder at Thor.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s good that...I think,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the good guys, I believe,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jay nodded. \u201cSometimes we have to go on logic and belief, huh?\u201d</p><p>She agreed, and bade him good-night, promising him that they were still on for a dinner sometime during the week.</p><p>Audrey and Uncle Adam were the next to leave.</p><p>As Jay had done, Audrey hugged her, but Audrey\u2019s hug was fierce. \u201cYou take care. And thank you. This was great. It\u2019s been too long since we spent time together.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve hugged her back, just as fiercely. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Audrey grinned. \u201cMy pleasure. Uncle Adam is cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Adam was the next one to say goodbye. Just feeling his handshake and meeting his eyes made Genevieve feel better. \u201cTomorrow night, then. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she glanced uneasily over her shoulder, wondering where Thor was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019m having breakfast with him.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes went wide with alarm.</p><p>But Adam Harrison shook his head. \u201cTrust me. And don\u2019t worry. I already have people down here to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son is with me, and there\u2019s a couple at the resort. Nikki and Brent Blackhawk. You\u2019ll like them. He\u2019s worked with me a very long time. And Nikki...Nikki has what it takes. You\u2019ll get to meet them soon. And though I don\u2019t have the gift, I have a hunch. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>She stepped up and kissed his cheek. She was surprised and embarrassed. He just smiled, squeezing her hand. \u201cWe need to learn how to listen,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Then, arm in arm with Audrey, he was gone.</p><p>There was a sudden silence. Genevieve turned around. All her remaining guests were silent, staring after the two who had just left.</p><p>Then Victor blurted out, \u201cThat guy is fucking weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta agree,\u201d Alex said.</p> <p>She could see Thor standing, grim and silent, just behind the two.</p><p>He agreed, as well. She could tell.</p><p>\u201cThen again,\u201d Jack said, \u201cAudrey\u2019s a little weird herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all nuts,\u201d Genevieve informed them. \u201cTo you guys, anyone who isn\u2019t a diver, who doesn\u2019t live to spend half their days underwater, is weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed any help?\u201d Bethany asked Genevieve. When Gen shook her head, Bethany said, \u201cI guess we should all head back, then. Tomorrow is an early day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLecture day,\u201d Alex groaned.</p><p>\u201cLecture day, and let\u2019s pray Marshall shows,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>\u201cMarshall will be there,\u201d Victor said, setting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll show. You know he will.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a warm, brotherly hug. She smiled at him. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Victor, don\u2019t you dare leave without me,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Victor said, rolling his eyes jokingly.</p><p>Genevieve realized that, amazingly, they had spent the entire day without mentioning that there was an unknown killer loose right there in the Keys.</p><p>There was another moment\u2019s silence. \u201cOkay, well, Zach and I are out of here,\u201d Lizzie said firmly. \u201cGenevieve, thanks. This was great.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve grinned. She liked Lizzie and Zach.</p><p>\u201cOut, out, everyone out,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is so cute,\u201d Alex said with a sigh as everyone headed toward the door. \u201cLook at the lineup\u2014Lizzie and Zach, Bethany and Victor, and me and...Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no way I\u2019m sleeping with you, bud,\u201d Jack announced.</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d Genevieve said again, laughing even harder.</p><p>At last, she managed to close the door on them all. Even without turning back to face him, she felt Thor\u2019s silent presence, felt him watching her.</p><p>She turned to stare at him, crossing her arms over her chest, leaning against the closed door. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked defensively.</p><p>He cocked his head at an angle, staring back, speaking softly, \u201cI hate to agree with Victor, but...\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from the door, heading for the kitchen. \u201cI liked him,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>She went to the sink, ready to do the last of the dishes. He followed her, setting his hands on her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cThis guy is...some kind of a...well, let\u2019s get serious. He\u2019s as loony as Audrey. He\u2019ll feed into every fear and fantasy you\u2019ve been breeding.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the sponge and turned around. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think, isn\u2019t it? That I\u2019ve got an imagination that never ends, and that I\u2019m just letting it run wild.\u201d She hesitated, hating what she saw in his eyes. She thought he cared about her and that what was going on between them was a lot more than sleeping with her. But there was a crystal over his eyes. She could just hear him thinking she was crazy as hell, and he wouldn\u2019t be sticking around if she insisted on keeping it up.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to go. It hurt like hell to say the words, but she managed to speak them with tremendous dignity. \u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you where you don\u2019t want to be.\u201d</p><p>His answer came slowly. \u201cI\u2019m exactly where I want to be,\u201d he said. He let out a long breath. \u201cLook, we\u2019re tired and tomorrow is going to be a long day. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a killer out there,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you staying because of that,\u201d she said.</p><p>The warmth she so loved and craved touched his eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m kind of big to throw out,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then he stepped away, as if any more conversation between them could cause him to leave after all. \u201cI\u2019ve got a really early morning. I\u2019m setting the clock for five-thirty. I\u2019ll reset it for six-thirty. Will that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI need to check my e-mail. Mind if I log on in your office?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you want some help down here?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve got it under control. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He left her. She washed up the last few dishes, hesitated, then dried them and put them away. She didn\u2019t like leaving things out, since she might well wind up spending the rest of the week at the resort. Her last few little chores wound up taking longer than she had anticipated, but when she walked up to her bedroom, he still wasn\u2019t there. She was tempted to go into the office and read over his shoulder.</p><p>She hesitated, then chose not to. She washed her face, brushed her teeth, then slipped into the shower for a minute; she felt she was wearing the scent of barbecued fish. Once out, she dried and hesitated. Presumptuous to slip into bed naked? Or ridiculous to slip into bed clad?</p><p>She closed her eyes, biting her lower lip for a minute. She was falling for him so hard. He was everything she could want in a man, her dream counterpart, sharp, intelligent, fun...a diver, a lover of the sea. And it didn\u2019t hurt that he was built like Atlas, with such striking features, and that he had a way of touching her, of making love, that was exciting beyond measure and still, somehow, achingly tender.</p><p>She slipped into bed, turning off the lights, then stared into the darkness. There was light coming in from the hall.</p><p>And he was there, just down that hall. So close to her, and yet so far.</p><p>She was just about to get up and turn the lights back on when Thor came in at last. He moved silently in the darkness, not about to wake her if she slept.</p><p>When he, too, had slipped beneath the covers, she rolled against him, fingers light as they moved down his chest. He took her into his arms.</p><p>He made love as he always did. Erotically, slowly, teasingly...He elicited and teased, and she lost all fear of the darkness in the madness of desire. She was aware of the feel of his lips against her, so intimately, the tremendous power of his frame, the frantic beat and soar of touching and rising, writhing, thrusting, rocketing into the volatile realms of sex and sensuality. She longed for release, longed to stay forever....</p><p>As always, he held her.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>She sensed something different. He was silent, as if lost in his own thoughts. She was afraid then. Afraid she had lost him, that this was his way of saying goodbye.</p><p>She started to inch away, alarmed to realize her heart was so tender, that she was already on the defensive.</p><p>He pulled her back, kissed her forehead. She thought words hovered on his lips, but if they did, they went unsaid.</p><p>The real thing.</p><p>That was how Captain Raul Terry, a good friend in Naval Intelligence, had described Adam Harrison. The real thing.</p><p>There was no real damned thing, Thor thought.</p><p>But the Internet had yielded the name Adam Harrison in a number of articles concerning unusual occurrences. There had been no Web site for Harrison Investigations. There were no advertisements. In fact, it was impossible to find. Except the articles had referred to the government, so he had hunted until he had found Raul online, and the man\u2019s response had shocked him.</p><p>The real thing.</p><p>Impossible. They were living in the real world.</p><p>At his side, Genevieve shifted slightly. He pulled her closer, damning himself in the night. He would not be taken in.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>He found he was afraid. He had never been under the delusion that his size made him tough, but he believed in his reason and intelligence, and it was frightening to feel with a greater sense on a daily basis that she was slipping away.</p><p>That he couldn\u2019t protect her.</p><p>He gritted his teeth in the darkness. There was a killer on the loose. Hard, solid fact. The guy was probably a coward, victimizing the weak. There was no reason to believe Genevieve was in any danger. The man had killed a prostitute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there were the other disappearances.</p><p>Seawater...</p><p>The scent of salt water suddenly seemed to be upon them again.</p> <p>\u201cGenevieve,\u201d he whispered urgently, pulling her close. Her eyes opened. She stared at him in the shadows, smiling, still half asleep. \u201cStay with me,\u201d he murmured urgently. A slight frown crossed her brow. His words made no sense, he knew. She obviously had no plans to.</p><p>But he repeated the words, anyway.</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>He cradled her to him. Made love with a ferocity that bordered on the violent. Held her against him, flesh to flesh.</p><p>He realized he didn\u2019t want to sleep, even as she drowsed in his arms. But in time, despite his desire to remain awake, he slept. Completely entwined with the woman he realized he loved.</p> <p>As if his very flesh could keep away the demons in which he did not believe.</p><p>It came again.</p><p>The smell of the sea.</p><p>Salt, waves, wind.</p><p>And she knew they were coming. Men, marching slowly, grimly. Tattered frock coats in many colors. White unbleached cotton shirts that were in rags.</p><p>Decaying bodies.</p> <p>Rotting flesh.</p><p>The white gleam of bone.</p><p>Eyeless sockets that still seemed to stare...</p><p>Marching. Coming closer, closer...</p><p>Here a blunderbuss, there a saber.</p><p>Shreds of hair from bony heads topped by angled hats. And there the remnant of an earlobe, gold hoop dangling precariously.</p><p>She fought the fear. Fought the conviction that they meant to surround and entrap her. But still they came closer...closer.</p><p>And then, as usual, the woman. The beautiful young woman. Hair floating around her. White gown drifting in the invisible water.</p> <p>Her eyes, so sad. Her lips, forming the word.</p><p>Beware...</p><p>Genevieve fought against her innate panic; the survival instinct that begged her to awaken. She knew she needed to wait, to let them enter her unconscious mind.</p><p>To let them have their say.</p><p>Beware of what? she entreated in silence.</p><p>The woman\u2019s full, rich, beautiful lips, so miraculously preserved against the absolute decay of her companions, began to move.</p><p>But her words dissipated at the ear splitting blare of the alarm.</p><p>Genevieve bolted upright. She gasped, drawing a deep breath, more panicked by the noise than she had been by the dream. She looked around. The room was in shadows.</p><p>Thor was gone.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember hearing the alarm earlier. He must have awoken on his own, then, as he had promised, reset it. She let out a long breath, closed her eyes tightly, steeled herself for the day. She started to rise.</p><p>The bed was soaked. When she stepped onto the rug, it, too, was drenched. She stood there, naked and shaking, fighting the urge to burst into tears.</p><p>She hunkered down, smelling the sea. \u201cWhat?\u201d she cried out. \u201cWhat do you want? What are you trying to tell me? What?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer in the shadows of the early morning.</p><p>Swearing, she headed for the shower.</p><p>There were two men sitting together in the dining room when Thor arrived. Adam was wearing khaki shorts in concession to the heat and a tailored short-sleeved shirt, while the younger man was wearing jeans and a T-shirt that advertised a nineties rock group. Before Thor could greet Adam, the younger man spoke. \u201cHey. I\u2019m Josh. Adam\u2019s son. It\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded somewhat curtly and indicated that the men should sit, then took a chair himself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrison, I\u2019ll start right off by saying I did some investigating myself last night.\u201d</p><p>The younger man\u2019s eyes widened. Adam Harrison smiled. \u201cOf course. I would have expected no less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit my former colleagues have only good things to say about you.\u201d</p><p>The waitress stopped by to pour Thor\u2019s coffee and take their order. The younger man waved a hand, indicating he wasn\u2019t eating. Adam ordered an English muffin and orange juice. Thor opted for eggs and toast. Though it wasn\u2019t good to overeat before a dive, it could be worse not to eat at all.</p><p>Thor sipped his coffee, staring at Adam. \u201cYou\u2019ve come here to ask me to leave,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Thor arched a brow, setting his mug down with precision. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to convince me that our project is being hounded by ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t disturb you that a young woman you obviously care about is suffering?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cI think you insinuating that she really is seeing ghosts is just going to make matters worse,\u201d Thor said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou do know I\u2019ve worked for the government?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d They were engaging in a staring contest, Thor realized. \u201cAnd I know some presidents have sworn that Lincoln haunts the White House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Josh Harrison commented.</p><p>Thor ignored that.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrison, the body of a woman was discovered on the beach. There is a serious danger in the Keys. It\u2019s coming from a real killer. Messing everyone up with talk of ghosts and things that go bump in the night isn\u2019t going to help anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts are not necessarily evil,\u201d Josh said seriously, his brow furrowed. \u201cIf you let them, they can help with the real, the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Thor murmured, stopped from saying more when the food arrived. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see my position,\u201d he went on when the waitress had gone.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Adam Harrison said. \u201cAnd my people and I will try very hard to stay out of your way.\u201d</p><p>Thor chewed his food without tasting it. \u201cDon\u2019t disturb my divers,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>Adam Harrison leaned forward. \u201cLook. You\u2019ve checked me out. You know I\u2019m honest. Give me a chance to be around. And we\u2019re not talking about divers, plural. We both know we\u2019re only talking about one. And she\u2019s more than a diver to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scaring you,\u201d Josh said.</p><p>Thor shot the young man a withering stare.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let what\u2019s happening turn you against a wonderful woman,\u201d Adam said softly.</p><p>Thor wondered if the guilt the words made him feel was clearly written across his face. Yes, all this made him uneasy. It made him want to hold her, protect her. It also made him\u2014him\u2014want to run. To get out before...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cBut you will,\u201d Josh said softly, almost sorrowfully.</p><p>Thor sighed. \u201cI know I can\u2019t convince you to leave today. So be aware I don\u2019t believe in what you\u2019re doing for a second. And tread lightly.\u201d</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to stay out of your way, but I have a job to do, too. And I honestly believe you\u2019ll wind up grateful for my presence.\u201d</p><p>Thor was surprised to discover he had eaten his eggs, apparently, much like a normal, unenraged human being. He rose. \u201cI had hoped we could come to some kind of an agreement,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>Adam Harrison\u2019s slow, easy smile was grating. \u201cNo, you had hoped to intimidate me into leaving. But I do understand. I harbor no resentment. Good day, and good diving to you.\u201d</p><p>Fortified by a long, hot shower, Genevieve dressed for a day of diving, throwing on a suit and a terry cover-up.</p><p>Downstairs, she discovered Thor had left her coffee. She smiled, wondered how she could feel so touched and poignantly sad at the same time.</p><p>Because he would never stay with her. Because she really was going crazy.</p><p>She washed up in the kitchen, angry again. Until they locked her up, she had to work, had to keep going.</p><p>She gathered the few things she wanted to take back to the cottage at the resort and locked up the house.</p><p>As she turned the key in the lock, she froze, a prickling sensation suddenly sweeping up her spine to her nape.</p><p>She looked around. It was still early. Not full light. Shadows everywhere.</p><p>And from the shadows, she felt as if there were eyes. Staring at her.</p><p>She swore aloud. This was really getting ridiculous.</p><p>Determinedly, she started down the path. Bushes and trees seemed to rustle behind her. She found herself hurrying.</p><p>She was alone on the streets.</p><p>She started to walk, still feeling as if she was being watched. She stopped, angry, spun around. There was no one. And not a sound. Not even a bird cheeped.</p><p>She started forward again.</p><p>Then she heard the footsteps. Running footsteps, hurrying over grass and pavement.</p><p>She turned quickly. Yes, there by the bush...a shadow.</p><p>She started to run, afraid to turn back to look.</p><p>And hit Duval Street.</p><p>And there, coming from one of the bed-and-breakfasts, was a deliveryman.</p><p>She nearly crashed into him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he called cheerfully.</p><p>She came to a halt, swallowing, heart pounding. She dared to look back.</p><p>The street was empty.</p><p>12</p><p>G enevieve wound up being just a few minutes late\u2014the last arrival of the morning. The deliveryman had realized she was shaking and worried about her, even getting her a bottle of water. She had quickly regained her composure and bought him a Starbucks latte in thanks.</p><p>Still, the morning should have been good. The skies were clear, the breeze soft. Perfect diving conditions.</p><p>Professor Henry Sheridan was ready with his model and his lecture.</p><p>There was one flaw.</p><p>Marshall wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>His absence had already been discussed when Genevieve arrived. Thor appeared to be so completely irritated\u2014though whether about Marshall or something else, she couldn\u2019t tell\u2014that she immediately determined to keep her distance from him.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t like Marshall,\u201d Victor insisted.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Alex chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about him,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>While Marshall was absent, Jay was present, as were a pair of handsome strangers, the woman a beautiful blonde, the man with striking features that denoted Native American ancestry. Sliding into a seat on the bench at the picnic table next to Bethany, Genevieve demanded in a whisper, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Who are those people with Jay? I don\u2019t understand anything here. Marshall isn\u2019t here\u2014Jay is. With strangers. But I take it someone knows why Marshall isn\u2019t here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUnavoidably detained on the mainland. That\u2019s why Jay is here. Evidently Marshall called the police station last night, too late to call one of us, afraid we might be worried, and asked that someone come out here and explain, and relay his promise to be back as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why Jay is here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Bethany shrugged and nodded. \u201cAnd probably why Thor looks like ye olde thunder god. He\u2019s disgusted. I guess. He\u2019s used to running a tight ship, and so far this dive has been anything but.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we could quiet down, please? I miss Marshall like the rest of you, but he\u2019s a a responsible man, so if he says he\u2019s unavoidably detained, well then, we move on,\u201d Thor snapped.</p><p>They all fell silent.</p><p>\u201cAll right, here we go,\u201d Professor Sheridan announced. He indicated the ship with his pointer as he spoke. \u201cThe Marie Josephine. Launched in October 1803, purchased by the British in 1816. Displacement, one thousand eight hundred pounds, length one hundred and sixty feet, depth 14.3 feet, in the hold. She carried thirty long guns and two twenty-four-pound bow chasers. Those guns are down there somewhere. She had her masts blown to bits, and holes in the hull. She was mortally wounded before the storm ever began. Using descriptions of the damage written in one of the pirate\u2019s journals, we reconstructed her sinking via the computer. I believe she took on water in such a way that she split in half as she began her descent. It\u2019s estimated that the storm that caught them was gusting up to two hundred miles an hour. That would mean huge pieces of her might have been carried more than a mile, so we\u2019re looking for a truly vast field. Your clues will be the guns and...\u201d He pulled out a sheaf of paper from his briefcase. \u201cThese are computer illustrations, showing what pieces of the ship might look like now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like coral,\u201d Alex murmured.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. You might be staring right at a piece of the hull and not even see it. That\u2019s why this morning\u2019s lecture is important. You need to learn how to see what\u2019s hidden from the eye. Take a really good look at these pictures. She\u2019s there, and judging from that coin you found, you\u2019re right on top of her. You just have to find her. Well, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m done for the day.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped back, looking pleased. The divers were studying his pictures, and no one had yawned.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Professor,\u201d Thor said firmly.</p><p>The others looked up. As if on cue, they started to clap. Professor Sheridan flushed a deep red.</p><p>\u201cThank you. And good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Professor,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDo you want to go out on one of the boats today?\u201d</p><p>Sheridan lost his color, turning white. \u201cThank you, but I\u2019ll leave the diving to the experts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Genevieve noticed that Jay was talking to Thor, who still looked grim. He turned to the couple who had come with Jay, barked out a few questions, then shrugged, as if nothing were of the least importance to him anymore. Then he turned suddenly, as if aware Genevieve was standing there. His frown deepened. \u201cYou\u2019re with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, who\u2019s my buddy?\u201d Victor demanded. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. I hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d the blond woman said, smiling as she approached him. \u201cHow do you do? I\u2019m Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Nikki.\u201d Victor suddenly seemed thoroughly pleased with the situation.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guys,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI should have made the introductions earlier. Nikki and Brent Blackhawk work for the government. Now, don\u2019t let me hear any groans. They\u2019re pitching in because we\u2019re short a man and a boat. Jack and Brent will be topside on Thor\u2019s boat, and I\u2019ll be staying up on the police cruiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take my boat,\u201d Jack offered.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Bethany teased.</p><p>\u201cHey, all she needs is paint.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, the cruiser has everything you\u2019ll need,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cThe cruiser is great. We appreciate it,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Alex muttered, shaking his head. \u201cWhat the hell is Marshall thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do the best we can for the day, shall we?\u201d Thor asked. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the bag holding his diving equipment.</p><p>Genevieve realized that Nikki had fallen into step with her. She flashed her a quick smile. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Genevieve. Nice to meet you. So you\u2019re an experienced diver?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s smile matched Genevieve\u2019s. \u201cI dive.\u201d She paused. \u201cActually, I\u2019d prefer diving with you, but...I\u2019m grateful just to have gotten on the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Genevieve said, though in reality she didn\u2019t see anything. \u201cVictor is my usual partner. Don\u2019t let him fool you. He\u2019s a top-notch diver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be on this project if he weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve found herself smiling in turn. That was true.</p><p>They split up when they reached the dock and neared the boats. Genevieve stared at the woman suddenly, frowning. Adam Harrison had mentioned he had people coming, people who were acquainted with the kind of difficulties she\u2019d been having.</p><p>She had feared he meant psychiatrists.</p><p>Now she knew he had meant ghost hunters.</p><p>Ghost hunters with government connections? Maybe that wasn\u2019t so strange.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she called.</p><p>Nikki paused, looking at her with an expectant smile.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re with Adam,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHe told me.\u201d</p><p>Nikki nodded, but her eyes shot to Thor, who was ahead of them.</p><p>Genevieve almost laughed aloud. She felt ridiculously relieved. \u201cNot a word,\u201d she swore.</p><p>On the way out to their coordinates, Thor was entirely uncommunicative with her, but she heard him speaking softly with Brent Blackhawk. The man had a smooth, easy voice, and she could understand why Thor seemed to take to him so easily. He was a man\u2019s man, his authority quiet and unassuming. His smile was quick. He had the appearance of someone who could withstand any storm.</p><p>And yet, when he glanced Genevieve\u2019s way, he was quick to offer a smile, and a wink.</p><p>Looking at Thor, she realized that he knew. Somehow, he knew why Nikki and Brent were there, and, despite that fact, he was behaving decently.</p><p>Why? Was he just waiting to throw them to the sharks?</p><p>The motor sputtered to a stop. Brent Blackhawk came to help her up once she had buckled on her tank. She caught his eyes again. They seemed to offer reassurance. She thanked him, then met up with Thor at the stern. He stared at her for a long moment, then stepped out to the platform and jumped in. She followed suit.</p><p>He was leading. She followed.</p><p>As they moved deeper, she glanced at her gauge. Fifty feet...fifty-five...sixty. There was coral to her right; ten feet to her left, there was a drop-off leading down another ten to twenty feet. Glancing through the water, she could see Victor and Nikki about forty feet away.</p><p>She moved slowly. The water was clear, the current easy. Thor kept looking back at her. She stayed about ten to fifteen feet behind. The sound of her regulator was as soothing as the clear warmth of the water. Neon-colored fish shot by her. A huge grouper hovered by a staghorn coral, making her feel a bit guilty about last night\u2019s meal. He was a friendly fellow. He swam straight toward her. She reached out and she ran her fingers gently over its huge body. The fish outweighed her by about a hundred and fifty pounds, she decided.</p><p>Thor had paused and was looking back at her. He seemed pleased that she had been waylaid by nothing more than a friendly fish.</p><p>Again he moved forward.</p><p>Genevieve stared after her fish as it departed.</p><p>And then, in its place, she saw the woman.</p><p>Genevieve stopped breathing. Her heart hammered in a slow, dull thud.</p><p>She swallowed. Forced herself to breathe. The woman stared at her with her great sad eyes. Blond hair and white cotton trailed in the water. Through her, Genevieve could see the bright bodies of a dozen tropical fish.</p><p>The woman beckoned.</p><p>Genevieve followed.</p><p>Entranced, she had forgotten Thor\u2014until she felt his grip on her ankle, jerking her back. He stared at her furiously through the lens of his mask.</p><p>She stared back and pointed. He shook his head. She pressed her gloved hands together, prayer fashion.</p><p>Then, without waiting for a reply, she shot away from him.</p><p>Ahead of her, the woman waited.</p><p>There was a sand shelf beneath her, and Genevieve began to dig gently. She felt Thor behind her. Felt that he didn\u2019t want to believe.</p><p>Even so, he came beside her and began to help her with her task.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long they worked there, only that they displaced a tremendous amount of sand. The water around them had become silt. But he didn\u2019t leave her. And he didn\u2019t stop working.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think he was even as amazed as she was when she hit something hard.</p><p>A box!</p><p>It was a metal box. Small, no more than a little chest, something that must have held only the dearest mementos, or perhaps the most important papers. It was finely etched; not the sea, the sand nor time itself had managed to entirely erase the delicate tracery of flowers and birds, visible through the sea growth that clung to the box.</p><p>Thor stared at her. He should have been jubilant, but she winced, because the look in his eyes told her that he thought of her as something beautiful, but best kept at a distance.</p><p>He picked up the chest and gave the sign to head back. She nodded and followed. Turning wearily to thank the ghost, Genevieve saw that the apparition had already disappeared.</p><p>A few minutes later, they were topside. Thor handed up the treasure to Jack as he slipped off his fins, and tossed them and his mask onto the deck. On the platform, he reached back to assist Genevieve, but he didn\u2019t meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s done it again,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019ll say!\u201d Jack applauded. \u201cHey, Gen, I never asked, do you gamble? If so, sweetie, you can hit the roulette table with me anytime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brent Blackhawk had come to the stern as well. Thor stared coldly as Blackhawk took the box from Jack. \u201cDo you already know what it contains?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>Blackhawk shrugged. \u201cIt probably belonged to Anne,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there might be something in here that tells us more about her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s something she wants us to know, I take it,\u201d Thor said.</p> <p>Brent shrugged. \u201cWe see what we choose, and read what comes in life in the same manner,\u201d he said with dispassion.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lock on it,\u201d Genevieve commented, peeling off her dive suit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it back to the lab. There\u2019s no reason to destroy something that\u2019s hundreds of years old,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Jack protested. \u201cHow can you stand it? So what if we break the lock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not just treasure seeking. We\u2019re preserving history,\u201d Thor reminded him.</p> <p>Lizzie popped up at the back of the boat, followed by Zach. Staring at them, she knew immediately that there had been another find. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d she cried. She looked at Genevieve and threw her a proud look. \u201cYou\u2019re too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much,\u201d Thor murmured softly.</p><p>Genevieve walked past him. \u201cWe have some sodas in the ice chest, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheer up. Celebrate,\u201d Lizzie said as Zach cleared the dive platform. \u201cWe have someone who\u2019s better than sonar. This is great,\u201d Lizzie said.</p><p>Her enthusiasm brought a smile to Genevieve\u2019s lips. \u201cThank you, Lizzie.\u201d She stared defiantly at Thor as she spoke</p><p>He turned away from her and got on the radio. She heard him call the other boat. Jay\u2019s voice crackled in return, but she knew what he had said from Thor\u2019s reply. \u201cYep, it\u2019s great. Genevieve homed right in and found a box. We\u2019ll bring it in. Let\u2019s call it quits for the day. With any luck, we\u2019ll hear from Marshall soon.\u201d</p> <p>A little while later, back in at the dock, Genevieve was greeted with amazement and cheering from the rest of her teammates\u2014and Nikki Blackhawk.</p><p>As the other woman gave her a hug of congratulations, she whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t look so depressed. Shower, change, then Brent and I will meet you in the parking lot and we\u2019ll go talk with Adam and Audrey. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>It was going to be fine? Yeah, right.</p><p>She forced a smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Nikki caught her by the shoulders, looking at her sternly. \u201cOpen up,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThe ghost is trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ghost is making me look crazy.\u201d</p><p>Nikki smiled and shrugged. \u201cGhosts will do that. I wish there had been a way for me to be the one diving with you, but we have to be careful. It won\u2019t do any good if everyone knows who we are and why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away quickly as Victor came up, lifting Genevieve, spinning her around. \u201cHon, you\u2019ve just got to ditch that Norse god somehow and get back to being my partner.\u201d</p> <p>There was general laughter all around, even Thor taking the comment good-naturedly. He even told Victor it was nice to be called a god. But then he turned away, saying he would take the box to the professor at the lab.</p><p>Genevieve closed her eyes for a minute, feeling dizzy, then glad he hadn\u2019t suggested that she accompany him.</p><p>She sped as quickly as she could manage from the docks, going to her own cottage, showering and changing with shaking hands and a trembling that wouldn\u2019t leave. She dressed quickly, afraid that any minute Thor would be there, staring at her suspiciously, suggesting she come with him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t appear.</p><p>Paradoxically, she felt a sinking fear that he would never appear again. That he might really see her the way she looked at an exotic jellyfish\u2014gorgeous when billowing in the water, deadly when wrapping its tentacles around its prey.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014dwell on it.</p><p>She raced out of her cottage, heading away from the tiki bar and toward the parking lot. No one else was there yet.</p><p>As she waited, a late afternoon cloud covered the sun. Darkness seemed to descend in a great, ominous swirl. Around her, palms whispered as they swayed in the rising breeze.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, fighting the sensation that she was being watched. That a predator was lurking behind the benign palms and sea grapes. But then she heard something.</p><p>A shifting. Something in the trees. As if an animal were stalking her.</p><p>She closed her eyes for an instant, trying to clear her head.</p><p>She nearly screamed aloud when a voice said suddenly, \u201cHey there, gorgeous heroine of the deep.\u201d</p><p>She spun around. It was Jack. She was almost giddy with relief.</p><p>\u201cJack! Damn you, you startled me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? I should buy you a big bottle of champagne.\u201d He cocked his head at an angle. \u201cOr a beer?\u201d he said hopefully. \u201cKind of surprised me that our mighty leader brought us in today. I have a feeling we\u2019ll be working long, hard hours from here on out. So what do you say? Can I buy you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Jack. I\u2019m meeting Audrey,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how about a little later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. I\u2019ll be hanging around in the usual places. Crook your little finger, and I\u2019ll come running.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThanks, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He waved to her and headed across the lot to the street beyond. As he disappeared into the crowd on the sidewalk, Brent and Nikki came forward. \u201cHey,\u201d Nikki said cheerfully. She looped an arm through Genevieve\u2019s. \u201cCheer up. You\u2019re going to be rich and famous. Oops, wait a minute. Government funding. You\u2019ll be kind of rich and famous.\u201d</p><p>I just want to be sane, she thought. And despite herself, that inner voice went on. Sane\u2014and loved.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re seeing what you are,\u201d Brent said quietly.</p><p>Genevieve flashed him a rueful smile. \u201cAlways?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo. Sometimes, people are...well, just seeing what they want to see. That\u2019s why we\u2019re not easily accessible. Adam tries to make sure there\u2019s really something going on before he calls in his people.\u201d</p><p>Again, she felt there was something very solid\u2014sane in the midst of insanity\u2014about Brent Blackhawk.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cSo...do you see ghosts?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She stared at Nikki. \u201cAnd you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen them most of my life. Shadows, a hint of something.\u201d It was her turn to hesitate ruefully. \u201cThey\u2019ve only started talking to me recently.\u201d</p><p>The late afternoon sun was shining down again, though the heat was beginning to ease. Duval Street was crowded with tourists, and competing music escaped from different bars on different corners. This seemed like the most ridiculous conversation in the world, coming in the daylight, among so many of the laughing, partying, vacationing...living.</p><p>They reached the alley to Audrey\u2019s and turned. Adam Harrison was already there and opened the door for them. Apparently he knew his people well, because he greeted them warmly. Once again, Genevieve felt stronger in his presence.</p><p>\u201cHey, you!\u201d Audrey called happily. When she entered her friend\u2019s parlor, Genevieve saw computer printouts, magazines and books everywhere.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking up everything we can find,\u201d Adam explained. \u201cAbout the attack on the Marie Josephine, the storm and the sinking. We\u2019ve had a few minutes to speak, and Audrey has filled me in on what she knows. So I thought we should sit around and discuss what facts we have, add in what\u2019s happening, and see what answers we get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve found a box today, someone\u2019s private little treasure chest. It was locked,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Adam said. \u201cThe ghost led you to it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d Nikki said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Genevieve muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe might have picked you because she knows you\u2019re willing to help her,\u201d Brent said. He paused, looking at her. \u201cSome people have a sixth sense, if you will, though most people have a habit of denying it. Who thinks that someone who sees ghosts is sane? You\u2019ve probably always had the ability to sense something beyond the usual, but it\u2019s only just now that someone has tried to make contact. This ghost sees you as some kind of kindred spirit. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good thing? She\u2019s nearly given me a heart attack several times,\u201d Genevieve protested.</p><p>\u201cYes, but now you\u2019re accustomed to her,\u201d Brent said. He always spoke so evenly, in such a matter-of-fact tone. The ridiculous seemed to make sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Nikki said, taking a seat and frowning as she picked up a batch of the papers, \u201cis why Genevieve is seeing pirates. Supposedly the pirates survived and it was the ship\u2019s crew that went down. What we know about what happened comes from the pirates\u2019 letters and journals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that is interesting,\u201d Adam agreed.</p><p>\u201cThen again,\u201d Nikki said, \u201chow do we know the ghost is from the Marie Josephine? The body of a murdered woman was found on the beach,\u201d Nikki reminded them. She hesitated. \u201cThat means there might have been other victims. Other ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her?\u201d Adam asked Nikki.</p><p>Nikki shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t with Genevieve when we went down. We were lucky Thor Thompson even let us out on the dive. He knows we\u2019re your people, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded gravely. \u201cWell, she keeps showing Genevieve the pirate treasure. So let\u2019s assume she is from the Marie Josephine.\u201d</p><p>There was silence for a minute.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, you\u2019re going to think this is a bit schlocky, but we\u2019re going to try a seance,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cA seance?\u201d Genevieve said weakly. The idea terrified her. \u201cUm...it\u2019s still light out,\u201d she murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a matter of light and dark, though ghosts do tend to prefer darkness and shadow,\u201d Brent said levelly. \u201cBut they also walk the streets in broad daylight. They frequently have some kind of a mission.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve winced. Good God, this entire conversation was ridiculous!</p><p>Brent Blackhawk must have sensed the emotions churning within her. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them all my life. I told you that.\u201d He cocked his head at an angle and grinned. \u201cLuckily, I\u2019m half Native American. People think we\u2019re prone to the mystical.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cSometimes ghosts can\u2019t be helped. They walk the streets because they\u2019re punishing themselves for some evil deed they think they committed, and they have to come to terms with themselves before they can move on. But sometimes there\u2019s something happening in the world of the living that they\u2019re determined to straighten out.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve nodded, looking from him to Nikki. \u201cThey help solve murders,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cBut...a seance?\u201d Genevieve said uneasily.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not like what you\u2019ve seen in movies,\u201d Adam told her.</p><p>\u201cThe table is best,\u201d Audrey said. She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s where I pretend to contact the dead all the time.\u201d</p><p>They formed a circle around the table. Genevieve found herself between Brent and Nikki, and she was certain they\u2019d planned it that way. Just joining hands with the two, she nearly jumped. There seemed to be a flow of electricity going through her.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no gimmicks under the table, right, Audrey?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Audrey looked at her, hurt.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d Audrey admitted with dignity.</p><p>\u201cSo...what do we do?\u201d Genevieve asked softly.</p><p>\u201cJust hold hands. Imagine your vision,\u201d Brent said.</p> <p>She held tight, all the while thinking it was pointless and that despite the fact she had been the one having the visions\u2014this was really ridiculous, a bunch of mature adults sitting around a table holding hands.</p><p>\u201cClear your mind,\u201d Brent said, his tone deep, yet oddly quiet. \u201cClose your eyes for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Outside, night was coming at last. It was a time that folks waited for: sunset on Key West. The sky would be a burst of beautiful colors. In fact, there were few places in the world where sunset was quite so beautiful. Rays of last light playing atop the water, then diving into it, changing sea and sky at lightning speeds. Shadows falling...</p><p>She opened her eyes.</p><p>And there was the woman.</p><p>Jay drove Thor to the lab, which gave him a chance to quiz the police officer.</p><p>\u201cYou might have mentioned your new pals were with Adam Harrison,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Jay shot him a glance. \u201cThe captain said they were sent by the feds. Harrison wasn\u2019t mentioned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. And you didn\u2019t suspect anything?\u201d</p><p>Jay shrugged uneasily. \u201cYes. But what difference does it make? You knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I knew.\u201d He was quiet for a moment. \u201cI asked Harrison to stay away, but I guess it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy seems decent enough,\u201d Jay commented.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, the son is a smart-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe son?\u201d Jay said, sounding surprised.</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s son is here, too. Josh Harrison. I met him this morning when I joined his father for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrison had a son once, all right. And the kid\u2019s name was Josh. I don\u2019t know who or what you saw, but it wasn\u2019t his son. Josh died in a car accident over ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>T he woman stared at Genevieve. For once her hair and clothing didn\u2019t seem to flow in the water, as they did in the sea and in her dreams.</p><p>Her eyes were a deep, almost violet, shade of blue. Her hair was the color of sunkissed wheat. Genevieve saw her more clearly than ever before.</p><p>The woman looked around the room.</p><p>Genevieve tried hard to keep her breathing even, tried not to blink. She didn\u2019t want to lose the vision.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone in seeing the woman, she quickly realized. Brent Blackhawk spoke softly to her. \u201cHello. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>But the ghost didn\u2019t acknowledge him. She turned to stare again at Genevieve and gave her the usual warning.</p><p>\u201cBeware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeware of what? Please, help me.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s arms stretched out, covered in the silky white cloth of her gown. \u201cHelp me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHelp me. Beware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help you,\u201d Genevieve assured her. \u201cI want to help you. Tell me how.\u201d</p><p>The ghost was suddenly distressed. Afraid.</p><p>Was it possible for a ghost to be afraid? she wondered.</p><p>Possible or not, the woman looked around frantically with her huge blue eyes and then began to fade from sight.</p><p>\u201cWait! Please!\u201d Genevieve begged.</p><p>But the woman was gone. And in her wake she left only the whisper of her warning.</p><p>\u201cBeware.\u201d</p><p>Then there was nothing. Nothing, Genevieve realized, or the absence of something. There had been a subtle change in all of them. She looked at Brent, at Nikki, and realized she had nearly broken their hands, she had been gripping them so tightly. At the end of the table, Audrey was staring at her in shock.</p><p>Genevieve swallowed. \u201cBrent, you saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething...I knew she was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing,\u201d Audrey admitted dolefully. \u201cSome mystic I am.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just a good living, remember?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSome of us have great eyesight, and some are born myopic. Some make great acrobats, while others are mathematicians,\u201d Adam said kindly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d Audrey said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI wonder why she disappeared the way she did,\u201d Brent mused.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Beware\u2019 and \u2018help me.\u2019 Not enough to give us much information,\u201d Genevieve said. She was stunned to realize she wasn\u2019t feeling terrified. She felt...relieved. There was a ghost.</p><p>Audrey brightened. \u201cI know. The poor woman was murdered. She never had a decent burial. We need to have a service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Audrey,\u201d Genevieve said, \u201cwe don\u2019t even know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she hangs around with pirates a lot\u2014were they here, too, by the way?\u201d Audrey asked.</p><p>Genevieve shook her head.</p><p>\u201cStill, you\u2019re looking for the Marie Josephine. She was attacked by pirates before the storm that doomed her. The ghost has to be Anne, the captain\u2019s daughter. We should just have a nice funeral service at sea and let her rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure....\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>Nikki Blackhawk shrugged. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it could,\u201d Adam commented.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Audrey asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want her to disappear?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course! If she\u2019s a ghost...wandering, suffering past pain and trauma, of course I want her to be at peace,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does keep leading you to treasure,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Genevieve was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint the others, but...well, I think it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re on the right track. If there were a way to let her go, I\u2019d gladly do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get hold of Father Bellamy,\u201d Audrey offered. \u201cWe can hold a funeral service for Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get Thor\u2019s permission,\u201d Genevieve said uneasily. \u201cAnd if the papers got wind of it, I\u2019m not sure it would be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true at all. It could be spun into a nice human-interest story,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>They were all startled by a knock at the door. Audrey rose quickly, collecting the papers from her coffee table. \u201cWould you mind getting it?\u201d she asked of no one in particular.</p><p>Genevieve walked to the door. She was startled, when she opened it, to discover an entire crowd. Bethany, Alex, Victor, Jack, Jay and Thor were all there.</p><p>Thor was wearing his shades, making his expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, hoping she sounded surprised, but not nervous.</p><p>\u201cAre we allowed in?\u201d Victor asked.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Audrey announced, coming to the door. \u201cHi, Victor.\u201d She gave him a hug. \u201cJack...Jay. And you\u2019re Alex, right?\u201d She gave him a hug, too, but she didn\u2019t approach Thor. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need any introductions?\u201d Adam asked politely as they all entered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thor said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t all mean to barge in like this. Jay and I were hoping to find Adam, and we just ran into the others along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Adam said. \u201cWell, here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have bad information at the police station, and we\u2019re here so you can correct it,\u201d Thor said. \u201cI told Jay I met your son this morning. He didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Adam Harrison stared at Thor, mouth open in shock. After a moment he regained his composure enough to speak. \u201cMy son died ten years ago,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>Genevieve thought every single little muscle in Thor\u2019s body must have tightened. His face was like stone.</p><p>\u201cThen who was with us this morning?\u201d</p><p>Adam frowned, looking truly perplexed. \u201cMr. Thompson, no one was with us this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Thor said impatiently. \u201cYou had an English muffin, I ordered eggs, your son...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t order,\u201d Thor said</p><p>Adam looked down for a moment. \u201cOthers have seen him, too. Sometimes I get the sense of him, but...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you two talking about?\u201d Victor asked, but the two men paid him no attention.</p><p>Thor stood stiffly for a minute, then turned to Audrey. \u201cThanks for opening the door to an entire horde,\u201d he said pleasantly, then turned and left.</p><p>They all stared after him. \u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d Jack demanded.</p> <p>Genevieve looked at Adam Harrison, who looked back at her and smiled. \u201cMaybe a good thing,\u201d he said briefly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all frigging nuts,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWell, hell, this is Key West,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cAnybody hungry?\u201d Victor asked, looking at his watch.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jay agreed. But as he spoke, his phone rang. He excused himself, stepping back outside to take the call.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Victor said. \u201cAnyone else hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Bethany murmured.</p><p>\u201cNikki? Brent? Audrey? Uncle Adam?\u201d There was a twist on the last. Genevieve decided that everyone had somehow intuited at this point that Adam Harrison wasn\u2019t really Audrey\u2019s uncle.</p><p>\u201cDinner sounds like a fine suggestion at the moment,\u201d Adam said. \u201cAudrey, what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Victor slipped an arm around her shoulders as they left.</p><p>Bethany gazed at Genevieve and rolled her eyes. Genevieve just shrugged.</p> <p>Thor returned to the hotel. He doubted the crew that had been on duty that morning would still be working, but he could at least find out how Adam Harrison was registered.</p><p>The clerk at the desk was a young woman. He was prepared, since she wasn\u2019t supposed to give out certain information. He didn\u2019t have the credentials to demand answers to his questions, but he had a number of different legal IDs from various associations that would make it appear he had plenty of authority.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to use any of them. The young woman apparently recognized him and was quick to help him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Thompson, but no. Adam Harrison is registered alone. To the best of my knowledge, no one else came in with him. He\u2019d be more than welcome to have two or three adults in the room, so I can\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d pretend not to have company,\u201d she said very seriously.</p><p>He thanked her and walked back into the night.</p><p>The usual activity was going on, people wandering aimlessly, stopping to look, to shop, to buy a little trinket here or there from the sidewalk vendors.</p><p>He paused for a moment, just watching. Adam Harrison didn\u2019t need to have a roommate for them to have been joined by a young man at the breakfast table. Maybe it had just been some kid hired to put on an act. He found himself irritated to realize, looking back, that there had really been no interaction between the man claiming to be Josh Harrison and anyone other than himself. The kid hadn\u2019t ordered food. He\u2019d never spoken to the waitress or to his supposed father.</p><p>It had been a sham, of course. But a convincing one. He should probably be visiting the local high school drama club. Tomorrow morning, he would find the waitress. She would know that Adam hadn\u2019t been alone.</p><p>He felt his anger rising, and it disturbed him to know he also felt unease rising beneath it. His anger, he decided, was righteous. The dive was going to hell. First off, Marshall had been sold to him as the ultimate professional. But a professional didn\u2019t disappear in the middle of a project, no matter what. A professional didn\u2019t even call in sick. The only way to get out of this kind of work was to call in dead.</p> <p>He gritted his teeth, watching as a tall blond woman emerged from the hotel. She was attractive, but there seemed to be an edge to her. As he watched, she caught his eye. She smiled and sauntered over to him. \u201cHello. Lovely night. Have a light?\u201d she asked, producing a cigarette from her small clutch bag.</p><p>Her skirt was short, her shoes high. Her blouse revealed a great deal of cleavage.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, dropping the cigarette back into her bag, her eyes remaining focused on his. \u201cAre you looking for company?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>He shook his head. Working girl. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd watch out, miss. A woman was found dead, you know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cStill gotta make a living. Well, I\u2019m sorry, too, handsome. Have a nice night.\u201d</p><p>She headed off down the street.</p><p>Thor turned, walking down toward the water, determined to get back to Genevieve. He hadn\u2019t liked leaving her earlier, but at the same time, he\u2019d needed some distance. Not from her, exactly, but from the craziness, the whole thing with ghosts and dreams and....</p><p>His own sense of impotence, his inability to protect her. It had to stop. But by leaving that afternoon, he\u2019d left her free to spend the day with Audrey and those government-sanctioned ghost hunters.</p><p>As he walked at a brisk pace, he nearly collided with Jay Gonzalez.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jay said, startled.</p><p>\u201cHello. You didn\u2019t go to dinner with everyone?\u201d Thor asked. He still didn\u2019t know if Jay Gonzalez was on his suspect list or not. The man\u2019s wife had died under mysterious circumstances. And he\u2019d been around for the previous disappearances.</p><p>\u201cDuty called,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Thor said sharply.</p><p>Jay shook his head. \u201cNo more bodies. No real ones, anyway. A fellow working garbage detail freaked out. Went to empty his truck and thought he had a bunch of body parts. In a way, he did. Someone hacked up a mannequin and disposed of it all along Duval Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mannequin? Did he find the head?\u201d</p><p>Jay looked at him curiously. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it blond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there was a blond wig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got anything on it?\u201d Thor demanded. \u201cThere\u2019s some kind of prankster out there.\u201d</p><p>Jay frowned, shaking his head. \u201cThor, it\u2019s not a crime to dispose of a mannequin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve claimed someone left a mannequin on her doorstep the morning the body was found. She thought the body was a mannequin, in fact, and then it turned out there was a real victim. Doesn\u2019t that strike you as something that should be investigated?\u201d</p><p>Jay groaned. \u201cCome on, Thor, there\u2019s a big difference between chopping up a mannequin and killing a flesh-and-blood person.\u201d</p><p>Thor just stared challengingly at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll put in a few hours tomorrow and try to find out which shopkeeper was missing a dummy, and who they sold it to or why it wasn\u2019t reported as stolen, if that\u2019s the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Anything new on the victim or the killer?\u201d</p><p>Jay cast him a weary look. \u201cA hooker found dead, any trace evidence pretty much gone. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to solve the crime,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cA ghost tell you that?\u201d Jay asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cActually, I was going on the premise that you\u2019re a good police officer. You don\u2019t want to go with that, fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Jay let out a sigh. \u201cSorry. Listen, I won\u2019t be on the dive tomorrow. We\u2019re running short of manpower. They\u2019ll still give you the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything more from Marshall? Has he called anyone at the station again.\u201d</p><p>Jay shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you getting a little worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jay admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted this dive,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cI know. Look, I\u2019ve got word out in Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows where he\u2019s staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could pull the phone records, find out where he called from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d need to do some paperwork for that,\u201d Jay said. \u201cBut I will. And like I said, I arranged for you to have a police dive boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help adding, \u201cWe have the mighty Brent and Nikki, right?\u201d</p><p>Jay shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHell, this whole thing is about as professional as a party boat,\u201d Thor grated.</p><p>Jay grinned. \u201cSome people have connections. You know that\u2014you use them yourself.\u201d</p><p>True enough. \u201cPoint taken,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Jay waved a hand in farewell. \u201cThey were going out somewhere for dinner. Check along Duval. You\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>Thor did find them. By then Lizzie and Zach had found them, as well. \u201cI think it\u2019s an absolutely charming idea,\u201d Lizzie was saying as he approached the table. There was an empty seat. He realized they had planned on him joining them at some point.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a charming idea?\u201d he asked, sitting down.</p><p>He was located between Nikki Blackhawk and Audrey. Audrey was the one who answered him. \u201cA funeral service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA funeral service is charming?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA service for poor Anne,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cTo lay her ghost to rest.\u201d</p><p>His face must have looked like a thundercloud, and he couldn\u2019t help staring at Genevieve, seated farther down the table between Victor and Jack.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing otherworldly about it,\u201d Audrey said. \u201cFather Bellamy has been asked many times to do services for people lost long ago.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI happen to know he\u2019s available tomorrow morning. And I have a friend at the paper.\u201d She noted the wariness in his look and spoke quickly. \u201cA friend who writes good things. We want your permission, of course. But she thinks it\u2019s a lovely story, a beautiful young woman caught between pirates, the love of her life and a strict father, then dying young. It\u2019s got all the elements. You\u2019re not superstitious, of course, but a lot of sea people are. So what do you think?\u201d</p><p>He looked up and down the table. Jack shrugged. Victor grinned. Genevieve was just staring at him.</p><p>\u201cReally, Thor,\u201d Lizzie chimed in. \u201cCome on, the work is only going to get harder. Let\u2019s go for it.\u201d</p><p>Thor stared across the table at Adam Harrison. The man was looking at him impassively.</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrison, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Adam lifted his hands. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t see any harm in it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d Audrey asked anxiously.</p><p>Thor stared across the table at Genevieve. She hadn\u2019t said a word, but she was looking at him hopefully. He thought about the way she had homed right in on their finds. Directions from a ghost?</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe in ghosts.</p> <p>But apparently she did. And maybe she didn\u2019t want to be shown anything by the undead anymore. He thought it was all in her mind, in her dreams, but there had been that seawater....</p><p>And Adam Harrison might well be playing him for an idiot. Staring at the man, he couldn\u2019t quite get a handle on him. He just didn\u2019t seem like the kind of guy who went around perpetuating elaborate hoaxes.</p><p>Hell, someone had played a trick on Genevieve\u2014a real trick, with a real mannequin\u2014but Harrison hadn\u2019t been here at the time. As far as he knew...</p><p>Maybe a funeral service could put a stop to all of it.</p><p>There was also a real murderer out there, a vicious killer who had allowed a woman to drown with no hope.</p> <p>And why the hell did he feel that crime had something to do with the dive?</p><p>He stared at Audrey. \u201cWe\u2019d better not get any bad press out of it. And, hey,\u201d he said, addressing the others, \u201cI made the call to come in early today, but from now on we\u2019ll be making a minimum of three dives a day. We know we\u2019re in the right area, but we need to find the largest debris fields before the heavy equipment comes in. With or without Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the bloodly hell is Marshall, do you think?\u201d Alex asked, sounding annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but at least he\u2019s all right. According to Jay,\u201d Genevieve said. There was a note of worry in her voice, despite her words.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like him,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ve known Marshall since he was a kid. He didn\u2019t get where he is by acting like this.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not get going on another anxiety fest, huh?\u201d Alex suggested.</p> <p>\u201cFood\u2019s here!\u201d Victor announced, pointing as two waiters approached them bearing large trays laden with plates, and the conversation moved on.</p><p>\u201cYour place or mine?\u201d Thor murmured softly, slipping an arm around Genevieve\u2019s shoulders as they left the restaurant.</p><p>Despite his words and his touch, Genevieve felt a strange reserve in him. She didn\u2019t know what he was really thinking, and it hurt, because she wanted to be close to him even more.</p><p>\u201cSure you want to keep sleeping with me?\u201d she asked softly in return.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure you want to keep sleeping with me,\u201d he assured her. \u201cBy the way, did you know Jay was called out because a garbageman found a dismembered mannequin in the garbage?\u201d</p><p>Her heart thudded. \u201cI knew he\u2019d been called away suddenly, but not why. Um, a mannequin. Really?\u201d Why was she lying to him? Protecting Victor?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious\u2014why was Jay called in on it? I think it\u2019s legal to throw away a mannequin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegal, yes,\u201d Thor agreed with a shrug. \u201cBut I guess the fact it was in pieces scared the garbageman. And in light of what\u2019s going on...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cis Jay investigating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find out if one was stolen or sold to anyone.\u201d He stared at her hard. \u201cThe joke was played on you. Don\u2019t you want to know who did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. Though to tell you the truth, I\u2019m not sure I really care. I mean, everyone sobered up and got mature the minute the real body was found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And how many people know the body you saw was not the same body found on the beach? Let\u2019s see\u2014me. And Audrey and Bethany. Who else? Nikki and Brent, I bet. And how many people did Bethany tell?\u201d he queried sharply.</p><p>\u201cObviously it has nothing to do with Brent and Nikki. They weren\u2019t here then. And Bethany can keep a secret. Anyway, what difference does it make? It might have been a mean joke, but I\u2019m sure the mannequin was a joke. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know more than you\u2019re telling me,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She groaned softly. \u201cI just want...I just want to let it go,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, just looked straight ahead. \u201cLet\u2019s see what your funeral service will do tomorrow,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that little discussion you had going with Adam?\u201d Genevieve asked him.</p><p>\u201cA little discussion,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>\u201cYou know more than you\u2019re telling me,\u201d she echoed softly.</p><p>He grimaced humorously, still looking straight ahead. \u201cThey\u2019re staying at the resort, Nikki and Brent. I saw them before I met them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey...they can be helpful,\u201d she said lamely.</p><p>\u201cAt least she can dive,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>They had reached the parking area, and everyone started waving goodbye to one another. Adam headed off down Duval Street for his hotel. Victor, Genevieve noticed, had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your roommate?\u201d she asked Bethany.</p><p>\u201cHe saw a blonde,\u201d Bethany replied.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s bringing anyone back,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cAlthough maybe I shouldn\u2019t be there tonight.\u201d</p><p>Alex laughed. \u201cHe would have asked you politely to get the hell out if he\u2019d any such plans,\u201d he assured Bethany. \u201cBut you can come to my place, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, but thanks, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Bethany,\u201d Alex said, waving and walking off. \u201cGood night all.\u201d</p><p>Thor\u2019s arm was still around Genevieve\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cottage, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Despite the way he held her, the intimate way he spoke, she still had the terrible sensation she was losing him.</p><p>Inside, with the door locked, she touched his face gently with her palm.</p><p>\u201cLook, honestly, you don\u2019t have to pretend or feel that you started something and you have to keep it going, that...\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close to him. \u201cDo we have to talk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>His arms wound around her. Ghosts faded away in the vital reality of flesh and blood and the volatile power of his touch.</p><p>Losers. The guys here were a bunch of losers.</p><p>Ana Maria Strakowsky decided she shouldn\u2019t have come so far south. There had been talk about there being a lot of money in the Keys. So far, she\u2019d seen retirees, beer bellies and men in Speedos who should never, never, be so exposed. She didn\u2019t particularly care about that, but they were cheap. And slow. They didn\u2019t seem to comprehend that she wasn\u2019t looking for entertainment or the charm of their company, just a business deal. Then there were the kids. Lordy. Kids, everywhere. And family men. Guys who might have eyes that strayed from their widening wives, but not guys with the gumption to do anything.</p><p>And the really sharp, good-looking one...</p><p>He\u2019d probably never paid in his life. But that had been hours ago. She smiled. His warning had been nice. She didn\u2019t remember the last time anyone had said anything to her that had held the least note of concern. She had come to the States a long time ago. And though she had been barely sixteen, she had known exactly why her \u201csponsor\u201d had paid for her to get in. Back then, she\u2019d had dreams of using her body as no more than a stepping-stone. In the village where she\u2019d grown up, she could have either married a farmer or gone to the city, where the men were ugly and cheap, anyway.</p><p>Strange, the American-dream thing. It hadn\u2019t gone quite the way she had expected. So here she was, getting older now....</p><p>Cosmetic surgery could do a lot for that. She had to admit, she looked damned good for her age, but she was no kid anymore. More young girls entered the business on a daily basis. Young. That was the key word. And she\u2019d never quite quit when she should have. When she could have used her earnings for an education, pressed for more....</p><p>So here she was. Seeking new ground. And it sucked.</p><p>At least, as the night wore on, the kids began to disappear from the streets. As she passed from one bar to the next, she nearly collided with a man.</p><p>He apologized quickly, straightening her\u2014his hands lingering on her shoulders as his eyes surveyed her face.</p><p>No hesitation there. He smiled immediately.</p><p>\u201cWell...hello.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back. Took note of the way he was dressed. He might not be Trump, but he clearly made a decent income.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, uh, free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly free. But negotiable,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I like to negotiate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a room,\u201d she said huskily, and told him where.</p><p>He did like to negotiate, as it turned out. He talked a good line.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even notice they weren\u2019t heading in the direction of her room.</p><p>Genevieve wondered vaguely if she groaned out loud. She was sure, in the distant nether realms of the subconscious, that her sleeping body inched ever closer to the man with whom she was entangled.</p><p>She knew they were coming.</p><p>Even when they were at a distance, she could sense them as if they were marching through a fog and were dimly visible. As if she saw them through a storm at sea.</p><p>Closer...closer...they marched, then thronged around her.</p><p>She was beginning to recognize them. The jawless one in the tattered poet\u2019s shirt with the sword. The fellow in the big, plumed, deteriorating hat. The one with the knee breeches and rough leather boots.</p><p>And the woman. The beautiful blond woman.</p><p>She was weary. Not afraid...just weary.</p><p>Why? she pleaded silently.</p><p>She knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cBeware.\u201d</p><p>Beware of what? Please, please, please...</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>What truth?</p><p>Just as the ghost opened her mouth to speak, a look of extreme pain seized her. She seemed to double over in agony, even as she faded from view, her decomposing pirate escort disappearing with her into a field of fog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Genevieve really had to hand it to Thor. He was stubborn. He pretended not to notice the seawater that permeated his cottage, the floor, the bedding....</p><p>He awoke early. Very early. It was still dark.</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to do before we take off. Look out for the project for me\u2014make sure Audrey\u2019s priest and reporter are on the up-and-up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she murmured, only half awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m locking the door. Keep it locked until you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...of course,\u201d she mumbled sleepily.</p><p>He left. She stayed in bed, half awake, half asleep. To her astonishment, she found herself talking to the ghost.</p><p>Please, come back. I want to understand. I want to help.</p> <p>I need to know the truth.</p><p>Thor took the exact same seat he\u2019d had the morning before. The same waitress walked over to him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cEggs, whole-wheat toast...I forget. Hash browns or grits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d he congratulated her. \u201cI\u2019ll take hash browns, please. And do you really remember yesterday?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-two. No senility yet. Though my brother insists I\u2019m definitely warped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a brother for you,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you remember the people I was with yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were with an older man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a younger man, too. Sixteen...seventeen...maybe even eighteen or twenty,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head, smiling warily, as if he were trying to play some kind of trick on her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t see anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t eat. He just sat with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling my leg, right?\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded as she stared at his face.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly saw no one else, other than the older guy?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. He winced inwardly.</p><p>This was what it felt to be looked at like a crazy person.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I only saw the one man. Um, you wanted coffee, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>A little while later, as he was leaving, he paused at the door. Turning back, he saw Adam Harrison coming into the dining room.</p><p>The kid was with him, trailing behind him. He was tall and thin. Lanky, but good-looking, serious, a little grim, even.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice day, Mr. Thompson,\u201d the host called out.</p><p>Thor nodded, then walked over to him.</p><p>\u201cYou know Mr. Harrison?\u201d he asked the man.</p><p>\u201cSure. Nice guy,\u201d the man said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cIs the younger man as nice?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat younger man?\u201d</p><p>Thor let out a sigh of irritation.</p><p>\u201cThat young man,\u201d he said, pointing.</p><p>Again, that look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Thompson. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Josh Harrison stared straight at him and waved.</p><p>Thor spun on his heel and departed.</p><p>He reached the street. It was still barely light.</p><p>He looked up at the sun, trying to peek out and start the day.</p><p>\u201cI am fucking crazy,\u201d he muttered aloud, and started back for the resort and the docks, his strides long and angry.</p><p>14</p><p>T here were no messages to Genevieve from ghosts or anyone else as she lay awake after Thor departed. She had actually tried to go back to sleep, actually wanted some kind of message. She was no longer going to be so afraid. And she wasn\u2019t talking to anyone except Adam, Brent or Nikki\u2014especially not Thor\u2014about anything she saw, felt or sensed. She wasn\u2019t going to fight the fear; she was going to find...</p><p>The truth.</p><p>Whatever that meant.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t fall asleep. So she rose, showered, drank coffee and watched the morning come.</p><p>It seemed to do so slowly, especially since she couldn\u2019t sleep. Drinking her second cup of coffee, she was struck with guilt. She was going to have to call Jay. There was no reason for him to waste his valuable time looking for a culprit in the \u201cmannequin murder.\u201d She was surprised to realize she really didn\u2019t care who had been trying to play a trick on her. It didn\u2019t matter anymore. Other matters were far too grave.</p><p>At last she grew tired of sitting alone in Thor\u2019s cottage.</p><p>She opened the door and walked out.</p><p>The sun wasn\u2019t really up yet. It was one of those overcast mornings. She hoped the storm clouds would quickly blow away, as they so often did. The heavy rains and thunderstorms didn\u2019t usually come until the afternoon. Then it could rain like blue blazes for twenty minutes before coming to a dead stop. The streets could all but flood, and then the sun would come out again with a burning glory.</p><p>There was no one at the tiki bar. Still, she didn\u2019t feel like being alone in the little cottage. She frowned, wondering why Thor had disappeared so early again that morning. She might be keeping secrets, but so was he. They shouldn\u2019t talk. They should just have sex. If only...</p><p>There had to be an explanation for everything that was happening. She had to believe it would all make sense in the end.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think too far ahead. They would have a prayer service that morning. At the very least, it would be a nice gesture.</p><p>As she sat there, the breeze picked up beneath the dark sky. It teased at her nape, snaked down the length of her spine. She shivered. It was a distinctly unpleasant, even eerie, sensation.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. She looked around for ghosts.</p><p>But she knew there were no spiritual beings trying to make contact.</p><p>Just as she knew she was being watched again.</p><p>She had the uneasy feeling she was being assessed, that her steps had been followed, her daily pattern mapped out, that someone was watching her with evil intent.</p><p>She wanted to laugh aloud at herself. Okay, so they were late bringing the coffee out to the tiki bar that morning, while there were heavy clouds up above. And the breeze had an odd, almost icy feel to it. Leaves were rustling, fronds making strange whispering sounds, but that didn\u2019t mean someone was watching her.</p><p>Did it?</p><p>She leapt to her feet, ridiculously afraid, sorry she had come out.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>She swung around. Thor was there, wearing his sunglasses despite the overcast sky.</p><p>With his words, her unease evaporated. The clouds seemed to break. Light filled in the shadows.</p><p>She shook her head, smiling. \u201cI heard you coming up at the last minute. You startled me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She was glad he smiled, that he pulled her close and brushed her lips briefly with a kiss. But then he pulled back. \u201cThe troops are coming. Look.\u201d He pointed toward the parking lot. \u201cThe Exorcist himself has arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not an exorcist,\u201d Genevieve murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She left Thor and went to greet Father Bellamy, feeling guilty because she hadn\u2019t been to church in a while.</p><p>Next Sunday, she promised herself.</p><p>Surprisingly, Thor found that he did like Father Bellamy. The priest wore his collar with a lightweight suit, and he had a bag of dive gear with him, as well. His first question, after introducing himself to Thor, was whether he would allow him to enter the water as long as he swore to stay out of the way. It turned out he was an Episcopal priest, and he was dating the reporter, Helen Martin, who had also brought a dive bag. They were both in their mid-forties, down-to-earth, and both impressed him immediately.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice that you\u2019re doing this\u2014such a sign of respect to someone who died long ago,\u201d Helen told him. She grinned. \u201cPeople in these parts can get excited about treasure, but they also want the past to be honored. I think this will make a wonderful piece. Thank you so much for allowing us to be a little part of this.\u201d</p><p>There was still no sign of Marshall, a fact they all seemed to silently accept as a bad sign. What the hell had happened to the man?</p><p>Thor assigned Jack to the police boat with Alex, Bethany, Victor, Lizzie and Zach. He brought both Blackhawks, Audrey, Father Bellamy and Helen, and Genevieve with him.</p><p>Out on the reefs, the boats tied on together, and Father Bellamy began his service.</p><p>Thor had to admit it was both appropriate and well handled. The priest addressed no ghosts; he merely spoke to God about those who had been lost to sea, adding a special addendum for Anne, a young woman who died due to the perils of the sea. Flowers and wreaths were thrown into the water.</p><p>Helen scribbled away on a notepad the whole time.</p><p>There was nothing occult about the proceedings. Nothing to make him uncomfortable in the least.</p><p>When it was over, Audrey looked at him with a questioning smile. He smiled back. She seemed to be trying very hard to do what was right.</p><p>\u201cFather Bellamy, too, looked at Thor anxiously. \u201cMay we hit the water now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Thor told him. He looked at Genevieve, who nodded. She knew they would remain dive buddies.</p><p>Bethany was staying topside with Nikki that day. On the other boat, Jack would be watching out for the divers, ready to assist anyone in trouble, keeping an ear out for the radio.</p><p>It was going to be a long day, Thor decided. This wasn\u2019t a professional and historically important dive anymore, he decided wearily.</p><p>He was running a party boat.</p><p>But there were times when it seemed appropriate to go with the flow. This kind of work could take months, even years. Best to get all the foolishness out of the way now.</p><p>Damn Marshall. Where the hell was he?</p><p>He watched as Brent Blackhawk calmly buckled on his tank. He didn\u2019t know why, but he had the feeling that Brent was the one with the deepest belief.</p><p>So? Wasn\u2019t he seeing a kid who\u2019d been dead for over a decade.</p><p>No. There had to be a logical explanation. Maybe it was all a tremendously elaborate hoax. But to what end?</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked Gen.</p><p>She was.</p><p>They went out on three dives. Sadly\u2014or thankfully\u2014all three were uneventful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow, the day, which had started out with the threat of rain, remained bright and cloudless after the first hours of the morning. They were able to work without once being disturbed by thunder and lightning.</p><p>It was well past six when they brought the boats back in at last. Despite the lack of any discoveries, everyone seemed happy. He realized that, despite where they lived, Father Bellamy and Helen didn\u2019t often get out diving, so they were especially pleased about everything they had seen that day.</p><p>As they neared the dock, he heard Genevieve speaking softly to Brent Blackhawk. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s at rest?\u201d she asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It was an exhausted group that came off the boats. Helen hurried off to write her story; she wanted it ready to run in the Sunday paper. Father Bellamy had promised to meet with an elderly couple who were renewing their wedding vows, so he left quickly, as well.</p><p>Adam Harrison was waiting for them at the docks. He eyed Thor as they appeared, hauling their equipment from the boats to be hosed down.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. You didn\u2019t join us,\u201d Thor replied.</p> <p>Adam shrugged. \u201cI had some research I wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you discover anything?\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cMaybe. I need to do some thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. In other words, you don\u2019t intend to share your information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t share it until I have it,\u201d Adam said serenely. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the tiki bar,\u201d he said. The man walked away, straight as a ramrod. He was wearing a short-sleeved cotton shirt with palm trees on it and khakis. Thor had to grin, watching Adam. He might try to blend in, but no matter what, the man looked like the retired fed he was.</p><p>Genevieve seemed cheerful, Thor realized. She kissed him on the cheek, her eyes bright. He was glad to see her happy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m done. I\u2019m going to your place to shower. See you at the tiki bar,\u201d she said.</p><p>Strange. And sad. They were on a treasure hunt, but the days she had discovered treasure, she had been depressed. Today, no treasure, but she was radiant. Saddest of all, he understood.</p><p>She walked away, turning once and offering him a brilliant smile. He smiled back, but wondered why he was feeling as if their boat had sunk. He wanted this chapter in the hunt over.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t believe it was.</p><p>By the time he had finished rinsing down the boat, half an hour had slipped away.</p><p>He put in a call to Sheridan. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what we\u2019ve got!\u201d Sheridan said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cDiamonds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sheridan returned impatiently over the phone. \u201cSomething better. Letters. We\u2019re moving carefully. There was some erosion, even to the silver. But they were wrapped in a pig\u2019s bladder, and we\u2019re working to read them without causing any damage. This is a remarkable find.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd today?\u201d Sheridan asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, you\u2019ll be back out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>By the time he reached his cottage, Genevieve was gone. He showered and changed for the night.</p><p>It was already getting dark by the time he neared the tiki bar. Jack was playing chess with Alex, while Lizzie and Zach looked on.</p><p>Victor had stepped away and was on the phone.</p><p>Genevieve was sitting beside Bethany, with Adam on her one side, Audrey next to him. Nikki and Brent were at the table, as well.</p><p>\u201cThor,\u201d Audrey said, and he thought it was almost as if she were announcing his arrival.</p><p>Silence fell, and the others looked up.</p><p>\u201cWe were about to order burgers,\u201d Brent said. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded, then sat down next to Brent. \u201cSo where do you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of reefs around there,\u201d Thor murmured dryly.</p><p>Brent smiled slowly, using his thumb to rub the condensation off his bottle of beer. \u201cNot everyone lives where they dive, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. What kind of Indian comes from New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>He knew Genevieve was frowning. He was certain the question was rude.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking my background, it\u2019s Dakota. Irish mom,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Nikki was staring at him icily. \u201cI\u2019m straight from New Orleans,\u201d she told him. \u201cI was a Du Monde. Would you like to see our passports?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure every document you possess is in perfect order,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Brent started to rise; Adam lifted a hand.</p><p>Genevieve wasn\u2019t about to be stopped by Adam. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten what an asshole Mr. Thompson could be. Excuse me, will you? I have a phone call to make.\u201d</p><p>She walked away. He watched her with concern, fingers tensing on the arms of his chair. He should have been more careful. But he just couldn\u2019t shake the idea that he was being played.</p><p>It was either that or he\u2019d had breakfast with a ghost.</p><p>He stared at the remaining group. Bethany and Audrey were both staring at him, wide-eyed. Adam was wearing a tired but accepting smile.</p><p>\u201cAttack me, if you want, Mr. Thompson. Not my employees,\u201d Adam said, then looked around at the group. \u201cMy associates and I work in the field of the unusual, the unexplainable\u2014the otherworldly, if you will.\u201d He turned his attention fully upon Brent then. \u201cYou see ghosts, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brent said flatly.</p><p>\u201cAnd when did that start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked, zeroing in on Nikki.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always sensed them. Since a particular incident, I\u2019ve been able to communicate with them, as well.\u201d</p><p>Thor shook his head apologetically. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude. I\u2019m looking for facts, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for a black-and-white world. Something you can control,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThat\u2019s not reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s reality is the body of a woman that was discovered on the beach,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Audrey frowned. \u201cBut, Thor, I don\u2019t see how her death can relate to the dive. Or to any of us. She was a prostitute. Prostitutes never know the men they pick up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo any of us really know anyone?\u201d Nikki asked softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d Brent asked. \u201cI was going to go up to the bar, order our burgers, just put them on the tab. I can get you a beer while I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>Thor had to admit he liked the guy. He had acted like a jerk, but it would be worse if he was taken for a ride by these people.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll have a beer, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He kept an eye on Genevieve, who wasn\u2019t far away; she was on her cell, speaking intently.</p><p>To whom?</p><p>He realized that Nikki Blackhawk was staring at him, smiling.</p><p>He arched a brow to her.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cYou really are a good guy.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a hand, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re watching out all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be great\u2014once you learn what to watch out for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all learn as we go.\u201d</p><p>Bethany drew his attention before he had a chance to ask Nikki what she mant. \u201cThor, did you hear anything more about the little box? Was it silver? Was it filled with gold or emeralds and rubies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetters,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLetters?\u201d Bethany said with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cLetters?\u201d Audrey was intrigued.</p><p>\u201cSheridan is pleased,\u201d he said. As he spoke, Brent returned and handed him a cold beer. He nodded his thanks. \u201cI was just saying that the box Genevieve dug out a day ago contains letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Brent was intrigued. \u201cWere they badly damaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were packaged in a pig\u2019s bladder,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Audrey murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey, pig\u2019s bladders and other organs were the first condoms, too,\u201d Nikki offered cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that is gross,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cImagine, though,\u201d Audrey offered, \u201cif you were a working girl back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank God for my century,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>Genevieve was back. She was behind him, but Thor knew she was there without looking.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of centuries,\u201d Audrey said thoughtfully, \u201cdo you think ghosts from one century might hang around with ghosts from another? I mean, suppose you died in the 1700s and you met a ghost who died in the 1800s. Or last week, for that matter. What would you have to talk about? Are there ghosts who are stronger than other ghosts? Are there rules? Is there a way to learn how to be a ghost?\u201d</p><p>Brent lowered his head, smiling. \u201cA lot of it goes to simple belief,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s peoples hold some form of belief. Most religions find counterparts in one another, no matter how far apart they seem to be. Some worship one god, some worship several. But most believe human beings are something more than flesh and blood. That there is an energy within us, our spirit. It makes me me, and you you, more so than any compilation of DNA. The general belief is that flesh and blood dies\u2014earth to earth, ashes to ashes\u2014but the spirit, or soul, moves on. It\u2019s generally accepted that ghosts are spirits who, for whatever reason, have not moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you explain it,\u201d Genevieve said, \u201cthings make sense.\u201d</p><p>Thor was startled to feel a stab of jealousy. Well, sorry, I\u2019m not a ghost hunter, he thought, and realized he was almost bitter.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t accustomed to feeling like this. And he didn\u2019t like it. He gritted his teeth, fully aware that the power to change was his, and his alone.</p><p>But what change was he supposed to make?</p><p>\u201cDo I think they communicate?\u201d Brent asked Audrey. \u201cSometimes. Is there a book of rules? Probably not. Is there more in the world than science has yet explained? Definitely. Will we ever have all the answers? Probably not. Faith is as important to life as bald facts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d Audrey said suddenly, excitedly, looking at Genevieve. \u201cI think your ghosts might be from different times. I mean, if you had a woman who was murdered by pirates, I think she\u2019d be too afraid of them to get anywhere near them. Maybe she\u2019s from a different time, and she\u2019s protecting you from the pirates. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve groaned. \u201cI think we need to stop talking about ghosts,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cHamburgers!\u201d Victor announced suddenly.</p> <p>The chess game had ended, and the players and their team cheerleaders came over to join them.</p><p>Thor rose. \u201cLet\u2019s push the tables together,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>He looked at Genevieve, wondering who she had called. She glanced over and saw the obvious question in his eyes. She flushed. \u201cI called Marshall\u2019s cell and left a message. I\u2019m really getting worried,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried him a half-dozen times, too,\u201d Victor told her.</p><p>\u201cLooks like he doesn\u2019t want to be found,\u201d Alex said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time the police looked into it,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cThey are looking into it,\u201d Genevieve told them, reaching for the ketchup. She paused, realizing everyone at the table was looking at her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Jay, too,\u201d she admitted, her cheeks flushing. \u201cHe\u2019s called some friends up in Miami. The call from Marshall came from a hotel on the beach, but Marshall was never registered there. I told him I\u2019d fill out a missing persons report tomorrow. If Marshall didn\u2019t want us hounding him, he should have had the sense to make sure someone knew what was up!\u201d</p><p>Thor wasn\u2019t sure how he knew it, but he was certain Genevieve had called Jay about something more than Marshall\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll find Marshall, don\u2019t you worry,\u201d Jack assured Genevieve. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you worry,\u201d he told Thor. \u201cWe\u2019ll find plenty more at the bottom of the sea.\u201d</p><p>After that, the conversation stayed well away from ghosts. And it seemed that everyone was eager to call it a night. The diving had been exhausting, and they had another full day ahead of them.</p> <p>Genevieve had kept a slight distance between them. He didn\u2019t press her, just headed to his cottage on his own, hoping she wasn\u2019t aware that he was watching her through the window, determined to keep an eye on her.</p><p>Still, perhaps absurdly, afraid for her.</p><p>As he watched the group at the tiki bar break up, he saw Victor offer to walk Audrey home. Adam waved to the group. Brent and Nikki went off, hand in hand, to their own cottage. Zach and Lizzie walked down toward the beach, he noted. Well, if nothing else, the two of them really seemed to be enjoying their time in the Keys.</p><p>At last Genevieve started toward the cottages.</p><p>Toward her own? Or his? At first he wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>But then, halfway along the path, he saw her stop. She went very still, chin raised. The breeze caught the long tendrils of her hair, lifting it. Except for that slight movement, she might have been a statue, an elegant, perfectly formed, alabaster statue, she seemed so frozen in place.</p><p>Then she spun around, looking wildly around her.</p><p>She stared first at the trees surrounding the parking lot and cottages. Then she turned and stared back toward the water.</p> <p>Once again, she stood still. Then she started walking.</p><p>Toward his cottage. Then she wasn\u2019t walking, she was running.</p><p>Heedless of being caught spying on her, Thor threw open his door and stepped out onto the porch. She all but flew into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked anxiously, smoothing back her hair, looking past her into the night.</p><p>She shook her head, staring up at him. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know. Something ridiculous, I suppose. I just felt that I was being watched. By someone other than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Furious. I can\u2019t believe how rude you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. So why did you call Jay?\u201d</p><p>She gasped, backing away. \u201cI\u2014I called him about Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I called to tell him I helped Victor get rid of the stinking mannequin.\u201d</p><p>He was floored.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t do it to begin with, but that the mannequin wound up in his cottage. And I believe him. I\u2019ve known Victor all my life. He said they\u2019d ditched the idea. But...\u201d She paused. \u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you to get some sense. So you told all this to Jay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! I didn\u2019t want him wasting his time chasing down such a ridiculous case. And you\u2019re twisting this around. Just because you don\u2019t like Brent Blackhawk, you don\u2019t have to be so rude to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the guy just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why be such a jerk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t beat up a ghost?\u201d she demanded angrily.</p><p>He started to respond just as angrily, then paused. Hell, was that it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d Was that the truth? Or was he afraid of the truth.</p><p>Because she was dead right. How the hell did you fight a ghost?</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t believe in me,\u201d she said evenly, and started to turn. He was afraid she intended to leave. He caught her by the shoulders, pulling her around.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t walk out on me,\u201d he pleaded softly.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t walking out on you,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cAll right, sorry. You were just so angry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So are you. But I wasn\u2019t walking out. You may not believe in me, but I\u2019m sadly under the impression that this is what people call a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell! Of course it\u2019s a relationship,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. It was a relationship, all right. Anger just led to kisses that were heated, almost violent. She was just as wild, just as angry. Beautiful. Living alabaster. She touched him like burning lava, liquid and fluid, erotic and exotic; she excited and teased him, and finally sated him. When he held her in the end, in bed, he still felt the frustration, the anger, that he didn\u2019t know how to fight what was upsetting her.</p><p>Then she curled against him, flesh to flesh, her cheek resting on his chest. He stroked her hair and lay awake.</p><p>Audrey was barely inside the house with her shoes off when the doorbell rang. She let out a sigh, kicked the shoes aside and headed back.</p><p>She threw open the door and saw a familiar face. \u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He pushed his way in.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she repeated, in irritated protest this time. \u201cWhat the heck...?\u201d</p><p>The door closed.</p><p>Her eyes widened. She was still entirely puzzled when he made his move.</p><p>By then, it was far too late to scream.</p><p>When at last he slept, Thor dreamed. In his dream, he saw a battle. Fierce and furious. A man with dark hair, in expensive nineteenth-century apparel, against another, more tattered, fiercer....</p><p>Shouts rang between the men, along with the clash of steel. Shouts, words, but he couldn\u2019t comprehend them.</p><p>He woke. As he woke, it seemed he could still hear the ringing of steel on steel</p><p>He realized Genevieve was wide-awake. She was lying in his arms, shaking, staring at nothing in the shadows of the night.</p><p>The sound faded and was gone, as if it had never been.</p><p>She realized he was awake and turned to him.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t at rest,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOh, God, she isn\u2019t at rest.\u201d</p><p>He just held her.</p><p>But he knew that when he stood, the floor would be flooded.</p><p>With seawater.</p><p>15</p><p>W hatever was happening, it wasn\u2019t good, Genevieve could tell that the moment she stepped outside.</p><p>Jay Gonzalez was at the tiki bar, deep in conversation with Victor, who was angry and gesturing emphatically.</p><p>Hoping Thor wasn\u2019t directly behind her, Genevieve hurried over, certain Jay was reaming Victor out about the mannequin business, and equally certain Victor was going to be furious with her.</p><p>He was. He shot her a cold glare as she neared them. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you, Jay, I don\u2019t know how the mannequin wound up in my room. I didn\u2019t take it. I didn\u2019t play the joke on Gen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do admit to dumping the pieces?\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Victor muttered to Genevieve.</p><p>\u201cJay,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI called you to stop a problem, not create one. I helped throw it away. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>Jay had his sunglasses on, so she couldn\u2019t read his eyes, but she knew he was irritated. \u201cGenevieve, the problem is not that the mannequin was thrown away. It\u2019s not illegal to discard a mannequin. It isn\u2019t even illegal to pull it to pieces first. It is, however, illegal to steal a mannequin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it,\u201d Victor protested.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cWhen was it reported stolen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I made my initial inquiries, the staff at Key Klothing didn\u2019t know they were missing a mannequin. The owner called the station late last night. He\u2019d figured it out, but he told me he thought some kids had spirited the thing out. He wasn\u2019t going to report it, but since we\u2019d discovered the pieces, he wanted to let us know where it had come from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKey Klothing,\u201d Genevieve murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s right by Audrey\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re suggesting Audrey stole the mannequin?\u201d Jay asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Genevieve protested.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jay,\u201d Victor said. \u201cHow long have you known me? If I wanted a mannequin, I wouldn\u2019t have stolen it. I know half the shopkeepers on Duval Street. I would have bought one. Are you really going to arrest me over this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Not if you make good to the owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t steal it!\u201d</p><p>Thor would be joining them any minute, she knew, and she had to stop this before he got involved. She pushed her way between the two men. \u201cLook, Victor, I\u2019ll pay for the damned thing. Let\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t steal it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe you. But let\u2019s just make this end here and now. I\u2019m begging you,\u201d Genevieve pleaded.</p><p>Victor stared at her, still indignant. \u201cGenevieve, it might be important to find out who did steal it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I only know that I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just make it go away, please? We have bigger problems. Please, Victor?\u201d she said.</p> <p>He let out a sigh. From the corner of her eye she saw that Thor was coming. She had to get this settled\u2014now.</p><p>Victor shook his head. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will,\u201d Genevieve insisted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll argue about it later,\u201d she said. \u201cJay? Good enough?\u201d</p><p>He nodded his assent just as Thor strode over to join them.</p> <p>\u201cAny word from Marshall?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But Gen\u2019s going to fill out a missing persons report today. Then we can do more than just have me calling old friends in Miami-Dade and asking for off-the-record help,\u201d Jay said.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d Genevieve insisted.</p><p>\u201cOr right. Maybe he\u2019s found the woman of his dreams,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>Genevieve shook her head. \u201cThis project meant too much to Marshall for him to just walk off it. He\u2019s a responsible person. He\u2019s built up a great reputation. I can\u2019t believe he would slough it off all over some woman.\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded. He, too, was wearing dark glasses, so she couldn\u2019t read his thoughts.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t commented on the water, or the smell of the sea that permeated his cottage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some coffee,\u201d Thor said.</p> <p>Genevieve\u2019s eyes followed him, and she saw that Adam was walking toward the tiki bar from the parking lot, and he had met up with the Blackhawks on the way. He looked upset.</p><p>Frowning, Genevieve hurried toward them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably nothing,\u201d he said, forcibly easing the tension from his features as he tried to smile.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Audrey just overslept\u2014either that, or she simply forgot her appointment with an old man,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>Genevieve felt her heart catapult. \u201cYou were supposed to meet Audrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor breakfast, yes,\u201d he admitted unhappily.</p><p>\u201cAnd you went by her house? And she isn\u2019t answering?\u201d Genevieve demanded.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t panic,\u201d Nikki cautioned carefully. \u201cSomething important might have cropped up.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve spun around and rushed back to Jay. \u201cAudrey\u2019s missing,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d Victor said impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I walked her home myself last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to meet Adam Harrison for breakfast. She didn\u2019t show. And when he went to her house, she didn\u2019t answer the door. Jay, you have to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just break into her house,\u201d Jay protested.</p><p>Genevieve whipped out her cell phone, staring at them all angrily. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Haven\u2019t you noticed that people around here keep disappearing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall hasn\u2019t disappeared. He called the station. Adults have the right to take off if they choose,\u201d Jay told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of police crap,\u201d she snapped at him.</p><p>\u201cI walked Audrey home, and she was fine,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>Genevieve had already punched in Audrey\u2019s number. It was ringing and ringing. The answering machine came on.</p><p>\u201cCall me as soon as you get this,\u201d Genevieve said. Then she snapped the phone closed with dread in her heart.</p><p>Something was really wrong. Why couldn\u2019t they see it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a key?\u201d Jay asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do? If you force your way in, I\u2019ll have to arrest you for breaking and entering,\u201d Jay said wearily.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jay, I\u2019m worried sick,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>He looked down. \u201cI\u2019m going to wind up fired after all these years,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou go out on your dive. I\u2019ll go to Audrey\u2019s place, okay? And if she\u2019s angry because I jimmied my way in, I\u2019ll never speak to you again. I won\u2019t be able to, because I\u2019ll be looking for a job slinging hash in a distant city!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey would never get you in trouble. She\u2019d know we were just worried,\u201d Genevieve promised.</p><p>Jay shook his head and started off. \u201cShe missed a breakfast meeting,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAs if we all haven\u2019t slept through breakfast at one time or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. No lectures today. Let\u2019s get on the boats,\u201d Thor called out from the bar, where he was drinking his coffee. He didn\u2019t know anything about Audrey yet, Genevieve thought. Should she tell him, then insist they stay on shore for the day?</p><p>No, she decided. Jay would check on Audrey. And there would be some simple explanation. She hadn\u2019t been missing and out of action forever, not like Marshall.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to put a hold on the dive. She could do her work; Jay could do his. He was a cop, and he was also a friend. He wouldn\u2019t let her down.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d Thor called.</p><p>When they reached the dock with their equipment, Thor started giving out their diving instructions for the day.</p><p>\u201cJack, stay topside on the police loaner. Bethany and Alex, as usual. Zach and Lizzie, you\u2019re with them. Victor...topside on my boat for the first dive, but we\u2019ll switch around later. Brent and Nikki, keep being a couple. Genevieve, you\u2019re with me. Everybody got it?\u201d</p><p>There were nods all around, and they headed to the appropriate boats.</p><p>Genevieve noted that Adam wasn\u2019t there to watch them leave. She hoped he had gone with Jay and that, between the two of them, they would find Audrey. She fingered her cell phone, in the pocket of her cover-up. She couldn\u2019t take it down with her, but she would tell Victor to answer it if it rang.</p><p>Thor was at the helm. Genevieve chose a seat beside Nikki, who gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cIt will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the ghost is at rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t,\u201d Genevieve said flatly.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still came to me in dreams,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cAnd she soaked the room while she was at it.\u201d</p><p>Nikki smiled gravely. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s here to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Brent joined them in time to overhear the last part of the conversation, sitting next to Genevieve rather than his wife. \u201cThere is a reason,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Victor sat next to Nikki. \u201cDo ghosts steal mannequins and move things around?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Genevieve wasn\u2019t sure if the question was genuine, or if he was just mocking them. Looking at him, she thought he was sincere.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been the one to play the joke on her, she thought. But still, the niggling suspicion was there. Especially now that they had been caught getting rid of the mannequin.</p><p>Brent hesitated, looking at his wife before answering. \u201cThey have been known to gain the ability to move objects, but as to stealing a mannequin with a purpose...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you know?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she asked, to take the sting out of her words.</p><p>\u201cMost of the time, spirits remain or return with a purpose. And usually that purpose is to aid the living in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to anchor and dive flag,\u201d Thor shouted, breaking off the conversation.</p><p>Genevieve quickly found her position and buckled on her tank.</p><p>On the platform, she glanced at Thor as she positioned her mask. He looked back at her, but she could read nothing in his eyes.</p><p>She realized she was dreading the dive.</p><p>She had forgotten her enthusiasm for the project, her love for what she did. All she was doing now was waiting.</p><p>Something else was going to happen. She was sure of it.</p><p>She stepped out into the water, felt her body fall, felt the rush of the sea around her. Bubbles surrounded her as she released air from her vest and began to sink.</p><p>Thor had moved them out into slightly deeper water today, she realized. They were following a path that led them past the reefs, then dropped down to deeper shelves.</p><p>She listened to the sound of her breathing. Slow and easy. She was proud of how long she could go on a single tank of air.</p><p>Look around, watch, feel, remember everything you love about this, she told herself.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t working. The sense of dread that had first assailed her on the platform was growing. She found herself breathing far too quickly, too heavily. Her heart was hammering.</p><p>Small brilliant fish swept by her, unconcerned with anything but their next meal. The sun-kissed yellow of a tang, the stripes of a clown fish. To her side were dozens of pastel anemones, drifting in the easy flow of the current.</p><p>She was gaining control. The world beneath the waves was as it should be. A nosy barracuda was tracking them at a distance. Silver in the water, he stuck out his jaw, looking like a belligerent child. A giant grouper swam toward them, took a look, turned away.</p><p>Staghorn coral rose, followed by a field of brain coral. More anemones. More tiny, colorful, darting fish. A starfish began a slow trek across the sand. A tiny ray was disturbed by their passage and dug deeper into the sand.</p><p>She knew, her heart thundering, seconds before the body came into view that she was going to see it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first she denied it.</p><p>It was the ghost. Surely it was no more than the ghost, and she was there to lead Genevieve to the treasure, some new find....</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t the ghost.</p> <p>It was real.</p><p>Like the body on the beach, this one was real.</p><p>Caught just the other side of a huge field of staghorn coral, this was not a ghost.</p><p>Not a mannequin.</p><p>Suddenly she felt a deepening certainty that it was Audrey.</p> <p>Her heart seemed to scream. Her stomach pitched. Thor was just feet away from her, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to reach out to him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>She had to know.</p><p>She gave a thrust with her flippers and approached the body, desperate to know the worst.</p><p>Adam Harrison caught up with Jay before he left the parking lot.</p><p>Jay was annoyed. What the hell was with the guy? There was no reason for him to be so concerned so quickly.</p> <p>Victor had walked Audrey home, undoubtedly made sure she was inside with her door locked before he left.</p><p>Then again, Audrey still wasn\u2019t opening her door. He\u2019d tried her home phone, her cell and her business number, and there had been no response, only her cheerful normal voice on the first two, and her \u201cbusiness\u201d voice on the last, explaining that it was very important to leave a message, then make an appointment to learn what the future held.</p><p>\u201cAre you going in?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>He\u2019d promised Nikki he would. He had the tools in his car to pick a lock like Audrey\u2019s. He could do it easily enough.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he swore out loud.</p><p>Adam Harrison just stared at him.</p><p>Jay threw his arms up in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re the great medium. Do I need to go in? Is she there? Is it life or death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m more of a coordinator than a medium,\u201d Adam said, totally unruffled. Of course he was unruffled, Jay thought. This wasn\u2019t his home, his life. These weren\u2019t his friends. Key West and all that happened here would fade from his memory once he stepped on a plane and moved on to the next...whatever.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going in?\u201d Adam repeated.</p><p>Jay swore again, his language worse. He paced in a circle, then faced Adam.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what the hell. I can live on the fish I catch, I guess,\u201d he muttered. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>He left Adam at Audrey\u2019s door and went to his car for his tools. He wondered just how discreetly he was going to be able to pick the lock. Genevieve had asked him to do this, he reminded himself. But frankly, Genevieve didn\u2019t have the right. He didn\u2019t have the right to do what he was about to do.</p><p>Probable cause...</p><p>Yeah, probable cause. Please, God, let someone else\u2014like the brass\u2014believe that was true.</p><p>He felt like a thief himself, as he carefully worked the lock.</p><p>\u201cIf you see anyone coming...\u201d he started to tell Adam. Then he just swore again. \u201cNever mind. What can they do? Call the cops? I am a cop.\u201d</p><p>The door opened. They both just stood there for a full minute.</p><p>\u201cAudrey?\u201d Jay called.</p><p>They stepped in. They both stood quietly at the entry for a moment. \u201cAudrey?\u201d Jay called again. \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything,\u201d he told Adam.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Adam said with his customary smooth Southern dignity.</p><p>Jay walked through the small house. There was nothing to indicate there had been a struggle anywhere.</p><p>Until he picked the lock, he thought ruefully, there hadn\u2019t been any damage to the door whatsoever.</p><p>So, either Audrey had simply gone out...</p><p>Or she had let someone in. Who had then...</p><p>The bed was neatly made. Either Audrey had never gone to sleep the night before or she\u2019d gotten up and made her bed this morning before heading out to...to not have breakfast with Adam Harrison. Nope, she must not have gone to sleep at all.</p><p>With a sinking heart, Jay walked back to Adam. He shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t sleep here. But as you can see, there\u2019s no sign of a disturbance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>Jay looked down with a sigh. \u201cLots of paperwork. I can\u2019t get started on Audrey till twenty-four hours have passed. At least Marshall has been gone long enough to be considered a missing person.\u201d</p><p>He walked past Adam, speaking aloud. \u201cI need someone to agree to a crime-scene unit in here quickly. Shit! She opened her door to anyone with an appointment. Then again, she must have opened her door to someone really late, and now she\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be combing the city,\u201d Adam said quietly as they left.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do that,\u201d Jay muttered. \u201cYou just do that.\u201d</p><p>It slowly began to register on Genevieve, just as she swam around to see the corpse\u2019s face, that the woman was blond. Audrey was a brunette, with a touch of red in her hair, much like herself.</p><p>Not Audrey. Not Audrey!</p><p>For a moment the rush of relief eased the agony of what she was about to witness. Then the sad truth and blood-chilling horror set in again.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen the woman before. She was wearing the bottom half of a bathing suit. Her breasts were bared.</p><p>Her eyes were open.</p><p>She stared at Genevieve in lifeless horror.</p><p>Genevieve blinked, freezing in the subtropic water. The woman was floating by the coral because she was attached to it. A rope around her ankles had tangled itself in the field of staghorn. Her ankles were chafed and bloody. She had fought desperately to free herself. She hadn\u2019t been killed where she was, Genevieve registered dully. The rope had broken off from whatever weight had originally held the woman beneath the water, but too late for her to escape.</p><p>The woman\u2019s bloody ankles were now of tremendous interest to dozens of fish, all swimming frantically about, taking tiny bites.</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s stomach heaved.</p><p>She nearly screamed, despite her regulator and the fact she was more than sixty feet beneath the surface, when hands fell on her shoulders. Startled, she turned.</p><p>Thor.</p><p>His expression was grave. He sternly indicated that she shouldn\u2019t touch the body, then signaled that she should surface. Her mind in a fog, she nodded. She realized he had summoned Brent Blackhawk, who had been exploring the seabed fifty feet to their left.</p><p>Brent swept effortlessly and silently over to them. Nikki in his wake.</p><p>Genevieve saw the horror with which the other woman viewed the floating corpse. But she immediately joined Genevieve and tugged her topside. Genevieve realized they had to radio in the information as quickly as possible, not that the police could possibly help the woman now, but she deserved justice.</p><p>As she swam upward alongside Nikki, Genevieve felt a new rush of ice in her veins again, wrapping around her heart.</p><p>Two bodies. Two blondes killed in the same way.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t just a killer loose in the Keys.</p><p>There was a serial killer at large.</p><p>For Thor, the worst part of it was the fact that he recognized the woman immediately.</p><p>She was the hooker who had propositioned him outside the hotel.</p><p>So recently alive, and now so newly dead.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why he felt it was important to remain by the body until the police divers came, but he did. It seemed to take an eon. Brent Blackhawk stayed with them, neither of them touching anything, just staring into her sightless eyes until the police came.</p><p>A pall seemed to sit over the boat when they surfaced. They\u2019d come here seeking treasure and history; they were finding horror and tragedy.</p><p>Jay Gonzalez was topside in a police craft that had tied on to Thor\u2019s boat. After doffing his scuba gear, Thor moved over to the other boat.</p><p>Jay looked grim. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not Audrey, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Jay breathed.</p><p>\u201cNo sign of her yet?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cNone. Another body, no sign of Audrey or Marshall. What the hell is going on here?\u201d he asked, sounding frustrated.</p><p>And scared.</p><p>\u201cI recognized her,\u201d Thor told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who the hell is she?\u201d Jay demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who she is, but I know what she did for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother hooker?\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded. \u201cShe was outside Adam\u2019s hotel the other day. I don\u2019t know if she was staying there or not, but she was looking for johns on the street.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI actually warned her to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take her up on anything?\u201d</p><p>Thor felt a bolt of anger surge through him. Then he realized Jay was only doing his job.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but she spoke to you, you knew she was a hooker, and you warned her to be careful. What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she had to make a living. And that was all. She headed down Duval Street, toward the water and the bars, looking for customers. I\u2019m assuming she found someone.\u201d</p><p>Jay nodded. \u201cYeah. She found someone, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the killer is getting sloppy. That would be something, at least,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Jay winced. \u201cIn other words, this may have been going on for years, but he\u2019s getting careless and drowning the girls too close to shore?\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded.</p><p>Jay nodded grimly in return. \u201cOr maybe he\u2019s only just now made his way down to the Keys. Or he\u2019s just gotten started and he\u2019s an idiot incapable of securing a body to the ocean floor. Who knows? All I know is that now I\u2019ve got two corpses, two missing persons, a bunch of ghost hunters\u2014and no fucking answers.\u201d He looked across the water and shook his head. \u201cWho the hell would have suspected, when Gen first thought she saw a body, that it would turn into this?\u201d he asked morosely. He looked at Thor again. \u201cYou can take your crews in now. Tell them\u2014all of them\u2014that I may have some questions.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, the police divers surfaced, one man calling out to him.</p><p>They had brought the body up on a light canvas stretcher designed to preserve whatever evidence might have remained on the corpse.</p><p>He heard a startled exclamation and looked around.</p><p>The borrowed police boat was anchored about twenty feet away. Lizzie, Zach, Bethany, Alex and Jack were standing at the stern, watching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t know who had cried out.</p><p>He looked over at his own boat.</p><p>Brent, Nikki, Victor and Genevieve were also staring at the sad remains of a life gone tragically bad.</p> <p>\u201cTake your crews in,\u201d Jay repeated curtly.</p><p>\u201cRight. And you\u2019ll let me know the minute you find anything out?\u201d</p><p>Jay stared at him. He could imagine what the man was thinking. Yeah, right. I\u2019m a cop, you\u2019re not. Count on it.</p><p>Jay lowered his head. Maybe he\u2019d regretted his own thoughts, unspoken but clear.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, I\u2019ll get back to you. You\u2019ll just pull some of your government strings, if I don\u2019t, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would appreciate it,\u201d Thor said simply, then hopped from hull to hull, returning to his own boat. He shouted out to Jack on the other vessel, \u201cBring her in.\u201d</p><p>There was silence as the boats raced across the water, returning to dock at the resort. The police boats weren\u2019t far behind.</p><p>News traveled fast. A crowd\u2014being managed by uniformed officers\u2014had formed around the docks.</p><p>Strangely, there was a sense of excitement in the air. As if people felt they were being a part of history, rather than witnessing a tragedy. News had traveled fast. It seemed everyone already knew it was another hooker who had been found, so as long as you weren\u2019t a hooker, you were safe.</p><p>Thor was still tying down when the police cruiser came in, when the corpse was removed from it in a body bag. One of the cops had been as sloppy as the killer.</p><p>The bag wasn\u2019t fully closed.</p> <p>As two officers managed the weight, the top gave way. The woman\u2019s face was clearly visible, eyes still staring.</p><p>Thor heard a startled gasp from behind him.</p><p>He turned to see Bethany gaping at the corpse.</p><p>She saw him, and instantly, a shield came up over her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou knew her?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>She shook her head vehemently. \u201cKnew her? No, I didn\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve seen her before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah,\u201d Jack announced from behind them both. \u201cShe\u2019s Victor\u2019s blonde.\u201d</p> <p>16</p><p>I n his wildest dreams, Victor couldn\u2019t have imagined this.</p><p>The interrogation room was like those he had seen on television\u2014stark.</p><p>And the way the detectives spoke to him...He kept wondering what the hell had happened to \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d</p><p>Jay wasn\u2019t there. He assumed the powers that be had decided Jay was too close to him, and that others should do the baiting. Because it was baiting, nothing more.</p><p>Detective Suarez was lean, dark and sharp-looking. Mertz...well, even without the name, Victor would have been reminded of Fred Mertz on I Love Lucy. Mertz was stout, balding and sixty-ish.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t very funny.</p><p>\u201cHow many hookers have you done in?\u201d Mertz demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kill her? And the one before?\u201d Suarez asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk. This is a death penalty state. Death penalty. We can keep you from the needle, Victor. We\u2019ll help you\u2014if you help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your friend Audrey? What happened? She isn\u2019t the type you like to kill, so what happened? Did she suspect you were the murderer? You were walking her home, right? She said something, so you conned her into going with you so you could toss her overboard somewhere, too, is that it?\u201d Mertz suggested.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone!\u201d Victor exploded, thinking back to the way he\u2019d ended up here.</p><p>One of the officers had walked up to him pleasantly enough, explaining that they would be talking to everyone from the boats, because of the circumstances surrounding the finding of both bodies.</p><p>Of course, he knew the dead woman. Knew her in every sense of the word.</p><p>\u201cI thought she liked me. I didn\u2019t know she was a hooker at first,\u201d he\u2019d told Jay.</p><p>\u201cThey just want to talk to you at the station. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s routine. Help us out,\u201d Jay had told him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>So polite at first.</p><p>And now...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead, buddy,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cThat means you killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That happens when you weigh someone down and dump them in the water,\u201d Mertz added.</p><p>\u201cTalk to us. We\u2019ll help you,\u201d Suarez said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, buddy. The others, they were strangers. Whores. You know what I mean? But Audrey was your friend,\u201d Mertz pressed.</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, Audrey is alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd missing,\u201d Mertz said.</p><p>\u201cI walked her to her door. I watched her enter the house. I heard her lock the door after I left,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cBut then you went back,\u201d Suarez said.</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d Victor protested.</p><p>\u201cImagine the needle slipping into your arm,\u201d Mertz warned. \u201cThey say it\u2019s better than Old Sparky. Hey, Suarez, remember when that guy went to the chair and his hair caught fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why the hell he had hair at an electrocution, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Suarez replied, shaking his head. \u201cThey say the needle is much better. They say you\u2019re unconscious before the heart goes into agony and the lungs shut down. But imagine what it must be like. Being strapped down. Feeling the needle. Knowing what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, I didn\u2019t murder anyone, don\u2019t you get that?\u201d Victor demanded.</p><p>\u201cWas murdering a real woman kind of like chopping up that mannequin? Or are you going to tell us you didn\u2019t do that, either?\u201d Mertz demanded.</p><p>\u201cI need a lawyer,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not under arrest,\u201d Mertz said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t have any evidence, do you, assholes?\u201d Victor demanded, standing. His temper had finally burst. \u201cI\u2019m out of here\u2014unless you think you can arrest me.\u201d</p><p>Mertz grinned. \u201cIn that case, you\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor murder?\u201d Victor asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cTheft,\u201d Suarez said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cThe mannequin,\u201d Mertz said.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t steal the mannequin,\u201d Victor protested.</p><p>\u201cYou broke it up and dumped it, right? Your friend Genevieve told Gonzalez all about it,\u201d Suarez reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAnd she was going to pay for it, and no charges were going to be filed,\u201d Victor reminded them.</p><p>Suarez smiled grimly. \u201cImagine that. She was going to pay for it. Miss Wallace. She\u2019s a good friend, buddy. A real good friend. But she can\u2019t save you now. Trust me, we will find out the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want the truth, you should be out there looking for it. If you want to arrest me, do it\u2014and get me a damned lawyer. If not, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are going to arrest you,\u201d Mertz said.</p><p>Victor groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten the shopkeeper to file charges,\u201d Suarez informed him.</p><p>Victor slumped back into his seat.</p><p>\u201cThat is bullshit,\u201d he informed them.</p><p>\u201cHey, the mannequin was stolen. It was in your cottage. Miss Wallace found you breaking it up. Is that what you really wanted to do with the women you killed, Victor? Slice them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>\u201cWe think you did. We think there are more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think. You think! Think whatever you want, but you don\u2019t have anything on me\u2014you can\u2019t have anything on me\u2014because I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Was this how most confessions were obtained? Torture was no longer legal, so he\u2019d heard, but with both these guys right on top of him...</p><p>Shit. He could begin to question his own sanity.</p><p>\u201cBut you did steal the mannequin,\u201d Mertz said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just chopped it up. Murdered it. Like you murdered those hookers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m under arrest, I want a lawyer. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to us. We can get you a deal, keep you from the needle. No matter how many hookers you\u2019ve killed,\u201d Mertz said.</p><p>Victor gritted his teeth. \u201cI want a lawyer. Now. I know my rights.\u201d An idea occurred to him. \u201cHey, you guys forgot to read me my Miranda rights.\u201d</p><p>Score one for him. The detectives stared at each other.</p><p>Mertz began to drone out the Miranda rights.</p><p>Damn Genevieve. What had made her feel she had to go to Jay, confess that they had ditched the mannequin? She couldn\u2019t have known it would come to this. Still...</p><p>His hands twitched.</p><p>He fought the urge to throttle her.</p><p>Because everyone was talking, because everything was such a disaster, Genevieve had suggested they all get showered and cleaned up and come over to her house.</p><p>\u201cA party?\u201d Bethany had asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cNo! But the police said they\u2019re going to question us, so they can find us all there.\u201d</p><p>The look on Thor\u2019s face had indicated that he wasn\u2019t fond of the idea, but she had already spoken. And so, by the late afternoon, they had all gathered at her place.</p><p>They talked in circles. \u201cSo what do you think Marshall having disappeared has to do with all this?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>\u201cI wonder why they haven\u2019t called the rest of us in,\u201d Bethany murmured.</p><p>\u201cI wonder why the hell they\u2019re keeping Victor so long,\u201d Jack mused aloud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call the station and find out what\u2019s going on,\u201d Genevieve said, starting to rise.</p><p>Thor, at her side, placed a hand on hers. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked dully.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t seriously suspect Victor,\u201d she said, horrified.</p><p>\u201cThey can,\u201d Brent said, leaning forward. \u201cGenevieve, Victor knew the woman you found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? That\u2019s just circumstantial. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And Victor would be smarter. He would have done a better job getting rid of the body,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cBethany!\u201d Genevieve protested angrily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?

If anyone hears anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call you right away,\u201d Lizzie promised.</p><p>Looking at him, Genevieve nodded.</p><p>She was surprised when Brent stood. \u201cMind if I go along?\u201d</p><p>She was even more surprised when Thor studied him for a minute, then shrugged. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He turned to the others.</p> <p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d he said to the room in general. Then he hesitated, before looking back at Genevieve. \u201cLet\u2019s take a ride somewhere later tonight, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us?\u201d Bethany asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI meant Genevieve,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cBethany, they want to be alone,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cOh! Of course,\u201d Bethany said. But then she frowned. \u201cNow? In the middle of all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Victor is delayed, Bethany, you can room with Brent and me,\u201d Nikki said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you a room at the hotel,\u201d Adam said, sensing her unease.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m sure Victor will be back.\u201d Her words carried more conviction than her tone.</p><p>\u201cAdam, want to come along?\u201d Thor asked, really stunning Genevieve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep watch here, thanks,\u201d Adam said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m quite capable in the kitchen. I\u2019ll throw something together for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll be back,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Genevieve watched him go with growing concern. Audrey was missing. Marshall was still a no-show. Victor was down at the police station\u2014and their group had now discovered two corpses.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what was going on, but she knew it sucked.</p><p>\u201cThat was Sheridan on the phone?\u201d Brent asked as they drove.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...? This have something to do with the murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s started working with some of the letters from the box Gen found. He\u2019s treating them with something\u2014I don\u2019t really understand the preservation of paper\u2014and he\u2019s been translating them from Spanish into English.\u201d Thor shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s...an oddball. The type who feels you live by the sword, you die by the sword, and those women were living by the sword due to their profession. The present never interests him much. His biggest feeling seems to be irritation that the murders are disrupting the dive.\u201d</p><p>Brent lifted a hand. \u201cSome people are like that.\u201d</p><p>There were several long moments of silence before Thor turned abruptly to Brent. \u201cYou know a lot about...ghosts, right?\u201d he asked, unable to keep his tone from being slightly dry.</p><p>\u201cI know this is really hard for you. That you aren\u2019t the type to believe in anything except what you see and touch yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just made me sound completely closed-minded.\u201d</p><p>Brent grinned easily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. It\u2019s a tough world. You\u2019re a pretty tough guy. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to believe in the occult. You\u2019re a man who makes his living in the real world. It wouldn\u2019t do a lot for your reputation if you went around talking about pirate ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try not to spend my time protecting my reputation,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cWe do that to an extent. How do you think Adam has acquired his contacts and his ability to slip his people in wherever he chooses?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got a point. But what the hell good is any of this doing? Genevieve sees ghosts\u2014but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any ghost murdering those women. So where is any of this getting us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping what Sheridan has discovered might be of some help,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, too. Though, realistically speaking, I don\u2019t see how it can solve the current problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never claimed to have all the answers,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d Thor murmured. He bore a grudging admiration for the other man that continued to grow. He had an ability to hold his temper and still stand his ground.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about Adam Harrison,\u201d Thor said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cAdam? The last of the great gentlemen?\u201d Brent said gruffly, his affection for the man evident. He lifted his hands. \u201cHe was born on a working plantation in Virginia to a family with a long history in politics. His wife died soon after the birth of their only son, and his son was killed in an accident after his high school prom. He was kind of like Harry Houdini, I guess, desperate to believe there was life after death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, Houdini spent most of his life unmasking charlatans,\u201d Thor commented.</p><p>Brent smiled noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cAnd he never made it back himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t summon up whoever you choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, you don\u2019t, and you don\u2019t need to humor me. I don\u2019t really care if you believe in an afterlife or not,\u201d Brent said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to argue. I just know what I can and can\u2019t do, and your opinion isn\u2019t going to change it any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Harrison Investigations is completely on the up-and-up?\u201d Thor murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know it is. I\u2019m sure you used some of your own contacts to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still don\u2019t really trust us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ghost hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not con men,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure out what the story is with my seeing a boy claiming to be Josh Harrison,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cYou probably did see Josh,\u201d Brent told him casually.</p><p>\u201cA ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh Harrison, son of Adam, ghost,\u201d Thor murmured. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to tell me you\u2019ve seen him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Thor demanded, his brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the back seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Thor turned around.</p><p>He nearly drove off the highway.</p><p>Brent was telling the truth.</p><p>The boy was seated in the back seat, right behind Brent.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Thor gasped.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should drive,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jack said, rising. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t just sit around. Anyone want to join me? I\u2019m going to hit some of the bars and find out myself if anyone has seen Audrey anywhere, or if she said anything to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try Audrey\u2019s numbers again, just in case,\u201d Genevieve said. She pulled out her cell, since she felt the need to pace while she talked.</p><p>All three numbers rang until Audrey\u2019s recorded voice asked for a message.</p><p>Genevieve flipped the phone shut, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cSo we look for her,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cIf she had her phone...if she were reachable...she\u2019d answer. She\u2019d call me,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI\u2019m so worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, she\u2019s a brunette, not a blonde. Just like you, Gen,\u201d Alex pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s a quack, not a hooker,\u201d Jack reminded them cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still worried,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Jack walked over and gave her a hug. \u201cWe all are. And I\u2019m restless. I know she\u2019s probably not barhopping, but we\u2019re not doing any good, all of us sitting around here, just waiting. We\u2019ll see if she did run into someone else. Who knows, maybe there\u2019s a relative somewhere we don\u2019t know about who suddenly called because they needed her. Maybe she had to go to the aid of one of her clients. Maybe she really conjured up a ghost or...well, who the hell knows. But maybe, just maybe, we can find something out. Anyone want to join me?\u201d</p><p>Zach rose, reaching a hand down to his wife. \u201cSure. Though we don\u2019t know the locals like you do.\u201d</p><p>Alex rose. \u201cYeah, we need to do something.\u201d He looked at Genevieve ruefully. \u201cI think I need to move, too. I\u2019m going to go with Jack, too, if you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. But I\u2019m going to hang in here until I hear from Victor or Thor.\u201d</p><p>Bethany laughed. \u201cI\u2019m staying with my new best friend,\u201d she said, indicating Adam.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call you if we hear anything,\u201d Jack promised as he and the others filed out.</p><p>There was silence for a minute after they left. Then Genevieve picked up the plates. Adam had concocted an interesting hash out of the leftovers from the barbecue, and everyone had eaten heartily. \u201cI\u2019ll just put these in the kitchen,\u201d she said.</p><p>Nikki rose with her. \u201cI\u2019ll help. Move it along.\u201d She glanced at Adam. \u201cActually, Gen, there\u2019s something we\u2019d like you to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHypnosis,\u201d Adam said, rising.</p><p>Genevieve nearly dropped the plates she was carrying, staring from one of them to the other.</p><p>\u201cPast-life regression, or something like that,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>Adam hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019ll discover. But I can question you while you\u2019re under, and maybe.... Don\u2019t be worried. We choose a safety word before you go under. That word will bring you back to the present, wide-awake, if you find yourself under duress.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hands were shaking and she didn\u2019t know why.

They were almost at the lab, but he needed a break.</p><p>Throwing the car into Park, he looked in the back seat again.</p><p>It was empty.</p><p>He stared at Brent.</p><p>\u201cThere was just someone in the back seat,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brent agreed.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably thought you were about to have a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly drove off the damned road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I noticed that.\u201d Brent smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking believe in ghosts! What the hell is this bull you all are pulling on everyone? Smoke and mirrors. How the hell are you doing it?\u201d</p><p>Brent didn\u2019t flinch. He just stared at him. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d he said, calm, quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re a logical man. You figure it out. Maybe there are things in this world that you can\u2019t explain. Maybe there really was a ghost in your back seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d Thor repeated stonily.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t believe in them. But shouldn\u2019t I drive?\u201d Brent asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe have about four blocks to go,\u201d Thor said. \u201cI can drive.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back out onto the road. He didn\u2019t want to look into the rearview mirror, but he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>The kid was back, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>And then he drove on. Cautiously.</p><p>A strange wind was blowing. She was accustomed to the sea, loved the sea, and yet today something in the air was disturbing...frightening.</p><p>Or was fear creating the disturbance within her own spirit?</p><p>No one believed her, not even her own father. But then again, he was such a liar. Yet, she dared not decry him too passionately, lest the truth be known. And the truth was far worse....</p><p>She stared toward the horizon, certain help would come.</p><p>Then she turned and looked nervously at the ship\u2019s guns. There seemed to be so many. She was a proud ship, but the ocean was vast, and any ship, no matter how proud, was but a speck on the sea.</p><p>She turned around, aware of the wind, and also aware of something else.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>A strange and eerie silence. The ship shouldn\u2019t be quiet.</p><p>A sensation of evil crept along her spine. She looked slowly around her. There should have been men in the rigging. The wind was changing and the men should have been shouting to one another, hurrying to trim the sails.</p><p>Not a single sailor was topside.</p><p>But he was.</p><p>Staring at her. With that smile she hated so much.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where is everyone?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGone,\u201d he said simply, and smiled more broadly.</p><p>The chill along her spine became glacial.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018gone\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wanted to swim,\u201d he said pleasantly, approaching her. Slowly. Still keeping his distance. He was enjoying himself.</p><p>She watched him very carefully, then looked to the horizon again.</p><p>Maybe she was hoping, maybe it was real, but she thought she saw another ship on the horizon. But the weather was changing so quickly. Calm seas began to roil. A mist seemed to have suddenly sprung up over the water, a sure sign of changing temperatures.</p><p>She was worrying about a storm, she realized, while he...</p><p>She was worrying about a storm rather than face the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou have...you have taken over the ship? But...the men are loyal to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeamen, dear girl, are most often loyal to the highest bidder,\u201d he commented. \u201cYou forget the port from which we have just come. And that new men had to be hired on to replace those who took ill so seriously\u2014and so suddenly. You forget so much\u2014my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget nothing! You, sir, lived in the recesses of your mind and imagined truth where there was none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betrayed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no \u2018us\u2019 for me to betray.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. History will tell the tale. And it will be the truth. The pirate destroyed all.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>It was then that she saw what he was about. Saw the two men emerge from behind a pile of rigging.</p><p>One was huge, with burly arms. She\u2019d seen him before, when the first mate had been railing at him for some dereliction of duty.</p><p>He was winding a length of thick rope.</p><p>The second man dragged a canvas bag of ballast with him.</p><p>\u201cYou should have loved me,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She turned, desperate to crawl over the railing and cast herself into the sea while some margin of hope remained.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>She felt their hands, dragging her back.</p><p>She screamed. Screamed as if the sound could break the heavens, penetrate earth and sky, somehow bring salvation. But they were on her. Huge and heavily muscled. She had not a prayer. She knew that when the first blow struck her cheek and she went reeling. She fought the loss of consciousness, knowing her fate, disbelieving, and yet still...</p><p>Knowing.</p><p>There was a ship on the horizon. A distance away, still, but closing. Oh God, oh God, dear Father in Heaven, forgive me...</p><p>The rope was tied securely around both her ankles and the bag of ballast. Still, she bit, scratched, screamed, cursed....</p><p>She was lifted.</p><p>As she hit the water, she heard the first boom of cannon fire.</p><p>17</p><p>S heridan\u2019s real facilities were in the northern part of the state. Still, he had managed to do a good job of making it look as if he had kept a research lab in town for at least a decade.</p><p>A grad student sat sentinel in the antechamber; specialists the professor had called here were busy at various locales throughout the complex of rooms\u2014too many, Thor thought, considering the few artifacts they had turned up thus far.</p><p>Sheridan led Thor and Brent into his office, ignoring his people as if they were no more than honeybees buzzing around, expected to produce.</p><p>\u201cThe letter was written by Anne, and signed with a flourish. She had lovely penmanship,\u201d Sheridan told them, warming to his subject. His desk was laden with papers and books. Thor wasn\u2019t quite sure how the man could find anything.</p><p>Sheridan looked up at them triumphantly. \u201cThere was far more going on than one might have expected,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll read you my translation. The ink was poor in a few spots, but...imagine, almost perfectly preserved after all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor, if you would?\u201d Thor said, trying to hide his impatience.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need Sheridan going all intellectually ADD on him at the moment. He\u2019d been trying to keep it together since he\u2019d slammed his way out of the car.</p><p>Who would have expected this dive would be the one on which he found the woman he loved.</p><p>And lost his mind.</p><p>If he\u2019d seen a ghost, he should be considering a long vacation. If he hadn\u2019t seen a ghost, something criminal was going on with Adam Harrison and his gang.</p><p>He stopped thinking and started listening when Sheridan began to read.</p><p>Today I awoke afraid, as I had not been before. I was aghast at the lies being told, yet did not dare to utter the truth.</p><p>But I know he will come.</p><p>And for all that is reputation and all that is legend about the man, I know that one thing is true: his love for me. He will see the battle is swift and sure. He will see that the good do not die. He will be merciful. For me.</p><p>But while I wait, I am afraid, so I will write my prayers.</p><p>Sheridan stopped speaking and looked up at them as if he had just translated the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it!\u201d Sheridan exploded. \u201cCan\u2019t you see? There was a conspiracy going on aboard the Marie Josephine. Of course, I don\u2019t know why Anne was afraid, who she feared, or who she thought would come to her rescue, but...we will know more. I\u2019ll continue translating what I have, and you\u2019ll bring me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessor,\u201d Thor reminded him, \u201canother body has been discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a killer loose in the Keys,\u201d Brent commented.</p><p>Sheridan stared at him, frowning. \u201cAnd you\u2019re professional salvage divers. What\u2019s going on is sad, but I don\u2019t see why it has to delay your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to have to, Professor,\u201d Thor said. \u201cThe police have asked us to keep the area clear until they\u2019ve had time to look for evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can help them\u2014while you look for the Marie Josephine,\u201d Sheridan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I have more information,\u201d Thor told him, cutting the conversation short.</p><p>Sheridan rose. \u201cWe\u2019re working on grant money, you know. This lab...it costs a fortune to run. We\u2019ve got to get back to work. We\u2019re going to need much more to justify our expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted, I promise,\u201d Thor told him.</p><p>As they left the offices, Thor tossed the keys to Brent, who caught them, looking surprised. \u201cJust drive,\u201d Thor said wearily.</p><p>To Victor\u2019s amazement, they didn\u2019t arrest him. Even after they had said they were going to do so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suarez was the one who let him go, after having shut him in the interrogation room alone for at least an hour.</p><p>He released him simply, opening the door, popping in his head. \u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Victor said sharply.</p> <p>\u201cLeave. You can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were pressing charges against me?\u201d</p><p>Suarez shrugged. \u201cChange of heart.

I was about to say the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Victor lifted his chin. He decided it was time to beat a hasty retreat before the detective found another reason to detain him.</p><p>Audrey awoke. Her mind was in a pea-soup haze. She was tied up, nearly smothering, and in pain, but she couldn\u2019t figure out where she was, or how she had gotten there.</p><p>Then it all began to come back to her.</p><p>She was terrified, trapped in tight quarters, a gag in her mouth, the lingering thud of the drug in her head, and the bindings chafing at her wrists and ankles.</p><p>As the fog cleared, she became more aware of her position.</p><p>She could barely breathe, down here in the hold; she needed to keep still, to save her oxygen.</p><p>Despite that, she cried. Wet tears that slid down the grime on her cheeks.</p> <p>She remembered how it had happened, step by step.</p><p>And realized she was going to die.</p><p>So far...just the torture. Inflicted because her attacker had an ego that seemed to know no bounds.</p><p>How much more torture?</p><p>Could she do anything...play into it?</p><p>She wondered if air could get in? She realized all the things she didn\u2019t know about the sea, about boats.</p><p>She was going to die. When the game of torturing her grew old.</p><p>She could only put it off....</p><p>She resolved to herself that she would put it off. She would play along, say anything\u2014good God, do anything\u2014if it could keep her alive for one more minute.</p><p>Someone would finally figure it out, surely.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the one he had really wanted, she knew. She was just a poor substitute.</p><p>Substitutes were so expendable....</p><p>No!</p><p>She had to fight, had to stay alive, say anything, do anything....</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Genevieve. Eventually she, too, would be here.</p><p>And she, too, would die.</p><p>Despite the circumstances, Genevieve appeared to be in the best of spirits as she opened the door to see Thor and Brent standing on her porch.</p><p>\u201cVictor is out,\u201d she said first, without preamble.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Thor asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cThey have nothing on him, of course,\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cHe was the last one seen with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ask Bethany\u2014he couldn\u2019t have been with her long because he got back to his cottage too quickly,\u201d Genevieve said with a wave of her hand. \u201cI\u2019m onto something, though, but first\u2014\u201d she looked past him, smiling at Brent \u201c\u2014what did Sheridan have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye, basically. Our Anne left letters in the box. She was afraid of someone. And she was waiting for someone else to come and give her assistance. It\u2019s kind of convoluted. She goes on about some truth, but the truth is worse than a lie. He\u2019s only translated one of the letters so far.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve smiled. \u201cI have the truth,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cCome on in and sit down,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAny word of Audrey?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s brilliant smile collapsed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Adam, Nikki and Bethany were in the parlor. Someone had apparently just brewed tea.</p><p>\u201cWant something?\u201d Genevieve asked.</p><p>Thor\u2019s stomach was growling, but he shook his head. Information first. \u201cGive us what you know,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAnne wasn\u2019t desperately in love with Aldo. She despised him,\u201d Genevieve announced.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Thor said skeptically.</p><p>Genevieve nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember or not, but I\u2019ve done a lot of reading on the Marie Josephine. Some of the letters and memoirs were written by pirates who sailed with Gasparilla, and they talked about his deep love for Anne. Remember there was the suggestion that Gasparilla hated being scorned, that he might have killed Anne? Well, he didn\u2019t. He tried to save her. There was a mutiny on board the Marie Josephine. Aldo\u2014the supposed great love of Anne\u2019s life\u2014was the one who killed her. Gasparilla was on his way to save her. He\u2019d promised to do his best not to kill the crew and to see that her father was safe. But he was too late. Aldo was the one who couldn\u2019t bear the fact Anne had scorned him. He murdered her. In the same way these women were murdered now. He weighted her down and threw her overboard. Gasparilla was on his way. He attacked the ship, found the crew dead and battled the mutineers. The Marie Josephine was already breaking apart. Cannon fire did her in. Well, I\u2019m speculating on some of this, but I swear I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Thor stared at her, frowning. \u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d Bethany breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat was incredible?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cShe went back. She lived it all as Anne,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>Thor felt his temper rising. This was ridiculous, so why did he feel...</p><p>Fear?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d he demanded. He stared at Genevieve hard, then turned his glare on Adam Harrison.</p><p>\u201cHypnosis,\u201d Adam said evenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Thor exploded.</p><p>\u201cThor, stop it,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHypnotism is a valuable tool,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cPeople have quit smoking with the help of hypnosis. They\u2019ve lost weight, made other important changes in their lives.\u201d</p><p>Thor wasn\u2019t appeased. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply painted a picture of the day,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThen I asked Genevieve questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have heard her. It was like she was living it.\u201d Bethany was so obviously still under the spell of what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>Smoke and mirrors. The power of suggestion. Maybe it was all a form of hypnotism.</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest. \u201cGreat. You think you know what happened on the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cAnd,\u201d she pointed out, \u201cit fits in with everything Sheridan was telling you. Just wait,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cWait until he\u2019s read more of the letters. You\u2019ll find out I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>In this group, he wasn\u2019t going to win so he simply ignored the topic and moved on.</p><p>\u201cSo Victor has been released. What about Audrey? Any word from the cops on the identity of the corpse? Or from Marshall?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve\u2019s face fell. She shook her head. \u201cJack, Alex, Lizzie and Zach went out right after you left. They were going to see if Audrey was out...if anyone ran into her, if she said anything to anyone...anything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard back from them?\u201d Brent asked.</p><p>Genevieve shook her head. \u201cBut I can just call them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019d have called you if they\u2019d discovered anything. Want to head out with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She frowned, her eyes indicating that she had company. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiami,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see if we can\u2019t find out something about Marshall.\u201d She kept staring at him. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting anywhere here,\u201d he added quietly.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to drive all the way to Miami and back today? It is kind of late. And what about the dive?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cSheridan doesn\u2019t seem concerned about the dead women,\u201d Thor admitted dryly. \u201cBut we have to leave the area to the cops for another day. That\u2019s assuming they\u2019ll sanction us going back down on Thursday. We\u2019ll be back by tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Gen. I\u2019m just leaving with these guys,\u201d Bethany called, interrupting them. She smiled assurance to Genevieve. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sticking to this group like chewed gum on the bottom of a shoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep in touch,\u201d Brent told Thor.</p><p>\u201cActually, we are getting somewhere,\u201d Genevieve said as soon as everyone else was gone. \u201cAnd I want to get hold of Helen\u2014that reporter who\u2019s Father Bellamy\u2019s main squeeze. I want her to do a story about what happened on the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything yet,\u201d Thor reported.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have her write it up as my theory,\u201d Genevieve told him.</p><p>\u201cYou can call her from the car,\u201d Thor said curtly. He was suddenly in a hurry to get out of here.</p><p>He needed a little distance from all the insanity.</p><p>But could they really get away?</p><p>Or would they be followed?</p><p>By...? he taunted himself.</p><p>Ghosts.</p><p>He was back.</p><p>Audrey could hear his footsteps overhead.</p><p>From the noises, it sounded as if he were getting ready to take the boat out.</p><p>Oh, God!</p><p>It was time. If they went out to sea...</p><p>She could fight. Yes, now that she knew, she could fight.</p><p>And never win. Look where she was right now.</p><p>So this was it.</p><p>Tears sprang into her eyes again.</p><p>But then, very distantly, a phone began to ring. His cell.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear his words, only that he had answered, and his tone was as blithe as if he had a fish in his hold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the noises stopped.</p><p>He had left the boat.</p><p>A reprieve?</p> <p>The heat was terrible. She was sure her air was almost gone, although she kept trying to tell herself that oxygen was getting in to her somehow. The boards were wet beneath her. The whole place stank of fish.</p><p>She was going to smother or roast before she could drown, she thought.</p><p>Then a prayer rushed into her heart. No, no, I didn\u2019t mean it. I will survive. I will. Don\u2019t let him come back...!</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201d Genevieve asked, settling into the passenger seat of his car. \u201cI mean...should we be gone right now?\u201d</p><p>He set his hand on hers where it lay on her lap. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried sick about Audrey, and with all that\u2019s been going on, you have good reason. But everyone is out looking for her. I don\u2019t even begin to know where to start. It makes sense to take a trip to Miami. Marshall wasn\u2019t checked into the hotel his call came from. When I met with him to set up this dive, we met in Coconut Grove. There\u2019s public dockage there. I thought we would do some club-hopping on the beach tonight and rent a boat tomorrow. We can search the yacht clubs, marinas and waterways for his boat.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s very logical. But by now, haven\u2019t the local police notified their associates up there? Aren\u2019t they on the lookout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably not at a public marina,\u201d Thor acknowledged. \u201cBut you can be certain law enforcement in Miami-Dade isn\u2019t seeing this as a serious situation. I\u2019m not saying anything negative about them, but they\u2019ve got their hands full with local crime, and they\u2019re not going to be overly concerned with a grown man who may have disappeared of his own volition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she admitted, then looked at him. \u201cSo you have a plan. And here I was thinking you just wanted to get the hell out of Key West,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe\u2019ll be gone twenty-four hours. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou feel all right?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She laughed out loud. \u201cDo you mean, am I slipping in and out of another lifetime? Do I have a ghost on my lap?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her through the rearview mirror.</p><p>He also checked out his back seat.</p><p>It seemed they were alone.</p><p>He was starving, so they stopped in Plantation Key for dinner, then moved on.</p><p>There were no traffic problems on US1 that night, and by the time they reached Miami, it was well past rush hour.</p><p>They checked into the Mayfair in Coconut Grove. Thor was in a hurry to go out, but Genevieve insisted that if they were hitting the clubs on South Beach, she had to shower and change.</p><p>Thor wound up joining her in the shower. And then they wound up slick and soapy and together.</p> <p>Slick, soapy, and flesh to flesh, steam rising all around them. They were alone. In a massive marbled bathroom. With a huge king-size bed just beyond.</p><p>The bed wound up damp and just a bit slick, as well. Thor found himself wondering what it was about one particular woman that could make the rest of the world fade away. Sex, yes. The rise of excitement created by something so small as a smile, a touch...</p><p>A body, slick and soapy.</p><p>And still...</p><p>It was her. Everything about her. Her eyes, her smile. The shape of her face. The way her fingers felt against his. Little things he knew she would do. The way the palm of her hand felt against his buttocks, the way her lips felt on his, the way she teased with just the tip of her tongue...</p><p>The heat that exuded from her body, the very scent of her so unique...</p><p>Later, as he lay looking at the ceiling, he knew he was in love with her. Thor would accept anything in the world if...</p><p>But...ghosts?</p><p>There seemed to be none around them that night. Her fingers played across his chest for a moment as they lay there, just breathing, hearts slowing. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that prime time at the clubs is in the middle of the night,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He leapt up. \u201cShower first\u2014don\u2019t come in,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She laughed. But she waited dutifully until he was out. Then she rushed in.</p><p>She really had her virtues\u2014beyond beauty, sensuality, diving ability and her smile. She could get ready faster than any woman he had ever met.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019re out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>He was amazed to discover he had fun. He was pretty sure, despite the fact that he might have been recognized a time or two, that they were admitted to every club without hesitation\u2014despite occasionally lengthy lines\u2014because of the way Genevieve looked and smiled.</p><p>At first, and well past midnight, it seemed they were on nothing more than a club-hopping tour. They danced. They paid exorbitant prices for drinks. He became best friends with lots of cocktail waitresses, while Genevieve flirted with bartenders, describing Marshall and asking if they\u2019d seen him anywhere. Several knew him, but no one had seen him recently.</p><p>They found out nothing useful. Thor\u2019s frustration must have shown, because Genevieve slipped her arm around him and said, \u201cHey, it was a good idea. We did find out most of the bartenders know him, so if he had been there...\u201d</p><p>They wandered into a little place on Washington, a piano bar.</p><p>It was much quieter than the places they had been. The pianist was good, the audience sedate.</p><p>He and Genevieve took seats at a small table toward the back. They ordered coffee, despite the fact that they would be heading back to the hotel soon to sleep. Hell, he needed to stay awake enough to find their way back.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be an explanation for his disappearance. He\u2019s not a prostitute\u2014hell, he\u2019s not even an attractive woman,\u201d he said, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he really called the police?\u201d Genevieve asked worriedly. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that he was...I don\u2019t know, abducted for a different reason, and someone faked the call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>She was folding and unfolding her napkin. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Marshall, but...I\u2019m even more worried about Audrey. She is an attractive young woman.\u201d</p><p>She stared straight at him then. \u201cI\u2019m worried, too,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>She smiled wanly, placing her hand on his. \u201cStill worried about me?\u201d she asked, and he knew she was referring to her sanity.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a chance to reply. A soft female voice broke in on them.</p><p>\u201cGen? Genevieve Wallace?\u201d</p><p>He turned as Genevieve looked up. They had been approached by a couple who had apparently been leaving but stopped at the sight of Genevieve, who frowned, before her face lit up in a smile.</p><p>\u201cKathy!\u201d She grinned at Thor, who rose quickly as Genevieve introduced her friend. \u201cKathleen O\u2019Malley, Thor Thompson. Thor, Kathy and I went to school together. She\u2019s an escaped Conch. And George.\u201d She rose, too, kissing the man on the cheek. \u201cGeorge Ryder,\u201d she said in a rush, remembering she was doing the introductions. \u201cGeorge also went to school with me.\u201d</p><p>Kathy laughed. She was tiny, with blond ringlets. George was taller, and very lean. He shook Thor\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re the diver, right? I\u2019ve seen you in magazines.\u201d</p><p>Thor nodded. \u201cCan you stay a minute? I\u2019ll draw up a few chairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cOh, we\u2019re both Ryders now. George and I got married four years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea,\u201d Genevieve said warmly, taking her seat again. \u201cCongratulations. Weren\u2019t you voted \u2018Couple Most Likely to Stay Together\u2019?\u201d</p><p>George arched a brow. \u201cOh, stop,\u201d Kathy said, laughing. \u201cGen, you look wonderful. But I thought I read that you were on some dive now? Did you two escape or something? The prostitute murders down there have made the news up here. They just found a second girl, right?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve nodded.</p><p>\u201cBe careful down there. No wonder you guys wanted to come up here for a break,\u201d Kathy said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cYou know Marshall\u2014my boss?\u201d</p><p>Again, Kathy smiled. She seemed unfailingly cheerful, Thor thought. \u201cSure. He used to humor us all the time when we were kids. I still love boats and diving because of him. We came up here because George was going to law school at the University of Miami, and then he got a job up here...but I still miss the Keys. Anyway, yes, I remember Marshall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t run into him anywhere up here recently, have you?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>Kathy shook her head. She was obviously the speaker. George was the quiet one.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, sorry. He isn\u2019t down there with you? Hard to believe Marshall would play hooky. I remember him telling us he\u2019d have his own company one day, just like the big-time salvage guys. He managed it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Genevieve murmured.</p><p>\u201cWow, imagine, running into you,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cOf course, the distance isn\u2019t all that great, but I haven\u2019t been all the way down to Key West in years. We escape to Key Largo a lot, but that\u2019s just an hour away. Much easier when you only have a weekend here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I almost never get up here,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d George said, breaking in suddenly, \u201cit\u2019s strange to run into you tonight. I\u2019ve been thinking about you and Bethany and Victor. I thought you might be affected by what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe murders, you mean?\u201d Thor asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d George agreed, nodding gravely. \u201cDo you remember back when we were in school? We were seniors, I think, when the paper had a spread on that woman who was on her way to being a supermodel. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she just up and disappeared,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been bugging me,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t there something in the paper last year about another woman who disappeared? Did they ever find her?\u201d Kathy asked, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI should ask Jay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJay,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cPoor guy. He loved his wife so much. Did he ever remarry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not married. If he\u2019s even dating, I don\u2019t know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him our love, will you?\u201d Kathy asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Genevieve said.</p><p>Kathy looked at her watch. \u201cYikes! We\u2019d better get going. George\u2019s cousin is home with the baby. Oh, we have a little boy\u2014George, of course,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations again,\u201d Genevieve told her.</p><p>\u201cI wish we had seen you earlier. This was wonderful,\u201d Kathy said, rising. George and Thor did the same and Genevieve, too, got to her feet to give Kathy a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cReally great,\u201d George added.</p> <p>\u201cAnd a pleasure to meet you,\u201d Kathy said to Thor. She assessed him, grinning, gave Genevieve a nod of what seemed to be approval.</p><p>\u201cReally great,\u201d George said again, pumping Thor\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, and listen. Best of luck with the treasure hunt. And remember, Gen, you knew us when.\u201d</p><p>Waving, Kathy was led away at last by her husband.</p><p>Thor stared at Genevieve, grinning.</p><p>\u201cGeorge was the smartest kid in class,\u201d she said, grinning back.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Kathy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most talkative.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, then sobered. Something about the conversation had disturbed him. As they paid their bill and left, he kept mulling it over in his mind.</p><p>He\u2019d felt suspicious of those close to them before now.</p><p>Jay.</p><p>Who had lost his wife when she had drowned.</p><p>Victor.</p><p>Who had been with the prostitute.</p> <p>As he drove back to their hotel, he knew George and Kathy had pressed something home to him.</p><p>It had all happened before.</p><p>So who had been around all that time? Strangers, of course. People he had never met. Key West could be a transient place. He was certain a lot of the people living there now had arrived since Genevieve had been in high school.</p><p>There was no reason to believe the murderer was close to them.</p><p>Except...</p><p>Okay, it was a long shot, but what if ghosts did exist? What if Genevieve\u2019s ghost kept appearing not because she wanted help, but because she wanted to give them help?</p><p>\u201cCrazy,\u201d he muttered aloud.</p><p>Genevieve was half asleep in the passenger seat. She raised her head slightly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, sorry,\u201d he murmured. How was he supposed to respond? Hey, guess what? I\u2019m seeing a ghost, too. Different ghost, a wise-ass kid, but still...</p><p>Gen was so tired he was tempted to pick her up and carry her to their room after they turned the car over to the valet. He refrained, slipping an arm around her instead. She crashed out on the bed, murmuring something about getting up in just a second to change.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t getting up again. Not that night, he knew. He managed to slip off her shoes, but he left her sleeping in her lilac halter dress.</p><p>Slipping in beside her, he drew her to him.</p><p>Close...</p><p>He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he murderer was close to them.</p><p>Who to trust? Lizzie and Zach\u2014they came from the north and certainly hadn\u2019t been around years ago. But who the hell else? Marshall\u2014who could be playing them all\u2014was from Key West. The question was, when had he been working in the north and when had he been working in the Keys?</p><p>Alex?</p><p>Key Largo was too close for comfort. He would have been in high school when the model disappeared, but Victor would have been in high school then, too. That didn\u2019t exonerate either of them.</p><p>Jay.</p><p>For that matter, Jack had been around, too.</p><p>So...hell! That left the ghost hunters in the he-could-trust-them category.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, willing himself to go to sleep. It had been a long day and he was dead tired.</p><p>Dead...</p><p>He woke with a start the next morning when Genevieve cried out.</p><p>She was sitting up, soaked and shaking.</p><p>He leapt out of bed, turned the light on and rushed around, lifting her up and into his arms.</p><p>The smell of seawater was sharp and strong.</p><p>She stared at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go back!\u201d she cried, and threw herself against him, trembling. The salt and the sea seemed to sink into his flesh, along with a stinging blast of ice-cold dread.</p><p>18</p><p>G enevieve tried hard to be reasonable\u2014especially since she couldn\u2019t explain her desperate urge to return to Key West so quickly.</p><p>She told herself that at least Thor didn\u2019t seem to be feeling repelled by her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even comment on the salty scent of the sea or the dampness that seemed to descend upon them nightly. Since he was choosing to ignore those very weird occurrences, she told herself, she could control the desire to leave long enough for them to take a motor boat out for a few hours to search for any sign of Marshall.</p><p>Despite their night, they were up early, thanks to her nightmare.</p><p>Maybe the ghost\u2019s directive had simply been meant to get them up and moving.</p><p>Thor was patient. \u201cI understand,\u201d he\u2019d said very softly, holding her as she had trembled when the woman in white and the pirates had faded into puddles around her. \u201cBut we\u2019re here. It\u2019s a long drive back. We can rent a boat, cruise around for a few hours and still be back by five. All right?\u201d</p><p>Sheerly for the fact that he hadn\u2019t gone running, she had agreed that they could take the morning. As they drove to the marina, she made phone calls. Bethany was a bit perturbed at being awakened.</p><p>She woke Jay up, too. He sounded exhausted and disgusted.</p><p>Nikki Blackhawk was the only one who sounded not only cheerful but determined. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much we\u2019ve helped so far, but a teaser ran today for the story on the Marie Josephine and Anne, Aldo and the pirates. I think Anne would be pleased to see the way Helen is handling it. And I\u2019m sure Gasparilla would like the world to know he didn\u2019t kill Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think the ghost is Anne?\u201d</p><p>At that, Nikki hesitated. \u201cI still don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way. The thing is, just as only certain people see ghosts, only certain people are either seen or acknowledged by ghosts. This woman wants you to know something. So just do what you have to do up there. I swear to you, we\u2019ll be combing the streets, along with the police, looking for Audrey.\u201d</p><p>As she hit the end-call button on her phone, Genevieve had to smile. Despite her dreams, they were certainly living in the modern world. Thor was on his phone. He had already spoken to Jack and left a message for Sheridan; he had been speaking with Brent Blackhawk while she had been talking to Nikki.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d Thor asked her.</p><p>She nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>At the public marina in Coconut Grove, Thor was able to rent the speedboat he wanted. It was a perfect day to be out on the water; the seas were calm, there was a slight breeze, and the sky was almost crystal clear. Of course, that could change quickly, but for the few hours they needed, it looked as if they would have perfect conditions.</p><p>They turned off their phones, so they wouldn\u2019t be interrupted, and headed north first, circling Key Biscayne, following the Intracoastal Waterway at a barely legal pace, then turning back. Downtown Miami was striking from a distance, the buildings towering above the ocean, all the hardships and sore spots of a major metropolitan area hidden by the distance.</p><p>Thor seemed irritated with himself as they passed marina after marina with no luck, and when he turned back, he told her, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I was certain we\u2019d find Marshall here, even though I know someone might have called in using his name.\u201d Her eyes widened with alarm, and he quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s just fine.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve was worried for Marshall, but also pleased they were turning back, because she still felt driven to return to Key West as quickly as possible.</p><p>Then Thor said, \u201cThe river.\u201d</p><p>She almost groaned aloud. Checking out the Miami River could add hours to their day.</p><p>But she forced herself to stay silent, though she was chafing inwardly, anxious to head back.</p><p>Suddenly she found herself standing, gripping the console, as they passed through a residential neighborhood that took up both banks of the river.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s Marshall\u2019s boat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Thor demanded.</p><p>\u201cRight there...at that really weathered-looking dock. Behind the house that looks as if it\u2019s gutted. Thor, that\u2019s it! I\u2019ve worked on that boat for years. That\u2019s her. I know it is. Take a look at her. She\u2019s a working dive boat, not a pleasure craft.\u201d</p><p>He cut the motor to idle, slowly steering closer.</p><p>Genevieve gasped.</p><p>There was Marshall. Sunglasses on, hands laced behind his head, he was stretched out on the deck, a bottle of Scotch by his side.</p><p>She felt fury swell inside her. Before Thor could warn her to be quiet, she cried out in anger, \u201cMarshall Miro, you son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Marshall jerked up as if yanked by the hair. He looked at Genevieve with disbelief, then confusion, and then, to her amazement, abject fear.</p><p>\u201cMarshall!\u201d she cried again.</p><p>Thor had cut the motor. They drifted closer. Genevieve didn\u2019t wait. She raced forward and leapt to the other boat.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve!\u201d Thor shouted. \u201cWait! Damn it, wait!\u201d</p><p>Marshall had leapt to his feet. He was in a pair of khaki trunks, no shirt, and she headed straight for him.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Thor yelled again. He threw a line to Marshall\u2019s boat, racing after her.</p><p>She hit Marshall. Hard, both fists pounding against his chest.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve!\u201d Thor reached her, dragging her away, before Marshall could strike back.</p><p>But Marshall clearly didn\u2019t intend to hit anyone. He didn\u2019t protest Genevieve\u2019s wild rage in any way. He edged back, insisting, \u201cI won\u2019t go back. I will not go back, do you understand? Damn it, why couldn\u2019t you just have left me alone?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve stared at him, her anger drained by the sheer astonishment that seized her. \u201cMarshall, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve been worried sick. We\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI called. I said I had business,\u201d he protested.</p><p>Marshall was a big guy, his size and musculature emphasized by his shaven head and tattoos, but despite that, he looked absolutely terrified.</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell better explain yourself better than that,\u201d Thor snarled.</p> <p>His fingers were knotted into fists at his sides, and his tone had aroused something in Marshall, too, because suddenly he was bristling, as well. The air filled with a sudden rush of testosterone. She kept her position between the two men, hoping to keep them from coming to blows.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she said, and glanced at each man in turn.</p><p>Marshall let out a long sigh, lowering his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can make you understand. I barely got out with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Thor demanded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something in the water,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cSomething that doesn\u2019t belong there. It tried to drown me,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt almost succeeded.\u201d He pointed a finger at Genevieve. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault. Why the hell couldn\u2019t you just leave me alone?\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve opened her mouth, but words wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cMarshall, is this you talking\u2014or the Scotch?\u201d Thor asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t start with the Scotch until I encountered whatever the hell is down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Thor demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Marshall said, staring at them defiantly. \u201cI never saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense,\u201d Thor said.</p> <p>\u201cYou had no right just to disappear. I thought you were one of the best men in the Keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d Marshall said, shuffling his feet.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Genevieve said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Marshall stared at her, shook his head, winced. \u201cThere was something in the water. It kept tugging at me. It dragged me under. Let me up, dragged me under again. There were weird sounds, and...shit, you can\u2019t smell in the water, but I could smell decay. It was trying to kill me. I mean it. I\u2019m not going back there...at least not for a long, long time. Not until someone finds out what it is and kills it or...exorcises it or something. Don\u2019t you understand yet? It was trying to kill me. And you brought it on, Gen. You brought it on when you went down and saw that...whatever.\u201d</p><p>Thor stared at him, his eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t blame Genevieve,\u201d he said. \u201cBlame the project, but don\u2019t blame her.\u201d He caught her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go?\u201d she echoed questioningly.</p><p>\u201cYou heard him. He\u2019s not coming back. And we have to go back. Just one word of advice, Marshall\u2014lay off the Scotch. You feel like you can handle things again, you know where we\u2019ll be. Genevieve, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They returned to their rented boat. Thor had tied on to Marshall\u2019s with so much haste he\u2019d caused some minor damage to the hull, which they would have to pay for.</p> <p>Either he didn\u2019t notice or he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He was obviously struggling to obey the speed limit as they headed back down the river. He stared straight ahead. She went to stand by him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really terrified,\u201d she murmured. She had worked with Marshall forever. She was angry, disappointed, hurt. But she still found herself defending the man who had been her boss\u2014confident, professional, assured\u2014for so many years. \u201cAnd honestly, this isn\u2019t like Marshall. I\u2019ve seen him face a million threats and I\u2019ve never seen him cave like this.\u201d</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t look at her for a moment, but when he did, he smiled ruefully. \u201cI don\u2019t care what a guy looks like. Or a woman, for that matter. We all have some point deep in our psyche where we can be afraid. In Marshall\u2019s case...who the hell knows what went on? But it isn\u2019t your fault. You didn\u2019t cause any of this.\u201d He hesitated, staring straight ahead again. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d he said. Yet, the words were like a line in a script, like something he had said over and over that no longer held any conviction. \u201cBut if there were ghosts out there...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll start over. I don\u2019t think anything intended to harm Marshall. Whatever happened, it just touched that raw edge deep inside where any human being can be vulnerable.\u201d He fell silent again for a second, then offered her another smile. \u201cHell. We found him. He\u2019s alive and well. We\u2019ll just tell the others that. That he felt he needed some personal time. That\u2019s kind of the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if something down there did try to kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Thor said simply. \u201cI do believe a flesh-and-blood murderer is out there, and because of that, we need to be...not afraid, but wary. I believe that...that there are questions that have to be answered.\u201d</p><p>She stood next to him, not replying at first. Then she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found Marshall. Now we have to find Audrey.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet. She knew he was thinking they might never find Audrey, and that, if they did, she might already be dead.</p><p>They made Genevieve\u2019s house before dark.</p><p>As they pulled into her driveway, Thor turned on his cell, which immediately began to ring.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been? I\u2019ve been trying to reach you for hours.\u201d It was Sheridan, and he sounded irritated.</p><p>\u201cDriving,\u201d Thor said flatly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read another one of the letters, and it\u2019s too damn close to what that reporter rushed ahead and insinuated in the paper. If you\u2019ve been on to something that you haven\u2019t been sharing, you are entirely outside your contractual bounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve given you everything we found,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get back down there,\u201d Sheridan said.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I have police clearance.\u201d</p><p>Sheridan let out an irritated snort. \u201cCan they cordon off the ocean? There was no reason for the dive to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA corpse is a good enough reason for me, Professor. Is there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get over here immediately?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Thor maintained his temper, grimacing at Genevieve as she arched a brow at him. \u201cI\u2019ll run by. I\u2019ll check with the police first and see if they need more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore time? It\u2019s an ocean, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Sheridan was probably right; Thor was simply in the mood to buck him.</p><p>\u201cAre you off to see Sheridan?\u201d Genevieve asked after he\u2019d hung up.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cJust go now, and then you can get back fast. I\u2019m going to call Bethany, find out what everyone is up to, see if they\u2019re meeting later for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in with you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2014I threw everyone out and locked the house,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in with you first,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>They went through the same routine they had followed the first time. Thor didn\u2019t really believe anyone was lurking inside, ready to assault Genevieve, but he had a feeling that something was brewing and it was getting closer and closer to an explosion.</p><p>Her house, as he had expected, was empty.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want to just come with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe went through the house, and I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go off without me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>She walked him back to the door, smiling. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he hesitated. He felt as if his breath locked in his throat. He wanted to hold her, to refuse to leave her. He drew her into his arms instead and kissed her tenderly. When he eased his hold, she whispered, \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>For the fact that I love you...</p><p>But he didn\u2019t say the words. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever before felt the way he did about her now. He had cared about women before, been deeply involved several times.</p><p>But he\u2019d never been in love, never felt as he did now.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m going to get moving. Get this over with. It\u2019s been a long day, but you\u2019re right. I\u2019d like to have dinner with the others, find out if anything they found out puts a new light on things. At least we can tell everyone Marshall\u2019s alive and well. In fact, you might as well get started on that right now. We probably should have called earlier. I was just so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And...hell, never mind. I can\u2019t explain it. I\u2019ll hurry.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to explain. He knew she understood. He lifted a hand to her as he walked away and slid behind the wheel once again.</p><p>She smiled and waved.</p><p>He turned the key in the ignition, then he almost turned the car back off. Something was nagging at him, but he couldn\u2019t put a finger on it.</p><p>Reluctantly, he drove away.</p><p>Genevieve watched Thor go, wondering why she had actually been anxious for him to leave.</p><p>She locked herself inside, lowering her head pensively.</p><p>She knew why.</p><p>She was going to try to summon her ghost, and he wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>How to go about it?</p><p>She should call Adam Harrison, she thought. She should call him and the others immediately, just as she had told Thor she was going to.</p><p>But she was feeling the same sense of urgency that had plagued her all day. Yes, they had found Marshall, and Marshall was okay.</p><p>And Audrey, she somehow knew, was not.</p><p>Her heart was pounding as she went to the sofa and sat, closing her eyes and doing nothing but concentrating, trying to find out if it was possible to communicate with the dead, with the woman who had sought her out.</p><p>Please, don\u2019t let Audrey be dead already, she prayed silently.</p><p>She leaned back and closed her eyes.</p><p>Tried to relax. To clear her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Easier said than done.</p><p>And so she let her thoughts free.</p><p>Help me.

He\u2019s taking some personal time. He\u2019s docked up on the Miami River. I\u2019m assuming the property belongs to a friend, or maybe he owns it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go.

You know, your friend Victor was the last one seen with that hooker.\u201d</p><p>Thor discovered he disliked Suarez. The \u201chooker\u201d\u2014even if they didn\u2019t have an identity on her\u2014deserved more in the way of respect.</p> <p>\u201cYou questioned him,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I would have held him. But the shop owner refused to press charges.\u201d He let out a strange sound of disgust. \u201cThese people\u2014\u201d he waved a hand, indicating exactly who, Thor wasn\u2019t sure \u201c\u2014they\u2019re like a closed group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not from here, I take it,\u201d Thor murmured.</p><p>\u201cNope, not me. I\u2019ve lived all over,\u201d Suarez said.</p><p>Thor was glad he didn\u2019t specify a place; he would have hated to harbor a grudge against a certain area just because of Suarez.</p><p>\u201cYep, your friend\u2019s back out on the streets, so I\u2019d beware,\u201d Suarez went on.</p><p>Beware.</p><p>\u201cI work with the man,\u201d Thor said. \u201cAnd you have no evidence against him, right?\u201d</p> <p>Suarez shrugged. \u201cAll I know is, this kind of thing has gone on before down here. That suggests the perp is someone who\u2019s been around for a while, and that fits your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fits a lot of people here,\u201d Thor said coolly. Hell, even if he thought beyond a doubt that Victor was guilty, he would have defended him against this guy.</p><p>\u201cI came in to tell you we\u2019re going back in the water tomorrow,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>Suarez shrugged. \u201cTry not to dig up any more bodies, huh?\u201d</p><p>Was he trying to be humorous?</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Detective,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>More irritated than he had been already, he set out to see Sheridan.</p><p>Please...</p><p>She could sense it, smell the sea. Something different around her. Maybe just a charge in the air at first, a surge of energy...of electricity.</p><p>Help me, please.</p><p>The feeling that someone else was with her began to grow. She took a deep breath, then another. She wasn\u2019t going to be afraid. She was going to make this work. She was going to stay with the ghost until...</p><p>She nearly rocketed off the sofa when she heard a hammering against her door.</p><p>The electricity was gone. There was no longer any sense of the sea, or of anything but emptiness surrounding her.</p><p>She swore, rising.</p><p>The hammering continued as she walked across the room to the door. She looked out through the peephole and saw Victor.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she told him, throwing open the door.</p><p>He swept past her, ignoring her words.</p><p>\u201cThose fucking detectives grilled me as if I were Ted Fucking Bundy!\u201d he exploded at her.</p><p>\u201cVictor, you can\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s their job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have a real suspect. That\u2019s why they\u2019re going after me. I\u2019ll sue. This is harassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Victor, they let you out,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he accused her.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just had to call Jay and tell him you and I put that mannequin in the garbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor, I had to. He would have spent hours investigating\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if they\u2019re not spending hours investigating right now, trying to prove I stole the damn thing,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cVictor, do you want a drink? A soda or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, I\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t know what it was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor, I\u2019m sorry, but quit acting like a two-yearold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA two-year-old? You didn\u2019t have to go through that.\u201d</p><p>He was pacing so angrily that she kept her distance from him. She had to remind herself that she\u2019d known him all her life.</p><p>\u201cWomen!\u201d he exploded next. He pointed a finger at her. \u201cAlways trouble\u2014always teasing, and the next thing you know, they want money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Victor. You\u2019re not the first guy to be taken in by a prostitute. And how can you still be angry? The poor woman is dead.\u201d</p><p>He was still pacing, acting as if he hadn\u2019t even heard her.</p><p>\u201cVictor, stop it! I\u2019m sorry, but under the circumstances, I did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she found herself sorry she hadn\u2019t gone with Thor.</p><p>How long before he returned?</p><p>A while, she thought, amazed to realize how nervous she felt.</p><p>It was suddenly as if Victor read her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s loverboy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBack any minute,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDown with the cops, probably. Reminding them I\u2019ve lived here all my life, so I could be guilty of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictor, damn it, I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped angrily. \u201cAnd instead of feeling sorry for yourself, you should be worrying about Audrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s all worry about poor Audrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the last one to see her, too,\u201d she said without thinking, then practically gasped at her own foolishness in uttering the words.</p><p>He turned on her, furious, clenching his hands at his sides.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen him so angry.</p><p>She was an idiot. She never should have opened the door to him.</p><p>\u201cI should throttle you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She froze for an instant, shocked into stillness by the menace in his voice.</p><p>How well did she really know him?</p><p>He\u2019d been angry at the prostitute.</p><p>Had he been angry with Audrey?</p><p>He\u2019d been the last to see both women.</p><p>Had he lied about the mannequin? She couldn\u2019t help but remember the sight of all those plastic body parts.</p><p>She forced herself to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a beer, and I\u2019ll get you one, too,\u201d she said. To her amazement, her voice was even. \u201cSit down. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She had absolutely no intention of returning, of course. As she started toward the back of the house, she could still hear him pacing. She ran past the kitchen and out the back door.</p><p>19</p><p>S heridan, Thor thought, was the most boring academic ever to try to make a name for himself.</p><p>It was true that the second letter gave credence to everything Genevieve had said. It had been Aldo, remembered as the lover determined to defy anyone for the love of his Anne, who had planned vengeance against the English, the ship\u2014and the woman who had spurned him.</p><p>Sheridan was still talking, but Thor barely heard him. His mind was elsewhere.</p><p>The discomfort he had been feeling was growing. If Sheridan didn\u2019t shut up in sixty seconds, he was going to make up an excuse to bolt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>His cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cThor, it\u2019s Brent Blackhawk. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Sheridan\u2019s lab.\u201d</p><p>There was a split second of silence. \u201cWhere\u2019s Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t answering her phone.\u201d</p><p>Thor\u2019s stomach tightened in fear.</p><p>\u201cMr. Thompson, perhaps we could just finish up here?\u201d Sheridan asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWe are finished,\u201d Thor said flatly, then turned on his heel and headed for the door, racing toward the parking lot while Brent continued speaking.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe in...all this,\u201d Brent said, \u201cbut you need to get to the house. Find Genevieve. I\u2019m on my way there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost in the car,\u201d Thor said, sliding into the driver\u2019s seat. His heart was pounding.</p><p>He knew before glancing to his right that he was not alone.</p><p>Josh Harrison had graduated from the back seat to the front.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be here because you\u2019re going to help me,\u201d Thor snapped.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in danger\u2014I know that,\u201d the ghost said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the killer is alive, but I don\u2019t know his every move. I just know that...hell, step on it, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenevieve, what the hell?\u201d</p><p>She was hiding in the midst of her hibiscus bushes when she heard Victor come out the back door.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve? Where the hell are you?\u201d he called. She heard him muttering, \u201cNow she\u2019s gone frigging nuts, too.\u201d</p><p>She knew he couldn\u2019t see her. Darkness was falling, and though it seemed to come slowly at first, she knew it would soon be night.</p><p>She bit her lip, wondering if she was being ridiculous. She loved Victor like a brother, but...</p><p>He had been with the prostitute.</p><p>He had been the one to walk Audrey home. And now Audrey was gone.</p><p>She stayed where she was. She wasn\u2019t going back in the house. The killer was probably someone they didn\u2019t even know, but still...</p><p>She felt ill and she didn\u2019t believe Audrey had taken off of her own volition, not like Marshall.</p><p>She had to get to town, back to the resort, she decided. As long as she was in a crowd, nothing could happen to her.</p><p>She regretted running out of the house without her cell phone, but she wasn\u2019t going back for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nor did she dare take the street in front of her house. What if he came after her?</p><p>She hesitated, then turned and climbed over the fence to her neighbor\u2019s yard. As she did, she felt a strange chill.</p><p>She thought about the times she could have sworn she was being watched, that she was being followed.</p><p>Someone she knew was the killer.</p> <p>The knowledge washed over her with complete certainty.</p><p>Victor?</p><p>Her heart and mind fought the possibility.</p><p>She cut through people\u2019s backyards at first, disturbed to feel there were eyes in the night, that she was even now being watched\u2014being stalked.</p><p>That was sheer idiocy, she assured herself. She didn\u2019t know how anyone could have possibly followed her, the way she had left, the path she was taking.</p> <p>She eased back onto Duval Street, feeling like a paranoid fool. There were people everywhere. She hadn\u2019t been followed. She almost laughed aloud at herself as she hurried on toward the resort, then sobered when she realized that if she should run into Victor alone now, she really would be scared. She\u2019d walked out on him. He was going to be more furious than ever.</p><p>She took the half turn toward the water and the resort, her strides long and confident. It was when she reached the parking lot that the odd feeling returned.</p><p>She found herself pausing. The night had gone full dark. Streetlights created shadows under every leaf and branch. Clouds passed over the moon.</p><p>Why am I standing in the parking lot, shivering? she asked herself.</p><p>She realized that she didn\u2019t want to take the overgrown path to the tiki bar area and the bungalows.</p><p>She managed to make herself move at last. She hurried toward her own cottage, then paused.</p> <p>There was a figure on the little porch, seated and hunched over. She couldn\u2019t tell who it was.</p><p>She started toward the bar, but there wasn\u2019t a soul at the tables. Clint wasn\u2019t even there, though the place was entirely set up. As she hesitated, she heard her name being called. Someone was coming through the parking lot in her wake.</p><p>Had she been followed?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be seen, didn\u2019t want to be caught alone, but she couldn\u2019t go to her own cottage. Silently, she hurried across the sand, heading for the docks.</p><p>She avoided the pier where the dive boats were berthed, choosing to move along the other. Jay\u2019s boat was there, as was Jack\u2019s.</p><p>To her amazement, Jay Gonzalez was on his boat, though he hadn\u2019t seen her. His head was bowed as he sat in the captain\u2019s chair, busy at something.</p><p>He was a cop, for God\u2019s sake. She should just go ask him for help.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to see anyone. Not until she saw lots of someones.</p> <p>She kept moving then, certain he would look up if she moved back to land but all too aware that she was almost dead in front of him.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t see her, he was so completely absorbed in his task.</p><p>As she stared at him, she realized what he was doing.</p><p>Knotting and unknotting a rope, over and over again.</p><p>Her heart hammered; she needed to get past him. She hurried on, terrified that at any moment he would look up.</p><p>Her door was closed, but it wasn\u2019t locked when Thor arrived.</p><p>Brent Blackhawk was running toward the house just as Thor got there. He shot Brent a frantic look, then burst into the house.</p><p>To his amazement, Victor was there, sprawled on the sofa, drinking a beer.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Genevieve?\u201d Thor demanded, striding forward and catching him by the shirt, dragging him up from the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you?\u201d Victor cried out, torn between trying to wrench away and taking a swing.</p><p>\u201cHey! Take it easy, both of you!\u201d Blackhawk ordered. \u201cThor let him go.\u201d</p><p>Thor eased his hold on Victor, who was staring daggers at him, teeth clenched in anger.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Victor shook his head, looking worried. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted sickly. \u201cI was hoping she\u2019d come back. I didn\u2019t mean to, but I guess I scared her. I\u2014\u201d He broke off in fear when he saw the murderous look that entered Thor\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Brent forced himself between the two men. \u201cThe important thing is that we find her,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying, I don\u2019t know. She said she was going to get me a beer, then she ran out the back door. I called her, but I didn\u2019t want to chase her and really scare her, so I figured I\u2019d wait here for her to get back.\u201d</p><p>Thor realized he was still tense; his muscles were knotted and he wanted to shake Victor until he produced Genevieve.</p><p>\u201cGo easy on him. I think he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d It wasn\u2019t Brent Blackhawk who spoke, but Josh Harrison, who had walked in and was standing behind Victor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you know about it?\u201d Thor demanded irritably.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you talking to?\u201d Victor demanded.</p><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d Josh said indignantly to Thor.</p><p>\u201cYou shut up,\u201d Thor muttered.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but Gen is my friend, too,\u201d Brent said.</p><p>Something in his manner alarmed Victor. \u201cYou think something is really wrong, don\u2019t you? Look, I swear to you, I\u2019m not the killer.\u201d</p><p>Thor took a step back, pulling out his cell phone. The killer was someone they knew. Someone who had been in the Keys a long time.</p><p>Not Marshall. He was still in Miami.</p><p>So assuming Victor was telling the truth...</p><p>Alex?</p><p>Not from Key West, though close enough.</p><p>Still, in his mind, only two suspects were left.</p><p>Both had been old enough to kill when the first woman went missing. One might have done away with his own spouse.</p><p>He dialed Jay Gonzalez\u2019s cell phone. No answer.</p><p>Brent Blackhawk was staring at him. \u201cShe probably went to the resort, where she would expect to find lots of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI bet she\u2019s having a drink at the tiki bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Thor said.</p><p>She had made it past Jay unseen when she heard the strange noise, a kind of thunk. She didn\u2019t know what it was, and she didn\u2019t want to know. She just wanted to get away.</p><p>Ten feet to Jack\u2019s boat. She ran along the pier and took a flying leap, landing hard on the deck of the beat-up old fishing boat. She ducked down, waiting, certain Jay was somewhere, that he was coming after her. He\u2019d seen her and had no doubt paused only to get a weapon.</p><p>She waited, her heart thundering. And waited some more.</p><p>And no one came for her.</p><p>Jack, thank you for docking your boat here, she thought.</p><p>She closed her eyes tightly. Still waiting. Still afraid to move, even afraid to breathe. Then she opened her eyes.</p><p>She felt a soft tremor in her heart, but not of fear.</p><p>The ghost was back.</p><p>Just as she saw the beautiful woman in white, she heard the noise. It was muffled, something knocking against the bottom of the boat.</p><p>The ghost stared at her with her huge sad eyes.</p><p>Beware.</p><p>Help...she needs help.</p><p>She?</p><p>The noise again. Staring at her unearthly friend, Genevieve slowly rose. There was no one on the dock. The moon shone down through a break in the clouds. The noise came again.</p><p>She nearly tripped on one of the oars for the little dinghy as she moved carefully to the small cabin. There was barely any light at all there, but it was enough for Genevieve to see that no one was there. Her heart was thundering.</p><p>She?</p><p>Audrey?</p><p>She realized there was a hatch offering access to the engine, just at the base of the stepladder that led from the deck to the cabin. A massive slide bolt held the hatch door in place. She fell to her knees and realized it wasn\u2019t even closed. She struggled with the door, which seemed to be stuck.</p><p>She struggled again, tugging with all her might.</p><p>It gave suddenly, and she fell back.</p><p>In the darkness, she didn\u2019t at first recognize the figure that rose from the bilge.</p><p>\u201cGen!\u201d</p><p>She tried desperately to scramble to her feet, but she was only halfway up when an oar\u2014partner to the one she had nearly tripped over on the deck\u2014came crashing down on her skull.</p><p>Bethany was at the tiki bar.</p><p>Thor was sure he scared her half to death when he rushed up behind her, and grabbed her anxiously by the shoulder. For the rest of her life, she would probably be sure he was crazy.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Alex said, walking up behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Thor demanded.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d he said, gesturing. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where the hell anyone was and I was getting lonely, then I saw Bethany get here. So I came over. I did see Jay earlier. He was heading out to his boat. It didn\u2019t look like he wanted company, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis boat?\u201d Thor said.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d Bethany said, pointing. \u201cA bunch of cops keep their boats here.\u201d</p><p>Thor was already running, the others behind him. Suddenly he stopped, not knowing which boat. Bethany nearly crashed into him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2014she\u2019s called My Lady.\u201d</p><p>He sped forward, leaping from the dock to the deck of the boat. There was no one there, but lengths of rope were strewn everywhere.</p><p>\u201cGenevieve!\u201d he bellowed out.</p><p>There was nothing. No sound.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Alex swore. \u201cThere!\u201d</p><p>Thor looked into the water. A man\u2019s body was floating, facedown.</p><p>He dived in, Blackhawk behind him. Catching hold of the man, he flipped him; with Blackhawk\u2019s help, he quickly dragged him to the side of My Lady.</p><p>Bethany and Alex were there to help drag him up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jay. He\u2019s not breathing,\u201d Bethany said as Thor and Brent pulled themselves from the water.</p><p>Alex already had Jay stretched out on his back. \u201cBethany, dial 911. Fast.\u201d He ripped off Jay\u2019s sodden shirt, falling to his knees, ready to perform CPR.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a knot on his head the size of an emu egg,\u201d Brent commented.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d Thor murmured, hunkering down. He looked around. There was an empty berth next to My Lady. And the lines hadn\u2019t been untied; they had been severed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat boat docks there?\u201d he demanded, taking Bethany roughly by the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cUm...oh, Jack\u2019s old fishing boat,\u201d Bethany said, shivering, still in shock, staring at Jay\u2019s seemingly lifeless body.</p><p>\u201cGet him on the dock!\u201d Thor ordered. \u201cNow!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m doing CPR,\u201d Alex protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is a speedboat. Get off it!\u201d Thor ordered. He bent down and lifted Jay himself, gritting his teeth, half hating himself.</p><p>But he needed the boat.</p><p>And for Jay, those few seconds wouldn\u2019t make any difference.</p><p>\u201cTell the cops. Tell them to get a boat out on the reef fast,\u201d Thor ordered over his shoulder, racing for the helm. \u201cAnd keep up the CPR, no matter what, until help gets here.\u201d</p> <p>Alex lifted a hand in acknowledgment. Bethany hurried to his side at the dock, dropping down beside him, then looked up at Thor.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. Genevieve....\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t reply.</p><p>The key was in the ignition. He turned it, praying.</p><p>Beside him, Brent turned on the lights.</p><p>\u201cYou drive, I\u2019ll look,\u201d he said simply.</p> <p>The powerful engine roared instantly to life.</p><p>Thor blessed the cop he had suspected for keeping the boat he never used anymore in good running order.</p><p>Genevieve was aware of the movement of the boat, the rush of the water, the heat thrown off by the engine. She blinked desperately, trying to move.</p><p>She felt a body next to her.</p><p>Panic seized her. She was trapped in the darkness with a dead body.</p><p>Audrey!</p><p>Oh, God, Audrey was dead....</p><p>She started to scream, but it didn\u2019t matter. She couldn\u2019t even hear herself over the roar of the motor. She fought for calm. She was still alive, and she desperately wanted to somehow stay that way.</p> <p>But she might as well have been paralyzed.</p><p>Her wrists had been bound behind her back, and her ankles were tied, as well. Realizing her situation, she fought a nauseating wave of panic. When she had finally gained a grip on her sanity, she realized the body wedged next to her own was still warm.</p><p>\u201cAudrey?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There was no response. She didn\u2019t know if Audrey was alive or dead. She only knew they were both in serious trouble.</p><p>She tried taking a deep breath, but her stomach turned at the stench of motor oil. She coughed, her lungs ripping in agony. She bit her lip and began working at the ropes binding her.</p><p>Jack. Good God, Jack was the killer.</p><p>It hardly seemed to matter. She was numb.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get away with it. Not this time. Thor would have returned to the house. He would look for her....</p><p>He might find Victor and beat him to a pulp, but he would still keep looking for her.</p><p>Except he wouldn\u2019t know where to look.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think that way. She kept struggling with the ropes, cursing the fact that Jack was an expert seaman and knew how to tie a knot.</p><p>Despite that, she forced herself to work steadily at her bindings. As long as she worked at them, she had a chance.</p><p>She had become so fixed on her task that she didn\u2019t even notice at first when the motor cut off.</p><p>Then she froze.</p><p>A second later, the hatch opened. \u201cGen, you came to. I\u2019m sorry. I should have hit you a lot harder, saved you the panic, but when you think about it, it\u2019s your own fault. You started this. You\u2019re the one who brought it to light. You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m going to have to keep going tonight after I...well, let\u2019s not go into that now. It\u2019s too bad, though. I really love Key West.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reach for her first, but bent down to lift Audrey from the hold. He laid her out like a rag doll. Audrey\u2019s hair was plastered to her head. Her clothing was drenched.</p><p>\u201cStill warm,\u201d Jack said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Genevieve said, finding she had no voice at first. \u201cJack, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t take me for an idiot. Do you know what I really am? A hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hero?\u201d</p><p>He stood in the cabin, staring down at her, his hands on his hips and laughed. \u201cImagine me with a red cape, honey. I\u2019m an avenger. Those girls were running around with their short skirts and bursting cleavage, taunting men\u2014and giving the clap and crabs and AIDS to guys the whole time. They had to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, the girl years ago...when I was a kid. She wasn\u2019t a prostitute\u2014she was a model.\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter before dragging her out to lie half on top of Audrey. She gritted her teeth against the painful way he twisted her arm.</p><p>\u201cModel? That\u2019s what she wanted people to think. That little whore was getting her room, her food, her photographs\u2014all of it by hopping from bed to bed. I knew her, knew her tricks. And then, when I helped her out, did she want to pay up?\u201d</p><p>Genevieve tried to breathe, thinking furiously that she had to keep him talking as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cShe was the first?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst\u2014and only\u2014for many years. Then, after a while, there were a few others. That little hussy who came down here last year, she was number eight. But I only punished those who deserved to be punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, for a minute, Gen.\u201d He rolled her over, reached down and lifted Audrey up.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jack, wait!\u201d she cried.</p><p>He turned, one step up the ladder. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll let you two go together.\u201d</p><p>He was gone. She heard Audrey\u2019s body land topside.</p><p>Then he was back.</p><p>\u201cJack, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He hunkered down by her as if truly concerned, fingering the skull and crossbones in his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand, Gen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey isn\u2019t a prostitute! And neither am I.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, not looking at her. \u201cGen, you started everything when you thought you saw a ghost in the water,\u201d he told her. He actually sounded truly sorry. Her heart took flight as she prayed she could talk him out of his intent.</p><p>\u201cJack, I still don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cGen, you thought you saw a woman. Then a dead woman popped up. I was the one who tried to scare you off with the mannequin, you know. It was Victor\u2019s idea, but I convinced him it was idiotic. I only meant to scare you\u2014to make you stop. Didn\u2019t work, though,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cAnd then there you were, spouting off about different bodies. And Audrey! Her and her so-called ghost hunters. I had to shut her up.\u201d He grinned suddenly. \u201cDon\u2019t you go kidding yourself. She worked hard to stay alive this long. Real hard. She knew how to pay up. It\u2019s almost too bad she has to die, but that\u2019s the way it has to be. And you, Gen, I\u2019m so sorry. You were always the sweetest kid. And so pretty, too. You know, I remember when you were a kid and you used to come see me. I\u2019d tried to make you feel better when the boys teased you for being so tall, calling you an Amazon. Remember how I used to tell you it was going to be okay? That you were going to be a real beauty and they\u2019d all be sorry. By the time you were twelve, you\u2019d proved me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jack. Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, honey. No more time. I\u2019ve got to get moving. I\u2019m going to the Bahamas. I know some people there who will be thrilled to help me out. I\u2019ve uncovered a few treasures of my own, you know, diving this area. Hell, we didn\u2019t need Sheridan and all his charts. I\u2019ve been picking up pieces from that ship for years.\u201d</p><p>He stood, reaching for her. She shrank from his touch.</p><p>\u201cGen, I told you, I wouldn\u2019t do this if I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it, Jack,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>She landed on the deck next to Audrey.</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer at first. She realized he had two heavy canvas bags of ballast ready. He started tying one to the ropes around Audrey\u2019s ankles.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Jack?\u201d she demanded, trying to divert him.</p><p>He kept working while he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll let you pick. Who goes in first, you or Audrey?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. She still couldn\u2019t believe it. Jack! He\u2019d been like an uncle to them, a friend, someone who had taught them, stood by them.</p><p>\u201cJack, if you\u2019re running to the Bahamas, anyway, there\u2019s no need for this,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there is. I have to slow your boyfriend down.\u201d He had hunkered down beside her and started humming as he tied the second bag to the ropes at her ankles.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThor. He\u2019s on his way now. I reckon that\u2019s Jay\u2019s boat he\u2019s coming in.\u201d</p><p>He was staring out at the dark horizon. She could hear, above the slapping of the waves against the hull, the rising sound of a motor.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d she began, then broke off. Staring past him, she could see the ghost. The woman in white.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone. The pirates were aligned beside her.</p><p>Her heart sank.</p><p>Beware.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Help me!</p><p>This time she was the one crying the words, in her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You seeing ghosts again, Gen? Jeez, who\u2019d have thought you, of all people, would be the one to go off the deep end.\u201d He laughed. \u201cHell, is there a deep end in the ocean? Okay, you won\u2019t choose, so I will. Audrey first!\u201d</p><p>He bent down, scooping Audrey up. He threw her overboard, then picked up the canvas bag of ballast he\u2019d tied to her feet and threw that overboard after her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Jack, no!\u201d</p><p>She fought as much as she could as he reached for her. She was still dimly aware of the ghosts. They had moved, congregating together, the woman in white giving the directions.</p><p>They were moving toward the helm. They seemed to be...</p><p>She saw the key fall from the ignition.</p><p>Success, she thought.</p><p>But not in time to save her.</p><p>Jack picked her up, heedless of both the ghostly activity and her fierce squirming. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re as slippery as an eel,\u201d he complained. Then he laughed again. \u201cLook at it this way. You already think you know some of the people you\u2019re going to be joining. And since you\u2019re in love, you can come back and haunt Thor until the end of his days.\u201d He roared with laughter at that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He threw her over the rail.</p><p>For a minute she was dangling from the hull, kept from hitting the water by the bag of ballast.</p><p>Then she saw him lift the bag and throw it.</p> <p>The water seemed very cold and dark as it closed over her head.</p><p>They were still a distance from Jack\u2019s boat when Thor felt his heart stop.</p><p>There was a splash, and a burst of silver as the moonlight caught the droplets of water that rose in the wake of the sound. Another splash, another, then another.</p><p>He swore, revving the motor higher. Blackhawk stood silently at his side.</p><p>How long?</p> <p>He was dimly aware that the other boat wasn\u2019t moving. As they closed in, he could see Jack at the helm. He should have been long gone.</p><p>But as much as he wanted to kill Jack, Thor couldn\u2019t spare a second. He nearly capsized Jay\u2019s boat, bringing it to such an abrupt halt, sending it spinning.</p><p>He threw himself into the water. How long had she been down? How long could she survive? She was a diver, in excellent condition, but how much time would that buy her?</p><p>Thor was aware that Blackhawk had followed him in. But the water was all but black at night, barely illuminated a few feet down by the moon and the lights from the boat.</p><p>He was amazed, when, almost immediately, he came upon a body. He pulled his knife from his pocket and groped blindly for the rope holding the still form to the weight. He slit the rope, jackknifed his legs toward the surface. They were no more than forty feet down, but it felt as if he were rising forever.</p><p>He broke the surface, gasping for air. \u201cGenevieve?\u201d</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t Genevieve. It was Audrey, and she was blue and limp.</p><p>Blackhawk burst from the water at his side, gasping desperately for breath. He swam hard against the light chopping waves, grasping Audrey. For a split second Thor hesitated, his heart sinking. How much time did he have left? And how the hell was Blackhawk going to get Audrey\u2014or her earthly remains\u2014aboard an unanchored boat?</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Blackhawk roared.</p><p>It was all he needed.</p><p>She loved the water.</p><p>She had loved it all her life.</p><p>And, she thought, as she pitched downward, dragged by the heavy weight, she was going to die in it.</p><p>She could see nothing. The moon didn\u2019t penetrate this deep. Her wrists were bound behind her back, and she was also bound to the weight.</p> <p>They had moved the key, she thought. Somehow, the ghosts had moved the key. Jack\u2019s boat was stationary. He wasn\u2019t going to get away.</p><p>Would she even know or care once she was dead?</p><p>Would Thor kill the man, or would he die by lethal injection? Or would he get away?</p><p>Jack was a serial killer. He didn\u2019t even know exactly how many victims he had sent to a watery grave. She still could hardly believe it.</p><p>She continued working furiously at the rope binding her wrists. How long could she hold her breath?</p><p>Four minutes. She\u2019d gone as long as four minutes once, she reminded herself. And she was working her hands free. She could feel herself making progress.</p><p>Her lungs were already burning.</p><p>At first he could see, but then darkness became complete as he plunged deeper. Desperation filled his heart and mind. He hit the bottom. Searched...</p><p>Hopelessness, bleak and debilitating, seized him.</p><p>And then he felt it.</p><p>Like a featherlight touch. A hand...guiding him.</p><p>Was he dying himself?</p><p>Suddenly there was a stronger light penetrating the water. At first he thought it had been sent from heaven. Then he realized that Brent had found a floodlight on Jay\u2019s boat and aimed it into the water for him.</p><p>But that touch...</p><p>He looked.</p><p>And he could see her.</p><p>She was blond. Beautiful. With huge blue eyes. And she was leading him.</p><p>He followed and there was Genevieve.</p><p>She was alive. She had freed her hands. She was fighting desperately with the rope that tied her to the weight. He shot forward, his own lungs burning, cut the rope and grabbed her by the shoulders, then kicked with all his power, shooting them toward the surface.</p><p>They broke the water gasping. Genevieve started to cough. He took her in a life-saving hold and kicked hard for Jay\u2019s boat, which had crashed into Jack\u2019s.</p><p>Gasping for breath, Genevieve managed a hoarse whisper. \u201cAudrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackhawk has her,\u201d he assured her. He reached Jay\u2019s boat and grabbed onto the small dive platform at the rear.</p><p>It was then that Genevieve tried to scream. She managed only a croak, but it warned him.</p><p>Brent was bent over Audrey, and Jack was approaching him, one of his deadly oars in hand.</p><p>\u201cBlackhawk!\u201d Thor roared.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare release Genevieve, sure she couldn\u2019t possibly have the strength of a kitten left. But she did.</p><p>She grasped the dive platform.</p><p>Thor was amazed at his own strength as he hurled himself up.</p><p>Brent turned in time, ducking the blow.</p><p>Thor charged.</p><p>Jack turned to swing, but he barely caught Thor in the upper arm before Thor tackled him and shoved him hard against the helm.</p><p>Genevieve was staggering up; she made it far enough to sit on the platform, though she looked as if she were going to slip back in. Thor turned his attention back to Jack, who bellowed and thrust hard against Thor. The two of them staggered in a ghastly dance, then crashed against the starboard rail of the boat.</p><p>Jack flipped out his knife and Thor realized then he had lost his own, dropping it after freeing Genevieve.</p><p>Jack lunged at him. He ducked, but Jack lunged again. Brent Blackhawk was reaching for the oar. Jack saw him and darted toward the dive platform, catching Genevieve just as she pulled herself fully aboard.</p><p>\u201cGot ya now,\u201d Jack taunted. There was blood pouring from the man\u2019s mouth. He\u2019d probably broken a tooth in the tackle.</p><p>But he had Genevieve. And a knife.</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019re insane. Thing is, I don\u2019t care. If you put a single scratch on her,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will kill you in a way that will teach you agony you\u2019ve never even begun to imagine.\u201d</p><p>Jack started to laugh, then began to cough as the blood choked him.</p><p>Genevieve cried out in rage, kicking him squarely in the groin. He bellowed and doubled over, his hold easing. Thor stepped forward, wrenching Genevieve far from the other man\u2019s grasp. He threw her behind him and was ready to rage forward again like a maddened bull.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Blackhawk cried.</p><p>He did.</p><p>Because he saw what Blackhawk saw.</p><p>They were coming from the water. Two of them...three, four...five...six.</p><p>Pirates. Tattered. Decaying. A gold tooth gleaming here. A bleached white bone sticking through a ragged sleeve there.</p><p>Sightless eyes in empty sockets staring...</p><p>They surrounded Jack, who began to scream as he was grabbed by ghostly hands.</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes widened in horror, and he screamed out in an agony of terror.</p><p>\u201cStop! God, help me, stop!\u201d</p><p>His body began to tilt as his bony assailants pressed at him. Then he, and they, went overboard.</p><p>There was dead silence on the boat for a minute. Absolute stillness.</p><p>Then they rushed for the rail.</p><p>Jack surfaced and he screamed again as a bony hand emerged, grabbed him, and he went down for the last time.</p><p>They were stunned, just staring. Then Genevieve swallowed audibly and looked at Thor.</p><p>\u201cAudrey!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Brent shook himself back to reality and responded. \u201cShe\u2019s breathing, and she has a pulse. Just barely. God knows what she went through. She was his captive for days. But I radioed for help. The police are on the way.\u201d</p><p>Genevieve took a deep breath of relief, then turned to stare at Thor.</p><p>\u201cDid...did you see...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply. And he took her into his arms, shaking.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>I t was strange, Thor thought. Whereas Josh Harrison appeared solid and real, Anne was gossamer.</p><p>He had gone outside, needing to see the night sky and feel the breeze. There were too many people inside, he thought, staring out at the ocean.</p><p>Neither he nor Genevieve had lost their love for the sea, and they had returned to the Marie Josephine project. It was their willingness to go back after nearly losing their lives that had made an impact on Marshall.</p><p>That, or maybe Gen herself, talking to him for hours, convincing him that if there were spirits in the ocean, they\u2019d been trying to tell him something, not kill him.</p><p>Of course, they never mentioned ghosts themselves. What had happened that night out on the water remained between Genevieve, Blackhawk and himself.</p><p>Victor and Genevieve had patched up their differences. Genevieve had been buying Victor apology dinners ever since.</p><p>As for the project, not even Jack had known where to find the bulk of the treasure, but Genevieve had found a large section of the hull. The vacuuming equipment had been brought in, and a chest filled with treasure had been found.</p><p>It was with Adam, Bethany and the Blackhawks that he and Genevieve had pieced together the most important discovery, and that had been before the bitter end for Jack. Genevieve believed that Anne had needed the world to know that Aldo had been her murderer. In Genevieve, she had seen someone with the strength to help her, as well as the spirits of the girls who\u2019d shared her watery grave over the years.</p><p>As for the pirates, they had apparently admired Anne, who, in her captivity\u2014that time in which she had fallen in love with Gasparilla and he had apparently returned her devotion\u2014must have been kind, charming and engaging.</p><p>Perhaps they had guarded the treasure they had never stolen in life. Perhaps they had merely stayed behind to help her find justice.</p><p>Audrey had gotten well quickly, though. She\u2019d refused to discuss her ordeal with them. She had done what she\u2019d needed to to stay alive as long as possible. The only one she\u2019d been willing to talk to was Jay.</p><p>They had spent time recuperating together, and she\u2019d helped him put together his case against Jack. Then they had surprised everyone by flying off to Vegas and eloping. They still seemed incredibly happy.</p><p>He and Gen had opted for a more traditional wedding. Well, traditional, by Key West standards, anyway.</p><p>His bride had been beautiful in white\u2014but shoeless. They\u2019d been married on the beach at sunset, only a few hours ago, with Father Bellamy presiding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bethany, Victor and Alex had been half smashed before the wedding had begun, and they had cried throughout, hugging one another. A difficult feat, since Bethany had been the maid of honor and the other two had served as ushers. But Lizzie and Zach\u2014who had taken work in Australia\u2014had flown back for the wedding and done their best to keep the others in control. Everybody from the project had been there\u2014Adam, Brent, Nikki, Marshall. Something had grown between them, a friendship that would endure.</p><p>But friendship or no, he\u2019d needed some air, only as soon as he\u2019d walked out he\u2019d seen Josh, leaning against the back porch rail, with Anne beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there. I don\u2019t see you,\u201d Thor groaned.</p> <p>\u201cI am here, tough guy, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Thor looked at Anne. She was still so skittish, so afraid....</p><p>He trembled inside.</p><p>Where would he be now, without her? Without her and her band of pirates?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said softly, as she began to fade away, her work done. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to go in.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling like a fool, he waved goodbye to the ghosts, wondering if he would ever see them again.</p><p>Inside, he ran right into Victor. The music was high, laughter in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think she went upstairs, looking for you?\u201d Victor said.</p><p>Thor took the stairs two at a time. Gen was in their room, standing at the window, looking down at Duval Street.</p><p>She turned, smiled.</p> <p>His heart fluttered. Her hair was long, rich, waving with lustrous highlights against the black satin of her silk dress. Her eyes...God, he was in love with her eyes, the sound of her voice...</p><p>\u201cHey you.\u201d She walked toward him, catching his tie, pulling him close, kissing his lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her, kissing her back.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Listen, I know you think I\u2019m crazy\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>He pressed a finger against her lips. \u201cI believe,\u201d he whispered very softly. \u201cI believe. And now that that\u2019s settled, please just shut up so I can kiss my wife properly.\u201d</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>He did, too.</p><p>Outside, the palms swayed and the breeze blew, and there might have been a hint of delighted ghostly laughter, fading into the night.</p>  </body></html>"]
