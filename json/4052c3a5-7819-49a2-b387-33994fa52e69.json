Zane didn\u2019t know him well enough to read him, and he wasn\u2019t interested in trying. He couldn\u2019t get past his own butterflies to analyze his companion\u2019s state of mind.</p><p>It had been six months since they\u2019d watched Sidewinder walk down the gangway to their plane. Six long, lonely months of confusing feelings and dread whenever the phone rang. Zane had woken every morning expecting to hear horrible news about the men he considered friends, and not a day had passed that Ty hadn\u2019t been on his mind.</p><p>The call Zane had lived in fear of receiving had never come, thank God. In fact he\u2019d only received a single satellite call from Ty in all the time he\u2019d been gone, the one telling him when they\u2019d be coming home. It had been like a drop of water to a dying man, and coming just weeks before Christmas, the best present Zane could have asked for.</p> <p>Kelly had admitted to much the same type of existence as they\u2019d driven there from the airport. Every day a struggle to keep his mind on something besides the fact that he wasn\u2019t there to help protect them.</p><p>\u201cYou nervous?\u2019 Zane asked him.</p><p>Kelly took a deep breath, nodding. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on this side of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it any easier on the other side?\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced up at Zane, shrugging. \u201cNot really. You sit there with all your buddies, men who\u2019ve been your world for months, years. You think about the people at home, wonder if they\u2019ve missed you. Pray they\u2019ve missed you. Your mind cycles through everything that could have changed, and the nerves start building. Even the smallest thing can hit you like a hammer when you come out. I\u2019ve seen guys break down and cry because their wives got a haircut.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat why you made me shave?\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned and nodded as the first buses began to pull in. Nerves skittered through Zane as tired Marines in rumpled uniforms began to trickle into the tented areas where family awaited. Kelly inhaled sharply. Zane\u2019s hand began to tremble. \u201cGod,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cThe first ship holds seventeen hundred men. We might be here awhile,\u201d Kelly warned.</p><p>And they were. An hour and a half later, they were still standing behind the roped-off area, witnessing reunions, waiting. Zane was watching a man embrace two blonde toddlers when Kelly slapped his arm to get his attention. Zane scanned the crowd almost frantically, searching for whomever Kelly had caught sight of.</p><p>He only saw one familiar face, and it wasn\u2019t the one he was desperate to lay eyes on. \u201cI thought they\u2019d be out together,\u201d Zane mumbled. He glanced to his side, but Kelly was gone. He\u2019d bolted and hopped the barrier, taking off at a dead sprint through the celebratory crowd.</p><p>Zane laughed as Kelly cut a swath toward the unsuspecting Marine. Nick was striding through the crowd of young sailors and Marines, nodding as they saluted him in passing. He looked long and lean in his uniform, hair shorn close and face clean shaven. He had more stripes on his arm than Zane remembered seeing in photos, and he walked with a change in his gait, like he might have been hiding a limp.</p> <p>Zane hustled after Kelly, but he couldn\u2019t keep up. People parted for Kelly, sliding out of his way like they knew he wasn\u2019t going to let them slow him down just to be polite. He pushed off a few people receiving hugs, hopped around a few children too tiny to get out of the way. It was probably those erratic movements that caused Nick to spot him in the crowd.</p><p>A smile graced Nick\u2019s tanned face, and he braced himself at the last minute as Kelly leapt at him and tackled him to the ground. They disappeared from Zane\u2019s sight briefly, and Zane hurried to join them.</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t seem to care who saw them, or what anyone thought of his lack of decorum, or even what Nick thought. He hugged Nick hard. Nick flailed under him, trapped between Kelly and the seabag still on his back. He finally wrapped his arms around Kelly and stopped struggling, laughing instead.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, if that\u2019s the welcome wagon, I think I\u2019ll walk home,\u201d Digger said as he approached. He shook Zane\u2019s hand and patted him on the shoulder. Then he dumped his seabag at Zane\u2019s feet and threw himself on top of Kelly.</p><p>A moment later, Owen appeared from the sea of faces and launched himself at the other three, wrapping his arms around all of them as they formed a dog pile in the middle of the crowd. Zane almost felt sorry for Nick being on the bottom. Almost.</p><p>He glanced up, scanning the crowd for the only person he desperately needed to see. He was searching so hard that he almost skipped right over him, standing just a few yards away and gazing at Zane with a smile.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught. \u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Ty said with a bigger grin. He was tanned and bearded, which was why Zane hadn\u2019t immediately recognized him. His hair was longer than when he\u2019d left too, obvious even under the hat he wore, and he was far leaner. But his hazel eyes still glinted like they always did.</p> <p>Zane started toward him, not caring who might see or what the consequences would be. Ty jogged the rest of the distance and threw himself into Zane\u2019s arms. Zane buried his face in Ty\u2019s neck, relishing the warmth and solidity of the man. He breathed in his scent, even though it wasn\u2019t the one Zane usually associated with Ty. It was still him.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Zane gasped finally. He tightened his arms around Ty, clutching at his uniform.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Ty whispered in his ear. His hands gripped at Zane\u2019s hair, and he stood on the toes of his boots so they could cling tighter to each other.</p><p>The thought of a kiss never entered Zane\u2019s mind. He didn\u2019t even think about stepping back so he could look at Ty\u2019s face, the face he\u2019d seen in his dreams and forced himself to remember every night as he lay awake. He just squeezed his eyes closed and held on to Ty like he might be taken away again, clutched at him as he would grasp for his very soul in a pit of a thousand reaching hands.</p><p>Ty held to him the same way.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t breathe!\u201d a pitiful voice finally called out, interrupting the joyous reunion.</p><p>Ty pulled back only enough for him and Zane to glance over at the tangle of limbs and laughter that were their friends. Nick was trying to extricate himself from the bottom, with little luck.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d he muttered as he finally looked Zane in the eyes and grinned widely. He took Zane\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Zane returned the smile, only to have it ruined as Ty pressed their mouths together, kissing him for all the months they\u2019d missed. It was usually at this stage of a dream that Zane would wake up, alone and so heartsick he thought he might cry. But the kiss lingered on. Ty\u2019s hands on his face were still warm and solid. His beard was scratchy at Zane\u2019s cheek. He was real. This was real, and Zane wasn\u2019t about to let it slip away.</p><p>He grabbed Ty and dipped him backward, kissing him for all he was worth. He heard the distant snap of a few cameras, the tears of joy from other reunions, tiny voices welcoming their mothers and fathers home, the muffled gripes from Nick to let him the fuck off the ground so he could at least try to be dignified about coming home. He felt Ty smiling against his lips and holding on to his neck so he wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>It was the most satisfying rush of emotion Zane had ever experienced. Better than any high.</p><p>When he finally stood them back up and let go of Ty, they were both breathless and laughing. Zane couldn\u2019t keep his hands off Ty, wanting to maintain contact, wanting to reassure himself that this wasn\u2019t a dream.</p><p>Ty took his hand and didn\u2019t let go. \u201cYou look amazing,\u201d he said as he leered at Zane.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d Zane ran a hand over Ty\u2019s shoulder and the new insignia there. \u201cCaptain Grady, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain.\u201d Ty nodded, his beard almost hiding his smile. \u201cThey gave us all a bump in rank equivalent to the time we would have served if we\u2019d stayed in the Corps. Owen and I got kicked over to officers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Grady,\u201d Zane repeated. He shook his head and swiped his fingers across Ty\u2019s chin. \u201cNope. You\u2019ll always be Staff Sergeant to me. What\u2019s with the beard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial forces. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s coming off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I like it. Keep it for a while.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled him into another hug. He was peripherally aware of the rest of Sidewinder picking themselves up off the ground and trying to straighten their uniforms, and he finally let Ty go long enough to turn toward them.</p><p>They were all grinning from ear to ear, hugging Kelly repeatedly, unable to stop laughing long enough to speak. Kelly began poking fun at their new titles.</p><p>\u201cMother fucking Master Sergeant O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d he said with a pluck at Nick\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>Nick brushed himself off, retrieving his hat from the ground with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cWhy the new ranks?\u201d Zane asked Ty. He did a double take, unable to keep his eyes off the only man he\u2019d been waiting to see.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as good a deal as it sounds,\u201d Ty said. \u201cThe ranks came with some pretty steep responsibilities. It was the reason we were called back. That\u2019s . . . that\u2019s pretty much all I can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out now?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cIs it . . . is this it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is it,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Digger said, almost singing the words. He bent to pick up his seabag and slung it over his shoulder.</p><p>Owen laughed ruefully. \u201cThey asked me to stay on. But, uh . . . I told them to stick it. It\u2019s back to the private sector for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted, glancing at Nick. He was looking at his feet, and Kelly was watching him with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cDid they ask you to re-up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they did,\u201d Nick answered without looking up.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Nick cleared his throat. \u201cThey asked me to stay on as a drill instructor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good casting,\u201d Ty mumbled. Zane glanced at him, and Ty mouthed, \u201cHe\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them no.\u201d Nick smiled at Kelly, then looked around before picking up his seabag again. \u201cI\u2019m done with carrying a gun.\u201d</p><p>He walked off. The others stared, looking stunned and confused. After a few seconds, Kelly jogged after him.</p><p>Zane finally found his voice and turned back to Ty. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you guys?\u201d</p><p>Ty was still watching Nick make his way through the crowd, his mouth hanging open. He had to tear his attention away to meet Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Owen grunted and smacked Digger in the chest. \u201cLet\u2019s go get a fucking milkshake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilkshake?\u201d Zane echoed.</p><p>Owen nodded and grabbed up his bag. \u201cAnd meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, meat!\u201d Digger practically skipped after the others, leaving Ty and Zane alone.</p><p>Ty was still staring after them, frowning. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigger? Hasn\u2019t he always been like that?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cNick. There\u2019s something wrong with Nick.\u201d He turned to Zane and wrapped his arms around his neck. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>Zane pressed his face to Ty\u2019s neck and closed his eyes. He laughed. \u201cCan we skip milkshakes and just go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Bad luck.\u201d Ty kissed his cheek, then took his hand and began leading him through the celebratory crowd.</p><p>When Ty walked into the federal building in Baltimore, it caused quite a fuss. Zane hadn\u2019t told anyone he was coming home because he hadn\u2019t wanted to deal with all the teasing from his coworkers. But also because he\u2019d wanted to walk out of the elevator and see all their faces when they realized Ty was with him.</p><p>The commotion started with their old team. Clancy saw them and screamed and flailed, which caused Alston to duck and cover like he was used to her smacking him. She came running over and threw herself into Ty\u2019s arms, hugging him around the neck and letting her feet dangle. Ty was wearing a red Santa hat with a white fluffball on the end, and the fluffball hit Clancy in the head when they hugged, but she didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>Alston, Perrimore, and Lassiter swiftly joined her, giving Ty hugs and handshakes. Others came over to welcome Ty home, and it didn\u2019t take five minutes for the teasing and ribbing to start. Everyone in the office, including Zane, had had six months to get used to the idea of Ty and Zane being a couple. Zane had endured a great deal of good-natured banter, with a side helping of nasty comments and uninformed opinions. For the most part, though, it had become old news. People had gotten over it and accepted it, then mostly forgotten it the longer Ty had been away.</p><p>For Ty, though, it was all new. And from the look in his eyes, it was scary.</p><p>The uproar in the office gained the attention of the Special Agent in Charge. McCoy stepped out of his office and started to shout at them, but he caught himself when he saw Ty at the center of the group.</p><p>\u201cGrady!\u201d he shouted. The group broke apart and people turned to look at their boss. Everyone was silent as they waited for McCoy to continue. He pointed at Ty and then Zane. \u201cYou two, in my office.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared back into his office.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a glance, and Zane grinned.</p><p>\u201cLike being home again,\u201d Ty said as they obediently headed for the office.</p><p>McCoy was digging in his desk drawer when they came in. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you,\u201d he told Ty. He pulled Ty\u2019s service weapon and badge out of his drawer and set them on the desk.</p><p>Ty stared at it for a moment, a smile playing at his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t I have to pass certification again first?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been living in certification,\u201d McCoy countered. He glanced at Zane, but his smile was hesitant and a little sad. He lowered his head. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you back safe, Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have good news from the home front.\u201d</p> <p>Zane groaned. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not putting him back on desk duty. You remember what happened last time.\u201d</p><p>McCoy turned his chair so he could rest his elbow on the desk and prop his chin in his hand. He didn\u2019t seem amused. In fact, he seemed downright solemn.</p><p>After a long moment of silence, he breathed in deeply. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said as he examined a file on his desk. He tapped it as if trying to decide what else to say. \u201cDuring the course of Grady\u2019s leave of absence, a few things came to light that . . . I would have preferred to remain in the dark. Unfortunately . . .\u201d He trailed off and shook his head.</p><p>Zane\u2019s good humor drained away as he watched their boss through narrowed eyes. He caught himself turning to Ty and stopped.</p><p>Ty leaned back in his chair, slumping and scratching at his forehead. He pulled the Santa hat off. He\u2019d gone pale, and his knee was bouncing. They both knew what was coming.</p> <p>McCoy looked up at Ty from under lowered brows, and then his gaze shifted to Zane.</p><p>Ty held his trembling fingers over his brows, as if shielding himself from the sun.</p><p>\u201cI need to know one thing from you both before I continue,\u201d McCoy said grimly. \u201cAre you now or have you ever been involved . . . romantically?\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes as the rest of the color drained from his face. Zane blinked hard over McCoy\u2019s question and had no idea what to say. How could they reply when McCoy already knew the answer, but the truth would probably separate them?</p><p>McCoy watched them silently. Ty finally moved, sitting straighter in the seat. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered, the sound barely even a recognizable word.</p><p>McCoy slammed his hand onto his desk. \u201cDammit, Grady! All the times you\u2019ve lied to me over the years, and you pick now to be honest?\u201d</p> <p>There wasn\u2019t anything Zane could add. Not really. He wasn\u2019t ashamed of being in love with Ty. He watched his partner as Ty met McCoy\u2019s eyes. He looked ill, but Zane knew why. They were well and truly out now. For better or worse. Ty was handling it better than expected, really.</p><p>McCoy propped both elbows on the desk and massaged his temples. Finally he leaned back and shook his head at them both. \u201cNow, I want it made very clear that the Federal Bureau of Investigation does not give a good goddamn about who you fuck.\u201d He kept rubbing his fingers over his chin and mouth in a nervous habit that rarely manifested. \u201cHeterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, omnisexual, transsexual . . . we don\u2019t give a damn. As long as you conduct yourself in a manner that is dignified and discreet, you do whatever you want. We will not tell you who or who not to be involved with. That having been said, my concern here, and that of my superiors, is how your relationship impacts your job performance and those around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantically involved or not, we were one of the best goddamned teams you had,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re his superior.\u201d McCoy shook his head and covered his mouth again. He met Zane\u2019s eyes; then his gaze flickered to Ty. \u201cGentlemen, if I could snuff this out, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you made a very public display before Grady left. While it\u2019s not against any specific Bureau policies, it\u2019s frowned upon, and it\u2019s been dealt with the same way across the board in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy sending one of us to North Carolina?\u201d Zane asked with a bitter laugh.</p><p>\u201cBy separating you, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cThis is precedent,\u201d McCoy snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re both good agents, but neither of you have ever been above reproach. We can\u2019t afford to have your integrity come into question in the future because you\u2019re fucking. Especially now that Garrett is essentially your boss.\u201d</p> <p>Zane grunted. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer partners, there\u2019s nothing to separate.\u201d</p><p>McCoy looked at him with true regret and sighed heavily. \u201cYou\u2019re management now, Garrett. There\u2019s no going back. And you can\u2019t have your . . . your boyfriend working under you.\u201d</p><p>Ty opened his mouth, and McCoy held up his hand. \u201cIf you make a joke, I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty mumbled, slumping further into his chair.</p><p>\u201cI have to reassign one of you.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared, appalled by this sudden obstacle thrown in their path. A reassignment could mean any number of things\u2014different shifts, different departments\u2014most of them not so conducive to him and Ty seeing each other regularly. There was no way McCoy could have any idea how serious their relationship was. He seemed to simply think they were sleeping together. Zane glanced over at Ty, who was sitting stock still and watching McCoy intently.</p><p>\u201cWe have several options,\u201d McCoy told them, obviously uncomfortable. \u201cOne of you will be transferred to another field office. DC or Philly would be relatively close. Even Newark. Unless you\u2019re willing to end your relationship to stay where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered immediately, his voice low and firm. Zane shook his head. He wouldn\u2019t give up Ty now that he\u2019d just gotten him back.</p><p>McCoy nodded as if he\u2019d anticipated that reaction. \u201cWell,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cWhich one of you will it be? Grady, we could send you to Philadelphia, closer to family. Garrett, you\u2019re already familiar with DC. You could easily go back there, where there are more chances to advance.\u201d</p><p>Zane dropped his gaze to his hands. Yes, he\u2019d expected them to be separated. But he\u2019d been anticipating them working different shifts, not this.</p><p>DC was a good choice. When he\u2019d lived there when they\u2019d first been partnered, Ty had driven back and forth from Baltimore. But it had only been for a matter of weeks. Zane drew a slow breath, trying not to resent McCoy for what he was making them do.</p><p>Before he could speak, though, Ty reached between their chairs and brushed his fingertips across Zane\u2019s elbow, eyes still on McCoy. Ty didn\u2019t appear angry or upset. In fact, Zane\u2019s usually temperamental partner looked downright composed as he pushed to his feet. He lowered his head as he reached under the lapel of his suit coat and pulled out his badge\u2014the badge he\u2019d just gotten back. He laid it on the desk in front of McCoy, followed by his Bureau-issued sidearm, still in its holster.</p><p>When McCoy looked up at him, his eyes were wide and his lips were parted.</p><p>Ty merely shook his head. \u201cNobody\u2019s moving.\u201d</p><p>Zane distantly wondered what the thundering noise was until he realized it was his heartbeat in his ears. He stared at Ty, unable to look away. He knew how much Ty loved and lived for his work. He was afraid to speak for fear of what would come out.</p><p>\u201cGrady, think about this, would you?\u201d McCoy said patiently. \u201cI understand, okay? It\u2019s a shitty situation, and if I could sweep it under the rug, I would. I tried.\u201d</p><p>Ty was shaking his head, gently pushing the badge on the desk around in circles with his finger. \u201cI know, Mac. But being separated is not an option.\u201d Zane\u2019s gut clenched as Ty used the one finger to push his badge closer to McCoy. \u201cGarrett can stay where he is. Consider this my resignation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Zane finally managed to say. He stood and snatched Ty\u2019s badge from the desk. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go insane if you\u2019re not working, Ty,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cI\u2019m two years from retirement. Let me take the bullet on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, you\u2019re two years from retirement,\u201d Ty hissed. \u201cTwo years and it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d McCoy sighed. \u201cIf the Bureau loses either of you right now, it\u2019s my ass they\u2019ll come for. I can\u2019t let either of you resign, goddamn it. That\u2019s not a solution.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and gave him a small smirk. \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway, Mac.\u201d</p><p>McCoy began to massage the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Ty reached for Zane\u2019s hand and gently removed the badge Zane was clutching. He set it on McCoy\u2019s desk and pushed it toward their boss, his eyes never leaving Zane\u2019s. Then the smirk turned into a smile\u2014the same beautiful grin Zane had always loved. The laugh lines at his eyes appeared. His nose scrunched. But there was no light in his eyes, the sparkle that said he was enjoying life. That light hadn\u2019t been there since he\u2019d gotten home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a rubber band ball to retrieve from my desk,\u201d Ty said. He patted Zane\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d</p><p>He walked out, leaving Zane and McCoy staring after him with their mouths hanging open.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he just did that,\u201d McCoy finally said.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cGive me time before you file his paperwork, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Assistant Special Agent in Charge,\u201d McCoy said, and he stuffed Ty\u2019s badge and gun into a desk drawer. \u201cYou file his damn paperwork. Get out of my office.\u201d</p><p>Ty spent the next two weeks reacclimating to civilian life. He got up early to run, relearning his old route and taking note of everything that had changed. Buildings being redone, neighbors being gone, a florist where a dive bar used to be, a martini bar where the Fosters used to live.</p><p>It all felt the same, but it was different. A car would backfire and Ty would drop and roll. A baby would cry and Ty would reach for a gun he no longer carried. Zane would knock into him in the middle of the night and Ty would grab him and roll him off the bed.</p><p>Okay, that had been kind of funny after the fact.</p><p>But it was taking Ty longer to get used to being in his own skin again than he would have liked. He didn\u2019t hear much from the other guys, either. He supposed they were all suffering through the same sense of vertigo as he was. Sometimes it was easier to get used to real life again if they didn\u2019t speak for a while. They\u2019d discovered that years ago. The only person Ty had expected to hear from already was Nick, but he hadn\u2019t even received a text message from the man. That in itself was strange, and it felt like something was missing from each day.</p><p>Not working was also disconcerting. He\u2019d never in his life been without a job. It was driving him a little crazy already, and he knew he would have to find something else soon. A city cop position like Nick had taken up, or even private security somewhere, because as far as he was concerned, guns were the only thing he did well. But all he had to do now was work on the old Mustang in the backyard, and pore over the scraps of evidence Zane brought him about their mole.</p><p>Since their ordeal in New Orleans with Liam Bell resurfacing and the uncanny knowledge both he and the Vega cartel possessed about Ty and Zane\u2019s movements, Ty was just as sure as Zane was that a mole had infiltrated the Baltimore office. Burns had confirmed it the day Ty\u2019d received his orders from the Marine Corps. Someone was relaying information to the Vega cartel, and God knew who else. Enemies who would kill Ty or Zane without a blink.</p><p>The danger had always been at the back of Ty\u2019s mind, knowing Zane was home, alone, with no one he could trust to watch his six. Kelly had spent a great deal of time in Baltimore getting to know Zane, keeping an eye on things for Ty, but Ty hadn\u2019t known that when he\u2019d been away, so he\u2019d fretted at night, worried himself sick when he had the free time to do it. Nick had attempted to distract him at first, but even he had given up on trying to keep Ty\u2019s mind off the very real threat.</p><p>Coming home and finding Zane happy and healthy, smiling and beautiful, had very nearly erased the worry from Ty\u2019s mind. But walking out of the office the day he\u2019d quit, the realization had come tumbling down on him again that there was still a traitor in their midst, and now he\u2019d removed himself from the game.</p><p>So he searched. He pored over news articles and police reports about the cartel. He tried to find connections between the events of New Orleans and any of their cases, delving into everything he had at hand that wouldn\u2019t tip off the mole. But his resources were minuscule, and there was so little to go on.</p><p>All he found were dead ends, and so more often than not he found himself just like he was now, on his back on a modified mechanics creeper\u2014really just a plywood board he\u2019d reinforced and put wheels on\u2014beneath the Mustang.</p><p>He was humming along to the radio, trying to keep his mind clear as he worked, when someone grabbed him by both exposed ankles and yanked. He closed his eyes and tensed his entire body as the creeper shot out from under the Mustang, shocked he didn\u2019t catch his head on any protruding parts. When he cleared the undercarriage, he had his gun in hand, and was shielding his eyes from the winter sun with his wrench, even though he was pretty sure he knew who his assailant was.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d Zane said, the mischief quite clear in his voice. He didn\u2019t even bother helping Ty off the ground, nor did he seem fazed that a twitchy war veteran had just pulled a gun on him. He headed for the door, already yanking at his tie and shrugging out of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Ty called after him.</p><p>Zane laughed, and Ty hurried to follow. He was pretty sure that whatever it was, he didn\u2019t want to miss it.</p><p>Zane jumped Ty before he could even say hello or wipe his greasy hands off on his jeans. He dragged him through the door and slammed him against the wall, leaving Ty\u2019s radio playing and all his tools laying out in the yard as snowflakes began to drift down.</p><p>The next kiss made Ty think he could buy new tools if they got stolen or rusted. Zane pulled at his jeans and shoved at his heavy wool shirt, growling at him to take everything off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus Christ, what happened to you?\u201d Ty gasped.</p><p>\u201cI was sitting at my desk, wanting to shoot myself,\u201d Zane said as he kissed his way down Ty\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd I remembered that you were at home, just sitting around doing nothing.\u201d</p><p>Ty made an insulted noise, but he couldn\u2019t even argue because it was true.</p> <p>Zane kissed him again, shoving Ty\u2019s jeans down his hips and sliding his fingers against Ty\u2019s bare skin. Then he stopped and met Ty\u2019s eyes with a smile that crinkled his laugh lines. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t fucking wait to get home.\u201d</p><p>Ty moaned when Zane sank to his knees.</p><p>The first touch of Zane\u2019s tongue to the soft, sensitive skin at the crease of Ty\u2019s thigh and groin made his entire body shudder. Zane\u2019s bristly cheek glanced along the side of Ty\u2019s cock as Zane paused to suck hard on a patch of skin just inside the curve of Ty\u2019s hipbone.</p><p>Ty gripped the back of Zane\u2019s neck as he tried to catch his breath. This was the kind of \u201970s porn situation he had played over and over in his mind while he\u2019d been gone. This was why he\u2019d continued to fight when they\u2019d been outnumbered, continued to duck when bullets flew. Not the sex, though that was certainly a bonus. But coming home to this, to Zane.</p><p>Zane\u2019s reply was a drawn-out hum, and he didn\u2019t stop until he\u2019d placed a kiss at the base of Ty\u2019s cock.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Zane,\u201d Ty gritted out as his fingers tightened in Zane\u2019s hair. He didn\u2019t know whether to pull Zane\u2019s head back and ask him what the hell he was up to or hold his head there until he finished what he\u2019d started. Because like it or not, Zane did not often come home from work ready to go at it against the kitchen wall. Ty missed working with him, missed seeing him at all hours of the day. And he hated, absolutely loathed, being out of the loop like this, wondering what the hell Zane was up to when he made advances.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t care what his motives were once Zane licked all the way up his cock to the sensitive head.</p><p>He called out wordlessly and grabbed at Zane\u2019s shoulders with both hands, his back bumping against the brick of the kitchen wall. He tried to push his hips forward but couldn\u2019t, instead settled for watching Zane. It wasn\u2019t messy or hurried; Zane was taking his own sweet time, tonguing and kissing and tasting and rubbing every millimeter of skin his lips met. Thoroughly and repeatedly. Just the sight of his lips on Ty\u2019s cock was enough to get Ty\u2019s blood pumping. Ty held his breath, his entire body thrumming with anticipation and teasing jolts of pleasure.</p><p>Then Zane took Ty into his mouth and sucked gently, and tipped his head back enough to look up at Ty. Ty couldn\u2019t take his eyes off him. \u201cDon\u2019t think because your mouth is full you\u2019re not expected to explain.\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled off Ty long enough to press a kiss to his belly. He smirked up at him, then picked up where he left off, sucking carefully but with more strength while the fingers of his free hand curled into the muscles of Ty\u2019s hamstring.</p><p>Ty sucked in a breath and let his head fall back as his dirty fingers flattened against the rough brick behind him, and when he looked back down, the urge to sink his fingers into Zane\u2019s dark curls was almost overwhelming. It left him grasping for anything else to hold on to because he knew what he\u2019d do to Zane if he got a handle on him.</p> <p>\u201cZane!\u201d he gasped again as his knees began to go weak. He wasn\u2019t even close enough to the stairs to grip the railing.</p><p>Zane\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t verbal; he simply gripped Ty\u2019s hips and pinned him to the wall as he continued his slow and methodical approach. Ty had to give Zane points for attention to detail. Classic Garrett.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ty groaned plaintively. He banged his head back against the wall. Then somewhere close, amidst the pile of clothing Zane had yanked off him, his cell phone began to ring. He distantly recognized his brother\u2019s ringtone. \u201cChrist, not again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to answer that?\u201d</p><p>Ty shivered all over and shook his head. No way in hell could Deuce have anything to say to him that was more important than Zane on his knees with his mouth on Ty\u2019s dick.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Zane drawled before licking from Ty\u2019s balls all the way to the head of his erect cock in one wet swath. \u201cMight be important.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes fluttered shut, and he groaned desperately. \u201cDamn you,\u201d he gritted out. He reached for Zane\u2019s hair and yanked at his head so he could step away from the wall and pounce on the jeans that had been tossed aside. He grabbed at the phone, then turned back to Zane with every intention of continuing what they\u2019d started without further unnecessary delay.</p><p>Apparently Zane was thinking the same thing, because he latched onto Ty\u2019s hips and pushed him back against the wall. Damn, he was determined.</p> <p>Ty hung his head and panted for a few frantic breaths, trying to regain control before he answered the phone. He rested one hand on top of Zane\u2019s head, his fingers automatically curling as he answered with a curt, \u201cCall me back in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s tongue flicked over the head of his cock, and Ty bit his lip against a moan.</p><p>\u201cOh God. You\u2019re either having sex or being shot at, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Deuce asked with dread. \u201cWhy do you answer the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to go,\u201d Ty grunted as he swiped the phone off and tossed it into his pile of clothes, letting his hand join the other one in Zane\u2019s hair.</p><p>Muffled laughter sent vibrations through Ty\u2019s groin, and Zane pulled back, sucking all the way until Ty\u2019s erection popped free and rubbed through the whiskers on his chin. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy asshole brother,\u201d Ty answered tightly.</p><p>Zane bit his lip, peering up at Ty and waiting.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Zane,\u201d Ty begged, shameless. He slid his palm against Zane\u2019s cheek, his fingers digging into the back of his neck. Zane nodded slightly before leaning forward, taking Ty in on his tongue. He couldn\u2019t fit all of Ty\u2019s erect cock into his mouth, but it didn\u2019t matter. He wasn\u2019t teasing anymore; he was focusing on the endgame.</p><p>Ty did his best to keep his eyes open, watching as he disappeared between Zane\u2019s lips. He wanted nothing more than to come down Zane\u2019s throat. It was barely a matter of minutes with the visual stimulation, and Ty was soon gasping and tugging at Zane\u2019s hair in warning.</p><p>Zane pulled off, wrapped his fingers around Ty to pump him hard, and leaned his forehead against Ty\u2019s belly to kiss the warm skin.</p><p>Ty gritted out Zane\u2019s name as he came hard, watching lasciviously as it splattered onto Zane\u2019s throat and chest, onto his pressed dress shirt. As if on cue, his phone began to ring again. Zane jacked him through his orgasm, obviously not caring about how damn debauched he looked.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand moved to Zane\u2019s shoulder and squeezed harder as his legs went weak and he began to sink toward the floor. Zane slid his arm around Ty\u2019s waist, and Ty wound up on his knees, panting hard as they kissed. The phone continued to ring, ruining the afterglow with its obnoxious tune. Ty ignored it for as long as his conscience would allow. Zane hugged him close for a long moment before he nipped at his lower lip, then he reached for the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted at him and flopped to his back on the hardwood floor, unashamed. He could hear the tinny sound of his brother\u2019s voice through the phone. \u201cPush the speaker button,\u201d he said to Zane.</p><p>Zane laughed at something Deuce said before jabbing the button and holding the phone out between them. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Deuce?\u201d Zane asked warmly. He wiped at his mouth and chin with the back of one hand.</p><p>\u201cI hope he at least buys you dinner before you do that,\u201d Deuce said to Zane.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to bribe my bedmates,\u201d Ty shouted at the phone. His brother laughed heartily. Ty couldn\u2019t help but smile. He looked at Zane and winked.</p><p>\u201cI called to ask you a favor, Ty,\u201d Deuce said.</p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d Ty said lazily, still lying on the floor and enjoying the post-orgasm high.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be my best man.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re getting married, finally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, we settled on the details.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat up, suddenly wishing he was wearing pants. \u201cI better damn well be your best man,\u201d he muttered as he crawled closer to his jeans and lay back down to slide them on.</p><p>\u201cCalm yourself.\u201d Deuce sounded very pleased with himself. \u201cZane? I expect you to be a groomsman as well. We\u2019re keeping the guest list small, and frankly, I don\u2019t know that many people I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a circus,\u201d Zane teased. \u201cYou know we\u2019ll be there for whatever you need.\u201d When Ty glanced up, Zane raised a brow in question and leaned to tug at Ty\u2019s jeans leg, trying to dissuade him from putting them on.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes in warning. \u201cI need pants on to talk about this,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can hear you, right?\u201d Deuce said, voice wavering with laughter.</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t call when we\u2019re in the middle of things! When\u2019s this thing going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . it\u2019s next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week?\u201d Ty blurted. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush, man, you already knocked her up once!\u201d</p><p>Zane smacked Ty in the head before he could duck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married in Scotland. And we thought, what better time to do it than Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland?\u201d Zane echoed, perking up. \u201cDoes that mean Ty has to wear a kilt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas in Scotland sounds . . . cold,\u201d Ty added.</p><p>\u201cGet a hold of yourself,\u201d Deuce said. \u201cA week away, all expenses paid. I\u2019ll email you the info.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked positively gleeful. He offered Ty the phone as he shifted to get up. Ty watched him walk away, then pressed the speaker button again and put the phone to his ear. \u201cDeacon,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cBeaumont,\u201d Deuce replied in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much so,\u201d Deuce said. The answer would have been clear in his voice regardless.</p><p>Ty smiled. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another favor to ask you,\u201d Deuce said quickly, his voice losing its enthusiasm.</p><p>Ty\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you bring someone with you to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your Recon buddies.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat up, his unbuttoned jeans forgotten. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort version? Livi\u2019s dad is concerned about safety. His company\u2019s been getting threats, apparently. That\u2019s why we\u2019re rushing it. He\u2019s got his own private bodyguards, but I\u2019d feel a lot better if we had someone there who could put all his attention on the baby girl if anything goes wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a bodyguard for the baby at your wedding?\u201d Ty frowned harder. He glanced up when Zane came back into the kitchen, shrugging at the questioning look Zane gave him, and Zane turned to head back into the living room. Ty\u2019s eyes lingered on his ass as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds overboard, but I swear man, the way her dad talks, it makes me paranoid. And I don\u2019t want to have to worry on my wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no,\u201d Ty said quickly. \u201cI got it. I\u2019ll call someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make him a groomsman so he\u2019ll have access to all the crap we\u2019re going to have to go through. Pay his way, everything. And give him a guest. It\u2019s only fair. All on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, bro.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, grinning. \u201cNow, if you ever call me again while I\u2019m getting head, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Deuce said with a laugh, and the phone clicked off in Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty smirked, looking down at the phone for a moment before clambering to his feet. \u201cGarrett!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane called back.</p><p>Ty found Zane in the bathroom, shirt off, wiping himself down with a hand towel. \u201cI\u2019m not done with you. We have to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled indulgently. \u201cCelebrate Deuce\u2019s engagement by engaging in copious amounts of hot sex?\u201d</p><p>Ty spread his arms and cocked his head with a grin. \u201cSounds like a plan, right?\u201d</p><p>Zane left the towel in the sink and moved until they stood chest to chest. He placed his hands on Ty\u2019s hips, his thumbs stroking the skin bared by Ty\u2019s unfastened jeans. \u201cYou know what that wedding means, don\u2019t you? A whole week. The two of us. On vaca\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ty tapped Zane\u2019s lips with two fingers, shushing him. \u201cDon\u2019t finish that thought.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him, smirking. \u201cWhat else did he need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Ty grunted, determined to get back to business. \u201cThere was an inappropriate celebration we were getting to, remember?\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled, a low rumble in his chest. \u201cYou can\u2019t distract me that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d Ty growled.</p><p>It took Nick a long time to talk himself into climbing the front steps of the triple-decker he\u2019d grown up in. He glanced at the upstairs window as he stood on the sidewalk. His father was laid up in bed there, dying from all the poison he\u2019d put into his body in the last sixty or so years. He wanted to see all his children before he passed, wanted to make peace with them.</p><p>At least, that was what Nick\u2019s mother had told them. Nick knew there was something more going on, though. It had taken his mother two weeks to contact him after he\u2019d returned home, and the first words from her mouth hadn\u2019t been to say she was glad he was home safe. Just that his father needed to see him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He climbed the front steps and knocked before he could decide against it. His mother answered the door, her smile strained and her hug stiff when she greeted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, voice quiet. \u201cYou look good, Nicholas. Your father\u2019s been asking for you.\u201d</p><p>Nick merely nodded, resisting the urge to glance up or in the direction of his father\u2019s study. He was closer to forty than four, but he still felt that flash of anxiety and outright fear when he thought of walking down that hallway.</p> <p>They stood in awkward silence, not really looking at each other, not really wanting to. This was the first time Nick had been in his childhood home since he\u2019d told his parents he was bi. He hadn\u2019t been welcome after that.</p><p>Nick cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cKatherine and Erin are here,\u201d his mother said finally. \u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here before they go up to see him.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded again, shrugging out of his snow-covered coat. He and Kat and Erin shared memories the younger siblings hadn\u2019t been subjected to.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re down\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know where they are,\u201d Nick murmured, and headed for the creaky old door to the cellar.</p><p>The light at the top of the staircase didn\u2019t turn anything on, but then, it hadn\u2019t since Nick had gotten old enough to figure out how to cut the wires inside the switch. He descended in darkness, hoping his memory of the stairwell would keep him from breaking his damn neck. His footfalls were silent on the concrete steps. When he reached the bottom, a pool of weak light emitted from the corner, where old room dividers and screens and large concrete pillars partitioned off a piece of the cellar.</p><p>His two sisters were together on an old sofa in the corner. A battered coffee table with a duct-taped leg, braced with a broken hockey stick, sat before them. A lamp on a milk crate gave off the only light. They were flipping through a photo book, both alternately sniffling and laughing.</p><p>Nick shoved his hands into his pockets as he approached them, trying for a smile. He stood on the other side of the coffee table. \u201cI thought I\u2019d find you two down here.\u201d</p><p>Kat smiled weakly and cleared her throat. \u201cDo you remember when he\u2019d come home drunk and you\u2019d gather all of us together and bring us down here?\u201d</p><p>Nick fought to swallow past the tightening in his throat. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d tell us stories and we\u2019d play board games or listen to the Sox play until we heard him go to sleep.\u201d Kat wiped at her eyes.</p><p>Nick stepped around the table, and they both moved over so he could sit between them. He spread his arms on the back of the couch, and both women leaned into him.</p><p>Kat\u2019s voice quivered when she spoke again. \u201cI was never afraid when we were down here. Not when you were with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was I,\u201d Erin whispered. She hugged Nick close. \u201cWe knew you would protect us. You always did.\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes, his arms tightening around them.</p><p>The three of them had met for dinner the day after he\u2019d returned to Boston, catching up after he had been gone for so long. But this was something they never talked about.</p><p>Kat began to cry softly. She shoved the picture book away and pressed her face against Nick\u2019s chest. \u201cThese pictures . . . we never realized how young you were. My God, Nick, you were just a baby. You were younger than Patrick is now.\u201d Her oldest son. He\u2019d just turned ten last week. \u201cWho stood in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Nick whispered.</p> <p>They sat in silence, listening to the house creak, to their mother moving around upstairs, to the occasional voice of one of their two youngest sisters asking where the hell they were. The young ones didn\u2019t remember the basement, didn\u2019t remember Nick and Kat carrying them down here in bundles of blankets and setting them in stacks of pillows or beanbag chairs and singing them to sleep so they\u2019d be safe. They didn\u2019t remember to look for their older siblings down here when the thought of facing their father was too much for them.</p><p>\u201cNicholas!\u201d their mother called from the top of the steps. \u201cYour father\u2019s awake. He\u2019s asking to see you.\u201d</p><p>Nick took a deep breath. The three of them shared a glance. Both his sisters looked like they wanted to hang on to him for dear life, just like they\u2019d done when they were little.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to tell him to kiss our asses,\u201d Erin said as she stood.</p><p>Nick stared at the rectangle of light near the bottom of the steps. He had so many memories of sitting on this couch, his arms around Kat and Erin, their baby sisters asleep on their laps, listening to the sound of their mother crying upstairs. And waiting. He remembered the terror of watching the silhouette of his father appear in that frame of light, hoping the man would try to storm down the steps Nick had booby-trapped with his sports equipment, praying he\u2019d just trip and break his neck on the concrete floor when he landed.</p><p>He\u2019d never grabbed one of those sticks or bats on his way up the steps after being summoned, though. He\u2019d always left them where they were, knowing the veritable minefield would keep his sisters safe.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d never dreamed about taking that hockey stick and watching it crack his father\u2019s skull. He\u2019d grabbed a baseball bat one time, the day before leaving for Basic. It had been the last time his father raised a hand to any of them.</p><p>A shadow appeared on the floor, different than the one that haunted him. \u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d Nick called. Kat and Erin trailed behind him as he made his way up the two flights to his father\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He stood in the doorway, Kat and Erin still behind him. His two youngest sisters, Alana and Nessa, sat in chairs beside the bed, where Brian O\u2019Flaherty lay propped amongst several pillows, jaundiced and weak. All three of them looked at the doorway when they realized Nick was standing there.</p><p>\u201cSon,\u201d his father said. He pushed himself up, trying to sit straighter. He didn\u2019t quite make it.</p><p>Nick moved toward the bed. Nessa stood and gave him a stiff hug. Nick held onto her, flooded by memories of running down the hall and gathering her out of her bassinet, wrapping her up in her blankets and hugging her to his chest as he and Kat scrambled to get down to the cellar before their father hit the front door.</p><p>He let her go, and she and Alana moved to let him sit beside the bed. His father\u2019s eyes stayed on him, and Nick didn\u2019t look away. Eye contact had always been something he\u2019d fought for. When he\u2019d been little, it had pissed his dad off. He\u2019d seen it as a challenge, like a fucking junkyard dog.</p><p>It had been worth a backhand to meet the man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home safe,\u201d his dad finally said. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell us you were leaving. We\u2019d have come to see you off.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t spoken to me in over a year. You said I was going to hell.\u201d</p><p>Brian\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cI\u2019m too sick to fight, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a first,\u201d Nick said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cNick, he can\u2019t handle stress right now, why don\u2019t you try to be civil,\u201d Alana spat. She was standing by the door, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut your mouth,\u201d Kat snapped.</p><p>Nick glanced over his shoulder at them, then back to his father. \u201cI\u2019m not here so you can say a tender good-bye. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make my peace with you, son. We had a rough road. But now I\u2019m dying. And I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes. He knew what sort of changes the thought of impending death could bring on a person. He\u2019d suffered through them himself. But he knew his dad, too. The man wasn\u2019t seeking retribution or forgiveness. He wanted something, something only Nick could give him. And it wasn\u2019t peace.</p><p>\u201cCut to it. What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Brian took a deep, rattling breath. \u201cWithout a new liver, I\u2019ll be dead in three to six months.\u201d</p><p>One of Nick\u2019s sisters sniffed. Nick didn\u2019t look away from his father.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close enough to my size you could be a match, son. You\u2019re the only one who might be. You got that O blood type.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat back and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shitting me!\u201d Erin shouted.</p><p>\u201cErin!\u201d their mother cried. \u201cYour language!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff it, Mom!\u201d Kat waved a hand at Nick. \u201cHow the hell can either of you ask him to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad is dying,\u201d Nessa said, her voice small and scared. \u201cEven you can\u2019t be so selfish you wouldn\u2019t help him if you could. Even Nick\u2019s not that selfish.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced over in time to recognize the warning signs of Kat and Erin about to blow a collective gasket.</p><p>\u201cEverybody get out,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cNick!\u201d Kat started.</p><p>\u201cKat, stay calm, okay? Give us a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Kat held her breath but nodded. She ushered everyone out of the room and closed the door behind them, leaving Nick and his father alone.</p><p>\u201cTemperamental women,\u201d Brian mumbled. \u201cThey run in the family. Got to keep the reins tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only person in this family who should be tied down is you,\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>They stared at each other for several long moments, neither willing to look away. Brian swallowed hard and licked his lips. Nick hated that he enjoyed seeing his father scared. He hated the fact that he wanted revenge for all the terror and pain of his childhood. But he did. He\u2019d have to live with the kind of person that made him.</p><p>\u201cI know you hate me, Nick, and you got the right. But do you think I\u2019m such a horrible man I deserve a death sentence?\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t want me to answer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you consider it before you say no? For your sisters? And your mother?\u201d</p><p>Nick began to smile. \u201cTell me something, Dad. How fucking terrified were you when they told you I was the only one who could save you?\u201d</p><p>What little color there was drained from Brian\u2019s face. \u201cNicholas,\u201d he tried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got somewhere to be,\u201d Nick said, and stood.</p><p>\u201cSon, please. I\u2019ll die without your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably should have thought about that thirty-seven years and fifteen broken bones ago,\u201d Nick said as he headed for the door.</p><p>His father called after him, his voice a pale echo of the shouts that used to ring through this house.</p><p>Nick ignored him. He stalked down the hallway to the stairs, beginning to fume as he thumped down the steps. The man had no right to ask that of him. He had no right to put that decision in Nick\u2019s hands. How many times had Nick prayed for his father\u2019s demise over the years? And now it seemed the only way it would happen was if Nick pulled the trigger on him. It wasn\u2019t fucking fair.</p><p>The rest of the family was gathered in the kitchen. Nick\u2019s mother was hunched over the kitchen table, Alana and Nessa sitting on either side of her. Kat and Erin were stalking back and forth like hungry lionesses, and they pounced on him when they heard him coming.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Erin demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do it, are you?\u201d Kat added. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe him shit.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s phone began to ring before he could answer. He glanced around at the five women as he dug in his back pocket. Nessa and Alana were watching him, their expressions full of hope and fear and pain. How many times had Nick seen those eyes\u2014frightened but not sure why, trusting him to protect them.</p><p>His mother stood. \u201cNick, please,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Nick tore his eyes away from them to look down at his phone. \u201cI have to take this.\u201d He grabbed up his coat and turned toward the front door without another word, leaving his family behind to step out into the freezing air. His hands were shaking and he felt like he might throw up in the bushes. The cold air helped to calm him, and he began making his way to the brand-new Range Rover parked at the curb.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty,\u201d he answered, his voice choked.</p><p>\u201cHey, Irish, you okay?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cYou sound like shit.\u201d</p><p>Nick cleared his throat and glanced at the house behind him when he got to his car. \u201cYeah, you just did me a solid, man. Got me out of a tight spot. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, long story short, you want to be one of Deacon\u2019s groomsmen? All expenses paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at the window above him, pursing his lips. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring a date.\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes and smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a gun.\u201d</p><p>Nick opened his eyes. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s laughter was all the answer Nick got.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a single town name here I can pronounce,\u201d Zane said as he peered at a map inset of the Scottish highlands and Inner Hebrides. He kept pronouncing Hebrides wrong on purpose, and it was driving Ty crazy.</p><p>Ty tossed his arm over Zane\u2019s shoulders, leaning back in his chair. His feet were propped on a suitcase. They\u2019d flown into Glasgow via a hellish eighteen-hour layover in Iceland, and now they were waiting at baggage claim for Nick and his date to join them. They were a little behind the rest of the Grady family, who\u2019d chosen to take Theodore Stanton up on his offer to fly in his private jet. Zane hadn\u2019t been able to get off work in time to do it or Ty would have been all over it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to pronounce it,\u201d Ty said. \u201cApparently the Stantons own the entire fucking island.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cPrivate jet, private island, private security force. I\u2019m starting to think Deuce is in way over his head.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted, and a sense of unease fluttered through him again. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been able to talk to him a little more before he left Philly. Nick\u2019s going to be pissed that I don\u2019t know more about what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>Zane hummed.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. Nick\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Zane began to chuckle. \u201cMaybe this date he\u2019s bringing will make him behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr at least keep him distracted,\u201d Ty mumbled.</p><p>A few minutes later, Ty caught sight of Nick making his way through the crowd. He stood to go meet him, but stopped short when he recognized the man walking with Nick.</p> <p>\u201cDoc!\u201d he cried, and wrapped Kelly up in a hug when they got closer. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said to bring a date and a gun,\u201d Nick said with a crooked smile. \u201cSo I brought a date with a gun.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed and stepped in to give Nick a hug as well. Zane shook both their hands. \u201cHow was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlight was good. Security was rough,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Ty frowned. If Nick and Kelly hadn\u2019t been able to bring their weapons along, their trip had been for naught. \u201cThey give you shit about your gear?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Kelly said before Nick could answer. \u201cThe guns and knives and fucking night vision goggles or whatever he has in there, those permits went through fine. It was him they wouldn\u2019t let go through.\u201d</p><p>Zane began to laugh despite obviously trying not to. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way the new machines are? They take a picture when you stand there, right?\u201d Nick said, raising his arms above his head. \u201cThe fucking shrapnel in my thigh makes it look like I have something sharp in my pocket. They kept telling me to empty my pockets, and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Kelly began to laugh. \u201cThey made him drop his pants. He got whistled at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy you!\u201d Nick shouted.</p><p>Kelly laughed harder. Nick rolled his eyes as Ty and Zane snickered.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHow long a drive do we have to this place?\u201d</p><p>Ty slung his arm around Nick\u2019s shoulders. \u201cCouple hours. You feel like driving it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather me do it than you.\u201d</p><p>Ty snickered, and Kelly jabbed his elbow into Zane\u2019s ribs. \u201cNever let him drive in a country with left-hand driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Zane said with a raised eyebrow at Ty.</p><p>Ty shrugged and winked at him. Nick and Kelly headed for the luggage conveyors to retrieve their suitcases, and Ty slid closer to Zane. \u201cThey\u2019re right, never let me drive here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d Zane\u2019s grin was a warm one. \u201cI can\u2019t believe O\u2019Flaherty brought Doc instead of a real date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought of a week at a wedding with a real date probably flat gave him a panic attack.\u201d Ty gave Zane a spontaneous squeeze around the waist.</p><p>They gathered their luggage, and Nick and Kelly joined them to head for the rental car counters. Ty told Nick to go to the counter and handle the rental because he knew Nick\u2019s luck. The man was fucking blessed when it came to traveling. He\u2019d been Sidewinder\u2019s \u201cacquisitions specialist,\u201d and he\u2019d been damn good at it. But even beyond skill came luck, and Nick had that in spades.</p><p>They\u2019d booked a compact car, but sure enough, Nick came back with a \u201cfree upgrade\u201d to a brand new Audi A4 and the counter girl\u2019s phone number. He handed the number to Kelly and the receipt to Ty, then waved the keys as he headed for the door to the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell does he do that?\u201d Zane asked. Kelly merely laughed as they trailed after Nick with their luggage.</p><p>Ty and Kelly both fell asleep in the back of the sedan as Nick made the three-hour drive to the little town where they were to catch a very private boat to the Stantons\u2019 very private island. Ty woke whenever they took an especially sharp curve or slowed for a trekking biker, and each time he did, Nick and Zane were talking companionably. Several times their laughter roused him.</p><p>Halfway through their deployment, Nick had been sent home for forty-eight hours. Ty knew he\u2019d been sent to Maryland to deliver a message to Naval Intelligence because Ty had specifically chosen him for the mission. When he\u2019d returned, Nick had told him that he\u2019d dropped in on Zane and brought a letter back with him, the only communication Ty and Zane had been able to have during those six months.</p><p>From what Ty had observed since landing in Scotland, Zane and Nick had come to an understanding during that visit. He might even call them friends. The level of relief he felt at that was astronomical, given their rocky start.</p><p>The next time Ty woke, Kelly was using his lap as a pillow, and they were making their way through a tiny, crowded coastal town. Ty stretched and patted Kelly\u2019s chest as he peered out the window. The quaint shops seemed to lean toward them as they drove past, and the cars on the wrong side of the road came way too close to the car for his comfort. He was glad Nick was driving because the roads in the UK made him twitchy.</p><p>They could see sailboats in the harbor and a great expanse of deep blue water beyond. In the far distance, the tops of gently rolling mountains were visible.</p><p>The Stantons\u2019 private island was somewhere out there in the wilds of the Inner Hebrides, two hours away. It didn\u2019t have a name on the map.</p><p>Ty shook Kelly awake as Nick found a tiny parking spot and turned the car off. They all climbed out, stretching and groaning. Nick rolled his neck and Kelly took hold of his shoulders, massaging them to loosen him up. It made Ty smile. It had been odd being deployed without Sanchez, without Kelly. Seeing Kelly and Nick together was like a balm on an open wound he hadn\u2019t realized was there.</p><p>They gathered their luggage and began making their way to the private dock tucked into the picturesque seaside near the larger ferry landing. Kelly and Nick pulled ahead of them, heads bowed as they talked.</p><p>Zane took Ty\u2019s arm and slowed him. \u201cIs there something going on with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re kind of . . . touchy-feely.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed. \u201cNick and Kelly have always been like that. Either one of them would cuddle you if they had the chance.\u201d</p><p>Ty picked up the pace again to catch up with their companions. Zane trailed behind for a few steps.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Zane finally said.</p><p>When Zane climbed out of the craft, the sun was trying desperately to shine through the afternoon cloud cover. The dock seemed to be out in the middle of nowhere, with a winding dirt pathway that supposedly led up to the mansion that inhabited the small island. There were patches of snow in the shade, and the wind was frigid. The crew began to unload mail and packages from the boat, and two men piled them into a small electric vehicle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the brother, then?\u201d a man asked him.</p><p>Zane turned to him, eyebrows raised. The man was short and stocky, with a wild gray beard and even wilder eyebrows. He was wearing a wool skullcap and small, round glasses. His cardigan was torn and tattered, and so were his fingers, which were wrapped around a wooden oar he was leaning on like a cane.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the brother?\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cOh! No, I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m the brother\u2019s partner.\u201d Zane took a step closer and offered his hand. \u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Mackie,\u201d the man said. His Scottish brogue was so thick, Zane had a hard time deciphering what he\u2019d said. \u201cIn charge of the docks. You need something to float, you come calling.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Mackie left him to go supervise the loading of the packages. Zane glanced over the island, whistling under his breath. Talk about getting away from it all. This tiny island on the brittle northwestern coast of Scotland was about as far away as you could get. He shook his head and looked behind him. Ty was straddling the boat and the concrete steps that were built down into the sea off the dock. Nick was handing suitcases up to him, and Kelly was standing on the boat, giving them cheeky directions, no doubt to annoy them both.</p><p>Zane grinned at them.</p><p>Ty glanced up as he balanced on the edge of the boat, several wardrobe bags over his shoulder. \u201cGive me a hand, huh?\u201d he grunted. He raised up one of the bulky bags that carried the tuxedos they\u2019d brought from Baltimore.</p><p>Zane took the garment bag and laid it over one arm before accepting the next satchel Ty shoved at him. \u201cYou make a good pack mule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty grunted. He tossed Zane\u2019s luggage unceremoniously onto the dock. Kelly laughed and held onto his side, using Nick\u2019s shoulder and Ty\u2019s hand to get onto the steps.</p><p>Ty helped Nick with the last two suitcases, then gave his surroundings a once-over, taking in the crimson ribbons tied to the dock and the hint of ancient ruins in the distance. \u201cPoor Deacon.\u201d</p><p>Zane stifled a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p><p>Ty was scowling, obviously not in agreement.</p><p>Nick found his feet and gave the island his own once-over, looking grim. \u201cI\u2019m going to die in Scotland,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Kelly barked a laugh. Nick reached out and grasped his forearm to pull him onto the dock.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with then,\u201d Ty said as he bent to pick up his bags.</p><p>Zane chose the better part of valor and stayed quiet. Ty and Nick both had gotten crankier and crankier as the trip went on, but then, hours of layovers, car rides, and a choppy boat trip to an island that may or may not have power would have tried the biggest of travel lovers, especially since they were mere weeks off six months of deployment.</p><p>Zane slung a satchel over both shoulders, being careful of the tuxedo bag. When they made it to the dirt path, a golf cart broke the rise ahead and trundled their way, three familiar figures riding in it.</p><p>Ty grinned widely at the sight of his brother. He dropped the heavy bags he was lugging and jogged toward the golf cart, which stopped several yards off. Livi put Amelia on the ground, and she bounded toward Ty, who knelt and held his arms out for a hug. Amelia bypassed him, though, running right under his outstretched hand to leap into Zane\u2019s arms. She giggled as Zane twirled her around. Ty\u2019s shoulders drooped, and he trudged back over to them.</p><p>\u201cThat was the most epic rejection I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Kelly said, snickering behind his hand.</p><p>Amelia was only fifteen months old, but between the auburn hair and eyes the same unusual hazel green as Ty\u2019s, she was going to be one killer little lady when she grew up. She wore nothing but dresses, the frillier the better, and she insisted that her shoes match her ribbons. And she was apparently the only child Ty had ever met who would have none of his charms.</p><p>Her parents had spent most of her life showing her pictures of Ty, telling her he was her uncle who loved her very much, and Zane had taught her several tricks under Ty\u2019s strict instructions. But none of it had convinced her to give Ty the time of day yet.</p><p>Zane squeezed her close, and nodded at Livi, who gave them a wave and smiled brilliantly. She was quite lovely in a robin\u2019s egg sheath dress that matched her eyes and a wool coat that matched her dress, even though the wind plucked at her silvery blonde hair and gave her a disheveled appearance. Zane was amused to see that she was wearing galoshes. No unwieldy heels for this one, fashion be damned.</p><p>Nick whistled when he stopped next to Zane. \u201cDamn. Hate to say it Zane, but Deacon won this round.\u201d</p><p>Zane gave that a hearty laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very nice,\u201d Kelly muttered. \u201cZane could pull off that dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really my color.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both chuckled.</p><p>Deuce gave Ty a long, tight hug, squeezing him until he started to struggle for freedom. When Deuce finally released Ty, he offered his hand to Zane. \u201cAgent Garrett,\u201d he said, mockingly formal.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes as he propped Amelia on one hip. \u201cDr. Grady,\u201d he drawled, shaking his hand heartily.</p><p>Deuce turned to Nick, shaking his hand as well and smirking. \u201cSnakebite, been a while. Good to see you back on your feet.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed heavily. \u201cNever going to live it down, am I?\u201d</p><p>Deuce practically giggled.</p><p>\u201cSnakebite?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick shook his head, but Zane cackled when he realized what Deuce was talking about. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re the one who went hiking and got bit by the snake?\u201d</p><p>Nick turned a glare on him.</p><p>\u201cDad told you not to poke it,\u201d Deuce said.</p><p>\u201cI had to poke it, it was in my sleeping bag!\u201d</p><p>Kelly chuckled. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we were young and stupid,\u201d Nick told him.</p><p>\u201cSome of us more so than others,\u201d Deuce added. He turned to Kelly, offering his hand. \u201cI recognize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly Abbott, I was the Navy doc for Sidewinder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve met before, but it\u2019s nice to meet you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you both for coming on such short notice. I know you\u2019re probably wanting some answers about why Ty asked you to come. I figured we\u2019d let you rest a little and then sit down and talk tonight, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Nick said. Zane was a little more ready to demand answers faster, but Nick and Kelly were both the epitome of hassle-free.</p><p>Ty was gallantly helping Livi out of the golf cart, and he offered her his arm as they rejoined Zane and the others. She introduced herself to Nick and Kelly, thanking them for coming just as Deacon had. She seemed sedate for a bride-to-be. She gave Zane a hug and kissed him on the cheek, and then Ty put an arm around her and kept it there as Zane introduced Amelia to the others. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you say hello?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Amelia echoed.</p><p>Zane lifted her a little higher, holding out his fist to show her. \u201cCan you give Nick a fist bump?\u201d</p> <p>Nick gave Ty a wary sideways glance, but he held his fist up to the little girl. Her eyes were shining when she punched her fist to his, but it didn\u2019t end there. She pulled her hand back and spread her fingers, making an exploding sound as she did so, and then she came back for a second bump.</p><p>Nick and Kelly laughed raucously as Zane hugged her tight. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell did you become the favorite?\u201d Ty grumbled. He looked genuinely upset, and Zane gave him an apologetic smile. He\u2019d actually spent more time with Ty\u2019s niece than Ty had because of the deployment, and he\u2019d overcome his awkwardness with children to become quite comfortable with her. He carried her over to the golf cart, leaving Ty to gather the rest of Zane\u2019s bags for him.</p><p>Ty and Nick piled the bags onto the cage on top of the cart. Nick and Kelly took the rear seat, facing backward, and Zane set Amelia between himself and Ty as Deacon guided them toward the main house.</p><p>\u201cPretty swank, Deuce,\u201d Ty said, leaning forward so he wouldn\u2019t have to yell.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, wait until you see the house,\u201d Deuce said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cMy granddaddy had a flair for the dramatic,\u201d Livi told them. \u201cI mean, the place was pretty dramatic to start with from what I understand, but he completely gutted and redid it when he inherited it.</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s the island been in your family?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cA little over a century. When the steel boom started and the robber baron era came along, my great-great-grandfather bought the island and built the mansion as a way to escape public outcry when his dealings went shady.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised both eyebrows, impressed with her candid handling of her family\u2019s not-so-stellar history. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die in Scotland,\u201d Nick said under his breath. \u201cIn a kilt.\u201d</p> <p>Zane coughed to cover his laugh.</p><p>\u201cThe castle ruins on the lee side of the island are from the sixteenth century. But the main house was built in the late 1800s,\u201d Livi continued. \u201cThe island was produced by an extinct volcano, so it\u2019s riddled with caves, lava tubes, and cliffs. The house is built near the highest cliff, actually. You guys should have plenty of territory to explore.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned around, putting his arm over Ty\u2019s shoulder and leaning closer to hear. \u201cDid she say lava?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Livi smiled sympathetically at him. \u201cDeacon tells me you and Kelly are both members of Ty\u2019s Recon team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cSidewinder, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both nodded.</p> <p>\u201cSo do all of you make a habit of being bitten by snakes, or was that like a personal journey of discovery for you?\u201d</p><p>Deuce and Ty burst out laughing, and Livi covered her mouth like she was embarrassed for making fun. Amelia giggled, even though she didn\u2019t know why. Zane glanced sideways to see Nick pursing his lips and nodding like he was trying to hide a smile.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s a comedian,\u201d he finally muttered, turning back around and shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI still love you, babe,\u201d Kelly said to him, patting him on the knee.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Livi finally got control of her laughter and continued talking. \u201cI have to apologize, when Ty told us you were bringing a date, we just assumed . . . the room you have has one queen-sized bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Nick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve shared before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? We could probably do some creative switching, maybe find you two twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re good,\u201d Kelly insisted. \u201cThank you, though. He brought me for a free week in Scotland. Least I can do is put out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou damn right you will,\u201d Nick said. They both laughed.</p><p>It took another few minutes to reach the house, and even Zane\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of the place. It was a Gothic revival mansion, with spires and gables and ancient windowpanes that sparkled in the weak sunlight, all of it made of aged stone and dark brick.</p><p>They sat and stared at it as Deuce and Livi clambered out of the cart. Kelly leaned forward to peer up at the structure, then turned to Nick grimly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Nick just nodded, his mouth gaping open.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Four porters appeared to retrieve their luggage, leaving them free to gawk at the house as Livi led them toward the intimidating front entry. Zane instinctively clutched Amelia closer as they stepped under the front archway and through the massive wooden door.</p><p>The inside of the house was pleasantly light and airy, though, with none of the doom and gloom of the exterior. The wooden floors were a light gray color, covered with cream-colored fiber rugs to soften their appearance. The walls had all been plastered over and painted in cool colors, with the exception of the occasional artful patch of stone showing through to remind visitors of the age of the stately home. The light fixtures were all glittering centerpieces hanging high above their heads, illuminating surprisingly modern d\u00e9cor with comfortable-looking furniture and family photos dotted throughout, rather than deer heads or family crests like Zane had half expected.</p><p>Livi stood in the foyer, extending her arms. \u201cWelcome to Stanton Hall. I can give you the grand tour now, take you right to the kitchen for some snacks, or show you where your rooms are so you can rest.\u201d</p><p>Kelly and Nick both raised their hands, and said almost in unison, \u201cRest, please.\u201d</p><p>Livi laughed and nodded. She took Amelia from Zane, rubbing her nose against the baby\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll show you to your room.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly trailed after her, still checking out the massive house as they climbed the grand staircase.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a bite to eat,\u201d Zane said. \u201cMaybe some coffee.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a step and craned his head, watching Nick and Kelly as they disappeared onto the second level. \u201cI\u2019d like a tour.\u201d</p><p>Deuce took Ty\u2019s arm in his to lean on him as he walked. \u201cI\u2019ll lead Zane to the kitchen and give you a halfass tour, how about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cGuests won\u2019t arrive until the day of the ceremony. Until then, it\u2019s just family and the wedding party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Deacon, what the hell have you gotten yourself into?\u201d Ty hissed.</p><p>Deuce lowered his voice, trying not to laugh. \u201cI was just going for the hot yoga girl, okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane cackled as he followed after them.</p><p>Deuce led them through the great hall, pointing out different rooms as they passed. There was a gentleman\u2019s study and a billiards room, a living room and a parlor, an office with the door closed, a sitting room, a morning room and a dining room, and a hallway that led off toward even more rooms, which Deuce claimed included a pool and a theater.</p><p>The kitchen was located at the bottom of a flight of curved stairs. Zane had to duck.</p><p>A white-haired, cherubic little woman was bustling around the kitchen, humming softly as she prepared what looked like a simple, huge dinner. She stopped and smiled when she noticed them.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, this is Mrs. Aileen Boyd. Stanton Hall\u2019s cook,\u201d Deuce told them. \u201cMrs. Boyd, this is my brother Ty and his partner Zane.\u201d</p><p>Aileen came over to greet them. She had a splotch of flour on her cheek. She was holding a large knife in one rubber-gloved hand. Ty discreetly leaned away from it. \u201cLovely to meet you both,\u201d she said, her smile genuine and warm. \u201cYou\u2019ve come for food, have you?\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced around the kitchen and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re so busy here, we wouldn\u2019t dare bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly!\u201d Aileen said with a wave of her hand that coated Ty in a fine mist of flour. \u201cYou\u2019ve been traveling, and big boys need big food. Here, you just take whatever you need.\u201d She headed back to her work station, offering up the entirety of the kitchen to them.</p><p>Ty gave Deuce a hesitant glance, and Deuce shrugged. They made themselves small plates of food to tide them over until dinner. Zane found himself admiring the pristine kitchen. There were four ovens, two glass-fronted refrigerators, a large stainless steel walk-in freezer, and what seemed like miles of counter space full of pots, pans, appliances, and food. The walls were made of stone, decorated with carved figures. It seemed supremely odd that a kitchen would be covered with carved angels, but he swiftly realized a subterranean room this expansive could only have begun life as one thing: a chapel.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get out of your hair now, Mrs. Boyd,\u201d Deuce called. She waved cheerily, and they took their plates with them and headed back up the winding stairwell to the main hall.</p><p>Deuce led them toward what he called the morning room, and there they found several small tables set up for dining. At one of them, a man was polishing a brass candlestick with a blue cloth. He startled when they appeared, then put a hand to his chest and smiled at them. \u201cGave me a bit of a jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hamish,\u201d Deuce offered. \u201cI\u2019m giving my brother and his partner a little tour. Guys, this is Hamish Boyd, the house manager. Hamish, this is Ty and Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyd?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cDid we just meet your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, if you were exploring the kitchen.\u201d Hamish finished his polishing and set the candlestick back in its rightful spot. \u201cWould you like anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Hamish, thank you,\u201d Deuce answered.</p><p>Hamish gave a nod and picked up another candlestick to polish. Ty turned until he was staring at Deuce, a smirk curling his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have a butler. I\u2019m judging you so hard right now,\u201d Ty said under his breath.</p><p>Zane tried desperately to muffle his laughter as the tour continued.</p><p>Nick and Kelly followed Livi into the suite she had designated as theirs. The room was modern, with silver-toned floors and ebony-stained furniture. A four-poster bed with sparkling, gray netting sat opposite an intricate fireplace, complete with an ornate mirror and corbels carved into angels. A silver chandelier cast gentle light on sumptuous gray-toned linens.</p><p>On the outside of the door was a little wooden sign with their names carved in it, a stylized ampersand between, hung with a red ribbon. Livi blushed as Nick looked it over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I completely misunderstood when Ty called and told me the name of your guest,\u201d she said. \u201cI can have another placard made for you.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed and jerked his thumb at Kelly. \u201cBlame the doc, he\u2019s the one with the girl name.\u201d</p><p>Kelly jabbed him in the ribs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re up to your ears in things to deal with, so you can mark us right off your list. We\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded in agreement, still trying to catch his breath. The little girl kept grinning at Nick, reaching her hand out to him, but Nick wasn\u2019t comfortable responding. He didn\u2019t handle children well.</p><p>Livi smiled, her shoulders slumping in relief. She hitched Amelia higher on her hip. \u201cThank you both. For so many things. I can\u2019t even begin.\u201d</p><p>Nick managed a weak smile at Amelia before meeting Livi\u2019s eyes again. He could see the strain around her eyes and mouth, the worry she was trying to hide behind the task of being a hostess. This was not the way a blushing bride was supposed to feel. For the first time, Nick truly began to worry.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you to rest up,\u201d Livi said. \u201cThere\u2019s a welcome dinner tonight at seven on the back patio. After that, Deacon and I will try to fill you guys in on what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Nick said, keeping his voice gentle.</p><p>Kelly held his fist up as Livi passed, and Amelia gave him a fist bump over her mother\u2019s shoulder. She giggled as Livi carried her out. Kelly chuckled and pushed the heavy door shut after them, leaving him and Nick alone for the first time in almost twenty-four hours.</p><p>They stared at each other for a few seconds, and just as Nick was about to step closer, Kelly smiled slyly and moved away. He peered at the fireplace, walking with his hands in his pockets. Nick trailed after him, watching the way Kelly\u2019s shoulders moved, the way he cocked his head and exposed his neck.</p><p>\u201cKels,\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>Kelly turned to grin at him. \u201cWhen are we going to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we tell Ty now, he\u2019ll go ballistic, and we\u2019ll ruin that poor girl\u2019s wedding. And you know it.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. \u201cSo . . . the plane ride home so he can\u2019t be armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Nick growled. He took a last step and grabbed Kelly by his upper arms, shoving him against the paneled wall beside the fireplace. He pressed their bodies together and kissed Kelly hungrily.</p><p>Kelly flailed, reaching out to grab at the closest thing for leverage. His hand fell on one of the angel corbels, the one whose bent wing was attached to the fireplace by a dainty ball and chain. Something clinked inside the fireplace, and before they could break the kiss, the wall gave way behind Kelly\u2019s back and they both went tumbling into a hollow space behind it.</p><p>Nick tried to catch himself on the edge of the new opening, but Kelly didn\u2019t let go of him and they crashed gracelessly to the floor. They were both laughing before the dust settled.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d Kelly groaned, still giggling. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>Nick pushed himself up, looking around. The walls were hollow, with at least two or three feet of space between the thick stone and plaster of each room. The passageway came to a dead end where the hallway was, but in the other direction it seemed to turn a corner on the outer wall. Shafts of light pierced the darkness in odd places, highlighting cobwebs and floating dust motes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis place just gets creepier and creepier,\u201d Nick muttered. He shoved up, helping Kelly off the floor and dusting both of them off. They peered at the bend in the passageway, then met each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWant to see where it goes?\u201d Kelly asked, his eyes sparkling.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>They got out their phones, turning on the flashlight apps. Kelly took the lead, Nick\u2019s hand on the small of his back as they moved together with practiced ease in the small space. When they got to the bend in the passageway, it stretched off in both directions like Nick had suspected, but it also presented them with a narrow set of stone spiral stairs. They each aimed their lights in opposite directions. Several feet off, the wall came down so low they would have to crawl to get under it. Nick assumed that was the window casing.</p><p>\u201cUp or down?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick put his lips against Kelly\u2019s ear, smiling. \u201cDown.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shivered, leaning back into Nick\u2019s hand briefly. They managed not to give in to temptation just then and instead headed down the steps to see where they\u2019d end up. The steps were so narrow Nick\u2019s foot didn\u2019t fit on them even if he turned it sideways. His shoulders brushed both sides of the staircase. He was glad he wasn\u2019t claustrophobic because it felt a little like getting stuck in a hole as they descended.</p><p>Kelly looked at him once the staircase was so tight that he had to turn to get down it. \u201cGuess this rules out showing Ty this shit.\u201d</p> <p>Nick nodded. Ty would go into a full-fledged panic trying to get down these things.</p><p>At the base of the staircase it opened up again. There were more shafts of light that Nick guessed were peepholes into rooms. He also assumed there were more ways in and out, but he saw no indications along the walls. Kelly went to the first peephole and peered through, then made room for Nick to look.</p><p>The room beyond was the gentleman\u2019s study, decorated with heavy, rich materials rather than light, modern ones like the other rooms they\u2019d seen. Green medallion carpeting, heavy wood, leather seating. The walls were paneled in leather, and the scent of expensive cigars lingered even over the smell of ancient wood inside the passage.</p><p>Deuce and Zane were sitting in leather club chairs near the fireplace, and Ty was perched on the arm of Zane\u2019s chair as they talked.</p><p>Deuce was in the middle of speaking to Ty. \u201cThe Stantons are very . . . please don\u2019t wave any weaponry or kill anything in their presence.\u201d</p><p>Ty held up his hand. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Girl Scout pledge, Ty,\u201d Deuce observed, deadpan.</p><p>Ty looked at the fingers he\u2019d raised and then sneered at Deuce.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really expecting us to need weaponry, are you, Deuce?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cHe never needs an excuse,\u201d Deuce\u2019s reply was as long-suffering as his gesture at Ty. They laughed, but then Deuce grew serious once more. \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t know. When we sit down tonight with Theodore, I think we\u2019ll all learn a little more about it.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane both gave worried nods.</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing your friends,\u201d Deuce added. He sounded weary.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Ty glanced up and around the study, like he was sensing something off. He visibly shivered. \u201cThis place gives me the creeps, man.\u201d</p><p>Deuce laughed.</p> <p>\u201cNo, seriously, I feel eyes on me in here.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted. Nick quickly clapped a hand over his mouth and nose, biting his own lip so he wouldn\u2019t laugh as well.</p><p>Ty\u2019s head whipped around and his eyes darted back and forth over the section of wall they were behind. His sharp hearing had picked up on them, and the display of his predatory senses made the hairs on the back of Nick\u2019s neck stand up. He gripped Kelly tighter, and they both held their breath.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Deuce laughed harder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ty, the walls are talking to you,\u201d Zane teased.</p><p>\u201cI heard something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two go get some rest before dinner,\u201d Deuce urged, still snickering. \u201cBefore Ty opens up some sort of paranormal investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d Ty insisted as his piercing eyes raked over their hiding spot one last time. Nick wondered how in the hell the peepholes were concealed if Ty couldn\u2019t spot it. Ty turned to follow Deuce and Zane out, but Nick could tell he was on the alert now just by the way he carried himself. His voice trailed off as they left the room. \u201cThis place is creepy, Deacon.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly barely held in their laughter.</p><p>Kelly grinned widely. \u201cThis could be fun. Want to see where else it leads?\u201d</p><p>Nick was grinning and nodding. \u201cWant to go get naked first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He took Nick\u2019s hand and tugged him toward the stone steps.</p><p>Ty could hear Nick and Kelly arguing as he and Zane approached their room. Nick and Kelly were in the next room over from them, with a cute little wooden placard with their names carved on it. Ty laughed and pointed it out to Zane. Though the way Nick and Kelly were, it was likely neither of them cared. They\u2019d probably be fighting over who\u2019d get to take it home by the end of the week.</p><p>He stood at their door and cocked his head to listen, but he couldn\u2019t make out the words of the argument. They were interspersed with laughter, though, so Ty wasn\u2019t all too concerned about it being a real fight. He gave the door a knock, then tested the knob to see if it was unlocked and shoved it open.</p><p>He stopped short when he encountered Nick and Kelly on the queen-sized bed they were sharing. Nick was reclining against the headboard in nothing but his boxers and a worn-out Red Sox T-shirt, and Kelly was kneeling beside him holding a small tube of something.</p><p>\u201cWas that really fucking necessary?\u201d Nick demanded as he wiped a runny white substance off his calf.</p><p>Kelly was laughing hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it just shot out!\u201d</p><p>Both men glanced up when they noticed Ty and Zane in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Ty asked in horror.</p><p>Kelly held up the tube. \u201cFirst aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s making a goddamn mess is what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Nick corrected. He scratched at his calf.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s scratching himself bloody, I was trying to put this hydrocortisone cream on him while I had him immobile,\u201d Kelly explained. \u201cBut the plane ride must have made it separate or something, \u2019cause . . . I\u2019ve never seen this shit do that.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed.</p><p>Kelly shoved at his knee to make him turn onto his side, and then he put the tip of the tube at his calf where the skin had been scratched red. When he squeezed it, though, another thin stream of opaque liquid shot out instead of the thick cream it was supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obscene,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Kelly laughed harder and wiped at Nick\u2019s leg before it could drip to the sheets.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Nick shouted. \u201cWhat kind of janky fucking medic are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tube of cream, how hard is this exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s separated!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in the wet spot tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not my fault!\u201d</p><p>Zane finally lost it at that. Laughing, he strolled into the room and sat on the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Ty said, moving closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know what I thought was going on in here.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced up, scowling as he scratched at his calf.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still itching, there\u2019s no bite or anything there,\u201d Kelly grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even allergic to anything,\u201d Ty added. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m itchy,\u201d Nick grumbled. \u201cI think this place knows I\u2019m Irish.\u201d</p><p>Kelly barked a laugh. He placed the cap on the tube and shook it vigorously. The same persistent liquid shot out from under the tightened cap, hitting Nick in the face.</p><p>Nick howled and flopped to his side, covering his face and laughing raucously. Kelly pitched forward, cackling so hard he had to rest his head on Nick\u2019s hip. Zane practically guffawed.</p><p>\u201cYou got it in my mouth!\u201d Nick finally cried. He rolled to his back, pawing at his face.</p><p>Kelly was hooting and snorting and wheezing too hard to answer. He buried his face against Nick\u2019s stomach and shook his head, holding the dripping tube of cream up.</p><p>\u201cIn my mouth! Is this shit poisonous? Am I going to die?\u201d Nick fumbled on the bedside table for his water bottle, gulped it down and wiped at his face frantically with a pillow.</p><p>Kelly brought the tube of cortisone cream up again, and when Nick caught sight of it he rolled out of bed and thumped to the hardwood floor. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking come near me with that shit! I\u2019d rather be itchy!\u201d</p><p>Kelly tried to argue, but he still couldn\u2019t catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a shower,\u201d Nick cried, distraught. He pulled his shirt off and wiped his face with it, then disappeared into the bathroom and slammed the door.</p><p>Zane was holding his stomach, trying to sit up and laugh at the same time. Kelly chuckled. He quickly capped the tube then tossed it toward the trash can. He looked around for something to wipe his hands off on and Ty backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cThere were so many things wrong with that,\u201d Ty told him, close to giggling.</p><p>Kelly snorted. \u201cWhat did you guys need?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t even fucking remember.\u201d</p><p>Zane cackled. \u201cI feel like I just watched free porn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look at this shit we found earlier,\u201d Kelly said, grinning like a little boy as he hopped past Ty toward the fireplace. He reached up to one of the carved angels on its knees with its hands clasped. A chain ran through its broken wing and attached to a ball higher up the corbel. He pulled the angel\u2019s head.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a glance, and Ty put two fingers to his lips to indicate Kelly may have been toking earlier rather than resting. Zane snorted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d Kelly said. He tried again, tugging at the angel\u2019s head. Again, nothing happened. He glanced over his shoulder at them. \u201cI swear to God this thing opened a door earlier.\u201d</p><p>Ty snickered.</p><p>Kelly looked it over with a deep frown, pushing on the wall next to the fireplace. \u201cNo, seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe you, Doc,\u201d Zane said kindly.</p><p>\u201cNo! There was a door here! The walls are hollow, and there are stairs and everything,\u201d Kelly insisted. He glanced at the bathroom door. \u201cNick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nick called from the bathroom. The water shut off. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>Zane began to laugh again.</p><p>Kelly put his shoulder into the wall, leaning against it. He reached up to tug the angel\u2019s head again. \u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>Nick came out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist. He watched Kelly for a few seconds before saying, \u201cPull its wing.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at him, then up at the carving. He pulled the fragile-looking wing and something clicked within the fireplace. The wall gave way against Kelly\u2019s shoulder, and he stumbled sideways before catching himself.</p><p>Zane stood, and Ty took a step forward, eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d Zane cried.</p><p>Ty took another step, peering into the dark passageway. \u201cHow the hell did you find that?\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at Nick, opening his mouth and closing it like a fish.</p><p>\u201cHe, uh,\u201d Nick said quickly. \u201cHe tripped over the wood holder down there. Grabbed at it when he fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you follow it?\u201d Zane asked, his brown eyes gleaming.</p><p>Ty was struck speechless for a moment, just staring at him. Good Lord, the man was beautiful. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he\u2019d just missed Zane so much, but he was pretty sure Zane had grown even more attractive while he\u2019d been deployed. The sprinkling of silver in the hair at his temples had increased, and the light in his eyes was there more often than not. He\u2019d slimmed down, losing a little of the bulk in his muscles, but he was still trim, and his suits seemed to fit just a little better than they had. There was a weightlessness to him now as well that hadn\u2019t been there before, like the burden of his past had finally been shed.</p><p>Not lifted, no. No one had lifted Zane\u2019s burden for him; he had shed it himself, like a caterpillar unfolding its wings to become a butterfly. Ty would never tell Zane he thought of him like a butterfly, of course.</p><p>\u201cWe followed it a little way,\u201d Nick answered, reminding Ty that no one else in the room was smitten and they were still talking. \u201cDown to the study. We saw you two in there with Deacon.\u201d</p><p>Ty pointed a finger in his face. \u201cI knew someone was watching me!\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou let me think I was being stalked by a ghost, you fuck nuts!\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed harder. He pushed at the angel\u2019s wing, and the opening in the wall creaked closed.</p><p>\u201cAre there more doorways?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Kelly shrugged. Ty grumbled at Nick and shoved him lightly, and Nick swatted at him.</p><p>\u201cWe can go back in later and explore,\u201d Kelly said, grinning like the Cheshire Cat.</p><p>\u201cI think something in there made me itchy,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not allergic to anything,\u201d Kelly argued.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I showered and I\u2019m not itchy anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got groped by a ghost,\u201d Ty teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ghost gave you crabs,\u201d Ty added as he hopped toward the door.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Nick was looking around for something to throw, and Ty darted for the door. He and Zane made their escape as Kelly peered at the wall and the angel who was chained to the fireplace and Nick hunted for a projectile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>Zane and Ty had just enough time to shower and wind down, and that was what they did. Together. When the water started running cold, they turned it off and stayed in the shower for several more minutes, until it got cold enough to drive them into the bed and under the covers. They fell asleep wrapped up in each other.</p><p>When Zane woke, he slipped out of Ty\u2019s arms and pulled on a robe. He headed for the doors to the balcony and stood leaning against the frame, gazing out at the gardens, the cliffs, and the choppy ocean beyond.</p> <p>The bed creaked, and he turned. Ty was sitting on the edge, wearing only his sweatpants, watching him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked after another moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. I didn\u2019t figure it would be so fucking beautiful. But it\u2019s . . . rugged and captivating.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes strayed to the pristine vista behind Zane, then back to Zane. He smiled slowly.</p><p>\u201cKind of like someone else I know,\u201d Zane added. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI sense mischief brewing.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood and joined Zane by the doors. Zane turned, and Ty stopped in the doorway, facing him with the same crooked smile still on his lips. It felt like he had something important to say, but the surroundings seemed to be outdoing him. Beyond the manicured gardens below, a sheer cliff stretched in either direction, ushering the angry sea along its way.</p> <p>\u201cTy?\u201d</p><p>Ty took a deep breath and grasped Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to now?\u201d Zane asked, even more suspicious.</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught. His hand involuntarily tightened on Ty\u2019s, and all he could do was stare into Ty\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d never dreamed he\u2019d hear Ty say those words, especially not so soon after returning home. He\u2019d never dreamed he\u2019d experience half the things Ty had offered him. He brought Ty\u2019s hand to his lips and kissed his fingers, inhaling deeply to calm everything that was suddenly churning inside him.</p><p>Zane did want to marry Ty. But he didn\u2019t want it yet, not when they still had so much to learn about themselves and each other.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane repeated shakily. Ty huffed. Thank God he looked bemused instead of upset, one eyebrow cocked and a gentle smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane repeated, more confident this time. He was relieved Ty didn\u2019t appear to be hurt, but he also knew how well Ty could hide his feelings. He took Ty\u2019s face in his hands, hurrying to explain. \u201cI know you, Ty. And I know the thought probably just popped into your mind. You haven\u2019t thought it through. You haven\u2019t looked at it from any angle other than the one we can see from our balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it any less sincere,\u201d Ty said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI know, doll.\u201d Zane took a deep breath, wishing he had the words to explain just what Ty meant to him, how much he really did want what Ty was asking. The time just wasn\u2019t right. It didn\u2019t feel right saying yes, not after they\u2019d been apart for so long, not after all that had happened to them. Not after they\u2019d both changed so much. Nothing seemed like an adequate explanation, though, not when so much of him wanted to just say yes. Instead he sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s . . . let\u2019s get to know each other again first. And you give it as much thought as I do everything. And if you can convince me you\u2019ve done that, then when you ask me, I\u2019ll answer as fast as you always do.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips quirked up, and he didn\u2019t take his eyes off Zane\u2019s when he leaned back. \u201cYou\u2019re saying no?\u201d</p> <p>Zane stepped closer and kissed him. His lips moved against Ty\u2019s when he murmured, \u201cI\u2019m saying no for now.\u201d</p><p>Ty cupped his cheek, his fingers playing with the tips of Zane\u2019s curls. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep asking until you say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d Zane grinned, drawling when he added, \u201cTry to be creative next time, huh?\u201d</p><p>Ty kissed him one last time, then shoved at his chest and patted his cheek hard. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he grunted before turning away.</p><p>Zane reached past Ty on both sides to grasp the doorframe, trapping him in place. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Ty smirked, jutting his chin out for a kiss. Just before their lips brushed, there was a loud rap on the door.</p><p>Zane pulled back, and Ty huffed in irritation. \u201cAnd so it begins.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled and let Ty loose, going to his suitcase to unpack and to find clothes for dinner. When Ty opened the door, Mara Grady threw herself into his arms and hugged him tightly.</p><p>He laughed in surprise and returned the hug. \u201cHey, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018Hey, Ma,\u2019 me! Why the hell didn\u2019t you come see me as soon as you got here? Gone a year\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess than six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and can\u2019t come see his mother,\u201d she scolded, holding him by his broad shoulders and shaking him. Then she hugged him again, pressing her cheek against his chest and patting his back.</p><p>\u201cMissed you too, Ma.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled and moved closer.</p><p>Mara released Ty and practically shoved him aside as she stalked into the room. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you can hide from me,\u201d she told Zane. \u201cGet over here and give me a hug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Zane said, and the smile on his face was honest when he hugged her.</p><p>\u201cYou boys both look so handsome!\u201d Mara said, even though Zane was still wearing his robe and Ty was in a ratty pair of sweatpants.</p><p>Ty laughed, rubbing a hand over his chin as he closed the door. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill trying to convince your grandfather that we did not just hit the shore of Guadalcanal and he should not hit anyone on the head with that shovel.\u201d Mara released Zane and put her hands on her hips.</p><p>Ty was biting his lip hard as he tried not to smile. \u201cDid you come for reinforcements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Mara said thoughtfully. \u201cMight not be a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he really bring the shovel? On the plane?\u201d Zane asked, not suppressing his laughter very well.</p><p>Mara shrugged. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t come otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should make an impression on the in-laws anyway,\u201d Ty said under his breath. \u201cDo you know where your room is, Ma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the other wing. Old farts and married folks are over there. Young troublemakers are shacked up on this side.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed before he could stop himself.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of troublemakers, where\u2019s Nicholas? I\u2019ve got a hug for him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Doc are in the next room,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cDoc? Which one was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who lost his parents when he was young. I brought him home for Thanksgiving one time. You told him you wanted to wrap him up and bake him in a pie and he never came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that one! Oh, he\u2019s a cutie. Little skittish. Well, make sure Nick comes to say hello to me and your daddy, got it? Earl was asking after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I just wanted to come get a hug before you got into trouble,\u201d she told them as she headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhy does everyone assume I\u2019m going to get into trouble?\u201d Ty asked, his brow creasing with frown lines.</p><p>\u201cBecause we know you, baby,\u201d Mara told him. She walked by him, patting his cheek. \u201cSee you boys at dinner.\u201d</p><p>After shutting the door, Ty shot Zane an evil grin that damn near caused them to be late. Thankfully, it was a casual affair, or they never would have gotten ready in time. As it was, Ty was still tucking his shirt in and fixing his tie as they made their way to the back patio of the massive house.</p><p>Someone whistled from behind them as they were hustling down the stairs. Zane glanced over his shoulder to find Nick and Kelly, both looking well rested and more relaxed than they had been. It was also the first time Zane had ever seen either man in a suit.</p><p>\u201cYou dirty whores,\u201d Nick drawled quietly.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty mumbled, still fussing with his tie.</p><p>Zane just smiled and gave Nick a cheeky wink. They headed for the party with a handful of other guests. Zane didn\u2019t know the numbers, but he estimated there were roughly thirty people on the island, with another hundred due to show up the day of the ceremony. Not a large wedding for such a prominent family. It was just family and friends, perhaps, but no business associates. Zane knew how these affairs went, and he found that particularly odd.</p><p>He glanced at Ty, his body warming all over. Ty had asked him to marry him. He\u2019d been entirely sincere, too, in the way only Ty could be when he thought of something spur of the moment. It brought a smile unbidden to Zane\u2019s lips, and he quickly schooled his expression to something a little less giddy as they joined the crowd.</p><p>The patio was full of outdoor heaters and covered with a large party tent with plastic windows and ties to keep the doors closed against the wind. The tent protected parts of the garden, too, giving the space an outdoor feel without the outdoor frostbite to accompany it.</p><p>While Ty and Zane had been placed at the table of honor with Deuce and Livi, Nick and Kelly were at the next table over with the other members of the wedding party. They split off and took their seats just in time, beating Deuce and Livi by mere seconds.</p><p>Zane knew everyone at their table except the older couple he assumed were the Stantons, and a younger man who was probably Livi\u2019s brother. They didn\u2019t have time for introductions before a man approached the table to say hello. Ty and Deuce both stood abruptly, and it startled Zane and the Stantons into flinching when they did it. Zane glanced up to see Assistant Director Richard Burns standing there.</p><p>Ty reached out to shake Burns\u2019s hand. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler. Deacon,\u201d Burns said as he shook Ty\u2019s and then Deuce\u2019s hands. He turned to Ty\u2019s father, Earl, who was in the process of pushing back his chair to stand. They embraced warmly.</p><p>Livi cleared her throat. \u201cMama, Daddy, this is Director Richard Burns, a dear friend of the Grady family.\u201d</p><p>The tall, white-haired man stood and offered a hand to Burns. \u201cTheodore Stanton. Pleased to meet you, Director. This is my wife, Susan.\u201d</p><p>As they exchanged greetings, Livi continued. \u201cAnd this is Tyler Grady, Deacon\u2019s brother. And Special Agent Zane Garrett, Ty\u2019s partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you all,\u201d Zane said, standing and shaking Stanton\u2019s hand when it was offered, just as Ty had done.</p><p>Burns took Livi\u2019s hand in a dainty, formal greeting. \u201cCongratulations, my dear, you look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Director, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded to them all, then gave Earl a wink and patted his lapel pocket as he turned away. \u201cEarl, I\u2019ll find you later.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand sought out Zane\u2019s under the table, squeezing. Then his thumb stroked over Zane\u2019s palm, and any anger or resentment aimed toward the director that had been bubbling inside Zane began to fade. He glanced at Ty to find the man watching him.</p><p>Ty mouthed a silent, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>They engaged in only a couple minutes of small talk before Deuce and Livi stood and Deuce tapped his crystal glass with a knife. The room quickly went quiet, all eyes turning toward them.</p><p>\u201cGood evening everyone,\u201d Deuce said, just loud enough to reach all the tables. He possessed a certain presence, like a man accustomed to speaking to large crowds or being in the spotlight. He smiled as he spoke. \u201cYou are our nearest and dearest, and we want to thank you all for making this journey to be here with us.\u201d</p><p>He waited a beat, and Livi took over. \u201cDeacon and I decided that we wanted our families and friends to enjoy this as much as we will, which is why you were all invited to stay for the entire week with us.\u201d She turned a loving smile up to Deacon. He hugged her around her slim waist. \u201cRehearsals and planning are being kept to a bare minimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust enough to make sure we don\u2019t make fools of ourselves,\u201d Deuce assured everyone, drawing laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd so we can all get the most out of this experience. We ask you to please enjoy yourselves this week as our most beloved guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you partake of the open bar, please stay away from the cliffs.\u201d</p><p>More laughter arose from the crowd, and as Deuce held his glass up to toast, it was followed by applause.</p><p>Waitstaff appeared to man the buffet. Zane stayed in his seat and watched as others got in line. He smiled when Deuce hugged Livi and kissed her forehead. He tried to remember what he\u2019d felt like before his wedding, but he couldn\u2019t recall much of anything beyond nerves. Deuce and Livi looked anything but nervous, despite whatever trouble was apparently brewing.</p><p>They were a good couple, and Zane was genuinely happy for them.</p><p>When his eyes met Ty\u2019s, he found his partner relaxed in his seat and watching him with a small smile. Ty winked at him, flushing Zane\u2019s body with the same convictions he\u2019d experienced the first time that wink had hit him. He lifted his water glass and toasted Ty before pushing out of his chair to join the buffet line.</p><p>As soon as dinner wound down and people moved on to drinks and dancing, Deuce stood and tilted his head at Ty to indicate they should go inside.</p><p>Ty turned to seek out Nick or Kelly, and immediately found Nick\u2019s sharp eyes on him. He waved at him to follow, and Nick nodded.</p><p>At the doorway to the study, a man was standing with a metal-detecting wand. Ty stopped and spread his legs, holding his hands out. Zane did the same as he followed Ty into the study. Ty was still glancing around the room when a commotion arose behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy am I being wanded?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cJust stand still,\u201d the guard ordered.</p><p>\u201cI am standing still,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWhat, does that thing not work when I\u2019m talking? It gets distracted? It\u2019s a metal detector with ADD?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus Christ, Kels, just let him wand you,\u201d Nick said, rubbing his eyes as he stood behind Kelly, waiting for his turn.</p><p>\u201cI usually get dinner first. No, that\u2019s a lie,\u201d Kelly said as the man waved the wand over his chest.</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat and nodded, but his eyes were sparkling when he stepped into the room. Nick stood obediently and let the man wand him, but just as Ty knew it would, the wand went off at Nick\u2019s thigh near his pocket.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a weapon on you, sir?\u201d the guard asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nick unbuttoned his jacket and turned his suit pocket inside out. \u201cIt\u2019s shrapnel in my thigh. There are certain frequencies it sets off.\u201d</p> <p>The man patted Nick\u2019s thigh down, then wanded him again after finding nothing in his pocket. Nick narrowed his eyes. When the man looked up at him, Nick shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot taking my pants off, man.\u201d</p><p>The security guy snorted and waved him past.</p><p>They were joined in the study by Livi\u2019s father, Theodore Stanton, and her brother, whose name had escaped Ty. Two other men followed along and positioned themselves at the door of the study, not being discreet at all about the fact that they were Stanton\u2019s private security. They called each other English and Hardin. Ty had pegged them as ex-military as soon as he\u2019d seen them, and he guessed the others had as well.</p><p>One more man joined them. Despite the casual evening, he was wearing a suit and vest. His movements were fast and nervous, and his forehead glistened with sweat. He carried a smooth worry stone in his hand, and he was almost continuously rubbing his thumb over it. Stanton introduced him as Ernest Milton, the company\u2019s head of operations. He seemed pretty young for such a prestigious position, which probably explained his obvious stress-related issues.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Stanton said as he poured himself a drink and took a thick cigar out of a humidor on a desk in the corner of the room. \u201cI understand Deacon asked you to come here as added security.\u201d</p> <p>Ty raised an eyebrow. He glanced over his shoulder at Nick and Kelly, who were both frowning hard but not yet looking defensive.</p><p>Stanton took a deep breath and looked at his daughter, his expression softening. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in too much rather than too little, so thank you. And welcome.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Ty, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Nick\u2019s shoulders relax. They\u2019d been expecting a little resistance.</p><p>Stanton continued. \u201cMy family has always received threats. That\u2019s the way of the business, I\u2019m afraid. But when news of Amelia\u2019s birth got out, some of those threats turned their attention to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Ty practically growled.</p><p>\u201cTo be perfectly blunt: as leverage.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane both turned to Deuce. He\u2019d gone considerably paler. He met Ty\u2019s eyes and nodded. \u201cKidnapping her and using her to force Theodore to make decisions for the company.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s blood began to boil at the mere thought. These people had no fucking idea what kind of fire they were playing with if they came after Amelia.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut what do you do that\u2019s so important to your competitors to warrant threats of that magnitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago, we bid on a defense contract. It was awarded to us over four other companies. There are some . . . sensitive projects being undertaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it escalated since then?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cWe received several specific threats regarding the wedding, yes,\u201d Deuce said, his voice hoarse. \u201cNot just to Amelia, but to Livi, myself, and Theodore and Susan. That\u2019s why we moved the timetable and cut the guest list down to bare essentials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo at its core, this is a corporate espionage issue,\u201d Kelly muttered. He and Nick shared a look. \u201cYou should have asked Owen to be your date.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave him a solemn nod. \u201cBut at least you put out.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced back at them with a frown. Neither man was laughing.</p><p>Zane was sitting on the edge of the couch, resting his elbows on his knees. He\u2019d been quiet so far, but he finally took the opportunity to speak. \u201cWere there any specifics? Any indication of how they intended to strike or what they were after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought the communications for you to look at,\u201d Deuce said, and headed for the desk to retrieve a flash drive. He held it up, looking guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know you\u2019re not on the job right now. I feel bad putting this on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about my niece, Deacon, fuck the job,\u201d Ty growled. He stood and took the flash drive, then handed it to Zane.</p><p>The nervous head of operations, Milton, finally spoke up. \u201cOur security is well prepared for any eventuality. We don\u2019t anticipate a problem. Everyone here, with the exception of these two,\u201d he added, gesturing to Nick and Kelly, \u201chas been vetted with background checks.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up in time to see Kelly narrow his eyes and Nick bristle. Ty cleared his throat. \u201cYour company\u2019s security clearance isn\u2019t high enough to check their backgrounds, so don\u2019t bother.\u201d</p><p>The man sniffed, dismissing Ty\u2019s words with a wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThese are people I trust to protect my daughter,\u201d Deuce said, his voice going hard. He examined the two bodyguards. \u201cAll due respect for your preparedness, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottom line, gentlemen, we don\u2019t expect trouble,\u201d Stanton announced before more words could be exchanged. \u201cBut if trouble comes, we intend to deal with it in-house.\u201d He nodded toward the two bodyguards at the door.</p><p>\u201cWe have five men on the island, with constant patrols,\u201d the man called English said. His eyes went from Ty to Nick and Kelly. \u201cOur files indicate you\u2019re Marines, is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ty answered. He surveyed the man up and down. He was huge, with biceps the circumference of small trees, and a chest that looked more like a barrel of ale and produced a deep, echoing voice. His head was shaved clean, and his brown eyes were sharp and observant.</p><p>\u201cGreen Beret?\u201d Nick asked out of the blue. Ty had to quickly look down at his hand to hide a smile.</p><p>English stiffened. He nodded, his jaw tightening. He obviously didn\u2019t like that someone could peg him without the benefit of a file. \u201cForce Recon team Sidewinder. Now defunct.\u201d</p><p>The other bodyguard, Hardin, grinned, showing his crooked teeth. \u201cSidewinder. Like the snake.\u201d The room was silent, waiting for his point. \u201cYou know what they used to call the Green Berets when we were active?\u201d</p><p>Ty tried hard not to roll his eyes. Behind him, Kelly answered wryly, \u201cSnake Eaters.\u201d</p><p>Both security men chuckled. \u201cBest watch out, Sidewinders. Don\u2019t want to get eaten.\u201d</p><p>Nick barked a laugh. \u201cI appreciate the offer, Hoss, but I got someone taking care of me already.\u201d</p><p>Hardin squared his shoulders, his face growing ruddy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find that someone special,\u201d Kelly assured him, his voice sincere.</p><p>Zane turned to Ty, grumbling under his breath. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get us killed.\u201d</p><p>Ty knocked his knee against Zane\u2019s and fought desperately not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re done here,\u201d Stanton said to Deuce.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait a minute,\u201d Zane said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling us you don\u2019t anticipate trouble, but every move you\u2019ve made so far has been in anticipation of trouble. I get the feeling we\u2019re getting the runaround here. I\u2019d like the whole story.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both made sounds of agreement.</p><p>\u201cLike we\u2019ve said,\u201d Milton grunted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it taken care of. Just enjoy your brother\u2019s wedding and leave the heavy lifting to the professionals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Stanton said, his voice soft but stern. His expression was completely unreadable. \u201cI understand what you men are capable of, and I appreciate your dedication to your family, and to mine. The fact is, we don\u2019t know what to expect. My men will handle the perimeter defense of the activities if the four of you will concentrate on the safety of my daughter and granddaughter.\u201d He gave Livi a fond smile.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a glance. \u201cSir, we\u2019d be honored if you trusted us with that task,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>Stanton came closer and shook his hand. His grip was firm and curt, and he made eye contact and kept it. He then shook the hands of the other three, thanking them for understanding. He left the room, his two bodyguards and Milton trailing after him.</p><p>Livi sat down hard, sighing audibly. \u201cThank you for keeping it mostly civil with Daddy\u2019s guys.\u201d</p><p>Deuce rolled his eyes and limped to the wet bar to make himself a drink.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Amelia now?\u201d Ty asked Livi. \u201cDoes she have a nanny or babysitter or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually, but the island employs a full-time nanny, her name is Maisie. Amelia took to her immediately, they\u2019ve been inseparable ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mother was our nanny when we were young.\u201d Livi waved at her brother. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think I introduced any of you. This is Theo, my older brother. Theo, this is Zane, Ty, Nick, and Kelly.\u201d</p><p>Theo raised his glass to them. \u201cPleasure.\u201d His tone wasn\u2019t convincing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, bud,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Livi cleared her throat and stood, smoothing her hands down her skirt. \u201cWell. I guess we should get back to the party.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat in a chair around an unlit fire pit on the edge of the garden, far enough away from the heaters for it to be a little chilly, nursing his drink and watching the few remaining people mill about the dining area.</p><p>Amelia had long ago been tucked safe in her bed, along with all her cousins. Nick and Kelly had, of course, landed at a table with three of the bridesmaids, including Ty\u2019s baby cousin, Emma. She was a beautiful young woman with a personality to match. Ty would have to remember to threaten both men if they even thought about making a move on her. Nick was the most obvious danger, but Kelly had a way of slipping through the defenses before you noticed him there.</p><p>Deuce and Livi were making the rounds to the last trickle of guests, saying good-night. Zane was standing at the end of the bar, water glass in hand, stuck talking to another of the groomsmen. He finally made his escape as Ty watched. He had to smirk when Zane strolled toward him, one hand in a pocket, his shoulders thrown back and relaxed. He\u2019d taken his tie off and loosened the top few buttons of his shirt, and he cut an impressive figure.</p><p>Ty bit his lip. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he said under his breath. Zane saw his expression and smiled as he came closer.</p><p>Soon the patio was empty enough for Deuce and Livi to retreat into the darkness of the gardens and sit with Ty. They both looked exhausted. Ty held his glass up and tapped it against Livi\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTo the lovely bride,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo my future brother,\u201d she replied, grinning. \u201cGod help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mind if I smoke?\u201d Deuce asked as he dug into his jacket.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you share,\u201d Livi answered wryly.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a cigarette Deuce pulled from his pocket, though. Ty laughed in exasperation. \u201cHow did you get that through airport security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate plane, man. What, you thought I was marrying her for her personality?\u201d</p><p>Livi snorted. Zane materialized out of the shadows and settled in next to Ty, who set his glass on the ground and wrapped an arm around Zane\u2019s shoulders. Zane leaned into him, and they shared a kiss before he propped his feet on the fire pit.</p><p>Just as Deuce was getting ready to light up, they noticed Nick, Kelly, and Emma heading their way. Deuce glanced at Ty. \u201cNick still a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Little far from his jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he go hardass? Like . . . forget-who-his-friends-are kind of cop?\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more likely to arrest you than he is,\u201d Zane told Deuce.</p><p>Nick and Kelly came strolling over, Emma between them with one arm hooked through each of theirs. She was a natural blonde with hints of strawberry and darker tones in her long hair, and it was split into two messy ties just behind her ears. She was tan and fit with an athletic, curvy build and delicate features, and her eyes were a deep green. She\u2019d always been a pretty girl with a mischievous personality, just the type Nick and Kelly both would probably be drawn to. Ty gave her skimpy cocktail dress a disapproving once-over.</p><p>\u201cDid they forget to sell you the rest of that dress, sweetheart?\u201d Ty asked her.</p><p>\u201cI got it half-price,\u201d she answered with an unconcerned shrug. Ty laughed and stood to hug her. She let go of Nick and Kelly and threw her arms around Ty\u2019s neck, hugging him so hard that he staggered backward.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had better taste than these two,\u201d Ty finally grunted with a nod at his friends.</p><p>She stepped back and smacked Ty in the side of the head. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in forever!\u201d She turned to Zane and stuck out her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re Zane, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Zane. I\u2019m Emma, Ty\u2019s poor, neglected cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit bitching, I called you on your birthday. Last year,\u201d Ty said as he sat back down.</p><p>Emma gave them both a big grin. \u201cMara told me you two were cute together,\u201d she said, completely devoid of any tact, just like Ty and the rest of the family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane seemed to struggle with that piece of news. \u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to still be a secret, is it?\u201d she asked worriedly. Ty shook his head. She rolled her eyes in relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good, \u2019cause everyone knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Ty grunted. He\u2019d known his extended family would all find out sooner rather than later because that was how his mother rolled, but it still caused butterflies. He winced at Emma. \u201cGood or bad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say mostly good. Pretty much nobody gives a shit because they all expected you to be dead by thirty. Actually, Elliot won like three hundred bucks on a bet he made with Tag back in high school that you were gay, so Tag\u2019s still kind of pissed at you.\u201d</p><p>Ty barked a laugh.</p><p>Zane shrugged and smiled at Ty. \u201cHell, your opinion\u2019s the only one that matters anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet,\u201d Emma said as she looked Zane up and down. She glanced at Ty. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re going to eat him alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty agreed with a long-suffering nod. \u201cAnd seriously, where\u2019s the rest of your dress?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up, I\u2019m flaunting it while I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat in the chair next to Ty, holding a glass of champagne he\u2019d been nursing. He put his feet up on the fire pit, setting them next to Zane\u2019s. \u201cEmma was telling us about what she does. I still haven\u2019t decided if she\u2019s messing with us or not.\u201d</p><p>Emma laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not messing with you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly repositioned the last stray chair next to Nick and sat down, and Emma perched on his knee for lack of anywhere else to sit. Ty narrowed his eyes at them.</p><p>\u201cEmma has a degree in underwater archaeology,\u201d Deuce provided.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like it\u2019d be interesting. What do you do with that?\u201d Zane asked her.</p> <p>\u201cNot what most people do. I\u2019m a member of a team of researchers who investigate cryptozoological anomalies, historical mysteries, and natural phenomenon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCryptozoological?\u201d Zane repeated incredulously. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . animals that aren\u2019t scientifically recognized, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster?\u201d Livi asked.</p><p>Emma laughed. \u201cAmong others, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Emma laughed harder.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fucking cool, man,\u201d Kelly said, peering through the darkness at Nick. Nick raised both eyebrows but chose to take another sip of champagne rather than comment.</p><p>\u201cThe team\u2019s sort of on hiatus right now,\u201d Emma admitted. \u201cMarley, our camera specialist, came with me to film the wedding. We\u2019re going to make a side trip and see if we can head over to Loch Ness after.\u201d</p> <p>Ty frowned. \u201cWhy are you on hiatus?\u201d</p><p>Emma sighed. \u201cOur expedition leader had a little disagreement with the producers of the show they\u2019re trying to get off the ground, and then he went on strike. They\u2019re trying to find someone to replace him so they won\u2019t have to deal with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re without a team leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. And those are some weird resume requirements, know what I mean? Not only did he have the skills to keep us from getting maimed in the Amazon, but he also had the degrees to qualify as an expert in the fields of history and anthropology. He filled two posts despite being kind of an arrogant asshole. Then our medic went and got pregnant, so we\u2019re down by three spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s a medic,\u201d Ty told her. \u201cAnd Nick\u2019s currently being a jobless bum, plus he knows everything about history there is to know. He could lead your expeditions.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted.</p><p>\u201cReally? You were both Recon like Ty, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head, but Kelly\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhat kind of expeditions are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind with really big snakes to poke,\u201d Emma answered, glancing sideways at Nick.</p><p>They all laughed, and Nick shook his head harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been getting a little restless where I am,\u201d Kelly admitted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind finding out more about this.\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckled as Emma sank her teeth in and started talking up the open positions on her team. He could see Kelly fitting in with a bunch of adventuring whackos like Emma and her crew. Nick would go nuts, though.</p><p>Deuce brought the blunt out again, leaning forward to light it. He was able to take a long drag on it before Nick reached over the fire pit and plucked it out of his mouth.</p><p>Livi laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re being oppressed by the Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave the blunt a sniff. \u201cMedical grade?\u201d</p><p>Deuce smirked and shrugged. \u201cI have a bad leg.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, and to Ty\u2019s surprise he took a short hit before handing it over to Kelly. \u201cThat\u2019s better than your other stuff,\u201d he told Deuce.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Deuce said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about his other stuff?\u201d Ty demanded.</p><p>Nick and Deuce both laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, you think I sucked snake venom out of his leg because he\u2019s a nice guy?\u201d Deuce asked. \u201cI\u2019m just glad he hasn\u2019t turned over any new leaves since then.\u201d</p><p>Ty gaped at Nick, who was snickering and sipping his champagne. \u201cLike I don\u2019t even know you,\u201d Ty said to him.</p><p>Nick merely shrugged.</p><p>They passed the blunt around, Ty and Zane both refraining. Ty didn\u2019t really have any objections to marijuana, but if he didn\u2019t like the way a contact high felt, he knew he wouldn\u2019t like anything stronger. He\u2019d never tried it and didn\u2019t intend to.</p><p>Emma passed the blunt back to Deuce and turned to Livi, her eyes shining. \u201cI want to see your dress tomorrow. I can\u2019t stand waiting any longer!\u201d</p><p>Livi\u2019s laugh was light and carefree. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to show it off to anyone yet, so I\u2019d love that. Bring your bridesmaid dress so I can see if it\u2019s horrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fun! I will!\u201d</p><p>Because of the restricted guest numbers, Deuce and Livi had filled in the ranks of their wedding party with family. Livi\u2019s brother Theo was a groomsman, and Emma was one of Livi\u2019s bridesmaids, even though the two had never met before this week.</p><p>As they continued talking about the wedding colors and the cakes and the dresses, Kelly groaned and rubbed at his eyes.</p><p>Livi settled into the crook of Deuce\u2019s arm, smiling kindly at Kelly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through this, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be as big a disaster as mine was,\u201d Kelly assured her.</p><p>Nick and Ty both made noises of agreement. They\u2019d barely gotten Kelly to that wedding alive, much less gotten him out of the marriage.</p><p>\u201cI remember the tales of that bachelor party,\u201d Deuce said. \u201cWhich is one reason I\u2019m not letting Ty plan mine.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted. \u201cHey, that wasn\u2019t me. I was an innocent victim. Mostly. Sort of innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d Nick confessed.</p><p>\u201cI woke up the morning of my wedding on the front lawn of the church, tied up, with my tux covered in sequins they\u2019d taken from stripper outfits.\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned. \u201cWe Bedazzled him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe minister told me I was the shiniest groom he\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Nick burst out laughing, slumping further in his chair.</p><p>\u201cIt took a long damn time to collect those sequins, too,\u201d Ty added. \u201cWe had to beg every dancer in Jacksonville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just buy a bag of sequins from a craft store?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty and Nick shared a look, both of them frowning. Nick took a drink as Ty muttered, \u201cWow, that would have been easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot near as fun, though,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>\u201cHave any of the rest of you ever been married?\u201d Livi asked.</p><p>Zane raised his hand. Nick shook his head and took another sip of his champagne, but Ty was already snickering and pointing at him. Nick narrowed his eyes as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s been married,\u201d Ty drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kelly asked. Then his eyes widened. \u201cOh! Oh my God, I\u2019d forgotten about that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forget,\u201d Nick insisted. He glared hard at Ty. \u201cWhy the hell would you bring that up?\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed harder.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty, you\u2019ve been married?\u201d Zane blurted.</p><p>\u201cNot . . . no. Sort of,\u201d Nick stuttered. \u201cNot like they\u2019re getting married, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHitched is hitched, man,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cShut up! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re bringing this shit up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ten-year statute of limitations has passed.\u201d</p><p>Nick made an insulted sound that came out squeaky.</p><p>Deuce leaned forward. \u201cDid you get drunkenly married in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes and slumped in his chair. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Zane threw his head back and laughed. Ty pulled him closer. He loved it when Zane got loose and started enjoying himself.</p><p>Ty reached out to pat Nick\u2019s shoulder. Nick shoved him away and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were on leave before deployment,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cWe headed to Vegas because none of us had ever been before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe six of you?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty grinned and nodded. \u201cWe had two days. And we all thought we were going to die on our next deployment, so we went all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that,\u201d Deuce said. \u201cYou told Ma and Dad you were going through extra training or some shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and if you tell them different, I\u2019ll ruin your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Livi cried.</p><p>Ty shrugged, completely unapologetic. \u201cNick went on this craps run. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Just roll after roll of winners. He won over five hundred thousand dollars in like three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt craps?\u201d Zane asked, impressed.</p><p>Nick nodded and took a long drink. \u201cPure luck, no skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasino security frisked him three times looking for loaded dice,\u201d Kelly added.</p><p>\u201cThe next morning we all woke up in the honeymoon suite with six women we didn\u2019t remember meeting,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHeart-shaped bed, champagne, confetti everywhere. Digger was wearing this powder-blue tux with tails, and Johns had nothing on but a cummerbund and a fuzzy tiara that said \u2018bride\u2019 on it.\u201d</p><p>Ty began to giggle uncontrollably. \u201cIt was instant mass panic.\u201d</p><p>Nick tried to add something, but he was laughing too hard to speak. Zane was shaking beside Ty, and Ty could barely breathe as he remembered the scene of that morning. Each man had been trained to deal with life-or-death situations; they were all cool as could be when on the battlefield. But faced with the prospect of one of them having married someone the night before, they had all panicked like a bunch of new recruits tossed into a hot zone.</p><p>Ty and Nick were both laughing so hard they couldn\u2019t breathe. Kelly had to continue the story for them. \u201cWe started checking our fingers for rings. It was like the scariest game of drawing straws ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I had this beautiful engraved gold ring on my finger,\u201d Nick said bitterly. He held up his hand to look at his ring finger as if the memory lingered with him. Knowing his fear of commitment like Ty did, he could imagine Nick literally having nightmares about that morning.</p><p>\u201cHe started cussing and kicking things,\u201d Kelly wheezed. \u201cI mean, just months before this, he\u2019d helped me salvage all my shit from my crazy ex-wife, so it was doubly traumatic for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nick grunted. \u201cMarriage is just a word for some people, but for others it\u2019s a fucking sentence, okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane was holding his side. \u201cOh my God, marriage puns! Oh my God . . .\u201d</p><p>Nick was trying not to grin, but he finally couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cOnce we established I was the victim, then we had to find a girl with a ring on her finger to figure out which one I\u2019d fucking married.\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned against Zane\u2019s arm, laughing so hard he could no longer sit up straight. \u201cThe look on his face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made a marriage pun,\u201d Zane gasped.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re mostly sober,\u201d Nick continued, getting more agitated the harder the others laughed at him. \u201cAnd I tell the girl, look, we need to get this thing annulled fast. Clock\u2019s ticking.\u201d He tapped his watch. \u201cAnd the chick said no!\u201d</p><p>Ty and Kelly both howled, and Nick glanced at each of them with renewed indignation.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t give you an annulment?\u201d Livi asked.</p><p>\u201cNo! She refused, said she liked soldiers. I told her we were Marines, and she said, \u2018Same thing!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cWe had to hold Digger back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever call a Marine a soldier,\u201d Kelly said seriously.</p><p>\u201cThen she fucking asked me what her new last name was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo wait, did you have to get a divorce?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I gave her half of what was left of my winnings from the night before, and carried her ass down to the courthouse to sign the annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou paid a woman not to be married to you?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>Nick nodded solemnly. \u201cWorth every penny.\u201d He raised his champagne glass to Livi. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and shook her head.</p><p>Zane hid his face behind his hand as Ty finally wound down from his fit. \u201cHow much did freedom end up costing you?\u201d Zane asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick threw back the rest of his champagne. \u201cClose to fifty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>The rest of them howled with laughter, but Deuce was shaking his head. \u201cWow,\u201d he finally said. \u201cThose are some impressive commitment issues you have going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk,\u201d Deuce promised.</p><p>The blunt was gone and the night was growing colder. Deuce wrapped his coat around Livi\u2019s shoulders, and they both stood. Livi slid her arm around Deuce\u2019s waist as they said their good-nights and headed inside. He leaned on her, his arm around her. Ty smiled at them. They made a good pair, and his brother was happy. That was all that mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat a gentleman,\u201d Emma cooed. \u201cOkay, whose coat do I get? \u2019Cause I\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go find the rest of your dress,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one complaining!\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m your cousin! Go put some clothes on!\u201d</p><p>Emma stood, freeing Kelly\u2019s lap. She did a little turn, showing off the backless dress. It left very little to the imagination. She shimmied her hips for good measure. Nick and Kelly both tilted their heads like puppies as they watched her. Ty growled at all of them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Tyler, I think it\u2019s a nice dress,\u201d Nick drawled. He uncrossed his ankles, standing and shrugging out of his suit jacket.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the dress,\u201d Kelly said. Nick helped Emma into his coat, wrapping it around her shoulders with all the delicacy of handling a Ming vase. She thanked him and then sat on the bench Deuce and Livi had vacated.</p><p>\u201cI hate all of you,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>They ignored him, and Emma started talking about the open spots on her team again, trying to convince Kelly to think about joining.</p> <p>Zane slid his hand down Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling no pain,\u201d he whispered against Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty\u2019s cheeks were flushed, and he couldn\u2019t feel the tips of his fingers. It was probably from the cold, but whatever they\u2019d been serving had been quality stuff, and he\u2019d had too much of it. He turned his face into Zane\u2019s and kissed him.</p><p>Zane chuckled, then pushed himself to stand. \u201cC\u2019mon, we\u2019ll take a walk, then head back to our room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I fall over when I stand up, you\u2019re going to catch me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><p>Ty took Zane\u2019s hand and hefted himself up. He wavered closer to him and gave him a gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d Emma said fondly.</p><p>Ty blushed in the darkness, and Nick and Kelly whistled. He pointed at both of them. \u201cEither of you touch my baby cousin, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p> <p>They both gave him obedient, if slightly sloppy, salutes.</p><p>Ty pointed again. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Zane slid an arm around his shoulders and turned him toward the flap in the tent that led out into the gardens. Ty slid his hand into Zane\u2019s as they walked.</p><p>\u201cYou having fun yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not fun, but it\u2019s been nice so far,\u201d Zane said as he laced their fingers together. \u201cI actually had a casual conversation with Burns earlier. It was a little bizarre, but . . . getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry having him over for Thanksgiving dinner,\u201d Ty said wryly. They hit the rocky ground that indicated the cliffs were near, and walked until there was nothing but moonlight to light their way.</p><p>It was quiet, and the wind smelled of salt and snow, and Ty was happy. It was easy to forget how lucky he was to be able to hold Zane\u2019s hand, to kiss him, talk to him whenever he wanted. He\u2019d told himself every night of his deployment that if he made it home, he\u2019d never take that ability for granted again.</p><p>The path angled down, taking them away from the cliffs until they were on the level with the surf. The sand beneath their feet became softer, and the crash of the waves intruded on all other sound. It was much colder down here, the wind whipping in off the waves.</p><p>Ty came to a sudden stop, pulling Zane closer to him. Zane hummed appreciatively and let his free hand fall to Ty\u2019s hip as their chests bumped. Ty ran his nose up the side of Zane\u2019s cold cheek, finally taking the proper kiss he\u2019d been wanting all night.</p><p>When he heard a noise above the surf, his entire body tensed, and Zane leaned away from him.</p><p>Even here, remote and safe, he couldn\u2019t seem to force his mind to relax. He wondered if he\u2019d ever be able to. He cleared his throat and squeezed Zane\u2019s hand, refusing to let his fingers slip away.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell thinks walking on the beach in the freaking dark is romantic?\u201d a woman asked breathlessly as the two figures came close enough to be heard over the surf.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s romantic if you\u2019re being carried,\u201d a man suggested.</p><p>\u201cMy calves are killing me!\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane both chuckled, exchanging quiet greetings as they passed the two people in the dark. The couple waved as they walked by, angling away from Ty and Zane and heading toward the mansion path rather than trying to be sociable. Ty glanced down the beach at the cottages on the end of the shoreline, where the staff were housed. They were all dark and silent.</p><p>A crash of thunder sounded not far off, and the thrashing sea was lit up by a bolt of lightning. Ty and Zane both stared at the dark ocean, struck momentarily dumb by the violent storm that seemed to be closing in with so little warning. Zane tugged on Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on. Nice, private room waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with them,\u201d Ty told Zane as he allowed himself to be turned toward the mansion. \u201cWe used to run with all our equipment in the sand until we threw up. Never really saw a beach as romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to suggest a run in the morning, but maybe not,\u201d Zane said as he guided Ty along with a hand on his elbow. \u201cAnd I\u2019m probably the last person to ask about what\u2019s romantic.\u201d</p><p>Ty pointed a finger. \u201cI will run in the late-morning to early-afternoon time frame. Otherwise I intend to be hungover.\u201d He waited a beat before glancing sideways at Zane. \u201cWhere were you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChurch wedding in Austin.\u201d There was a note of curiosity in Zane\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cWas it nice?\u201d Ty asked carefully.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cIt was way overdone. My mom did the whole thing because we were living in Dallas at the time. But I guess it was okay. I don\u2019t really remember much about it.\u201d Zane made a noise in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat, too much bachelor party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just . . .\u201d Zane waved his hand around. \u201cYou stand there in this important ceremony, nervous as hell because everyone\u2019s watching you and you don\u2019t want to trip on the steps, and then it\u2019s over and you don\u2019t remember a single thing and it seems like such a waste of all that time.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and shook his head. They walked hand in hand down the beach, the cold waves lapping at the rocky sand near their feet, the lightning highlighting whitecaps on the water.</p><p>\u201cCare for another waltz in the rain?\u201d Zane asked, his voice gone lower.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Zane stopped him as the thunder rolled, and pulled Ty to him. They began a slow box step, taking note of the rocks and their footing.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done the sex-on-the-beach thing?\u201d Ty asked as his fingertips played over Zane\u2019s palm. Zane shivered.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Once. I kind of enjoyed it, but she was complaining about sand in weird places for days afterward.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave a surprised laugh.</p><p>\u201cI always thought it sounded sort of uncomfortable, when you got down to the logistics of it,\u201d Ty mused. He began to hum as they danced. The skies rumbled and lightning flashed almost on top of the sound, meaning the storm was almost upon them.</p><p>Ty gazed up at Zane, his stomach fluttering. Rather than illuminating the warm brown of Zane\u2019s eyes, the night seemed to sap all the color from him, leaving them a luminescent gray. He couldn\u2019t help but stare at his lover, wondering how Zane just got more and more attractive to him as the days went by.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever been with who made me want to try things like that.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned, and their dance slowed to a stop. \u201cI make you want to roll around in the sand?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cThat came out wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d Zane murmured, still grinning as he ran his hand up Ty\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI just mean . . .\u201d Ty held a pent-up breath as he met Zane\u2019s eyes again. Zane\u2019s face was so sincere, looking at Ty in that way that always made Ty feel warm and loved. \u201cI mean that all the experiences I\u2019ve ever heard of in life . . . I want to have them with you.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile grew more tender. He ran his knuckles down Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cTy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Zane.\u201d</p><p>He could feel Zane\u2019s heartbeat quicken. Every part of him tingled where Zane touched him. He held his breath.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty grinned, laughing silently. Leave it to Zane to reject him and make him laugh at the same time. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to at least consider for a minute this time? Run the numbers a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, shut up,\u201d Zane murmured, and pressed his lips to Ty\u2019s, wrapping around him in a passionate embrace and kissing him for all he was worth.</p><p>Ty\u2019s arms tightened on him, fingers gripping. The sound of the tide and the approaching rain became a backdrop to the sound of Ty\u2019s heart pounding in his chest. He wanted Zane to know he\u2019d thought this through, that he wanted them to spend the rest of their lives together. But he also kind of liked the idea of Zane making him ask until he got it right, making him work for it. Ty needed to work for it. They could play this game because in the end, Ty knew Zane would say yes. He just had to find the perfect time, the perfect place, the perfect way.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Ty whispered against Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>Zane smiled and pressed his nose against Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep asking until you say yes.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled against his cheek. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Zane took his hand and began to lead him toward the path again. Ty glanced up at the lights ahead of them and squinted. \u201cPlease tell me you know which freaking haunted room in the freaking haunted mansion is ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know which one is ours,\u201d Zane assured him. The thunder crashed behind them and they quickened their pace. \u201cThis is nice, that Deuce and Livi get to do something like this. Wedding and honeymoon all in one, stretch it out and take their time. I would have gone tropical maybe, but still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Deuce is terrified of airplanes, so I\u2019m guessing he only had enough tranquilizers for one trip,\u201d Ty said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get to do the honeymoon thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were both working, and neither of us wanted to take time off right then.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound put out about it. \u201cThat stuff wasn\u2019t really our kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Ty just nodded. They walked in silence for a while. When they came closer to the house, they hit a stone walkway and Ty stumbled on the unexpectedly hard ground.</p><p>True to his word, Zane caught him around the middle and steadied him. Ty snorted as he wrapped an arm around Zane\u2019s neck. Zane squeezed Ty close as they started up the stairs. Flickering hurricane lamps lit the hallway, though Ty suspected they were electric. But it was dark inside their room, with just the moonlight filtering in the ancient windowpanes. Muffled sounds of laughter came from Nick and Kelly\u2019s room. It kind of sounded like someone was getting laid in there, and Ty idly wondered which one had gotten lucky with which bridesmaid and which one was sleeping on some sofa downstairs.</p><p>He stood motionless near the doorway to his and Zane\u2019s room, letting his eyes adjust and knowing he would wind up face-planting onto the floor if he tried to walk. The thought made him snicker quietly, and he clapped a hand over his mouth. Then Zane\u2019s arms slid around his waist from behind, followed by his warm, hard body.</p><p>Ty tilted his head to the side, biting his lip in an attempt to stop the laughter. He calmed briefly, but then another fit overtook him as Zane\u2019s stubble tickled at his neck. He closed his eyes and shook silently at the absurdity of the romantic location. He and Zane were definitely more of a backseat-of-the-Mustang kind of couple. The thunder rumbled outside.</p><p>\u201cAll right, funny guy,\u201d Zane said. He smacked Ty on the hip. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly entertained without my help.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached out for his wrist. He pulled Zane toward him in the dark. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being good isn\u2019t a problem,\u201d Zane growled. \u201cFocused, yes. Good, no.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded determinedly and cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll be focused.\u201d</p><p>Zane leaned forward, his lips skimming from the corner of Ty\u2019s mouth, along his cheekbone, and to his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>Ty tried to meet Zane\u2019s lips with his own, but Zane moved away too quickly for a kiss. Ty wrapped his arms around Zane\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI think you should do something I\u2019ll be ashamed of in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Zane gripped his hips and pushed their groins together. He hummed thoughtfully. \u201cWhat could I do that would make you blush if you thought about it tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t get a kiss soon, I\u2019m going to hit critical mass, understand?\u201d</p><p>Ty barely got the last word out before Zane\u2019s mouth was on his, hot and hungry. He groaned and let Zane take control of it, hoping his lover knew which way the bed was. Zane ran one hand up his back to cup his head as he deepened the kiss, his other hand moving between them to pull at Ty\u2019s shirt, drawing him into the darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, how embarrassed would you be if Nick and Kelly mention hearing screaming through the wall tomorrow?\u201d Zane drawled.</p><p>\u201cJust tell them I saw a ghost; no one will ask questions.\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled his shirt over his head, and then he was right there again, all defined muscles and warm skin. After another long kiss, Zane asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure, doll?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know exactly what I want,\u201d Ty answered breathlessly. He pushed Zane toward the bed. They could see it when lightning struck outside, the pale gray bedcover practically glowing blue as their eyes adjusted to the darkness. Ty pulled Zane closer to kiss him as he fell back onto the soft mattress.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until it was too late that he remembered the gauzy rings of decorative netting that hung from the four-poster bed. The clingy material wrapped around them as they fell into it, getting caught up between them and around their limbs and tightening as their weight pulled the netting.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Zane pushed off Ty and batted at the netting, trying to find his way out of it. \u201cShit, I can\u2019t see. Quit moving!\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and broke down all over again. He held his hands up obediently, trying not to move. But he was hopelessly encased in netting. He laughed harder, until he could barely catch his breath, and the sound went from loud and ringing off the rock walls of the suite to nearly silent as he tried and failed to pull in air. Zane\u2019s cursing and struggling just made it funnier.</p><p>Finally Zane got loose and rolled away.</p> <p>\u201cGet some rest,\u201d Zane said quietly as he moved around the dark room and out of Ty\u2019s visual range. He sounded disgruntled. \u201cYou don\u2019t want too much of a hangover tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Zane, don\u2019t go.\u201d Ty tried to go after him but wound up tangled even more in the netting. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, I swear,\u201d he tried, even as he snickered.</p><p>He heard Zane snort from the foot of the bed. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously leaving me here?\u201d Ty asked, his voice a higher pitch than it usually was.</p><p>Zane was quiet for a long minute. He finally sighed. \u201cNo.\u201d He moved, and a light flipped on, blindingly bright.</p><p>Ty winced away from it and tried to cover his eyes, but that only served to tangle him further, which was for some reason wildly funny.</p> <p>Zane threw up his hands. \u201cI am not even dealing with this,\u201d he said, his voice trembling with amusement. He turned the light back off. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zane! Don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d Ty said in the most pitiful voice he could muster, which was ruined by the continuing peals of laughter he just couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Ty.\u201d The bed dipped as Zane got in on the other side.</p><p>After long moments of trying desperately to calm down, Ty finally managed it and came to terms with the fact that Zane probably wasn\u2019t going to fuck him tonight. He probably wasn\u2019t even going to untangle him, and Ty was much too drunk and pleasantly sleepy to try to do it himself.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he sighed, his movements accompanied by the creaking of the canopy above him. \u201cThis was not what I had in mind when I told you I wanted to be ashamed of myself in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Zane watched the sun rise out of the distant horizon and shimmer on the water from where he lay sprawled on the bed. He\u2019d slept some as the storm raged through the night, although not as well as he would have while holding Ty, who was still encased in a protective roll of netting. And if he were honest, he\u2019d been a little too edgy to sleep deeply after the discussion they\u2019d had with the Stantons. Expecting trouble or not, Zane felt like it was around the corner.</p><p>He\u2019d also spent much of the night thinking about Ty. He knew Ty had meant every word of it when he\u2019d asked Zane to marry him. And Zane might be wrong, Ty may have thought about it every night while he was gone and played through every possibility in his mind before he asked the first time. But Zane knew Ty pretty damn well, and he wanted him to think about it again and again. And again. Then one last time, just to be sure.</p> <p>He also knew he had made some pretty drastic changes to himself. He wanted Ty to see those, to know those changes were permanent and to make sure he was still what Ty really wanted. Ty hadn\u2019t come back the same person. The more time they spent together, the clearer that was to Zane. He smiled less, he joked less, he was quicker to strike. Zane was almost afraid Ty\u2019s proposal was just another quick strike. They just needed time.</p><p>The canopy above the bed creaked as Ty moved within the netting. He groaned and rolled, only to have his progress halted by the gauzy, tangled material. He stopped, one hand actually suspended above the mattress by the netting as he lay flat on his back. He mumbled something in a language that may or may not have been foreign and tried to move again.</p><p>Zane half wanted to laugh, but waking Ty up that way might kick him into a full-blown, flashback-induced panic attack.</p><p>The bed groaned, and Ty shot up with a gasp, still wrapped in netting.</p><p>Zane rolled off the bed, out of reach. \u201cTy,\u201d he said carefully. Sometimes even when Ty\u2019s eyes were open, it didn\u2019t mean he was there with you.</p><p>Ty responded with a nearly panicked few words in Farsi, but he wasn\u2019t flailing or fighting. Not yet. He spoke again, rapid fire as he gave his arm a good yank. \u201cWhere\u2019s O\u2019Flaherty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, you\u2019re awake and you\u2019re okay.\u201d Zane moved into Ty\u2019s line of sight. \u201cNick\u2019s asleep next door. He\u2019s okay too. Everyone\u2019s okay, doll. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Ty watched him, his breathing slowing as reality seemed to soak through to his brain. His hands still shook with adrenaline and probably an ounce or two of fear, but he was silent and still as he let Zane untangle him.</p><p>\u201cWorst morning after ever,\u201d Ty said, almost calm enough to fool Zane into thinking he was okay with waking up to a full-fledged flashback.</p><p>Almost. Zane continued to untangle the netting, trying to move Ty\u2019s arms without holding or clasping them. He got one loose, but the other hand was really caught up. How had he even done this to himself? \u201cI can cut it loose, doll.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He began using the hand Zane had freed to disentangle his other leg, taking long, slow breaths to try to calm himself. As soon as Zane managed to free his other hand, Ty clambered out of the bed like it was on fire. He used Zane to pull himself out, practically climbing up and over him to get away from the netting. Zane sighed and let him do it; to try to hang on to him or stop him would have been a mistake.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Zane,\u201d Ty whispered, rubbing at his chest.</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart swelled with a confusing mix of love and pity and anger for the things Ty had been put through. He knelt on the mattress and reached out, brushing Ty\u2019s cheek with the tips of his fingers. He smiled wryly when Ty met his eyes. \u201cAt your service.\u201d</p><p>Ty managed a weak smile. \u201cMy hero.\u201d</p><p>Zane flattened his palm against Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Ty promptly stripped off the clothing Zane hadn\u2019t gotten off him last night and crawled back into the bed beside Zane. Zane scooted and laid himself out, reaching for him. Ty pulled the covers over both their heads and Zane gathered him up to hold him.</p><p>\u201cSorry I ruined the night,\u201d Ty offered. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll laugh about it later,\u201d Zane said, skimming one hand through Ty\u2019s hair.</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t be nice to me when I\u2019m hungover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit being an ass.\u201d Zane poked him hard in the side, and Ty chuckled against his chest. Zane hugged him tighter before loosening his grip again. He\u2019d learned that at times like these, Ty wanted to be held but sometimes couldn\u2019t tolerate it, so Zane let him decide. Ty rested his head on Zane\u2019s shoulder, his fingers playing with the hair on Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>Zane was desperate to know what Sidewinder had gone through to make Ty\u2019s nightmares so devastating, to make Digger and Owen walk away from the Marine Corps, and to make Nick look positively haunted when he thought no one was watching. But the only thing Zane could do was offer his shoulder. Literally.</p><p>Zane tapped under Ty\u2019s chin and got him to raise his head, then leaned in to steal a kiss. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty wrapped his arms around him and threw a leg over him to pull him closer. Zane closed his eyes, his chest aching. It was moments like this that made dealing with the shit of their pasts worthwhile, that made their future seem possible.</p><p>He pressed his lips to Ty\u2019s temple. \u201cLove you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty smiled and snorted against his neck. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent, soaking in the peace and quiet. Then Ty narrowed his eyes at Zane. \u201cI proposed on a moonlit beach in Scotland. How do you just say \u2018Nope!\u2019 to that?\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you remember it.\u201d</p><p>Ty muttered some more as he cuddled back down. Zane began to relax again, allowing Ty\u2019s weight to push him into the bed. They were both almost asleep when something thumped from the room next door, followed by boisterous laughter.</p><p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d Ty said. He raised his head and banged on the wall above the short headboard. \u201cAssholes!\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, someone banged back. If they said anything, the thick walls drowned it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are they doing up this early?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cScrew early, what the hell are they doing, period?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like someone fell out of the bed. I\u2019m putting money on it being Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Nick shares a bed well, but Kelly spreads like a fucking puddle of Jell-O. Forces you to fight back.\u201d More laughter came from the other side of the wall. Ty rested his elbow against Zane\u2019s chest. \u201cWant to make some noise on our side?\u201d</p><p>Zane slid his fingers down Ty\u2019s defined arm, stroking the marred face of the bulldog tattoo. A bullet had ripped through the ink and formed a jagged scar, but that just made it look tougher. Zane tore his eyes away from it to look up into Ty\u2019s. \u201cWhat\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind of noise that you have to hold on to the headboard for.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s body was instantly interested in this new proposition, and the predatory look in Ty\u2019s eyes said he knew it.</p><p>Ty leaned down and gave him a slow, sensual kiss. Zane dragged his hands up Ty\u2019s arms, over his shoulders, and down his back to hold on to his trim waist as they kissed. Ty smiled against his lips and climbed over him, staying on his knees and straddling Zane\u2019s thighs, putting both hands on Zane\u2019s shoulders. Zane tipped his head back, more than happy to give in to Ty\u2019s attentions.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands plunged into his hair, and his scruff scratched at Zane\u2019s chin and lips. It stirred the warmth inside Zane, and his skin heated with each stroke of Ty\u2019s tongue against his. When their mouths parted, Zane whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s make some fucking noise.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s breathing was harsh when he nodded. Zane dragged his hands down Ty\u2019s body to grasp his ass. Ty responded, his muscles bunching, his cock stirring against Zane\u2019s groin, kicking up a wicked feedback loop between the two of them as they rubbed against each other and grew more and more aroused.</p><p>Ty halted it before they could get too far ahead of themselves, throwing the covers off and rolling out of bed.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said, deadpan. \u201cWasn\u2019t finished over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how many times I dreamed about you?\u201d Ty asked, going to the massive fireplace. It was cold in the room, which while perfect for sleeping wasn\u2019t as conducive to other activities. He turned on the gas logs, grinning mischievously at Zane. \u201cEvery night.\u201d</p><p>Zane followed that come-hither look, giving up on the idea of grabbing the headboard in favor of being laid out on that rug in front of the fire. Ty was obviously thinking the same thing.</p><p>Zane took their bottle of lubricant from the bedside table and dropped it to the floor at Ty\u2019s feet. He pulled his T-shirt over his head, tossed it to the side, and joined Ty on the thick rug in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Ty gripped his chin and kissed him, slowly maneuvering them both until they were stretched out on the plush rug. He immediately laid Zane out, settling between his legs, gathering up Zane\u2019s wrists to hold him and kiss him soundly. \u201cEvery night,\u201d he repeated in a whisper.</p><p>Zane relaxed into the rug as Ty\u2019s weight bore down on him, and as Ty\u2019s hands closed around his wrists, he gave a gentle moan. The thought of Ty taking control and holding him down sent a shudder through him. It was something Ty hadn\u2019t done since getting home, something Zane had sorely missed. Zane couldn\u2019t help but wonder how much of Ty would never be the same again after this past year. So many things were still missing. Every time Ty seemed to regain something, even something as trivial as wanting to overpower Zane and screw him into the ground, it was like a weight being lifted from Zane\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty was already mostly hard, and he rubbed himself against Zane\u2019s hip. He gathered Zane\u2019s wrists into one hand, grip tightening, and the kiss became more demanding as Ty responded to his plea.</p><p>Ty\u2019s free hand slid down Zane\u2019s body, fingers digging in possessively as they dragged along his chest and then his ribs to his hip. Ty pushed up to give himself room to rut into Zane as he licked and bit and sucked at his lips.</p><p>Zane groaned and pulled at Ty\u2019s hands, testing his grip. Ty grunted at him, using the weight of his body to hold Zane down. He pushed at Zane\u2019s thigh with his knee, shoving his legs further apart and stealing any leverage Zane might have found. His hard cock pushed against Zane\u2019s hip as Ty straddled one thigh. He rocked against him as he sucked on Zane\u2019s tongue, slowly but surely draining Zane\u2019s control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane was hard, too, straining against his boxers. He whimpered, desperate for more. It wasn\u2019t often that Zane wanted this from Ty\u2014needed it, begged for it\u2014but when he did, Ty would nearly eat him alive before getting him off.</p><p>Zane so desperately wanted to be eaten alive right now, just to reaffirm that everything would be normal again, that Ty would return to his irascible self and still be able to make Zane\u2019s knees weak with a smirk. That one day Ty would ask him to marry him again and Zane would say yes without a second thought.</p><p>Ty pushed at Zane\u2019s boxers, rising up just enough to shove them down Zane\u2019s hips before plunging his hand into Zane\u2019s hair. Zane had let it grow a little longer, and Ty seemed to love it. He gripped Zane hard, holding him still as he took his fill of the kiss. Then he yanked Zane\u2019s head back and ducked to kiss at the tender skin of his neck.</p> <p>Arching under him, Zane bared his throat. He moaned when Ty bit him. He knew what Ty was going to do to him just by the way he kissed him, by the tense energy already emanating from Ty\u2019s body. \u201cYes . . . please.\u201d</p><p>Ty kissed him again, covering the words with his mouth and licking at Zane\u2019s tongue before working his way over Zane\u2019s chin, down his neck, and across his chest to bite at the hard muscle of his shoulder. With every movement, Ty\u2019s hand tightened in his hair. Each tug drew a soft groan, and each groan caused Ty to come back for another kiss. If Ty continued this way, he was never going to reach his goal, and Zane was going to come long before he got close.</p><p>Finally, Ty let go of Zane\u2019s hair and slid both hands under Zane\u2019s shoulders instead, jerking him against the floor as he kissed and bit along his chest. He sucked a nipple between his lips, flicking his tongue over it.</p><p>The moans tearing out of Zane were growing steadily louder. He was vocal anytime he was enjoying himself with his lover; he saw no reason to hold it back, especially when Ty loved to hear it so damn much. He didn\u2019t care if everyone in the mansion heard them. They no longer had to hide, not from anyone.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t seem to keep himself from Zane\u2019s mouth, and he pushed up to kiss Zane again, mumbling to him between the harsh kisses. His beard scratched at Zane\u2019s tender skin. His grip was hard enough to make Zane squirm. His muscles bunched under Zane\u2019s fingers. He felt like a wild animal in Zane\u2019s arms, barely under control.</p> <p>Then he was back to trailing down Zane\u2019s body as Zane shifted under him. Ty\u2019s hands slid underneath him as he finally got to Zane\u2019s hip and bit him, just hard enough to leave a red mark. It drew a cry of pleasure out of Zane. Ty sat up and yanked Zane\u2019s boxers off, then propped the back of Zane\u2019s thigh against his shoulder before bending over him and licking the head of his cock.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I love it when you do this.\u201d</p><p>Ty wrapped his arm around Zane\u2019s thigh. For some reason it made Zane feel vulnerable, propping that leg up on Ty\u2019s solid shoulder, watching him insinuate himself between Zane\u2019s legs to take his cock into his mouth. It made him feel vulnerable, and he loved it. It turned him on because Ty was the only person who\u2019d ever made him feel that.</p><p>He shuddered and clutched at the rug as he thrust his hips toward Ty\u2019s sinful mouth. \u201cOh God, please,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBaby, please.\u201d</p><p>He would beg, plead, and grovel if he needed to. He\u2019d never done that for anyone before, but he was irrevocably addicted to Ty\u2019s touch, to the way Ty made him feel. And he loved the way his begging spurred Ty on.</p><p>Ty\u2019s fingers dug into the front of Zane\u2019s hip as he held him in place and went down on him. It took him a few attempts, but he finally got the head of Zane\u2019s cock to the back of his throat and swallowed around it. A strangled yell from Zane echoed off the stone walls around them, and he strained uselessly to snap his hips up for more. The hot slide of Ty\u2019s tongue all over him was irresistible.</p> <p>Someone banged on the wall, followed by a taunting whoop from their audience next door. It was a far cry from the fear Ty must have lived with all his life of being exposed, to have his friends catcall him as he fucked his boyfriend.</p><p>Ty continued on, seemingly devoted to making Zane lose it. But then he stopped abruptly, pulling off Zane\u2019s cock with one last lick from balls to head.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, please,\u201d Zane gasped, reaching for Ty desperately. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t stop, baby.\u201d</p><p>Ty let Zane\u2019s leg slide off his shoulder and knelt between Zane\u2019s knees. Zane\u2019s pleas ceased when he saw the look in Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty slid both palms up Zane\u2019s torso, his fingers dragging against the muscles, ending up at Zane\u2019s shoulders and pushing him into the floor. He kissed him passionately, practically devouring him as he rutted against Zane\u2019s thigh. Zane moaned against his mouth, offering up complete control of his body and mind. Hell, his soul if Ty wanted it.</p><p>It was times like this, times when Ty gave in to utter passion, that his true strength revealed itself. It was a heady feeling, being completely under his control. Zane loved to imagine sometimes what it would be like to meet Ty in battle, to be at the mercy of this sort of power. Ty\u2019s hands moved all over Zane\u2019s body, alternately holding him down and pulling him up off the floor to suit whatever whims Ty had. It took a lot of muscle to manhandle someone Zane\u2019s size so effortlessly.</p><p>Finally, he reached for the bottle of lubricant, then found one of Zane\u2019s hands without breaking their kiss and squeezed some into his palm. Dazed, Zane dragged open his eyes as he panted and shivered under Ty, wondering what he was going to tell him to do. Zane would do anything right now to please him. To please them both.</p><p>\u201cGet me ready,\u201d Ty growled.</p><p>He groaned as soon as Zane touched him, bowing his back to bite at Zane\u2019s lip. Their foreheads pressed together, their gasps mingling, and Ty whispered \u201cI love you\u201d between each kiss.</p> <p>Zane spread his legs farther apart as he jacked Ty. \u201cFuck me, baby,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI need it.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s harsh breaths gusted across Zane\u2019s cheek and ear as he kissed toward Zane\u2019s neck and bit him right beneath his earlobe. He pulled at Zane\u2019s hair, jerking his head to the side, dropping little nips that left enough sting for Zane to want more. And Zane begged for them with broken sounds and soft cries.</p><p>Ty put his lips to Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cLouder.\u201d</p><p>Zane fought to swallow. His cock jumped against Ty\u2019s hip.</p><p>\u201cLouder, Zane,\u201d Ty ordered, voice going sharper. It was an order, just like the ones he gave in the field to Marines who hopped to obey his every command. Like he was finally declaring to the world, to anyone who would listen, that Zane was his.</p><p>With his other hand, Ty pulled Zane\u2019s leg up and sideways until Zane lay on his side, leg tucked up to his chest. He grabbed Zane\u2019s wrist and slammed it to the ground beside Zane\u2019s head, pinning him, twisting him, then scraped his teeth over Zane\u2019s ribs as he flexed his hips, going for the spot that was most exposed, that felt the most vulnerable. Zane tried to curl and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Zane\u2019s desperate half growl tore out of him as he writhed under Ty, body twisted, so turned on that it hurt, jolted by sweet agony every time Ty almost entered him.</p><p>\u201cTy . . . Ty, oh fucking God, please,\u201d he whimpered, his entire body shaking. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>Ty pushed at his head to turn him into another brutal kiss. \u201cLouder,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands tightened almost painfully, and he flexed his hips, and the angle of Zane\u2019s twisted body was just right to let him push the head of his cock inside. He rocked there several times, forcing Zane apart, causing him to cry out again, then he shoved in harder, rocking Zane\u2019s body against the thick carpet.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shout of pleasure and pain echoed off the walls. His gasps were caught between Ty\u2019s lips, and it was a near-impossible struggle to stay still as Ty rocked into him, to keep his hips at that perfect angle, one leg straight between Ty\u2019s knees and one drawn up to his chest as Ty took him from above. He needed to move, to ease the ache of invasion, to intensify the brutal pressure. God, he loved it, Ty forcing his way in, laying claim to Zane\u2019s body.</p><p>He was on the edge of completely falling apart. Thank Christ Ty was there to keep him together, just like he\u2019d always been. His cries turned to wails. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Ty finally loosened his hold, and his hands began to roam again as he started a slow, steady rhythm. \u201cMove, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck, thank you,\u201d Zane gasped, turning to angle his hips as Ty pushed into him. He squeezed his eyes shut and then opened them to see Ty over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful like this,\u201d Ty panted. He pulled at Zane\u2019s leg, turning him again to laying him out flat, belly to the rug, hips off the floor, and drove into him mercilessly.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shouts became louder and more frequent. He looked over his shoulder so he could see Ty fucking him, see him losing control. Ty pressed his cheek against Zane\u2019s shoulder as he picked up his pace, his panting breaths harsh in Zane\u2019s ear and sweat dripping from his temples. Zane loved the sensation of Ty\u2019s hips flexing against his ass, his knees pushing at Zane\u2019s with each thrust, his fingers digging into Zane\u2019s shoulders as Ty used his body for leverage.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t have stopped his cries if he\u2019d wanted to. The pleasure was overwhelming, and not even the pain of his own need for release could distract him.</p><p>Ty slowed and pushed himself up, trailing gentle fingers over Zane\u2019s shoulder blades. His hips were still thrusting into Zane, and his entire body was gleaming with sweat from his efforts and the heat of the fire just feet away. The change in momentum drove another husky wail out of Zane. His back arched almost painfully, and he threw a hand out, his fingers again digging helplessly for some sort of leverage from the rug.</p><p>\u201cYou better wait for me, you hear me?\u201d Ty warned. He snapped his hips forward, driving deep into Zane with a growl of pleasure, forcing another shout.</p><p>Ty had been so close to the edge since he\u2019d been home, fighting so hard to stay in control. Maybe what he needed was just to simply let it go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Ty returned to the same punishing rhythm he\u2019d started with, obviously not caring that Zane was trying to prolong it. Then he pulled back until the head of his cock was forcing the tight muscles of Zane\u2019s ass to spread and spasm, and made Zane roll his body again, one leg up as Ty drove hard into him.</p><p>Their eyes met, neither of them blinking or looking away as Ty thrust into him over and over.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t keep up the punishing rhythm for much longer, even though Zane begged him to continue. He pushed his face against Zane\u2019s neck and cried out Zane\u2019s name. Zane dragged his blunt fingernails down Ty\u2019s back, pleading with him not to come yet, begging him to keep fucking him, hard and merciless. Ty\u2019s answer was another agonized shout of Zane\u2019s name as he emptied himself deep inside him.</p><p>Zane soaked it all in, quivering uncontrollably. Ty was solid and warm in his hands, and he didn\u2019t let go while Ty kept moving inside him. He would never get enough of that feeling.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hips continued to rock as he laid himself down over Zane. He moaned, the sound tortured and exhausted. \u201cJesus Christ, you\u2019re fun to fuck,\u201d he rumbled as he pressed his lips to Zane\u2019s neck.</p><p>Zane groaned and shivered hard, turning his chin to give Ty all the access to his neck he wanted. That scruffy beard scraping across his skin was indescribably sexy. Whatever the reason Ty had grown it while he\u2019d been gone, Zane was damn glad he\u2019d kept it. Ty kissed under his jaw one last time before pulling out of him with a plaintive moan. He was damp, and his body glistened in the light of the fire and the morning sun.</p><p>Zane moved to take himself in hand, but Ty reached for him instead. He wrapped talented fingers around Zane\u2019s cock and stroked him lazily as they kissed. Then he scooted down and took Zane\u2019s cock in his mouth. It wasn\u2019t long, maybe a minute or two, and Zane was shouting helplessly as his entire body seized, muscles cramping, fingers digging into Ty\u2019s hair, hips jutting upward. He choked out a last moan and came so hard his vision sparkled, each thin stream coating Ty\u2019s tongue as he sucked Zane through it, driving his moans louder and louder into a pained yell and then a begging sob.</p><p>Ty sucked and pumped him until Zane had spent every last drop of himself, then pulled off and kissed Zane\u2019s hip. He rolled to his back and sprawled out on the rug, eyes closed and chest heaving.</p><p>The gust of air from Ty\u2019s movement sent another shudder through Zane. He could still feel Ty all over him: smarting bite marks, the whisker burn on his throat and shoulders, rug burn on his chest, elbows, and knees, sore spots from Ty\u2019s fingers digging in, and best of all, Ty\u2019s cum sliding down his leg. He felt absolutely mauled.</p><p>Eyes still shut, he reached out to his side and his fingers met Ty\u2019s hip. He stroked the heated, damp skin. A moment later, Ty\u2019s fingers tangled with his, lacing together. Ty didn\u2019t say anything. They were content to hold hands as they lay on the floor together, soaking in the warmth of the fire and the morning sun stretching toward them.</p><p>Once their breathing calmed and the ringing in Zane\u2019s ears faded, he heard the muffled sound of Nick and Kelly in their bedroom, catcalling and applauding. Ty must have heard it as well, because they both began to laugh at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong that I\u2019m turned on by the idea of forcing your friends to listen to us having sex?\u201d Zane asked with a frown.</p><p>Ty laughed harder. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell Nick that. He\u2019ll offer to critique your performance. Or worse, join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have that.\u201d Zane dragged Ty closer, snuggling him even though they were both still sweating and kind of gross. \u201cDid you see the note in the bathroom about saving water since the island is run on a self-sufficient energy system?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty smiled against Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cMust have missed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans we should probably shower together again, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Ty was already nodding. \u201cFor nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckled and they shared a languid kiss. Ty was smirking when they parted. \u201cMarry me, Zane,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane burst out laughing and sat up. These weren\u2019t exactly the ideal conditions for a proposal they needed to be telling to family. \u201cNuh uh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Ty called after him as he ducked into the bathroom. \u201cLying naked on a rug in front of a fireplace in a fucking castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Zane caught himself grinning in the mirror, but he didn\u2019t even try to wipe it off when Ty joined him.</p> <p>Ty shoved him against the sink to kiss him. He mumbled against his lips. \u201cYou might have to lower your standards.\u201d</p><p>Zane hummed. \u201cHow about you . . . up yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that . . . is that a pun?\u201d</p><p>Zane held to Ty as he tried to pull away.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane were some of the first people down to breakfast, beaten only by Chester, Ty\u2019s parents, and Nick and Kelly. The five of them were sitting at a table together, talking.</p> <p>Ty glanced around the morning room, surprised by the nerves he felt when he saw Nick with his family. He gave Zane\u2019s shirtsleeve a tug at the doorway, stopping him from entering the room before the others saw them. Zane let him draw him to the side, out of sight.</p><p>Ty hesitated and peered around the door again. Earl and Nick were carrying on what appeared to be a pleasant conversation. Earl was laughing, and Nick looked like he might be telling a story. Ty turned to Zane. \u201cHow much do you know about Nick\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>Zane raised both eyebrows, obviously confused. \u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed. \u201cOkay. Well, Nick\u2019s dad used to beat the hell out of him. I mean legitimately should have spent time in jail for what he did. When we graduated from Basic, our parents all came down for the ceremony and they took us out for dinner that night. They got into an argument, and Nick\u2019s dad started in on him and then walked out when Nick stood up for himself. Let\u2019s just say Dad took offense and basically adopted Nick after that.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, still frowning in confusion. \u201cI thought Earl didn\u2019t even remember Nick\u2019s name from the snake incident.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cHe was just messing with you, trying to make you nervous about hiking. Nick spent practically every leave with us after that. Ma and Dad are pretty close to him. I\u2019m telling you this so . . . just don\u2019t let Nick know how Dad reacted when Grandpa outed us, okay?\u201d</p><p>Understanding finally dawned on Zane\u2019s face, and anger swiftly followed.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Ty tried. \u201cDad can handle himself, he deserves what he gets, but Nick . . . Nick sees my parents as his own.\u201d</p> <p>Zane schooled his initial emotions, merely nodding instead. \u201cI promise. For Nick, not for Earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Zane,\u201d Ty whispered, and he slipped his arm around Zane\u2019s waist as they headed into the breakfast room.</p><p>They were greeted by the others with good mornings from Earl and Mara, and knowing smirks from Nick and Kelly.</p><p>Ty plopped down in the seat next to Kelly and peered over at his friends. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you two this morning?\u201d</p><p>Nick began to snicker and Kelly rolled his eyes as he took a sip of coffee. \u201cI fell out of the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cOr you were pushed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegit fell. Rolled right out of that thing and took the covers with me. I dreamt I was being attacked by a giant squid and woke up thinking I was drowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up cold and very confused,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>Kelly smiled slyly. \u201cWhat happened to you this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t attacked by a giant squid, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d Ty drawled. He glanced toward the end of the table at his grandfather, giving him a smart salute. \u201cGramps, how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Chester grumbled over his bacon and eggs, piling them all together onto a piece of bread to make a sandwich. He glanced up at Ty and Zane, narrowing his eyes before turning his attention to Nick, who was sitting next to him and minding his own business.</p><p>Chester pointed his fork at Nick\u2019s face. \u201cWhen I was your age, sonny, they used to say redheads was relations of Satan.\u201d</p><p>Kelly choked on his breakfast, but Nick just gave Chester an enigmatic smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they say about you now?\u201d Chester asked him.</p><p>Nick gave an easy shrug. \u201cThey say we have no soul.\u201d</p><p>Chester pursed his lips, nodding thoughtfully as he patted one gnarled hand against Nick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEh. True enough.\u201d</p><p>Nick raised both eyebrows, but then he held up his orange juice and Chester toasted him by tapping his coffee to the glass. Kelly was still coughing, trying to swallow and laugh at the same time. He finally had to excuse himself and stumbled out of the room to go find somewhere to spit it out.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and found the man hiding his face with both hands, laughing silently. At least now he knew it wasn\u2019t just him Chester spoke to that way. But Nick had always taken Chester\u2019s eccentricities in stride, probably even better than Ty and Deuce did because Nick just never gave a fuck.</p><p>Nick was still smiling, shaking his head as he ate. From the first time Ty had brought him home, he\u2019d fit into the Grady family shockingly well. Earl had taken a special interest in him after the scene Nick\u2019s father had made at their graduation. Whether Nick\u2019s father would have tried to hit Nick in front of them all was questionable, because men like him usually worked behind closed doors, but Ty had known immediately that he was going to have to pull his father off Nick\u2019s if a punch was thrown.</p><p>Ty realized he was staring at Nick, frowning with the memories. Something about Nick had been off ever since they\u2019d been deployed, and it had gotten worse once they\u2019d returned home, but Ty couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. Something just felt . . . wrong. Nick was keeping something to himself, something that was troubling him. Ty told himself to find some time alone with his best friend to see if he needed to talk.</p><p>Zane jabbed him in the ribs. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered in Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty tore his eyes away from Nick and nodded, realizing belatedly that Earl had been speaking to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked how your night went, but I guess I know,\u201d Earl said with a short laugh.</p><p>Chester began to cackle at the end of the table. \u201cI\u2019m the only Grady didn\u2019t get lucky last night!\u201d</p><p>Nick dropped his fork and put his hand over his eyes.</p><p>Chester grabbed his arm and shook him. \u201cYou want to bang something too, sonny, you can borrow my shovel!\u201d</p><p>They were still laughing when Kelly came jogging back into the room. He looked flustered. \u201cGuys, there\u2019s something wrong outside.\u201d</p><p>Ty shoved back from the table, Nick and Zane on his heels as they followed Kelly to the front door. Several other early risers were milling around, looking worried or confused. Kelly cut a swath through them and shoved through the door, pointing toward the staff cottages near the shore. Another small group of people was gathered down there.</p><p>Ty took Kelly\u2019s arm. \u201cDoc, will you go to Deacon\u2019s room and make sure they\u2019re safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Kelly said, then darted back into the house.</p><p>Ty and Zane took off at a run toward the commotion, with Nick hesitating briefly and then following them instead of Kelly. When they reached the crowd of roughly half a dozen people, Zane immediately took control of the situation, trying to discern what was happening in a loud, commanding voice. They received a cacophony of confused answers, but the prevailing words seemed to be \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cmurdered.\u201d</p><p>A redheaded man with a hawk-like nose and a ruddy tan finally broke away from the other staff and came up to Zane. \u201cJockie Fraser,\u201d he said in a Scottish accent, offering his hand. His fingers were stained dark and he was wearing a pair of heavy-duty overalls. \u201cI\u2019m the groundskeeper. I was on my way to the docks when I heard Maisie scream and I came running. Found her hyperventilating and found him like this.\u201d He led them over to the scene, wringing his hat in his hands.</p><p>The body was facedown in the sand, just yards away from the encroaching surf. The shoreline around him was completely trampled.</p><p>Nick cursed under his breath. The homicide detective in him must have been pulling the pin on a grenade inside his head just looking at this messy scene.</p><p>Zane made his way carefully to the body to check for a pulse. He found none, as he\u2019d probably expected, and he stood and backed away in his own footsteps. \u201cWe need to secure the scene and call the local authorities,\u201d he said to them.</p><p>Ty pulled his phone out of his pocket, but soon found he had no service. He glanced at Nick, who was shaking his head at his own phone.</p><p>\u201cWe got nothing,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>They asked the staff about their cell service, since they were locals, and were told the island\u2019s service was spotty and only found in the highest of places. They were too remote.</p><p>Zane singled out one of the onlookers to go to the mansion and have someone contact the mainland. The girl ran off, and Ty and Zane stood staring at each other for long moments. How did this always happen to them? Every single time. Another vacation, another psychopath.</p><p>Nick smacked Ty on the back, bringing his attention back to the present. \u201cYou recognize that vest, man?\u201d</p><p>Ty took a closer look at the victim\u2019s muddy vest. Burgundy with a gold-stitched fox-and-hound scene repeated over and over. His stomach sank. It was the head of operations, the man who\u2019d insisted the island was safe. \u201cMilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean we can\u2019t contact the mainland?\u201d Ty hissed to his brother\u2019s future father-in-law.</p><p>The man had ridden down from the mansion when he\u2019d heard the news, accompanied by his two bodyguards and Deuce. Nick assumed Kelly had remained behind with Livi and Amelia to watch over them, but his eyes kept straying to try to catch sight of him.</p><p>Stanton\u2019s voice was strained when he answered Ty. \u201cThe house telephones aren\u2019t operating properly, there\u2019s too much static on the line. Hamish believes there\u2019s water in the lines. But we\u2019re not getting a radio signal either.\u201d</p><p>The larger of his two bodyguards, the overeager leader of the Snake Eaters they all called English, took his sunglasses off and stepped forward. \u201cIt could be the work of a signal jammer.\u201d</p><p>Stanton sighed in annoyance. \u201cThat is one possibility, perhaps. There\u2019s also a massive storm cell all around us, the same one that passed over last night. That\u2019s why we moved tomorrow night\u2019s rehearsal ceremony inside. Communications are disrupted like this two, three times a week during the stormy seasons. It\u2019s no real reason for concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s reason for him to be concerned,\u201d Ty said with a point to the dead man.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Stanton said, staying impressively calm. \u201cI\u2019m merely saying the lack of communications is not unusual. It could be a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a sat phone?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you have one?\u201d Stanton asked, his tone one of hope rather than sarcasm.</p><p>Zane shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNeither does anyone else. My personal one has gone missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little bit of an alarm, there, boss,\u201d Ty grunted.</p><p>\u201cAmelia was playing with it at dinner on the first night. Maisie was trying to retrieve it from her, but I haven\u2019t seen it since. There\u2019s no telling where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the staff begin a quiet inquiry for anyone else who has one, but we\u2019re trying not to alarm anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the radios on the boats are out?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not yet got word back from the man I sent to the dock. I don\u2019t have high hopes. Even the staff\u2019s walkie-talkies are on the fritz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStorms usually do that?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen, no.\u201d</p><p>Nick gritted his teeth in frustration. This was kind of like being in the Marines all over again and trying to communicate with cans and string.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the ferry?\u201d Ty tried. \u201cWhen will they notice they\u2019ve lost contact with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day of the wedding is the next arranged landing if the weather is fair. After that, next week. Next month. Maybe. There\u2019s no real schedule for the ferry because the island is private.\u201d</p><p>Nick scratched at his eyebrow, looking over at Ty with a shrug. \u201cWe\u2019ll send someone in one of the island\u2019s boats, then. The authorities have to be notified of this, we can\u2019t just wait until nature lets us call.\u201d</p><p>Stanton turned to one of the groundskeepers. \u201cWill you please send word to the dock to have one of the smaller launches prepared for the crossing? And see what\u2019s keeping them so long with the radios.\u201d</p><p>Once the man had gone and the rest of the staff had begun to disperse for their daily responsibilities, Stanton drew closer to Ty and Zane, lowering his voice. \u201cIs this . . . was this an accident?\u201d he asked, obviously more rattled than he had been letting on.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a look. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t touched the scene other than to clear it.\u201d</p><p>Nick moved closer, keeping the two Snake Eaters in his peripheral vision because they both annoyed the shit out of him. \u201cIf help is going to take a long time in getting here, we need to look at that body,\u201d he told the others. \u201cEvidence is disappearing as we stand here, and there\u2019s more rain coming. And we can\u2019t leave the body like this for much longer. The tide will come in. We\u2019ll have to document the scene as best we can and then move him somewhere to preserve whatever\u2019s on him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty nodded, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ty. If he was murdered . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably a murderer on the island with us, yeah.\u201d Ty nodded, his frown growing even deeper. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p> <p>Nick raised both eyebrows, opening his mouth in surprise. He clutched his right hand to his thigh, making a fist with it. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the homicide detective, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrish, just look at the fucking body and see if you think it\u2019s a murder or an accident, okay?\u201d Ty snapped.</p><p>Nick grunted in annoyance. \u201cAye, aye, Captain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ty swiped a hand over his forehead, closing his eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed and brushed past him, stepping carefully in Zane\u2019s footprints to kneel next to the body. There were no defensive wounds on the parts of his arms that were visible, but the dead man\u2019s watch was cracked. Nick cocked his head to read the time. It had stopped at 3:48 am.</p><p>\u201cPossible time of death here,\u201d he said without looking up. He pressed his fingers to the man\u2019s neck. He was cold. He tried to articulate the dead man\u2019s fingers and they moved without resistance. Nick frowned. If he\u2019d died just four hours ago, he would still be in rigor. The cold night could have sped up the cooling of the body, but the evidence was saying different things about when the man had died.</p><p>He looked around for pieces of the glass watch face, finally finding them in the mud next to a rock a foot away from the man\u2019s head. The beach was littered with rocks and boulders, some smooth, some jagged. It was possible he\u2019d slipped while walking and hit his head. Nick reached for one of the shards of glass, but his fingers were trembling again. He clutched his hand into a fist and pulled it back, swiping it across his thigh instead. He\u2019d need someone to take photos of the glass shards anyway, so he left them there.</p><p>Footprints were impossible to decipher. The sand was too loose, and too many people had passed this way. He leaned far over the dead man, trying to see his face without disturbing the scene any more than it had been. What he found was a gaping wound at his hairline, so deep he could see bone and brain matter. The blood had mingled with the ocean and soaked into the sand. The absence of a blood pool made the brutal wound a shock to find.</p><p>\u201cHis skull\u2019s been caved in,\u201d he announced.</p> <p>\u201cCould it be from a fall?\u201d Zane called to him.</p><p>Nick shook his head before he even gave the question real thought. \u201cWound like this, there was some real leverage behind it. Looks like someone brained him with a rock. Never saw it coming. Didn\u2019t put up a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was murdered,\u201d Stanton said under his breath, covering his mouth with his palm.</p><p>There was a shout from the pathway, and when Nick stood to peer past the others, he saw a man guiding one of the golf carts up the path, waving at them frantically as he swerved the cart all over. When he got closer he hopped out and sprinted toward them, leaving the golf cart to roll by itself down the incline. People shouted and hustled for it before it could hit the cliff and sail over the edge, but the driver didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d the man blurted as he ran toward them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gone, Gillis?\u201d Stanton demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe boats!\u201d the young man named Gillis gasped out when he finally skidded to a stop in front of Stanton. \u201cAll of them. They\u2019re all gone from the dock. Even the rowboats and kayaks. Mackie says the boathouse was hit by a tree and they\u2019re all gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGone,\u201d Stanton echoed.</p><p>\u201cYou can see them, little dots out floating in the water.\u201d The kid was still breathless. He waved his arm around. \u201cThe storm set them all afloat. The ones not still floating sank at the docks.\u201d</p><p>Stanton\u2019s eyes were wide when he turned back to Nick and the others. Nick felt his stomach drop as the realization sank in. They were trapped on the island with no way to communicate with the outside world, possibly for days. And there could very well be a murderer among them.</p><p>He took a deep breath and let it out, grumbling to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking die in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Zane sat quietly in an office chair through a brief debate over whether the wedding festivities should carry on as planned, or if the guests should be told of the murder and the loss of the island\u2019s launches. Ty and Nick argued first with the Snake Eaters and then with each other over which avenue would be most expedient for keeping everyone safe. Kelly was still with Livi and Amelia, or Zane was sure Kelly would have been able to keep things calmer. As it was, Zane just hung back.</p><p>Ty insisted keeping the guests in the dark would, at least for a little while, prevent a mass panic and allow them to try to find a solution in relative peace. Nick was adamant that people in danger deserved to know they were in danger, and steps could be taken to protect them and convince them to cooperate.</p><p>Zane felt like he was witnessing the core of why Ty and Nick had always made a good team. They were very yin and yang.</p><p>Finally, Nick pointed out that word would get around despite their attempts to keep it quiet because most of the island\u2019s staff had seen the body. \u201cRumors are always worse than truth, and once they start, we won\u2019t be able to get people to trust us when we try to start sharing truth with them.\u201d</p><p>Ty and the Snake Eaters all grunted in unison, but none of them could come up with a counterargument to that.</p><p>Someone knocked on the door to the study, and a moment later they opened the door to see Kelly standing there. The bodyguards let him in and locked the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cIs it true someone got stabbed in the ear with a broken seashell?\u201d Kelly asked incredulously.</p><p>Nick held his hand out to Kelly, eyes on Ty. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Ty was massaging his temples, nodding. \u201cOkay, you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe make an announcement,\u201d Zane said, smiling fondly at Ty.</p><p>Stanton didn\u2019t look amused, though. \u201cAgreed. I\u2019ll make a call for all the guests and employees to assemble in the great hall. We can address the situation there. Who is with Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKorean dude who doesn\u2019t talk,\u201d Kelly answered.</p><p>\u201cWe need to set an investigation in motion in the absence of proper authorities,\u201d one of the Snake Eaters told Stanton. It was the large leader of the private security force, a man named John English. He struck Zane as a little too cocky, but he seemed efficient and mostly sensible.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d Zane asked him. \u201cWe have no authority to question these people, or detain them, or search for evidence.\u201d</p><p>English shrugged his huge shoulders. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will be handy later on,\u201d Ty added.</p><p>Zane grunted, beginning to grow annoyed with the attitude of the Snake Eater crew. It was disturbing to him on several levels how easily Ty fit in with them. He often wondered how close Ty had been to taking the mercenary road. He definitely set foot on it here and there.</p><p>Stanton started to pace, chewing on a cigar. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it clear it\u2019s an informal inquiry, being performed merely to keep everyone safe. There is a murderer roaming the island, after all, people deserve protection. Anyone who wishes not to participate will be . . . locked in their room for the safety of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not really legal,\u201d Zane advised.</p><p>\u201cNeither is murder,\u201d Theo Stanton snapped. They were the first words Livi\u2019s brother had uttered since the meeting had started.</p><p>\u201cThese are extraordinary circumstances, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Stanton turned to Nick, cheeks pale and eyes drawn. \u201cRick, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re a police detective? You\u2019ll do the investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Nick said, not even bothering to correct his name.</p><p>\u201cYou have no blood connection to either family, nor to the business. You\u2019re as neutral a party as we\u2019ll find and you\u2019re trained to do the job.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced around at all of them, looking like he wanted to argue, but the logic was sound. Zane nodded encouragingly when Nick met his eyes. Nick sighed and jerked his head to the side. \u201cIf I can have the doc assisting me, then I guess I don\u2019t have any objection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need,\u201d Stanton agreed. He shook Nick\u2019s hand distractedly. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>Nick hesitated before shrugging one shoulder. \u201cWell, it\u2019s an unusual situation in that our pool of suspects is static, so gathering alibis would be the first step. But that\u2019s something we\u2019d need to organize everyone for. If I tried to do it quietly, word would get around and people would be able to coordinate their stories. It would make it pointless. So we tell people we\u2019re trying to discern a timeline, to see if anyone out of place was on the island.\u201d</p><p>Stanton nodded and absently handed his cigar to Nick, who took it and looked at it like he\u2019d just been handed a unicorn as Stanton walked away. Nick glanced at Kelly, who was biting his lip and trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any way of telling time of death, though,\u201d Theo argued.</p><p>\u201cWithout definitive evidence, we\u2019ll have to go by his broken watch,\u201d Zane provided.</p><p>Nick shook his head, turning to Kelly. \u201cI need you to confirm it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfirm it . . . how?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick winced. \u201cWith a turkey thermometer probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh gross, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, that\u2019s why it\u2019s gross!\u201d</p><p>Even Zane was a little disgusted at the thought, but Nick was probably right. It was much more accurate to check the body\u2019s temperature by measuring the liver temp than assuming the watch had been broken in the fight that ultimately killed him.</p><p>Nick handed the cigar to Kelly and began writing down the information he would need to estimate the time of death from the body\u2019s temperature, indicating that roughly every two and a half degrees it had dropped meant he\u2019d been dead an hour. \u201cGive or take a little because of the cold. I don\u2019t trust the watch as time of death.\u201d He ripped the page off the notebook and handed it to Kelly. \u201cYou have to hurry before he hits ambient temp, okay? And I need you to do it before we put the body in cold storage. Like, right now, as soon as we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded and took the slip of paper, nose curled in distaste. Stanton was still pacing, and Kelly held the cigar out for him to take as he walked by. Stanton plucked it from Kelly\u2019s fingers and put it in his mouth without even seeming to realize he\u2019d ever given it up. Zane found himself fighting back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIf the temp puts time of death in range, we\u2019ll assume the watch is correct,\u201d Nick told them. There wasn\u2019t much point in arguing with what little they had to go on.</p><p>\u201cIf the body and the watch are saying different things, is it possible he was killed elsewhere?\u201d Zane asked Nick. He was the only one who\u2019d been close enough to the body to see.</p><p>Nick was shaking his head before Zane could finish. \u201cNo. There were no signs on the body that it\u2019d been moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick gave him a brief glare, then nodded. \u201cBeen doing this a long time, Garrett, I don\u2019t need my hand held.\u201d</p><p>Zane held up both hands and shrugged. He didn\u2019t want problems with Nick, not now.</p><p>\u201cIf this is the first step in an escalation against the company, then we have motive,\u201d Ty added. \u201cThat could narrow down the first wave of interviews, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to search his room,\u201d Nick told Stanton. \u201cGet a hold of his laptop, phone, any papers. If we could lock that down ASAP to keep anyone from getting in there. In fact, Grady and Garrett could handle that while I\u2019m interviewing people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you the key, but Grady and Garrett will be watching Amelia while you\u2019re doing that, thank you,\u201d Stanton promised. He headed for the door, gesturing for his men to follow him. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you gentlemen on the patio in ten minutes for the announcement. We\u2019ll serve brunch and allow you to do your interviews while people are eating. Will that work?\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned back to Nick, who was watching Stanton with a frown. When he realized the man was actually waiting for a response, he nodded, obviously flustered. \u201cYes, sir, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Stanton nodded and left the room. The door clicked behind Theo, leaving the four of them alone in stunned silence.</p><p>Kelly sat on the back of the couch where Nick was leaning, brushing their shoulders together. \u201cIs this what traveling with you guys is usually like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty and Zane both groaned.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said with a sorrowful shake of his head.</p><p>Kelly wrapped an arm around his shoulders, hugging him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Rick.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted. Zane chuckled, even though he felt guilty for laughing. Nick looked so distraught to have been singled out for the job, Zane had to wonder why. He\u2019d been a detective in Boston for at least seven years, and from what Ty said about him, he was good at his job.</p><p>Ty sat on Nick\u2019s other side and patted his knee. \u201cYou okay to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cWe got your six, man,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Zane nodded immediately. \u201cPiece of cake.\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed his fingers over his eyes. The very tips of his fingers trembled, barely noticeable. But Zane noticed it. He\u2019d noticed it outside, too, when Nick had made to reach for something in the sand but then stopped. He\u2019d noticed it last night at dinner when Nick had switched his fork from his right hand to his left and then clutched his right hand into a fist before hiding it in his lap. Nick was a lefty, so using his left instead of his right wasn\u2019t unusual, but it had caught Zane\u2019s attention nonetheless. The tremor in his right hand was the same type Zane had developed when he was coming off everything in rehab. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Combined with the other things Zane had noticed\u2014his uncharacteristically sedate behavior, his shorter temper, refusing to go back to a job everyone said he\u2019d loved, the haunted look in his eyes\u2014Zane was almost positive Nick was either using or trying to stop.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should get out there,\u201d Ty finally said. As they all stood to file out of the room, Ty grumbled under his breath, \u201cWe have a fucking murderer to find at my brother\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s one of those asshole security guys,\u201d Kelly said from behind Zane.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe the butler did it,\u201d Nick offered. Kelly answered with a groan.</p><p>When they reached the great hall where people were already gathering, Ty went straight over to his parents, whispering to them about the situation. Mara had a hand over her mouth and her eyes were wide, but Earl merely nodded grimly. Burns was sitting with them, and he didn\u2019t show much surprise either. It seemed they\u2019d already gotten wind of the news. From the low murmurs throughout the room, a lot of other guests had as well.</p><p>Zane stood watching people assemble for a few seconds before he decided that now might be the best time to pull Nick aside. When this was over, they\u2019d be in the center of an investigation, no matter how unofficial. He approached Nick with a hint of trepidation and caught him trailing after Kelly through the crowd to head back out into the hall. He took his elbow to stop him.</p><p>Nick turned to him with a confused smile. \u201cGarrett? They moved the body to the kitchen to store it, we\u2019re heading down there. Might want to order vegetarian tonight.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and glanced around them. \u201cCan I talk to you first?\u201d</p> <p>Nick\u2019s smile fell. Kelly had stopped to wait for him, and now he stood frowning a few feet away. Nick looked around just like Zane had done to see if anyone else was paying attention to them, then nodded. \u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere private. I\u2019d prefer if Ty didn\u2019t see us talking.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s confusion and sudden apprehension were painfully clear, but he turned to Kelly anyway. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you, Kels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kelly said, frowning at them but turning to head off to the kitchen on his own.</p><p>Nick left the great hall with Zane, but he didn\u2019t ask questions, and Zane was grateful for it. He led Nick into the hallway and found a quiet nook to duck into. He turned to Nick and glanced at the doorway behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Garrett?\u201d Nick seemed to be losing his patience with the cloak-and-dagger stuff.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I want to help you, okay?\u201d Zane said in a rush.</p><p>Nick raised both eyebrows and leaned a little closer. \u201cAren\u2019t you pretty much already signed up for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with that. I saw your hand shaking out there. And I saw you popping pills yesterday in the car when you thought I was asleep.\u201d Zane reached for Nick\u2019s right hand and brought it up, then released it. There was a tremor to his fingers as Nick tried to hold it steady. Zane nodded grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked at his hand, then gave an exhausted, almost relieved laugh as he dropped it to his side. He glanced away for a moment, then met Zane\u2019s eyes again. \u201cPropranolol.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow creased. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was taking in the car. I take it every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a narcotic,\u201d Nick said wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s prescribed. One a day.\u201d</p> <p>Zane took a moment to let that settle in, but it didn\u2019t alleviate his concern. In fact, it only served to double it. His stomach tumbled. \u201cAre you sick, O\u2019Flaherty?\u201d</p><p>Nick lowered his head, sighing and turning away. He ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>Zane glanced over his shoulder to make sure they were still alone, then took a step after Nick. \u201cWhat\u2019s it for?\u201d</p><p>Nick flopped his hands against his thighs. \u201cI have a tremor. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s gaze drifted down to Nick\u2019s right hand, which was clutched at his side. \u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cDoctors did tests. No one knows. But the medicine keeps my hand from trembling, so I take it. If I forget, I shake like fucking San Francisco in an earthquake.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed before he could stop himself. He put his hand over his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. He ran his fingers over his forehead. \u201cIt gets worse if I\u2019m tired. Like the muscles can\u2019t work hard enough to keep me steady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they think is causing it?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cThe original diagnosis was something called essential tremor. Basically, just bad luck genetics. Then the prevailing theory with the military docs was PTSD. That\u2019s pretty much what they call everything they can\u2019t pinpoint, though. All I know for sure is it\u2019s not MS or Parkinson\u2019s Disease. They checked for those. Twice.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s body flushed with ice for the briefest of moments. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s PTSD, who knows what\u2019ll happen. It might get better, I don\u2019t know. But if it\u2019s the essential tremor thing, it won\u2019t go away. And even though the medicine controls it, it\u2019ll probably get worse as I get older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you didn\u2019t go back to Boston PD, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Zane asked softly.</p><p>Nick winced and shrugged. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do? If I miss those pills a few days in a row, I can barely hit a target. When it started the first time, my hand completely locked up, my captain thought I was having a seizure and they called an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was that?\u201d</p><p>Nick licked his lips, stalling. Then he sighed and looked away. \u201cRight before New Orleans. That\u2019s why I had the time to go. They would have taken me back when I got home, they wanted to. And with the meds, I would have been okay. Maybe. But hell, if it is a side effect of PTSD, I\u2019m just a huge fucking trembling liability. I couldn\u2019t ask a partner to depend on me knowing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sniper with a tremor, Garrett. It\u2019s like a bad joke.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and it made Zane chuckle along with him even though there wasn\u2019t a damn thing funny about it. Nick held up his hand, frowning at it like it had betrayed him.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Zane whispered, but he was unable to follow up with any words of comfort. He cleared his throat, feeling stupid for thinking what he had. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I thought you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I probably would have thought the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so if it\u2019s PTSD, what do you think started it?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged, not meeting Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was the thing with Cross and the CIA, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cWe led them right to you. They came at you on your boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure they did, Garrett, but people have been trying to kill me every day since I was eighteen. Hell, even before that if you want to count being tossed down the stairs, so who the fuck knows. Got real bad a few months ago, though; they almost sent me home. I had to convince them to keep me deployed until the others were let go, too.\u201d</p><p>Zane waited a few beats. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly knows. He has for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not Ty?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed bitterly. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a couple things Ty doesn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been waiting for a good time to talk to him. You know how Ty is.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded sadly. Ty would freak the fuck out at the first hint of Nick being sick. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean . . . how do you tell your best friend that you\u2019re sick and no one knows why?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head, at a loss. An awkward silence began to creep in as they stood in the hallway staring at each other. Zane thought maybe Nick was holding his breath, and he suddenly realized why. \u201cIf he asks me directly if I know anything, I\u2019ll tell him to talk to you. Otherwise, it\u2019s none of my business to tell him, right? You\u2019ll do it when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and made to step away, but Nick reached for his arm and stopped him.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . thank you for being concerned and ready to help. I know it\u2019s not easy to come up to someone like that. That\u2019s solid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t have to give you my rehab speech.\u201d</p><p>Nick barked a laugh. He put his arm around Zane\u2019s shoulder, patting his back and steering him toward the great hall. He let him go before they reached the door, and they rejoined Ty and Kelly just before Stanton addressed the crowd.</p><p>They set Nick up in the game room. A billiard table and a long shuffleboard table sat along one wall, and a disconcerting stag head glared from over the fireplace. Nick pulled a stool behind the wet bar and laid out a notepad, several pens, and his iPad, feeling vastly unprepared for the task ahead of him.</p><p>After Stanton\u2019s announcement, people had been edgy and nervous, but no one had outright objected to the questioning. Nick was expecting some hostility, though, and it was going to be awkward as hell when he started interviewing people he knew. He also felt naked without his badge.</p><p>Susan Stanton was nearly inconsolable during her interview. \u201cErnest was a good man, he didn\u2019t deserve to die like that. Oh my God.\u201d She put her fingers to her lips and closed her eyes. \u201cPoor, poor man. He wasn\u2019t even supposed to be here! He and Theodore had some last-minute things to work on so he came on the plane with us.\u201d</p><p>Theodore Stanton was less flustered when Nick interviewed him. \u201cWe were working on a project, yes. He insisted he come along so it could be finished. He was like a bulldog when it came to the government work.\u201d</p><p>Livi Stanton cried through her entire interview. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Mr. Milton, Deacon and I would never have met, did you know that? He went to Deacon for his stress problems, and he noticed Deacon\u2019s limp. He gave him my card and told him to try it.\u201d She broke down into tears again, and Nick was forced to call Deuce to come get her. He didn\u2019t comfort crying women unless they were gutshot.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know I\u2019d forgotten that,\u201d Deuce admitted. \u201cHe did give me her card. Jesus, now I feel kind of bad. I mean I felt bad anyway, you know, but now I feel worse. I mean I feel bad that he died at my wedding, not because I killed him or anything. Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you writing that down? Oh my God, Deacon, stop talking.\u201d</p><p>Mara Grady babbled through her entire interview just like her youngest son. \u201cWhat was he doing out on that beach at night? That\u2019s so dangerous, you know he wasn\u2019t down there for anything good. Nicholas, dear, you look tired. You need some coffee.\u201d</p><p>When Earl Grady entered the room, he was carrying a plate and a steaming mug. \u201cThe wife said to bring you this,\u201d he said as he placed them at Nick\u2019s elbow. \u201cI saw the dead man at dinner. He kept checking his watch like he had somewhere to be. And he was on his cell phone the whole time. Figured it was a sat phone since everyone seems to have shit for service out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a damn bar of service on this stupid island,\u201d the maid of honor told him. She was a pretty woman with copper-colored hair. Her eyes were drawn to Nick\u2019s notepad. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m Nikki Webb. I hate being here, okay? My entire body itches and I can\u2019t get it to stop, and my hair is frizzy as hell because of all the rain, and I can\u2019t even have phone sex with my boyfriend because we\u2019re out in the middle of damn nowhere. I mean I love Livi, but so help me God this marriage better last forever.\u201d</p><p>Nick had already met one of the bridesmaids, Catalina Cruz, at the dinner last night. She was a looker, and she had the kind of fire that Nick enjoyed. He\u2019d spent a while talking with her, and if not for Kelly, they probably would have been each other\u2019s alibis last night. \u201cLet me guess, Nikki spent ten minutes complaining about the phone service? I\u2019m rooming with her. She spent at least an hour last night wandering the halls, desperate for a bar of service. She almost fell over the balcony railing holding it up to the sky. No one should get that wrapped up in a guy, you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>The next bridesmaid to sit across from him spelled her name for him. \u201cMiyoko Mason.\u201d She was tall and possibly too thin to be healthy, with an exotic look that spoke of an Asian ancestry. \u201cI talked to him for a while. He could quote Sun Tzu. That\u2019s The Art of War, in case you didn\u2019t know. He was very smooth, like a spy in some novel. He kept saying he had to meet with someone and checking his watch. He didn\u2019t say who.\u201d</p><p>The groomsmen weren\u2019t as impressed with Milton. Christian Orr, Deuce\u2019s oldest friend, was tall and lanky, and his handshake was firm. \u201cYeah, I saw him at the party. He was pulling some sort of spy con on two of the bridesmaids. It was kind of funny to watch. I didn\u2019t see him after he left the party. Thought he got lucky, but . . . guess I was wrong. I switched rooms when Matt hooked up with that brunette bridesmaid. I spent the night with the Asian chick, Miyoko? Read her a fucking poem and she\u2019s yours, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, how do you pretend you\u2019re some sort of damn secret agent at a wedding for a psychiatrist and a yogi?\u201d Matthew Ferguson asked Nick. He was short and athletic, with dark hair and a playful smile. \u201cI spent most of the party with Ashlee. Have you seen her yet? Ashlee Knight? I mean, Goddamn. I was with her until around four this morning. She woke me up when she left my room.\u201d</p><p>Nick had started out making a chart of who had been sleeping where and with whom, but it had begun to look like a spider\u2019s web. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but the bedroom machinations of the staff caught him more off guard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell . . . it\u2019s a small island,\u201d Maisie Ross told him. \u201cJockie and I grew up together, so of course we\u2019ve been together. There are only a handful of year-round staff, and I\u2019m one of them, even if I am just the nanny when the family\u2019s here. I work as a housekeeper as well, and I help Jockie with the gardening. But when Amelia\u2019s on the island, she\u2019s my only job. I was with her that night, asleep. I have to sleep when she does or she runs me ragged.\u201d</p><p>Most of the staff and wedding guests were cooperative. Others were so nervous they could barely remember their names when Nick asked, and a select few were irritable or downright combative about being there. The Snake Eaters, especially, were irate when they were questioned.</p><p>Nick put the latter guests in a special list, which included all five of the Snake Eaters, to question them again. Just to irritate them.</p> <p>\u201cMy men wouldn\u2019t kill someone by bashing their head in with a rock,\u201d John English insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s just insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right it\u2019s insulting,\u201d Lenny Hardin sneered. He was around Nick\u2019s size, with dark hair and a receding hairline he tried to hide by keeping his head nearly shaved. \u201cIf I was going to kill some snot-nosed little bitch like that Milton guy, I sure as damn hell wouldn\u2019t use a rock. Come on. I bet even you Recon bitches know how to snap someone\u2019s neck.\u201d</p><p>Solomon Frost was one of the Snake Eaters Nick actually liked. He was lanky and laid-back, with close-cropped blond hair and a hard face that seemed at odds when he smiled. \u201cI was doing my rounds. The beach wasn\u2019t part of our territory; we stuck close to the house. I\u2019m just here to do a job. Are you getting paid for this shit? Because you should be.\u201d</p><p>The one female Snake Eater, Avery Kline, was even more irritated at being questioned than the others had been. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like being the only woman on a team like this? I have to work twice as hard to prove myself, and I still get the shitty assignments. They kept me inside the house the entire night, said it would make the female guests feel more comfortable. Do you know how much bullshit that is? Half those girls weren\u2019t even in their own beds most of the night anyway!\u201d</p><p>Riddle Park, the silent Korean Snake Eater, had nothing to say about the night before. Nick was searching his memory for the few bits and pieces of Korean he had learned to ask if the man spoke English when Park leaned closer to him and peered over the sunglasses he wore. One eye was a milky-white color. \u201cI saw nothing,\u201d he said, and then got up to leave.</p> <p>Hours into the day, after over thirty questionings, a picture of everyone on the island in his iPad, and an entire notepad full of notes, charts, and scribbles, Nick was ready to bash himself in the head with a pool cue.</p><p>He glanced up when the door clicked shut, and he sighed in relief when he saw that his next interview was Kelly.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Detective,\u201d Kelly drawled. He pulled up the stool opposite Nick and sat.</p><p>\u201cThis is fucking exhausting,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnyone out there look nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone out there looks nervous. What the hell are you doing to people in here?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged helplessly.</p> <p>\u201cOn the plus side, no one else has shown up dead.\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed at his eyes, fighting the throbbing that had started up about an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Kelly asked, his voice going softer.</p><p>Nick met Kelly\u2019s multicolored eyes, and warmth spread through him, easing the stress. He reached across the bar top and took Kelly\u2019s hand in his, kissing his palm without a word.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to take my picture for your records and ask me where I was last night?\u201d Kelly teased.</p><p>Nick responded with a low rumble, because he damn well remembered every last second of where Kelly had been last night. They were both silent for a few moments, their hands clasped. Kelly finally picked up Nick\u2019s iPad and took his own picture, making a face when he clicked it. Nick chuckled and took it away from him, setting it aside.</p><p>\u201cYou remember anything from last night that was off?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying, but I can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d</p> <p>Nick nodded. That was the answer he\u2019d been getting all day.</p><p>Kelly stood and walked around the end of the bar, coming up to Nick and sliding his arms around his shoulders. Nick rested his cheek against Kelly\u2019s chest and closed his eyes as Kelly rested his chin on Nick\u2019s head. He wrapped his arms around Kelly\u2019s waist and Kelly slid closer, holding him tight. They stayed that way for long minutes, giving Nick a break, soaking in each other\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cTy is waiting for the next interview,\u201d Kelly finally said, his voice suddenly tense.</p><p>Nick groaned, closing his eyes and burying his face in Kelly\u2019s chest. After interviewing Ty, they would have to switch and Ty would interrogate him. This was not the way he had envisioned telling Ty about himself and Kelly, but he supposed there was no choice now. It was his alibi, after all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Kelly told him. He patted Nick\u2019s cheek and stepped back. Nick\u2019s hands fell away as Kelly headed for the door. \u201cScream if he tries to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little funny.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted as Kelly slid out of the room, and before the door closed, Ty had stepped in.</p><p>\u201cYou look rough, buddy,\u201d Ty said with a smirk. He set a bottle of water down at Nick\u2019s elbow, along with a couple of aspirin, then took the stool across from him.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Nick stared at the bottle, feeling like his entire body was tumbling with nerves.</p><p>\u201cAnyone stand out?\u201d</p><p>Nick forced himself to meet Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot anything glaring. I\u2019ve been starting with the party and having them walk me through to four this morning. Most of the answers I\u2019m getting are alcohol or someone else\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprised,\u201d Ty said with a huff. \u201cWhy the party? Why so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s temp check said eight hours at least. Even accounting for the night being cold, that puts us around midnight, give or take an hour. The watch is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned hard, leaning his elbows on the bar. \u201cSo he . . . he probably left the party and then bought it. How\u2019d his watch break at three something?\u201d</p><p>Nick raised an eyebrow and nodded. He\u2019d been asking himself the same thing. \u201cI have no clue. I have two theories, though. Want to hear them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few people have said they noticed he was messing with his watch all night. It could have been broken, frozen at that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. What\u2019s the other theory?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cSomeone killed him knowing time of death would be tricky way out here, so they wound the watch to a later time and smashed it. Made it an easy TOD. Made sure someone saw them hours later for the alibi.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes, cocking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d do, anyway. In a pinch. Hope no one would bring out the turkey thermometer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a really scary serial killer, Irish.\u201d</p><p>Nick tapped his pen on his pad of paper, staring until Ty shifted uneasily. \u201cOkay. Walk me through the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. We ate. We had the meeting with Stanton. I think I left the patio twice over the course of the night to go take a piss. Then we wound up in the garden watching you smoke a joint with my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave that out of the notes,\u201d Nick grumbled as he wrote the rest down. \u201cDid you see the victim at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after the meeting in the study.\u201d</p><p>Nick added Ty to the list of people who hadn\u2019t seen Milton after the time of that meeting. He\u2019d obviously not returned to the patio that night, and that gave them roughly a ten-hour window for the crime.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone leave the party after the meeting, anyone who struck you as behaving oddly?\u201d</p><p>Ty gave it some real thought before shaking his head. \u201cHonestly, I was more concerned with you and Doc chatting up my baby cousin than watching anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Nick tried hard not laugh. \u201cWhere did you go after you left the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took a walk toward the beach. I asked Zane to marry me. He turned me down. Then we headed back to the room.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at his best friend for a few beats before saying, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ty slammed his hand on the bar top. \u201cHe said no! Twice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d Nick sighed, rubbing his temple as he recognized the warning signs of Ty winding up.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Three times! Three times he\u2019s turned me down!\u201d</p><p>Nick reached for the aspirin Ty had brought him.</p><p>\u201cThree times!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler, listen, I\u2019m really sorry about the . . . three times, but you seem to be handling it pretty well this far, and this isn\u2019t one of those instances where I need to talk you off the edge, so could we maybe save this until after I eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, a beautiful beach in Scotland? Nope. Castle? Nuh uh. Rug in front of a fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, stop. Ty, please,\u201d Nick said quickly. He put his head in his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . no.\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and nodded. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Nick watched him for a few seconds, still covering half his face with one hand. Ty looked absolutely miserable. He might have seemed like he was handling the rejections well, but Nick could see underneath the mask just like he\u2019d always been able to. \u201cCondolences on getting shot down. Repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t even glare at him. He looked like a kicked puppy, and it made Nick want to slam his face into the wet bar. \u201cYou need to talk about it, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m going fucking insane trying not to give him . . . puppy eyes and beg him to rethink it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can quit giving me puppy eyes. You\u2019ve asked him three times?\u201d Nick asked, hating himself for giving in and feeling sorry for Ty instead of feeling sorry for himself right now.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cHe said I hadn\u2019t thought it through yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be on my side, here,\u201d Ty grunted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the side of the righteous, babe; means I\u2019m rarely on your side.\u201d</p><p>Ty barked a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of time span are we talking here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him the night we got here,\u201d Ty said as he began to play with one of Nick\u2019s extra pens. \u201cBefore the dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve asked him to marry you three times in thirty-six hours?\u201d</p><p>Ty smacked his hand on the bar again. \u201cIf I had you on the balcony of a castle with the motherfucking wilds of fucking Scotland out the window and I asked you to marry me, wouldn\u2019t you say yes?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the location that\u2019ll reel Zane in, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked almost desperate when he realized Nick was willing to give him advice. He leaned forward. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . he said you hadn\u2019t thought it through. So think it the fuck through for him. Let him know you\u2019re serious and you\u2019re thinking about life instead of just wearing a ring. You know him. I mean, think about it, how would you propose to me?\u201d</p><p>Ty waited a beat, then said, \u201cSeason tickets at Fenway and a ring in your beer during the seventh inning.\u201d</p><p>Nick waved a hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m yours.\u201d They both laughed. Nick was still smiling when he dropped his voice to a more serious note. \u201cWhat are Zane\u2019s season tickets? What\u2019s the thing that will tell him you\u2019re in it for the long haul and you want him there with you? It\u2019s sure as hell not a beach in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, his gaze losing focus. Nick let him ruminate for a few seconds, until Ty finally snapped out of it. \u201cThanks, Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll say yes eventually.\u201d Nick looked back down at his notes, trying to remember where they\u2019d been in the interview. \u201cOkay, so you were on the beach getting shot down by the love of your life.\u201d</p><p>Ty grumbled wordlessly.</p><p>Nick smirked and fought to recover a straight face. \u201cDid you see anyone else while you were out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there were two people walking. Guy and a girl. We passed them.\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned at his notes. He paged through them. \u201cWhat time was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe . . . half past midnight.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled out every page of interview notes with a woman. No one, man or woman, had mentioned being out on the beach for a walk. \u201cWhat\u2019d they look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced up, eyes going wider. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t . . . look at them. I don\u2019t know. The girl was wearing a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, every woman on the island was wearing a dress last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t pay attention to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they young, old? Flustered, composed? Hair color, height? Were they hot, not? Were they bloody and carrying a very large rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler!\u201d Nick dropped his pen and rubbed his hands over his face. \u201cDo you realize you may have seen the killers and you can\u2019t even tell me what fucking color their hair was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I guess I don\u2019t check people out like I used to.\u201d</p><p>Nick groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to inform Garrett that your eyes don\u2019t wander. Did he see them as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head in disgust, glaring at Ty. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst witness ever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted and picked up his pen again. \u201cAnything else you didn\u2019t see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you don\u2019t have to be snippy about it.\u201d</p> <p>Nick fumed for a second. \u201cWhat time did you return to your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who was with you?\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed.</p><p>\u201cTy, just answer the fucking questions, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cZane was with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you remained there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I got tied up in the curtains.\u201d</p><p>Nick squeezed his eyes closed. \u201cWhy would you tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I literally got tied up in the curtains. I got stuck. Zane left me there.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced up, frowning.</p> <p>Ty rolled his eyes, blushing a little. \u201cI got tangled in the curtains and I couldn\u2019t stop laughing, so Zane left me there and I fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you passed out drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what they call \u2018sleeping\u2019 in Boston, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . could Zane have left the room at any point?\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned, shifting on his stool. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave a curt nod and jotted it down.</p><p>\u201cDid you just write that down?\u201d Ty asked with an accusatory point.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m writing everything down, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t write down that you and Deacon were getting high in the garden!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t pertinent to the murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither is Zane leaving me passed out drunk in the curtains!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to confuse me to get a confession, damn you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler, come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is police brutality!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, Beaumont . . .\u201d</p><p>Ty glowered for a moment. \u201cOkay, so is that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s stomach tangled up, but he nodded and slid the pad across the bar top. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>Ty ran through the same questions Nick had been asking all morning. With every answer, Nick got more and more nervous. He\u2019d probably fail a fucking lie detector test at this point.</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you return to your room?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cJust after midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were there the remainder of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Nick watched as Ty\u2019s pen moved across the pad. He swiped his palms across his knees, trying to steel himself for what was coming.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do in your room the remainder of the night?\u201d</p><p>Nick swallowed hard. \u201cI was in bed.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised his head. \u201cYou were in bed or you were sleeping?\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him, holding his breath. \u201cI was in bed.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyebrows shot up, and he straightened. He almost looked like he\u2019d been expecting the answer, like maybe he\u2019d heard enough through the wall last night to know Nick hadn\u2019t been sleeping, but he still seemed perturbed by it. \u201cI gather you weren\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Nick answered. He took a deep, shaky breath. \u201cLook, Ty, this is not the way I wanted to tell you about this. We were waiting until after the wedding stuff died down so you wouldn\u2019t freak out and go nuclear when you\u2019re already under stress.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes. He placed the pen on his pad of paper, the movement briefly drawing Nick\u2019s eyes. \u201cWho?\u201d Ty asked, his voice going low and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ty, don\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you with, O\u2019Flaherty?\u201d</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t get enough air to take a breath to steady himself, much less extract a promise from Ty to remain calm. \u201cI was with Kelly,\u201d he said in a rush.</p><p>Ty stared, his brow furrowing and the tension seeping out of his shoulders. \u201cKelly who?\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned. \u201cKelly. Our Kelly. Doc.\u201d</p><p>Ty was still staring like he didn\u2019t understand, his head cocked like a puppy hearing a new sound. He glanced at the door, then at Nick again. \u201cYou were fucking Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent for several more seconds, then barked out a laugh. \u201cI thought you were talking about Emma!\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed in relief. This was not the reaction he\u2019d expected, but he\u2019d take it.</p><p>Ty laughed harder, but soon he wound down and then stood up. \u201cWait, you were boning Kelly? How fucking high were you two last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not . . . it\u2019s not just last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Ty demanded.</p><p>\u201cI mean it wasn\u2019t the first time. I didn\u2019t just bring him because he has a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, man, how did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have time,\u201d Ty growled. \u201cHow long has it been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started after New Orleans, when we got to Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was . . . that was months ago! Why the hell am I just finding this out now?\u201d</p><p>Nick stood so he would be on the same level as Ty. He was glad the wet bar was between them. \u201cIt kind of caught us both by surprise. Then I got deployed before we could figure anything out. Ty, we didn\u2019t even know what the hell there was between us. We kept it quiet because we wanted to know it was serious before we said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, you could have told me any\u2014 Wait, what do you mean serious?\u201d</p><p>Nick found himself snickering again. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop, and the more he laughed the more agitated Ty got. He put out a hand to try to calm Ty. \u201cIt\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow serious?\u201d Ty asked, still looking scandalized. Nick half expected him to hold his hand to his heart any second now, maybe clutch a string of pearls. Nick howled, doubling over and holding his stomach as Ty glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d Ty shouted. \u201cI feel like I need bleach for my ear holes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Nick gasped. He pointed at Ty and shook his head, trying for enough breath to speak. He finally got himself under control and straightened his shoulders to meet Ty\u2019s eyes. He smiled almost serenely. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at that, his mouth falling open.</p><p>\u201cI love him, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, then looked down at the bar top for a long few seconds, then back up at Nick with narrowed eyes. \u201cAre we talking with the heart love or with the dick love?\u201d he asked, echoing Nick\u2019s words from so long ago.</p><p>Nick merely grinned.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ty said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ty repeated. He came around the end of the wet bar, beginning to smile, then pulled Nick into a hug, holding him and patting him on the back. \u201cHe\u2019ll treat you right and you deserve that. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Nick gasped as the relief hit him. He squeezed Ty tightly. \u201cYou\u2019re not pissed?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. He stepped back, meeting Nick\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot pissed. Maybe a little confused, but . . . it kind of makes sense, the two of you. You fit. And to be honest, I\u2019m relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were mad at me, man. You didn\u2019t call, you didn\u2019t write.\u201d He patted Nick hard on the cheek before turning away. \u201cYou dog, you.\u201d</p><p>Nick found himself gaping as Ty strolled to the door.</p><p>Ty said over his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll send Zane in so he can tell you what those people looked like.\u201d</p><p>Ty came out of the game room with a huge smirk on his face. It immediately put Zane on edge.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, almost afraid to get an answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you after,\u201d Ty promised with a passing pat to Zane\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Zane gave him a sideways glance as he headed for the door. Ty made his way to the lounge area where Kelly was sitting with the four other children who were on the island for the wedding, all kids of Ty\u2019s cousins. Amelia was on Kelly\u2019s knee. Kelly and Ty had been entertaining them during the interviews, telling them campfire stories and doing magic tricks. Both men were exceptionally good with the young ones, but then Kelly should be since he worked at a camp for at-risk youth.</p><p>When Zane stepped into the game room, he was nervous for some reason. As soon as he saw Nick, though, the nerves vanished. He was sitting on a stool behind the wet bar, his nose and forehead pressed to the polished wood, his hands flattened to the bar top like he\u2019d just bashed his face into it.</p><p>Zane smiled, understanding Ty\u2019s smirk now. Nick picked his head up and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Zane said immediately. He sat opposite Nick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had to interrogate him before. Only ever seen it from the other side.\u201d</p><p>Zane bit his lip. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe accused me of police brutality.\u201d</p><p>Zane finally gave in and chuckled.</p><p>Nick just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take a break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re one of the last five on my list,\u201d Nick said. He was flipping through his notes, looking for a blank page. He started talking before he landed on one. \u201cDo you remember seeing anyone on the beach last night during your walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we passed a couple walking, a guy and a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you recognize them?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cMaybe. I didn\u2019t, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t any of the guests or staff?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen, no. But I haven\u2019t seen everyone.\u201d</p><p>Nick handed him the iPad and brought up pictures he\u2019d taken of each person he\u2019d questioned. He tapped the screen. \u201cStart flipping through those for me, see if you recognize anyone.\u201d</p><p>Zane took the iPad.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about them?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Zane shrugged and began to flip through the photos. \u201cThey were both still dressed up from the party. Both fairly young. The guy was possibly blond, the girl maybe had dark hair, it was hard to tell because there was no moon. The girl had an accent.\u201d</p><p>Nick raised an eyebrow at that, looking hopeful for the first time. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>Zane winced. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It sounded sort of like a mix, or maybe like she had a problem with her palate. Ty could probably tell you.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled wryly. He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, then nodded like he was giving himself a pep talk to continue. \u201cDid they say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly, no. They were talking about walking on the beach not being romantic because it made their calves hurt.\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped writing and simply peered at Zane for a few moments, letting the silence stretch. Zane fought not to shift in his seat. Finally, he couldn\u2019t handle the scrutiny any longer and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably know,\u201d Nick started, sounding uncertain. \u201cTy couldn\u2019t tell me a damn thing about these people.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned, confused.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t even tell me what color hair they had. Didn\u2019t mention the accent. Didn\u2019t give either man or woman a second glance.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled when he realized Nick\u2019s point. Ty had always had straying eyes, and that had never bothered Zane. Hell, he did too sometimes. There was nothing wrong with looking at a beautiful person. But out there last night, holding Zane\u2019s hand on the beach, Ty hadn\u2019t noticed a thing about two possibly attractive people other than the fact that they were walking by.</p><p>\u201cYeah, grin all you want, but these two people might be our doers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Nick tapped his notes. \u201cNone of the other statements account for them. Did you leave your room last night, after Ty fell asleep?\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned at the sudden change in questioning, but he nodded. \u201cWell, not the room. I went out on the balcony at one point. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere from four to just before the sun came up. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s expression remained neutral. \u201cDid you see or hear anything? Notice anything unusual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. The storm was going pretty hard at that point.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave a curt nod and lowered his head. He stared at his notes for a few more seconds, and then glanced back up, narrowing his eyes. His voice was lower when he spoke. \u201cThe storm was going?\u201d</p><p>Zane raised both eyebrows. The more he saw of Nick\u2019s professional fa\u00e7ade, the more impressed he was. As a rule, federal agents didn\u2019t often get along with police detectives. Their turf war had been turned into something of almost mythical proportions, and was often furthered by strutting and bragging and bickering when they were forced to collaborate. Rookies bought into the rivalry and perpetuated it. Zane had worked with quite a few detectives he enjoyed, but he\u2019d also been forced to deal with more he absolutely hated.</p><p>He kind of wondered what it would have been like to have met Nick on a job rather than through Ty.</p><p>Nick put his pen down, staring at Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane finally asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get your time from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was after four,\u201d Nick reminded him. \u201cHow can you be sure if you didn\u2019t know the exact time?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged, beginning to blush. \u201cI . . . you can\u2019t tell Ty this.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI remember rolling over at one point and looking at the clock. It was 4:20. I found it funny.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick blinked rapidly, his mouth going harder.</p><p>Zane sniffed. \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed his fingertips over his lips and shook his head, but when he glanced back up he was sniggering softly. He cleared his throat and schooled his features. \u201cOkay. So it was after 4:20.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane grunted. He crossed his arms, blushing harder.</p><p>\u201cHow bad was the storm when you went out there?\u201d</p><p>Zane exhaled slowly, rubbing at his neck. \u201cIt was bad. I\u2019m not surprised a tree took out the boathouse. I mean, it was raining sideways and the wind was howling. It was, um . . . it was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat motionless, his green eyes on Zane, his face expressionless. Finally, his gaze drifted upward and he seemed to be staring at the ceiling over Zane\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did that broken watch make it through a storm like that?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>They sat in silence, staring at each other, both stumped by the question. Nick rested his chin in his palm, tapping his lower lip with his finger. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cThe pieces would have been washed away for sure. The gears probably inundated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone killed him around midnight, then went back after the storm was gone and smashed that watch. Why?\u201d</p><p>Zane sat frowning at Nick, trying to come up with a reason why someone would do that. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d he finally admitted.</p><p>\u201cWe need to look at that watch again.\u201d</p> <p>Zane nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you as soon we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook off the mystery of the broken watch and proceeded to ask Zane a few questions about the party, approaching several things from different angles in an attempt to jog details loose from Zane\u2019s memory. He seemed tired, though, and Zane could see his fingers trembling almost imperceptibly.</p><p>Nick was almost done with his questioning when the door burst open and Kelly barged into the room. Nick and Zane both stood.</p><p>\u201cSorry, just be a second,\u201d Kelly said to Zane, and he made a beeline for Nick behind the bar. He grabbed him before Nick could say anything, and kissed him.</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth fell open, and he sat back down hard as he watched. Kelly pulled away from the kiss, leaving Nick wide-eyed and speechless. \u201cTy told me what you said. Love you, too.\u201d He kissed him one more time for good measure, then turned with a nod to Zane and left the room.</p><p>The door shut with a muffled click.</p><p>Nick stared at the door as Zane stared at him. When Nick finally glanced at him, still looking stunned, Zane pointed a finger at him and shouted, \u201cI knew it!\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>Nick emerged from the game room after half a day of interviews, looking ragged and irritable. Ty felt badly for him.</p><p>The wedding party and staff had mostly dispersed, the latter going back to work, the former enjoying what was apparently a rare sunny day on the island. There was a pool in one of the wings Ty hadn\u2019t explored yet, a sulfur spring somewhere on the island, and he\u2019d heard people talking about badminton and croquet. There were rumors of a movie room somewhere, too, and tonight\u2019s big event included a screening of something. Ty had a feeling he\u2019d be skipping that in favor of other endeavors.</p><p>Amelia and the other Grady kids had all been carted off to the pool by the grandparents and one very disgruntled Snake Eater. Ty and several of the others were loitering around one of the many lounge areas in the great hall. Zane and Marley King, Emma\u2019s cameraman, were involved in a pretty hefty game of chess. Livi and Emma were playing some sort of game they both had on their iPhones, competing for high scores and alternately trash-talking each other and giggling. Deuce and Kelly had drifted away, their heads bent together in a conversation Ty was pretty sure someone should arrest them for having. Take Deuce\u2019s medical-grade weed and grow it with Kelly\u2019s homemade mountain blend, and they could probably occupy small countries with it.</p><p>Two of the Snake Eater bodyguards, a Korean of very few words named Riddle Park and a wiry blond named Solomon Frost who never seemed flustered by anything, had been drawn to the crowd, too. Ty had sat talking with them about their adventures for a while. They were essentially mercenaries, but they were interesting men and they\u2019d led interesting lives. By the time the interviews were all over, Park and Frost were trying to recruit Ty into their company, and they were giving it a pretty good sell.</p><p>At one time, Ty would have made a perfect mercenary.</p><p>When Nick approached, they all halted their activities and watched him expectantly. Deuce and Kelly wandered back over, and everyone was silent, watching Nick.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ty finally said after the silence had grown awkward. \u201cDo we talk about your findings and suspects, or do we talk about the more important matter of you and Kelly banging?\u201d</p><p>Nick pointed his notepad at Ty. \u201cAnd there it is.\u201d</p><p>The others laughed, and Kelly came over to wrap his arm around Nick\u2019s waist. Nick pulled him closer to hug him. Ty couldn\u2019t help but grin. He was a little thrown by it, he would admit. And he had decided to deal with the horrifying realization that two of his closest friends were now fucking each other by just not ever accepting the fact that they were. Problem solved. But that aside, Nick and Kelly had always been affectionate with each other, and had always loved each other. This wasn\u2019t so huge a step.</p><p>As long as Ty didn\u2019t think about them fucking, it was all good.</p><p>There was a clatter from the side table where Zane and Marley were playing chess, and Ty glanced over at them.</p><p>Zane was peering under the table. \u201cShit, sorry. I didn\u2019t realize it was under there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, man, it\u2019s a tough old bastard,\u201d Marley said as he bent to pick something up. Marley was an easygoing guy with the beginnings of dreadlocks and a perpetual smile. He was wiry and athletic, with the long, lean body type Ty associated with surfers. The flip-flops, cargo pants, and graphic tees he always wore reinforced the image, and his pockets seemed to be loaded down with all kinds of tools and miscellaneous bits. Plus, he was kicking Zane\u2019s ass at chess. Ty liked him.</p><p>He sat back up cradling a large camera, patting its side like a baby. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Zane was smiling, but as Ty watched, he saw an idea strike Zane like it had physically hit him. Zane leaned forward and pointed at the camera. \u201cHave you been filming with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got most of the party last night. Little bit of scenery this morning. I was going to go through it tonight, put some B roll together.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned to Ty, his eyes wide.</p><p>Marley glanced between them, frowning. Then it dawned on him why Zane would be interested, and his face split into a huge grin. \u201cMaybe it recorded something important, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, if we\u2019d thought of that five hours ago that would have been nice,\u201d Nick grumbled.</p><p>Emma hopped up from the couch. \u201cWe\u2019re on it!\u201d she said, tapping Marley on the shoulder. \u201cWant us to look for anyone who looks like a rock-bashing psychopath, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdeally, yeah,\u201d Ty told her. \u201cFind anything of Milton you can so we can track his movements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a movie room,\u201d Livi told them. She stood as well. \u201cI think you can attach your camera to the equipment and watch the footage on the big screen. I\u2019ll show you where it is.\u201d</p><p>The three of them headed off, Marley lugging the camera on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds he caught the murder on camera while he was eating or something and we can all go back to being common wedding guests?\u201d Zane asked under his breath.</p><p>Park and Frost both shook their heads. \u201cNope,\u201d Frost said.</p><p>They all turned their attention back to Nick. He looked exhausted and frustrated.</p><p>\u201cHey, Irish, you want to get some real food before we powwow on this?\u201d Ty asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I also wanted to take one more look at the body, see if we can pull something off that watch, so I\u2019ll just head for the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Kelly smacked his ass. \u201cWe\u2019ll come with.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and stood. They said good-bye to the two Snake Eaters, who had to go take their shifts, and left Deuce to retrieve Amelia from her nanny. The four of them headed for the kitchen.</p><p>They were halfway down the winding steps to the kitchen when Nick stopped abruptly and Ty bowled into him from behind. They barely caught themselves from tumbling down the steps.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat smell,\u201d Nick whispered. He backed up a step, reaching wildly. His hand landed on Ty\u2019s stomach and he clutched at Ty\u2019s shirt. His other hand grabbed for the gun he had tucked in the small of his back. Ty hadn\u2019t even known Nick was carrying.</p><p>He immediately recognized the panic in the other man, and he knew what happened when Nick panicked. Going for the gun himself would\u2019ve gotten Ty killed, so he grabbed Nick from behind, wrapping him up so he couldn\u2019t get it either. Ty felt like he\u2019d just grabbed a tiger by the tail.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he said urgently. He pulled Nick backward, lifting him and swinging him up the steps, away from the kitchen. Nick kicked against the stone stairwell wall, slamming Ty against the opposite wall. His breath left him in a rush and he saw stars.</p><p>They struggled silently for several more seconds, until Nick was hyperventilating and Ty had given up on getting him up the steps. Zane and Kelly crowded closer.</p><p>Ty fell to his back on the steps, using the weight of his own body to drag Nick down. Kelly reached for them and Nick lashed out at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell triggered it?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cWhen did he start doing this shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen this!\u201d Ty answered, voice strained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Nick gasped.</p><p>Ty could feel Zane hovering behind him, obviously at a loss. Zane had become well versed in how to handle Ty\u2019s flashbacks and panic attacks, but he\u2019d never seen Ty react like Nick just had. Ty\u2019s instinct when the memories got too close was to freeze and curl up and wait for them to pass.</p><p>But Nick\u2019s instinct had always been to stand and fight. He\u2019d go on the offensive before he could be hurt. He\u2019d expose himself to whatever triggered him until it no longer caused a reaction. And if he got lost enough in a flashback, he could be downright dangerous to anyone and everyone near him. He\u2019d once nearly taken out an entire med bay on ship before he was sedated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick offered, voice hoarse and weak. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you\u2019re okay,\u201d Kelly said softly. He shook his head at Ty. \u201cHe\u2019s done. I\u2019m pulling medic rank. No more of this shit today.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. Kelly would find no argument from him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nick grunted. He took a deep breath. His entire body was trembling, though, and he couldn\u2019t even look toward the bottom of the stairs. \u201cWe have to go down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to vote no on that one,\u201d Zane said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d Nick insisted. He twisted in Ty\u2019s arms, his muscles flexing. Ty loosened his grip, and Nick instantly began to relax. \u201cThe smell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the smell?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cCopper. Blood.\u201d He reached to the small of his back and brought out his Glock, handing it to Ty. \u201cIt\u2019s blood, Ty. Get down there.\u201d</p><p>Ty left Nick and Kelly on the steps, and he and Zane hustled to the kitchen. He led with the weapon, clearing the kitchen silently as Zane remained in the stairwell, then signaled for Zane to join him.</p><p>Zane stood over the pool of deep dark blood spreading across the pristine white tile of the gourmet kitchen. The copper scent was almost overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got one hell of a nose on him,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty nodded, taking in the gruesome scene. The cook lay sprawled on the floor, the blood still trickling from a wound in her back. One of her expensive knives was protruding from her spine, and her fine white hair was caked with blood. Ty bent to check her pulse. She was still warm, but there was no heartbeat and far too much blood on the floor for her to have lived long.</p><p>\u201cDoc!\u201d Ty called out anyway.</p><p>Ty turned when he heard the scuff of a shoe on the stairs. Kelly stood there, face pinched in concern. \u201cBlood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLots of it,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cDon\u2019t let Nick down here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head, but a second later Nick appeared at his side, peering into the kitchen. He was pale and shaken, and he was holding his shirt over his nose to prevent another bout of scent-induced panic. But he was there and he looked determined to stay.</p><p>\u201cVictim?\u201d he asked, his voice muffled.</p><p>\u201cCook\u2019s dead. Knife to the back,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>Kelly moved toward them and bent to check her regardless.</p><p>Ty was watching Nick, though. \u201cIrish, you don\u2019t need to be here.\u201d</p><p>The apprehension in Nick\u2019s eyes said he completely agreed, but he shook his head. \u201cWhere\u2019s Milton\u2019s body?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around for the walk-in freezer, making his way carefully over to it. There were no signs of a struggle in the kitchen, nothing out of place or messy. He covered his hand with his sleeve when he opened the freezer door to prevent his fingerprints from contaminating the scene. Not like they could fingerprint anything, but still.</p><p>He peered into the freezer and was immediately knocked back by what he found inside. He turned his head away from the sight, gagging and covering his face with his sleeve as he shoved his shoulder into the door to close it.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he managed to groan.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zane asked, voice laced with dread. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been gutted. He\u2019s hanging from a meat hook.\u201d Ty squeezed his eyes closed, trying to erase that visual from the databanks.</p><p>\u201cThat seems so unnecessary,\u201d Kelly muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd hard,\u201d Zane added. \u201cTook at least two people. Or one very big one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeed to find that big Snake Eater,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>Kelly came closer, joining Ty at the freezer to crack the door open and look inside for himself. He didn\u2019t have the reaction Ty\u2019d had, but then, Kelly had always been able to compartmentalize with wounds and death and gore.</p><p>Nick sat on the bottom step and lowered his head between his knees. Ty knew why the smell of blood threw Nick back into a moment of terror. He was surprised Nick was managing to hold it together at all right now.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been disemboweled,\u201d Kelly told them, then stepped into the freezer.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, no,\u201d Ty whimpered as Kelly disappeared. \u201cPlease come back. Kelly. Kelly! Doc! I\u2019m not coming in there! I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s voice echoed from inside the freezer. \u201cThey cut him open good. Looks like they were looking for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for something?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cInside him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans whatever it is, it\u2019s small enough to swallow,\u201d Nick offered. He sounded positively ill. \u201cIs his watch still on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s gone. O, get out of here,\u201d Ty said, almost as desperate to have Nick leave as Nick probably was. When Nick raised his head, Ty hardened his expression. \u201cConsider that an order if you must.\u201d</p><p>Rather than getting pissy about Ty pulling rank on him, Nick gave him a grateful nod and retreated up the stairs.</p><p>Kelly stepped out of the freezer wearing a pair of black butcher\u2019s gloves that went up to his elbows. He was holding a section of Milton\u2019s insides. He showed it to Ty and Zane with a frown, then squeezed it between his fingers. Ty backed away from him, covering his lower face with his arm. Zane coughed and put a hand over his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they found what they were after,\u201d Kelly concluded with another experimental squeeze. It made a wet, squishing sound.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Ty cried. \u201cPut that down! Jesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked from him to the gore in his hand. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m wearing gloves.\u201d</p><p>Ty gagged and had to turn away. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said pitifully, and made his way to the stairs to follow Nick\u2019s retreat.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you think they found what they were looking for?\u201d Zane asked Kelly as soon as they reached the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThey cut open his stomach, which is probably where anything he swallowed in the last day would still be. Then they started on his intestines. But I can tell you right now, it wouldn\u2019t have made it that far. I think they stopped because they were interrupted by the cook, not because they found anything.\u201d</p><p>Zane curled his lip in disgust.</p><p>\u201cUnless we\u2019re dealing with a straight-up psychopath who likes playing with people\u2019s insides,\u201d Kelly added. \u201cI mean, low probability, but it is you and Ty, so anything\u2019s poss\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Zane held up a hand to get Kelly to stop talking.</p><p>Kelly patted his shoulder in sympathy.</p><p>After Ty and Nick had both vacated the kitchen, Zane sent Kelly to go find Stanton. Night was falling, they now had two bodies on their hands, and one of those was the wife of the head butler. Deuce had been forced to sedate the man when he\u2019d been told. The staff was a shambles, the members of the wedding party had all locked themselves in their rooms for the night, and the Stanton family was beginning to eye the Gradys like this was all somehow their fault. The Gradys, for the most part, were carrying on like it was business as usual. Two dead bodies at a family get-together hadn\u2019t caused many of them to blink.</p><p>One thing he knew with certainty was that this would continue to spiral and more people would get hurt if they didn\u2019t figure out how to get to the mainland somehow. He wasn\u2019t even sure that getting to the bottom of it and finding out the whys and hows would help at this point.</p><p>Until they could get help from the mainland, though, they would have to handle this on their own. Zane asked Marley to video the scene, and the blond Snake Eater Ty had gotten friendly with, Frost, was taking photos. Every inch of the kitchen from top to bottom was being recorded as John English supervised. He had a solid alibi\u2014he\u2019d been watching Amelia and the other kids swim\u2014and he was the only man on the island who could have lifted Milton\u2019s body onto that hook alone. Zane wasn\u2019t sure he necessarily liked the big Snake Eater, but he was an effective leader and his team all seemed to respect him. That said a lot about a person.</p><p>English was now treating Zane like his counterpart: the leader of the Grady/Sidewinder band. Zane wasn\u2019t sure how that had happened, but he supposed with Nick and Ty both upstairs throwing up, and Kelly more interested in blood-spatter patterns than motive, Zane was the only one left.</p><p>He was fairly certain they\u2019d lost Nick as the lead on the investigation, and he would probably have to take it over now. He\u2019d have to sit down with Nick and find out what he\u2019d learned, but it wasn\u2019t his first priority right now. None of this was his first priority.</p><p>\u201cNick going to be okay?\u201d he asked Kelly.</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cThat was a new one for me. He\u2019s never reacted like that to blood, not in front of me. Means whatever that was happened while they were gone this time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m beginning to understand why he refused to go back to work, though, and it wasn\u2019t because he has a fucking tremor in his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s been doing the same thing. Not to that extent, but . . . what happened to them over there?\u201d Zane asked, voice hushed and edging toward desperate.</p><p>Kelly stopped walking and peered through the glass doors of the back patio, where Ty and Nick were both sitting on a bench in the garden. Nick had his head down, holding it in both hands. Ty sat with his hand on Nick\u2019s back, rocking to and fro.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Kelly answered. He stared at them for a few moments longer. Then he squared his shoulders, and his lips moved like he was giving himself a silent pep talk. Then he nodded and marched toward the patio doors.</p><p>Zane took a deep breath to bolster himself, then followed. They made their way to the bench in the garden where Ty and Nick were sitting. Zane wasn\u2019t sure how to handle this, because he knew Ty always seemed embarrassed after he panicked. He covered it with jokes, making fun of himself and hoping anyone who\u2019d witnessed it would simply pretend it had never happened. Zane had a feeling Nick would handle it a bit differently.</p><p>Ty and Nick raised their heads at their approach. Ty looked grim, the lines around his mouth tight and his brow furrowed. Nick, on the other hand, struck Zane as simply being humiliated. He returned his gaze to the ground. Kelly sat on his other side, their shoulders brushing. He waited a beat before gently resting his hand on Nick\u2019s back. Ty removed his hand, letting Kelly take over. When Nick didn\u2019t protest, Kelly slid his arm around him and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cCaught me off guard, is all,\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>\u201cI want to give you something to knock you out for the rest of the night,\u201d Kelly said to Nick. \u201cYou\u2019ve pushed yourself too far with all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him something?\u201d Zane asked. He winced, remembering the one time he\u2019d tried that tactic with Ty. It hadn\u2019t gone well, but then Nick and Kelly had a lot more history and trust behind them than Zane and Ty\u2019d had at that point. And Kelly was asking first instead of just slipping it into Nick\u2019s drink.</p><p>Kelly glanced up at him. \u201cYeah, I have my kit with me. And I bet Deacon has something with him if I don\u2019t. Whatever he used on the butler, if he has enough to put Nick out. I kind of doubt he does.\u201d He looked back to Nick, who was watching him. They sat staring at each other in silence for a few seconds before Nick nodded.</p><p>Kelly patted Nick\u2019s knee and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>The rest of them remained where they were as Kelly jogged off into the house. Zane turned his attention back to Ty and Nick.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Nick sat back, taking a deep breath. \u201cEveryone has a shaky alibi. The couple you two saw on the beach are the only anomaly, and I can\u2019t figure out who the fuck they could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one fits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people fit. That\u2019s the problem. Then there\u2019s the broken watch, which is wrong every way we look at it. Whoever came back and cut him open, they took that watch, so it\u2019s got to be important for some reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the pictures you took?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick nodded and pulled his iPad out of a pocket inside his jacket. He handed it over.</p><p>Zane looked at the iPad with a frown, brushing his fingers along the edge of it. Nick had been carrying it with him since this morning, but the screen was spotless. Maybe Nick cleaned obsessively like Ty did when he was bothered by something. Zane glanced at the two of them again, sitting side by side like two little boys who\u2019d been sent out of class for misbehaving. Nick\u2019s head was down, his shoulders slumped. Ty was staring off into the horizon, watching the last rays of the sun disappear.</p><p>\u201cI think we should call it a night. Let you two recover,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty nodded in agreement. He absently raised his hand to Nick\u2019s back again. Zane didn\u2019t know if Ty did it to comfort Nick or himself.</p><p>\u201cThese islands have a reputation for being hit with rogue waves,\u201d Nick said without raising his head.</p><p>Ty and Zane locked eyes, both of them frowning in confusion. They both looked back to Nick, waiting for him to connect rogue waves to anything that had happened today. Nick raised his head, glancing at them both. Then his eyes fixed on the cliff not far off.</p><p>\u201cShips would dock at these remote islands where nothing but lighthouses stood and find them completely deserted. Food still on the plates. Fires nothing but embers. Clocks not wound for weeks. Everyone on the island vanished. They called them the Ghost Isles, no one would go near them because they were cursed.\u201d</p><p>Ty began to run his hand over Nick\u2019s back in slow circles. \u201cNick,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe theory of anyone who didn\u2019t believe in curses was rogue waves. Ninety, sometimes a hundred-feet high or more, just sweeping in out of the blue and taking everything on the island with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d Ty said a little more forcefully. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned to meet his eyes, and they sat there simply staring at each other for several moments. Zane shifted his weight, realizing he was a little unnerved by the monotone of Nick\u2019s voice. He was seriously beginning to wonder just how messed up Nick\u2019s mind was, but then Nick leaned closer to Ty, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow many places do you think we swept through, leaving people to wonder where the rogue wave came from?\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked rapidly, obviously taken aback by the direction Nick had gone. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at Zane, then stared out at the cliffs again. \u201cNobody\u2019s safe on this island as long we\u2019re out of touch with the mainland. Everyone\u2019s going to die in Scotland if we don\u2019t stop this.\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t seem to tear his eyes away from Nick, but Zane turned and glanced into the house. \u201cWhere the hell is Kelly with those fucking sedatives?\u201d he said under his breath. Nick was starting to make even him nervous; he didn\u2019t need Ty losing his shit, too.</p><p>\u201cIrish, you have to look at this as just another case, okay? Just another murder. That\u2019s all it is,\u201d Ty was saying, keeping his voice low as he leaned closer to Nick. \u201cYou have to take the island and the boats and the phones out of the equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Nick asked pointedly.</p><p>Ty opened his mouth to respond, but then snapped it shut again.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you discount all that? Why, when it makes for the perfect backdrop to wipe out a company with defense contracts? To take out a team of mercenaries? Target a family whose wealth fuels Philadelphia? Why would you think that storm destroyed those boats when it could just as easily have been a person?\u201d</p><p>Ty was left with a frown of consternation, and Zane was left even more unsettled than he\u2019d been.</p><p>Nick was still shaking his head when Kelly returned, a canvas bag with a red cross sewn onto it slung over his shoulder. Nick stood and waved him off. \u201cWe don\u2019t need that,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve got stronger shit in my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>He walked off toward the house, shoulders hunched and head down. Kelly gave Ty and Zane a mystified glance before turning on his heel to follow.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s insane,\u201d Zane finally said to Ty once they were alone, horrified by the realization. He\u2019d always been under the impression that Nick was the sane one, the only sane one, the one who kept the others all in line, the one who kept Ty from going for rides on the loco coaster. Now it looked like Nick was driving the damn thing.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cHe always has been. He controls it well. It\u2019s part of his charm. The hell of it is, he\u2019s right, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight about what? Rogue waves and dying in Scotland? I mean, I\u2019m no goddamn psychiatrist, but even I can see he\u2019s under way too much stress. He\u2019s rambling, Ty. He\u2019s cracking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if he is?\u201d Ty said heatedly, standing to face Zane. \u201cHe deserves to after what happened! How many times have you seen me crack and you still listened to what I was saying, even if it sounded like I was losing my mind?\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed and squeezed Ty\u2019s arm to calm him. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty stared at him like he\u2019d been expecting him to argue.</p><p>Zane pulled him closer, tightening his grip on Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you guys?\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhatever it was, it\u2019s driving you both over the edge.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked and licked his lips, trying to speak and failing. He finally swallowed and managed to say, \u201cYou know I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to tell someone,\u201d Zane said gently. \u201cYou both do. Before it eats you up inside.\u201d</p><p>The haunted look in Ty\u2019s eyes returned briefly before he turned away. \u201cCan we just deal with one thing at a time here?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. He knew when to stop pushing Ty, and he\u2019d reached his limit. \u201cThere\u2019s not much else we can do tonight. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, glancing up at the house. \u201cNick was right. We didn\u2019t even look at the boathouse. I want to go down to the dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? Ty, it\u2019s dark, what do you expect to find?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ty said with a frustrated shrug. \u201cBut it\u2019s time we start looking at this as the perfect location to massacre a group of people instead of a few freak accidents.\u201d</p><p>Zane had been looking at it that way all along, but he realized he\u2019d also been looking at it as strictly Not His Problem. This wasn\u2019t their jurisdiction. The victims were strangers to them. And since no one Zane cared about had been accused of the murders, he\u2019d simply been shrugging his way through, waiting until help came from the mainland. Ty had, too, to an extent, until Nick\u2019s words had sparked something.</p><p>\u201cIf that boathouse was taken out on purpose, it means someone intends to have his way with this island and everyone on it,\u201d Ty hissed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at it as a murder. What if it was a shot across the bow instead?\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cI was so hoping this would be a normal vacation.\u201d</p><p>Ty smacked him on the side of the head. \u201cDon\u2019t use bad words,\u201d he said as he walked off.</p><p>They followed the cliff path, taking an indirect route to the boathouse and dock so no one would see them heading off and wonder where they were going. The way to the dock was wooded and kind of creepy at night. It was also a long walk in the cold, something they should have realized since they\u2019d ridden in the golf cart when they\u2019d arrived.</p> <p>\u201cDid you bring a flashlight?\u201d Zane asked as he glanced up at the trees reaching over them, their skeletal branches silhouetted in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cI admit I didn\u2019t think this through,\u201d Ty mumbled. He dug in his pocket and extracted his phone. \u201cThis is all I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>They carried on in the darkness, using the spotty moonlight to show their way for as long as they could. When they broke the edge of the woods and came up to the rise in the path just before the docks, they both stopped at the same time. There was a light moving around the ruins of the boathouse, playing over broken boards and twisted rope. Everything else was dark. As they stood watching, disjointed voices drifted toward them, two or three people speaking quietly.</p><p>They both crouched and moved closer, silent on the dirt path. When they got close enough to the docks to hear the words being said, they moved off the path and knelt behind a pile of broken and battered canoes.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you boys out the night?\u201d a voice asked. Zane recognized the barely understandable Scottish brogue of Lachlan Mackie, the ferryman who\u2019d met them on the docks the afternoon they arrived. He held a lantern, its weak glow not quite reaching the two figures he was addressing.</p><p>\u201cWe came to see you, Mackie,\u201d one of the men responded.</p> <p>Ty gasped when he recognized the voice.</p><p>Zane smacked him in the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s Kelly,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Ty put his hand on Zane\u2019s head. \u201cI know, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognize a kindred soul when I see one,\u201d Kelly continued. The light continued to play over the wrecked boathouse. Zane assumed Nick had the flashlight. \u201cSee, we had to go through airport security to get here, left our hands a little empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Mackie said with a chuckle. \u201cI think I can show you some hospitality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they here buying weed?\u201d Zane whispered in Ty\u2019s ear. \u201cWe walked half a mile through the creepy woods to watch them buy weed?\u201d</p><p>Ty shushed him, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you stay out here, Mackie?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cAye. I make quarters up yonder the path.\u201d Mackie was doing something with his hands, probably pulling out or rolling a blunt, if Zane were to guess.</p><p>\u201cMust have been one hell of a racket when the storm hit,\u201d Nick commented carelessly. He took the rolled cigarette Mackie handed him.</p><p>\u201cAye, that it was. It was pelting down. I got out here in time to see the tree falling. Stood right where you are. Wasn\u2019t until the lightning strike I saw the dock was gone, the boats all with it.\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped closer, and Mackie lit the blunt for him.</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been hard, watching all your boats head out to sea without you,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t the first time, won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Mackie nodded. \u201cThese islands, they weren\u2019t meant to be lived on. That old castle on the hill, she\u2019ll tell you some stories. The house will, too. Even the caves in the cliffs, they\u2019ll sing to you about death. The island likes to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly stood side by side as Mackie turned and headed back up the path, using an old wooden oar as a cane. Smoke rose as one of them took a hit.</p><p>\u201cYou boys have a good night.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane crouched lower as Mackie passed by. There was no reason to reveal their presence, not until the old ferryman was gone.</p><p>\u201cDude\u2019s kind of creepy,\u201d Nick said after he was out of sight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you in twenty years.\u201d</p><p>Nick jabbed Kelly hard in the stomach, making him double over with a bark of laughter.</p><p>Ty sighed heavily, shaking his head. In the moonlight, Zane could see Kelly quietly poking fun at Nick as he lit the blunt again. But Nick was staring over Kelly\u2019s head, looking in their direction.</p><p>\u201cHe spotted us,\u201d Ty whispered dejectedly.</p><p>\u201cGrady?\u201d Nick called out. Kelly turned to peer into the darkness.</p><p>Ty and Zane both stood, coming out of their hiding spot. \u201cWhat gave us away?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cI saw you come over the rise,\u201d Nick admitted, smirking. He waved his flashlight as they made their way toward them. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>\u201cSounds like I was wrong, it really was an accident. Unless Mackie set the boats loose himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means the murderer is stuck here just like we are,\u201d Zane surmised.</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cAnd probably really pissed about it.\u201d</p><p>Nick glared and took the marijuana from him, shaking his head. Zane narrowed his eyes when Nick stuffed the blunt in his pocket. Kelly clapped a hand over his mouth, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you two get here so fucking fast?\u201d Ty demanded. He swiped at Nick, smacking him in the arm. \u201cAnd how do you go from full-fledge meltdown to out here investigating? Rambling about rogue waves and scaring the shit out of us! You had me all freaked out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe rode,\u201d Nick answered, gesturing toward the darkness up the coast. He let out a whistle, and there was a gentle nicker in response. Hooves stomped the wet ground.</p><p>Ty glanced around. \u201cRode what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses. We went to the stables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are stables?\u201d Zane asked, his mood lightening at the mere mention of it.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cDid you two walk through the Sleepy Hollow woods in the dark?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it was scary!\u201d Ty shouted. \u201cWhy are there horses?\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both laughed. \u201cDo you want one of our horses for the way back?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane answered at the same time as Ty\u2019s emphatic, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Nick flicked on his flashlight again, pointing it at the sound of clopping hooves. The two horses came closer, and Kelly moved toward them, talking to them in gentle tones. Both Nick and Kelly seemed comfortable and knowledgeable around the animals. One of them nudged Nick\u2019s shoulder and he patted the horse\u2019s neck, then took the reins.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing them over to Zane. \u201cThey know the path, so their footing\u2019s sound in the dark. You don\u2019t even have to lead them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting on that thing,\u201d Ty insisted. They watched Kelly mount, his movements natural and easy. Zane recognized a man who\u2019d worked with horses a great deal. Kelly offered Nick his hand, and Nick pulled himself into the saddle behind him.</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty, smiling widely. He hefted himself into the saddle easily, making himself comfortable on the large horse. \u201cCome on, doll, go for a ride with me.\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at each of them, including the horses. \u201cI hate you all,\u201d he said before reaching for Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>Ty held tightly to his waist, refusing to release him even after the horse had settled into an easy trot. They came abreast of Kelly and Nick, the horses tossing their heads at each other. It was nearly impossible to see under the cover of the trees. Nick\u2019s flashlight was the only light.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you two decide to come down here tonight?\u201d Zane asked them, raising his voice over the clopping of the horses\u2019 hooves.</p><p>\u201cSame as you,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cI just needed to know what we were dealing with.\u201d He pulled his flashlight, turning it into a small lantern that he held out between them. His other hand was on Kelly\u2019s waist, resting there. He wasn\u2019t gripping Kelly like Ty was gripping Zane, and he seemed pretty at ease with the whole horse thing even though he wasn\u2019t in control of the animal.</p><p>\u201cHow does a city boy from Boston get to know horses?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick looked from Zane to Ty, both eyebrows jumping. \u201cTy never told you?\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced over his shoulder. Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWe were some of the first into Helmand Province,\u201d Nick explained. \u201cThe mission was to clear Marja, and we were part of the advance team sent in for recon. But there were no roads. No equipment had even been floated in yet. Nothing but what we could hump in on our backs. The only way to get from one point to another was by horse. We probably spent six weeks on horseback altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, Digger on a horse,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe kept threatening to make his horse into stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe named his horse Stu,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ty\u2019s kept biting him. I even switched with him after a few days,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cBut then it would gallop to catch up to him just so it could bite him.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both laughed. Their horse shied to the side, and Kelly glanced off into the woods.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny,\u201d Ty grumbled into Zane\u2019s ear.</p><p>Somewhere in the woods to their right, a tree branch snapped, the sound so loud it startled the horses. A moment later there was a thump and another crack, and Zane would have sworn it sounded like silenced gunshots.</p><p>The horses both reared, neighing in terror. Ty\u2019s grip on Zane\u2019s waist tightened, and they both managed to stay in the saddle. Out of the corner of his eye, Zane saw Nick hit the ground. The lantern in his hand went rolling with him, casting garish shadows on the trees around them before it disappeared into the ditch along the side of the path and extinguished, throwing everything into complete darkness. Kelly\u2019s horse bolted, and Zane\u2019s galloped off after it.</p><p>Zane fought with the reins, trying to turn the horse, to stop it. They heard shots behind them, not silenced this time, but booming through the wet night. Kelly struggled with his horse, trying to force it to turn back for Nick, but it was too spooked by the gunfire. Zane finally got his horse to stop in the middle of the path. Ty pushed off him, dismounting and hitting the ground with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cGo get him!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Zane turned the horse, spurring it to a gallop into the inky darkness.</p><p>Nick lay in the middle of the road, staring at the moon through the creepy, bare branches of the trees. He had his gun in his hands, still pointed at the trees on the side of the path. He hadn\u2019t emptied his revolver, even though that had been his first instinct. He had two shots left.</p><p>He heard the pounding hooves seconds before he felt the vibrations beneath his shoulders. The fall had nearly knocked the sense out of him, and he didn\u2019t think he could move. That horse was probably going to trample him, and he still couldn\u2019t find the ability to scramble off the path. Instead he raised one hand, aiming his gun into the night sky like he could hit Orion\u2019s Belt. He waited until he could see the outline of the charging animal and then fired into the air.</p><p>The horse reared, bucking and trying to retreat, and Zane cursed, trying to calm it.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty!\u201d Zane shouted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that thing step on me,\u201d Nick called back.</p><p>The horse sidestepped toward him, still nervous but calming as Zane cooed to it. Zane hit the ground just feet away, and then knelt beside him, keeping the horse between them and the woods.</p><p>\u201cAre you hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStag,\u201d Nick said to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a stag. I shot it.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked over his shoulder into the woods. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t shots fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Bigass deer. Help me up, huh?\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled him up to sit, giving him a moment to make sure nothing was broken before dragging him to his feet. He stretched and shook himself out, managing not to whimper. \u201cI think I broke my ass bone,\u201d he said, and they both grinned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other horse trotted up, Kelly and Ty in the saddle. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kelly cried.</p><p>\u201cI shot dinner,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Kelly snorted. \u201cLook, Hannibal, you can shoot back if they\u2019re shooting at you, but it\u2019s still not okay to eat them afterward.\u201d</p> <p>Zane retrieved the light, converting it back into a flashlight and holding it up so they could see into the woods. The stag Nick had shot was lying a few yards away, the bullet holes right at its heart, steaming in the night.</p><p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt was a deer?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cGoddamn, I would have sworn those were shots.\u201d</p><p>Nick squinted into the woods, shrugging. That was why he\u2019d started firing back, but he supposed the wet pop of the underbrush with the weight of a deer that size would be as loud as what they\u2019d heard. If not, they\u2019d probably all still be taking fire.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d Zane said as he stood. He took the reins and pulled himself into the saddle, then held his hand out to Nick. \u201cYou okay to ride?\u201d</p> <p>Nick gave him a disgruntled nod and hefted himself onto the horse behind Zane. He groaned when he got up, resting his forehead on the back of Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCorpsman up,\u201d he said pitifully.</p><p>\u201cDid you break your coccyx?\u201d Kelly asked, just barely keeping the laughter out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou can check it for me tonight,\u201d Nick said wryly.</p><p>Ty made an offended sound and followed it with a simple, \u201cNope!\u201d before spurring the horse into the darkness.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cIt bothers you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Zane asked as Ty paced in front of the fireplace in their room. Ty hadn\u2019t even shed his dirty clothes yet; he\u2019d been too busy thinking about what Nick and Kelly were probably doing next door.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty insisted. He winced, realizing the lie in his answer. He turned to Zane almost desperately. \u201cYes. A little. Should it? I feel like it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty,\u201d Zane answered. He was sitting at the little desk, booting his laptop up. He still had the flash drive Deuce had given them, and it was the first chance they\u2019d had to look at it.</p><p>Ty stopped and ran his hands over his face. \u201cI thought I was okay with it, but it\u2019s weird!\u201d</p><p>Zane simply smiled and shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for you. But they\u2019ve known each other for fifteen years, and suddenly they\u2019re all . . . and it\u2019s . . .\u201d He waved his hand helplessly at the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the fact that they\u2019re fucking,\u201d Zane told him.</p><p>Ty pointed at the wall. \u201cThat is exactly what they\u2019re doing!\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled, nodding. \u201cTy. You\u2019re upset because you know there\u2019s something else going on with Nick, and he hasn\u2019t talked to you about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow could he not fucking tell me about them?\u201d</p><p>Zane raised both eyebrows. \u201cMaybe he was afraid you\u2019d react like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t do it in front of him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now that you know they\u2019re together?\u201d Zane continued. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019s told Kelly what\u2019s bothering him, and not you. He\u2019s talked about things with the doc that he used to reserve for you and that upsets you.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard. \u201cWhen you put it that way, it makes me sound like an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled. He was silent for a moment, then cursed quietly. \u201cMy laptop\u2019s been fried!\u201d Zane cried. \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, looks like it didn\u2019t like the trip here; it\u2019s completely dead. I think Nick was right, these islands are cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you to buy a Mac.\u201d</p><p>Zane slammed the lid of the laptop closed and turned away from the desk, coming over to the bed.</p><p>Ty watched him, feeling out of sync and a little desperate to understand why.</p><p>Zane took pity on him and ran a hand over his head. \u201cHe\u2019s your best friend, Ty. It hurts when you feel like your friends are pulling away, I know. I lost every one of mine, but none of them were like Nick is to you, you know? He\u2019s not replacing you with anything. Trust him.\u201d</p><p>Ty slumped his shoulders, his brow furrowing as he looked down at the USMC signet ring on his finger. He twisted it, trying to find the truth in Zane\u2019s words. Aside from Deuce, Nick was the most consistent, oldest friend Ty had. They had been through everything together, shared everything together. They\u2019d lived in the same room in some fashion for almost seven years; in some ways they were closer than brothers, and they had no secrets.</p><p>Or they hadn\u2019t, until the last few years. Ty shook his head. No, it was earlier than that. It was when he\u2019d signed on for the FBI, for Burns\u2019s work. Ty had been so angry that Nick wouldn\u2019t come with him, he\u2019d just shut him off entirely. He supposed that had been the beginning of the secrets. The beginning of where they were now. They\u2019d reconciled, but their friendship had felt different ever since. There had been times during their deployment when Ty had been sitting in the canteen and seen Nick walk in, but Nick hadn\u2019t come over to sit and talk. A few times Nick had even acknowledged him, but gathered his food and left anyway. There had been moments they\u2019d passed each other in camp and Nick had saluted and been on his way without even a knowing smirk at the oddity of Ty\u2019s rank.</p><p>Ty groaned and threw himself onto the bed, staring up at the high ceiling. \u201cI feel like I lost him somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Zane stretched out next to him, lying on his side so he was facing Ty. \u201cDid you ever think maybe he feels the same way?\u201d</p><p>When Ty glanced at him, Zane was smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cOut of all the problems we could be lingering on tonight, I think it\u2019s kind of sweet that you\u2019re moping about your best friend.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. He finally snorted and swiped his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou want to shower?\u201d Zane asked, lowering his voice suggestively.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get dirty first?\u201d</p><p>Ty raised one eyebrow in a show of detached interest, trying to hide his smirk. He turned his head, looking Zane up and down.</p><p>Zane grinned, his eyes warming. He rested his hand on Ty\u2019s chest, pushing the buttons apart to get to skin.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the hot spring,\u201d he suggested, the warmth in his eyes turning into outright fire.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all the way down there,\u201d Ty protested, pointing toward the balcony.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in its own little area . . . secluded . . . steamy.\u201d</p><p>Ty began to smile, but he held his ground, shaking his head. \u201cYou kinky little exhibitionist, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just suggesting that a hot soak would feel really good for aching muscles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have some aching muscles.\u201d</p><p>Zane hummed and scooted closer, nudging his nose against Ty\u2019s chin.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and smiled, sliding his hand up Zane\u2019s back. \u201cYou were sexy as hell on that horse tonight. Riding to the rescue.\u201d</p><p>Zane stole a kiss. \u201cI can think of someone else I\u2019d like to see riding something.\u201d</p><p>Ty bit his lip, loath to admit that he enjoyed Zane\u2019s cheesy come-ons. He wrapped his arms around Zane and brushed the tip of his nose against his lover\u2019s. \u201cWhatever makes you happy, Lone Star.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cCome on, Captain. It\u2019s late. No one else will be out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said I need rest for the vapors. Thought you said you were tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was until I thought about you and me in that damn hot spring.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed as his body responded favorably to the idea. Zane\u2019s playful smile was another reason to say yes. No matter what had happened to Ty and the rest of Sidewinder while they\u2019d been deployed, Zane had definitely benefited from those six months. He seemed unburdened now, more willing to simply grab onto life and go for a ride. Ty brushed his fingers through Zane\u2019s hair with an affectionate grin.</p><p>\u201cYou know if we get out there, I\u2019m just going to ask you to marry me again.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s grin widened further. \u201cI\u2019ll risk it.\u201d</p><p>Ty wasn\u2019t even sure where the damn hot spring was, so Zane led him through the quiet mansion, out the back patio to the path that curved its way into the interior of the island.</p><p>Ty squeezed his hand and pulled him closer, enjoying such a simple thing as walking along the dark path with their fingers entwined. This particular path was lit by dim, boxed solar lights set low to the ground. Zane didn\u2019t hurry. He purposely brushed their arms together as they walked.</p><p>The warmth Ty had noticed whenever Zane was near him began to spread further, making the touch of Zane\u2019s fingers like traces of fire, and a sort of unfettered giddiness crept in. They so rarely had these moments, but tonight Ty could make himself believe they were normal.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t let go of his hand when they reached the spring area. It was deserted, just like Zane had guessed it would be. It was also unlit.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Zane said, moving along the pathway to the spring edge.</p><p>Ty looked down at the water as they passed by. Only the moon and the eerily glowing mineral water of the hot spring showed them the way.</p><p>Zane pulled his shirt over his head and dropped it to the grass at the edge of the spring. Then his hands dropped to the button on his jeans, and he stopped. Ty hung back, watching him as deep breaths became harder to manage. He didn\u2019t think this thrill of anticipation would ever get old. Zane raised one eyebrow\u2014a clear dare\u2014and unfastened his jeans, letting them slide down his hips and thighs to fall to the dirt path.</p><p>Ty popped the button on his pants and dropped them, pulling out of his shirt without bothering to unbutton it. He kicked his clothing off to the side and moved toward Zane and the swirling water. The night was fucking freezing. Zane descended into the spring, down the carved-out steps into the bottom, and the water hit right at his chest as he turned in place to leer at Ty and hold out a hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips twitched at the chivalrous gesture. Sometimes Zane just couldn\u2019t help himself. Ty got in slowly, enjoying the heat as it lapped at his cold skin.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both going to catch pneumonia on the way back in,\u201d Ty griped.</p><p>He took Zane\u2019s hand, pulling himself closer until their bodies just barely touched in the bubbling water. Zane curled their hands together while taking a step back, tugging gently for Ty to follow. They were, for all intents and purposes, out of sight unless someone walked around the path to look directly at the spring. It was also insane for anyone to be out when it was this cold. The knowledge didn\u2019t keep the butterflies out of Ty\u2019s stomach, though.</p><p>He followed Zane regardless, willing to risk getting caught.</p><p>Zane sat on the bench molded from the rock under the water, drawing Ty down next to him. Then he sighed happily, leaning back in the steaming water. \u201cNow this is nice.\u201d</p><p>Ty settled into the water beside Zane, acknowledging the tease. He eased over and let their shoulders press together as he leaned his head back. He hooked his leg over Zane\u2019s knee, resting it there so their calves pressed together and he could slide his toes against Zane\u2019s ankle. Zane slid his palm against Ty\u2019s thigh, stroking idly under the water, then shifted a little, sliding his arm behind Ty\u2019s back and angling himself so Ty was leaning against him. He settled his hand on Ty\u2019s hip, rubbing the skin under his fingertips.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and turned his head toward Zane, adjusting so that more of their skin touched. He was content to sit like this, comfortable and intimate. It was a gentler foreplay then they were used to, and it was doing some very interesting things to Ty\u2019s mind and body. It seemed like he was tingling all over, and it wasn\u2019t from the minerals in the hot spring. He rested his head on Zane\u2019s arm, letting the water and the promise of his lover\u2019s caresses warm him.</p><p>Zane seemed just as content to remain like that, their bodies brushing, teasing, relaxing into each other. The hot water swirled around them. It was some time before Zane even turned his head and leaned forward enough to nuzzle at Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty turned to meet his lips, nipping at him languidly as he moved his palm across Zane\u2019s hard abs. Zane growled and chased Ty\u2019s lips, making it a game while his free hand glided over Ty\u2019s belly under the water. Ty grinned and nipped at him again, backing away playfully and pushing himself out into the center of the spring. His leg stayed hooked over Zane\u2019s as he let himself float.</p><p>Zane laughed quietly and grabbed for his hips, leaning against the wall of the spring to watch. Ty smiled and closed his eyes, floating for a few moments with nothing but the sound of the spring in his ears and the feeling of Zane\u2019s hands on his hips to keep him there. It was the anchor he\u2019d been missing for the last year, the one thing that could ground him every time he began to drift. Finally, he bent his knees and sat up, pulling himself to Zane and ending up straddling one of his thighs. He slowly slid his knee over Zane\u2019s other leg, skin gliding against skin, until he sat astride him, kneeling on the underwater bench. Zane\u2019s hands had remained on his hips. He sat gazing up at Ty in the moonlight, unabashed devotion written all over his face.</p><p>Ty rested his arms on Zane\u2019s shoulders and kissed him soundly. The warmth that had never dissipated began to churn inside him, love and desire warring for his attention. He groaned and delved his tongue between Zane\u2019s lips, seeking something more. Zane pulled him close as they kissed, responding to Ty\u2019s fervor with calm, consuming focus.</p><p>Ty smiled against his lips and finally forced himself to pull away. Zane\u2019s face was shadowed, but Ty knew every feature by heart. The laugh lines that mingled with frown lines, the curve from his broken nose, the hints of gray feathered at his temples. His warm brown eyes that could go hard as obsidian in a blink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slid his hand down the side of Zane\u2019s face. \u201cMarry me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane grinned, biting his tongue as he narrowed his eyes like he was considering it. Then he shook his head once. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cSo polite this time.\u201d They were both grinning when they kissed again, but the disappointment was sharper for Ty than he\u2019d expected. He was going to keep asking until he got it right, until Zane had forgiven him and was ready. Knowing Zane loved him didn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t hurt though.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s hands slid along his skin under the water. They were crouched low, trying to keep their shoulders under water so the cold air wouldn\u2019t bite at them. Ty could feel Zane growing harder. He adjusted the way he was sitting, rubbing against Zane to elicit a moan or two.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane finally whispered against his lips. His fingers dug into the muscles of Ty\u2019s thighs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you convinced me to come out here with you,\u201d Ty said between kisses. He lifted up onto his knees, letting Zane guide him back down. The head of Zane\u2019s cock pushed at him demandingly. After the last several weeks of getting reacquainted, it would have been an easy entry. Ty lifted his face up to the sky, humming and sighing.</p><p>\u201cCan we do this without lube?\u201d Zane asked. His voice was strained, and every muscle in his body was hard and tight, no longer relaxed by the waters of the hot spring. \u201cMore importantly, should we do this in a mineral spring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine time to ask now,\u201d Ty grunted. He lowered himself back into Zane\u2019s lap, dragging his own cock against Zane\u2019s as he sat. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with mineral springs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t some of them have bacteria in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting out!\u201d Ty shouted, trying to sound dismayed, but laughing too hard to pull it off.</p><p>Zane grabbed at him as he moved away, tackling him. They both managed to keep their heads above water, but Ty lost his footing. He wrapped around Zane to stay afloat, and he kissed him hungrily to combat Zane\u2019s next attack. Zane shoved him toward the other side of the spring, slamming him against the rock wall and holding him pinned there as their kiss turned devouring, consuming.</p><p>Ty wrapped his legs around Zane, groaning as Zane\u2019s hard cock threatened to breach him again. He flailed, reaching out for a handhold. He fingers fell on cool skin.</p><p>He jerked away, gasping and shoving Zane away from their kiss. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane cried. He pushed away, obviously thinking he\u2019d hurt Ty or something had triggered a flashback.</p> <p>But Ty\u2019s eyes had mostly adjusted in the moonlight, and he could make out the pale skin of a leg and bare foot against the dark underbrush. When Zane saw it, he scrambled toward their clothing, probably trying to reach one of their phones for the flashlight app. Ty pushed himself up onto the lip of the edge of the hot spring and reached for the foot again, tugging at it. He would have prayed it was a drunk bridesmaid, but he already knew he would be wrong about that.</p><p>When Zane got the light and shone it on the bushes, Ty realized he\u2019d been half-right. It was definitely a bridesmaid.</p><p>Ty hesitated to knock on Nick and Kelly\u2019s door for so long that Zane reached up and knocked for him. Ty glared at him until he heard the lock thrown and the door creaked open.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s face was puffy from sleep. He was wearing just a pair of sleep bottoms, no shirt, and he had Nick\u2019s gun in his hand. He wasn\u2019t even trying to hide it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cAnother body\u2019s shown up,\u201d Ty said quietly.</p><p>Kelly merely stared at him, then stepped aside and gestured for him to come in.</p><p>A lamp beside the bed gave off a dim glow, and Nick sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes with one hand.</p> <p>Kelly crawled back in beside him, leaving Ty and Zane standing awkwardly at the foot of the bed with nowhere to sit. Nick waved a hand at them, and Zane shrugged and crawled onto the end of the bed, sitting cross-legged like they were at a slumber party. Ty followed suit because he was past the stage of giving a fuck.</p><p>Ty showed his phone with the picture of the victim to Nick. \u201cYou recognize her?\u201d</p><p>Nick took the phone, nodding and frowning. \u201cThat\u2019s the maid of honor.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s stomach dropped. He was going to have to tell Livi that her best friend had been murdered at her wedding.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Nikki . . . something. Webb. West. No, it\u2019s Webb.\u201d Nick still sounded half-asleep. Ty had little doubt that Kelly had given him something to make him rest.</p><p>Ty glanced up at him, then down at the photo again, feeling sick. Notifying family of victims wasn\u2019t normally a part of his job. Notifying his own family of deaths definitely wasn\u2019t in his resume.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell them?\u201d Nick asked softly. \u201cI\u2019ve got some practice with it.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around at the three of them. All of them were frowning sympathetically at him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said with difficulty. \u201cThanks, but . . . no, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. He and Kelly shared a worried scowl, then Kelly nodded. They were communicating silently, and it bothered Ty. Kelly and Nick had always been able to do that, though, which told Ty that he just needed to get a fucking grip here. Nick took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bigger problem than a dead maid of honor?\u201d Zane asked, incredulous and full of dread.</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cDebatable, but . . . yeah, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we got back from the Creepy Hollow woods, I was cleaning Nick\u2019s back up,\u201d Kelly started.</p><p>Ty raised a hand. \u201cIf this is a sex story, I\u2019d like to take a pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Nick assured him. There was no humor in his voice. \u201cI thought I\u2019d hit something sharp in the path when I fell, but when Doc got a look at it, we realized . . . well, take a look,\u201d he said. Then he pulled his shirt up, twisting so Ty and Zane could see his back.</p><p>A long, narrow welt covered him from side to side, starting around chest height and then streaking over his shoulder blade and the Celtic cross tattoo along his spine to disappear into the large eagle, globe, and anchor tattoo on his shoulder.</p><p>Zane cupped a hand over his mouth, leaning his arm on his knee. Kelly\u2019s foot kicked Ty from under the covers, and he murmured an apology as he tried to get comfortable. Ty barely heard him. \u201cThat\u2019s a graze,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cNick, that\u2019s a bullet graze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nick said, voice calm. He turned and let his shirt loose, shaking his shoulders so the material would settle. \u201cWe were right. Those were silenced shots we heard.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Breakfast the next morning was late in coming, mostly because no one had thought to prepare it.</p><p>Mara took over, heading down to see what she could do to cook for thirty people. As soon as she\u2019d announced she was going to the kitchen, Zane and Nick both hustled after her, claiming they would help.</p><p>Ty knew they were going more to protect her than to use their considerable combined culinary skills. He appreciated that both men had taken responsibility for protecting his mother just as quickly as he would have.</p><p>Ty spent the morning in Deuce and Livi\u2019s room, bouncing Amelia on his knee and breaking the news of Nikki Webb\u2019s murder.</p><p>Deuce sat with his head in his hands, not even trying to be stoic anymore. Livi took the news a little better than Ty had expected, though. Her eyes were tearing over, but Ty had seen her sob over Milton\u2019s demise as well. Livi was a tenderer heart than Ty was used to dealing with.</p><p>\u201cThis is awful,\u201d Livi said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know her that well. I don\u2019t know how to get in touch with her family.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned, and the bouncing stopped for a second. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Amelia cooed to him, complaining about the halt in her ride. He began the bouncing again, smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cI mean I didn\u2019t really know her well,\u201d Livi said again. \u201cI met her a few months ago when she took one of my classes. I have three really close friends, and . . . frankly I was dreading choosing one of them. I don\u2019t have any sisters or cousins. So when I found out Nikki was a party planner, it just clicked. She became the maid of honor, she planned all the pre-wedding stuff, and I didn\u2019t have to choose between my closer friends.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, still a little confused. He was relieved, though, because he\u2019d been absolutely terrified of making Livi cry.</p><p>Amelia latched onto his nose and giggled. Ty tried to pull his face away, but couldn\u2019t get out of her grasp. Livi laughed shakily, still wiping at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTy, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Deuce asked. He sounded desperate. \u201cIs this your shit following you around, or is this entirely new shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s new shit,\u201d Ty answered, his voice nasal as Amelia held on to his nose. He almost wished he could say it was his fault, that this was about his past. But he wouldn\u2019t lie to Deuce just to make him feel better. He was done with lies.</p><p>\u201cBut what did Nikki have to do with Mr. Milton?\u201d Livi asked. \u201cI understand that Mrs. Boyd was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but why kill Nikki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>Deuce and Livi both nodded, wearing almost identical frowns.</p><p>Amelia squeezed Ty\u2019s nose, and he made a honking sound that set her giggling.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to take her for a while, Ty?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>Ty glanced at him, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI mean, when you\u2019re not investigating the series of murders at my wedding,\u201d Deuce said wryly. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely seen her. I know she\u2019s safe with you. And Maisie is running late, so we\u2019re sort of in need of a babysitter anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaisie\u2019s the girl who found Milton\u2019s body,\u201d Ty said with a frown. \u201cWhy is she late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d Livi answered. \u201cShe\u2019s not handling all of this . . .\u201d</p><p>Ty gave that another nod and a deeper frown. He sometimes forgot that normal people didn\u2019t handle finding dead bodies well. He looked down at Amelia, who was reaching for the compass pendant around his neck. Her little tongue was stuck out of her mouth as she concentrated. Ty grinned. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll take her for a while.\u201d</p><p>Deuce tossed him a tattered gray lamb. \u201cDon\u2019t leave home without it.\u201d</p><p>Zane actually had a good morning, working down in the kitchen with Mara and Nick trying to get enough food prepared to feed anyone who still had an appetite. He was able to show off some of the things he\u2019d learned to Mara, who seemed to be thrilled that \u201canother one of her boys\u201d had finally learned to feed himself.</p><p>He also learned a few things from Nick, who gave Zane the tip to fold his fingers in when he was cutting so he could feel the knife with his knuckles and didn\u2019t have to look at what he was doing. He shrugged it off when Zane asked where he\u2019d learned, saying it was nothing more than spatial recognition and the need to hurry when he\u2019d been learning to cook. He seemed to be in an unusually evil mood, so Zane mostly left him alone.</p><p>After breakfast, Zane sat in a secluded alcove off the great hall and began flipping through the photos on Nick\u2019s iPad, reading his notes, trying to follow the jumps in logic and make sense of the scribbles Nick obviously hadn\u2019t felt the need to connect when he\u2019d been taking them.</p><p>Zane could tell which interviews had been first and which had been last because, while the questions remained thorough, Nick\u2019s notes became less legible and the scribbles devolved into pleas for someone to kill him.</p><p>Zane snorted as he read them.</p><p>He glanced up when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Ty was striding across the great hall, Amelia riding on his shoulders and gripping his hair like the reins of a horse. He had Amelia\u2019s favorite stuffed animal stuck in the back pocket of his jeans.</p><p>Zane lowered the iPad and notebook, relaxing his shoulders and watching his lover. Ty would take a few steps, then stop and weave to the side, then stop again, making a sound like brakes screeching, and then he\u2019d veer in another direction. Zane realized that he was letting Amelia steer him by pulling on his hair.</p><p>They were never going to get wherever Ty was heading if they kept on like that. Zane gathered his things and stood, coming up beside them and putting a roadblock in their path.</p><p>\u201cUh oh!\u201d Ty said to Amelia. \u201cBrake!\u201d</p><p>Amelia was laughing, her tiny fingers clutched in his hair.</p><p>\u201cBrake!\u201d Ty called out again.</p><p>She leaned forward instead, and Ty walked into Zane, making the sound of a nasty crash when they collided. Amelia howled with laughter and crawled over Ty\u2019s head, sliding into Zane\u2019s arms. Ty gave Zane a quick kiss, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you wind up with this?\u201d Zane asked, tossing Amelia up and turning her upside down to hold her by her feet. She squealed in delight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m easily duped, I guess.\u201d Ty took her back from Zane, turning her right side up. \u201cThe nanny isn\u2019t doing too well with finding that body; she\u2019s MIA. I took Amelia so they could have an hour to get stuff done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. Poor girl. You missed breakfast, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned. \u201cWas there venison involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross. Are those Nick\u2019s notes?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to make sense of them without asking him what they mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably curled up in a corner hissing at people as they pass by.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s laugh was a surprised one. \u201cBad mood, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery. Last I saw him, he was still in the kitchen cleaning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find him. I want to sit down and hear what we all know, see if we can connect some dots.\u201d Ty headed off, carrying Amelia under his arm like a sack of potatoes. Her giggles echoed off the ceiling of the great hall.</p><p>Zane hurried to catch up. \u201cWait, Ty, you want to do that with her with us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a year old. She won\u2019t understand death and destruction for at least another year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we ever decide to adopt, you\u2019re a mute in any interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>They found Nick and Kelly outside, sitting on the patio with Emma and Marley. Kelly had a stick in his hand, and he seemed to be drawing things in the dusty brick. Nick had his sunglasses on even though the day was overcast, and he was sipping from a glass that Zane doubted was tea. Emma and Marley were talking animatedly, but Zane couldn\u2019t tell if either Nick or Kelly was listening, much less responding.</p><p>Emma glanced up when she noticed Ty and Zane there, and her face transformed into a bright smile. \u201cMy baby!\u201d she cried, and she held her hands out for Amelia.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Amelia shouted, clinging to Ty\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you bribe her with?\u201d Emma asked him.</p><p>\u201cUnicorns and rainbows and fun,\u201d Ty said with a grin. \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were pregaming the next murder,\u201d Nick said before taking a sip of his drink. Emma and Marley both raised their own glasses and drank with him.</p><p>Kelly glanced up. \u201cI over-drugged him last night. He may be a little cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Emma agreed, snorting.</p> <p>Nick lowered his sunglasses, squinting at Zane. He looked like he was completely done with everything on this island. \u201cAny new leads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we came out here, actually. It\u2019s time for all of us to sit down and figure out what we know.\u201d He pointed at Emma and Marley. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave that a curt nod. He pushed his sunglasses back up and hefted himself out of his chair. Amelia immediately lunged for him and grabbed his sunglasses. Nick held on to them, and after the ensuing tug of war he somehow wound up with Amelia in his arms, wearing his sunglasses on her little round face.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo what it says, no one gets hurt,\u201d Ty said, putting her lamb on top of Nick\u2019s head before going to retrieve more chairs.</p><p>\u201cTy, you know I don\u2019t do well with kids!\u201d</p><p>Kelly stood to take Amelia from him, but the little girl clung to him just as she had to Ty. Nick rolled his eyes and sat back down with her.</p><p>They gathered more chairs and circled them on the patio. It was pretty wide open, but Zane trusted it more than any of the rooms in the house since there were passages and peepholes in the walls. They leaned close so their voices wouldn\u2019t carry to anyone nearby.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you two find on the videos?\u201d Zane asked Emma and Marley.</p><p>\u201cNada,\u201d Marley answered. \u201cThat dude avoided the lens like a vampire. In total, I found seven frames with him in them. Frames. That\u2019s like less than half a second of video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we didn\u2019t find anyone that screamed \u2018I\u2019m a killer\u2019 either,\u201d Emma added. \u201cNothing really suspicious. Although, the dead girl was on her phone in almost every single frame she\u2019s in, and I thought it was weird because there\u2019s no service here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki Webb,\u201d Nick provided. \u201cShe mentioned looking for service to text her boyfriend. Her roommate said she was up half the night trying to get a signal. And several witnesses stated they saw Milton on his phone. That\u2019s pretty much the only thing I know the two victims had in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Kelly said as he propped his feet on Nick\u2019s knees. \u201cI\u2019ve seen every person here wander around looking for a signal at least once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivi told me Nikki showed up around two months ago, took one of her classes. That\u2019s how they met,\u201d Ty told everyone.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she earn maid of honor?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cShe was a party planner. Livi didn\u2019t have to choose between her better friends. It\u2019s chick logic.\u201d</p><p>Emma snorted derisively. \u201cIf that girl was a party planner, I\u2019ll eat my boots.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned at his cousin, looking troubled. He glanced at Nick and then met Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Zane nodded, knowing exactly what Ty was thinking. \u201cSounds like Nikki Webb was a plant.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat forward, shifting Amelia onto his shoulder. She had fallen asleep on him, and she clutched at his shirt as she snored, resting her head on his shoulder. \u201cLivi told me Milton was the reason she and your brother met. He steered Deacon toward her class.\u201d</p><p>Ty brushed a hand over his chin. \u201cLivi\u2019s a friendly girl. It\u2019d be easy to strike up a conversation at her class, make contact with her as a mark. She\u2019s the least sheltered member of the family, the easiest way into the company. But why plant Deacon with her?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I know. What really bothers me is that watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat really bothers me is getting shot at,\u201d Kelly spat.</p><p>\u201cYou guys got shot at?\u201d Emma blurted.</p><p>\u201cLast night, in the woods,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cWe were checking to make sure the boats really were taken out by the storm. On the way back, a few shots were exchanged. I had Fraser, the groundskeeper, do a sweep of the woods. He didn\u2019t find any trace of anyone being hit. No casings, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Kelly said in annoyance. \u201cWe know those were silenced shots, and we all know who would have silencers on this island. Those Snake Eaters are part of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels, those Snake Eaters are ex\u2013special forces,\u201d Nick said in exasperation. It sounded like they\u2019d had this conversation a few times already. \u201cIf they\u2019d fired at us last night, they would have hit us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did hit you,\u201d Kelly snapped without looking back at Nick.</p><p>Nick closed his eyes and rubbed his fingers over his nose.</p><p>\u201cThere are way too many weapons on this island,\u201d Emma said.</p><p>Zane found himself nodding. Not only were the Snake Eaters all heavily armed, but there was a room devoted to nothing but hunting and stalking, lined with rifles. Not to mention all the gear they had brought with them.</p><p>\u201cWe could try to round it all up,\u201d Kelly suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat should go over well,\u201d Ty said. \u201cWorth a try, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good is that going to do?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cAnyone intending to use their weapon isn\u2019t going to give it up voluntarily. And you don\u2019t need a gun to kill someone, even without training. What are you going to do, play Mr. Green and Colonel Mustard and round up all the candlesticks and lead pipes, too?\u201d</p><p>Kelly set his stick down and glared at him.</p><p>Nick raised both eyebrows in a silent challenge. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit being a dick,\u201d Kelly grunted. He pushed himself to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some Advil for the dick.\u201d</p><p>Nick grumbled to himself as Kelly walked away.</p><p>\u201cYou two had a fun night,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>Zane was flipping through the pictures Nick had taken as the rest of them spoke. Ty leaned forward to look over his shoulder. When they reached the photo of the broken wristwatch Nick had fixated on, Zane zoomed in on it, cocking his head. There wasn\u2019t anything special about it, but it did look familiar somehow.</p><p>Ty patted his shoulder. \u201cI had one like that.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised his head. \u201cYou did,\u201d he said as the realization hit him. \u201cThe one we smashed in Gettysburg. It had a tracker in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wore a tracker in your watch?\u201d Emma asked, sounding bemused.</p><p>\u201cDick gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurns?\u201d Nick asked, his voice going hard. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. Why would someone first smash the watch, then come back and take it? Was it possible that Ernest Milton had been one of Burns\u2019s misfit ops men? \u201cWe need to talk to Burns,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Nick leaned forward. \u201cYou think Milton was his?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common watch,\u201d Ty argued.</p><p>Zane clambered to his feet. \u201cCommon or not, I\u2019m going to ask Burns about it.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned at him.</p><p>Zane sighed heavily. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come. But I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d Nick said eagerly, and stood. He handed Amelia off to Emma, looking relieved to have her out of his arms. He didn\u2019t even try to take his sunglasses off her, and he placed her lamb gently on her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you two are going to track him down and beat the truth out of him?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cSounds fun,\u201d Nick said as he looked away.</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow at him, then met Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find Doc and you two go search Milton\u2019s and Nikki\u2019s rooms. O\u2019Flaherty and I will politely question Burns.\u201d</p><p>Nick lifted his glass. \u201cAlways at the center of it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurns has nothing to do with this,\u201d Ty snapped.</p><p>Nick just raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Ty looked between them, then stood reluctantly. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll be civil.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, but Nick didn\u2019t answer. He narrowed his eyes at Ty instead, then shook his head and turned away to go off in search of Burns.</p><p>Ty pointed at him. \u201cKeep him under control,\u201d he hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t let him get his hands around Dick\u2019s neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking figuratively or literally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Ty spat. He glanced over Zane\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cNick blames Burns for Sanchez\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Zane groaned, and he turned to jog after Nick.</p><p>Ty caught Kelly coming back down the steps with his canvas medical bag over his shoulder. Ty held up his hand. \u201cHe bolted, no drugs for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That bastard.\u201d Kelly stopped on the staircase. \u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Zane went to question Burns about the dead guy\u2019s watch. It was the same as the one I used to wear, so they think Milton was one of Burns\u2019s operators.\u201d</p><p>Kelly just blinked rapidly.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t bother trying to explain further. He climbed the steps toward him. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019re supposed to go search over Milton\u2019s and Nikki\u2019s rooms, see what we can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the worst vacation ever,\u201d Kelly said as he turned and followed Ty up the steps.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t use that word.\u201d</p><p>They hit the landing and made the turn down their hall. Milton\u2019s room was in the same wing as theirs were, but closer to the stairs. Kelly leaned against the wall as Ty fished the key he\u2019d gotten from Stanton out of his pocket. \u201cWhat are we looking for when we get in there?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cMotive. Anything worth killing over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019m not a cop, right?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him and smiled. \u201cNo, but you\u2019re fucking one.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s cheeks reddened and he bit his lip to hide a massive grin. He failed miserably. \u201cThanks for being cool with it, bud. Nick stressed a lot about telling you and the guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems Nick\u2019s stressed about a lot of things,\u201d Ty said with another sideways glance at Kelly. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him about that.\u201d</p><p>The nonanswer hit Ty harder than he\u2019d expected. He lowered his head and jammed the ancient key into the door, wriggling it to get it to catch.</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat. \u201cHe\u2019s still terrified to tell the others. He\u2019s watching your reaction closer than you might think he is. I think he was afraid everyone would assume he\u2019d taken advantage of me being hurt and drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Ty asked neutrally.</p><p>\u201cNo. In fact I pretty much had to beg him to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. The deal is I don\u2019t freak out, and you don\u2019t share sex stories.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snickered. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They stepped into the room and Ty flicked on the lights. He\u2019d been half-expecting to find the room turned upside down, trashed and searched. But everything seemed to be in its place.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Kelly offered as he took a few steps inside and surveyed the room. \u201cThey cut his guts open but didn\u2019t try his room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, or they searched it neat.\u201d</p><p>This room was a little more Spartan than theirs, with a double bed and a small vanity. It had no balcony. It didn\u2019t even have windows. The bed hadn\u2019t been slept it. Nothing seemed out of place.</p><p>Kelly pointed toward the small desk against the far wall. \u201cLaptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if you can get it up and running,\u201d Ty said. He headed for the bedside table and went through the small drawers, checked under the pillows and the mattress, got down and peered under the bed. He checked under all the tables and tried the bottoms of each drawer for anything taped there. He kicked aside the rugs and lifted them up to search under them. Then he went to the wardrobe that held Milton\u2019s luggage. He dragged everything out and put it on the bed.</p><p>\u201cJesus, he\u2019s got some heavy shit in here,\u201d Ty said as he hefted the third suitcase out of the wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cThis thing is password protected,\u201d Kelly finally said. \u201cI can\u2019t get into it.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it to Zane, see if he can get past it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelly came over to help Ty go through the suitcases. \u201cHe brought an awful lot of stuff for a week.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, frowning at the three large suitcases full of clothing, shoes, toiletries, and electronics. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he wasn\u2019t planning on going back home,\u201d he said. He and Kelly shared a glance.</p><p>Kelly pulled out a Dopp kit and unzipped it. It was brimming with toiletries and medicine bottles. \u201cWhy would this all be packed up? He had six more days, why not take it into the bathroom, lay everything out?\u201d</p> <p>Ty\u2019s frown deepened. He turned to the large wardrobe. It was empty. No suits hanging, nothing folded into the drawers. All of Milton\u2019s things were neatly packed. \u201cHe either never unpacked, or he was planning on leaving last night.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was scowling when Ty met his eyes. \u201cThis guy\u2019s starting to feel shady, man.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted in agreement. \u201cWe need to get into that laptop. Gather it up, we\u2019ll take it with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his phone? Did he have it on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it got wet. It\u2019s useless.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s go put it in some rice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it soaks up the water.\u201d Kelly bundled up the laptop and stuck it under his arm. \u201cI dropped mine in the toilet once. A little rice, a little Clorox. Good as new!\u201d</p><p>Ty swiped a hand over his face as they left the room. \u201cThat is so gross.\u201d</p><p>Zane approached the table where Burns and Earl were sitting, drinking coffee and playing some sort of card game. He could feel Nick behind him. He was a very physical presence, and Zane now completely understood why Ty had always trusted the man to have his back.</p><p>\u201cEarl. Director Burns,\u201d Zane said with a nod at each man.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Zane, Nick. Take a load off,\u201d Earl invited with a jerk of his head to the empty chairs at the table. \u201cWe heard there was another murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Nick said softly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we didn\u2019t come to play cards. Director Burns, we\u2019d like to speak with you about a few things.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at him, surprised he\u2019d gone the direct route. His jaw was tight and his green eyes were hard and sparkling. Zane groaned internally. Ty had been right. Zane was going to have to pry Nick\u2019s fingers from Burns\u2019s neck, he knew he was.</p><p>Burns and Earl exchanged frowns, then Burns placed his cards on the table and nodded. \u201cWhat do you need to discuss?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s hard stare remained on Burns, but Zane looked between the two older men pointedly. \u201cIt has to do with work. It\u2019s probably best we speak in private.\u201d</p><p>Burns pursed his lips and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said to Earl. He came around the table, watching Nick with an almost curious expression.</p><p>Zane turned to lead them both into one of the unoccupied rooms that lined the great hall. They settled in the parlor. Burns sat in one of the chairs near the large stone fireplace, and Zane and Nick sat opposite him on a small sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, boys?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas Milton one of your men?\u201d Nick asked, his voice hard.</p><p>Burns\u2019s only reaction was a rapid series of blinks.</p><p>\u201cThe watch he wore,\u201d Zane said. \u201cIt was just like Ty\u2019s, the one you gave him with the GPS in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also dead, just like most of your recruits,\u201d Nick practically snarled.</p><p>Burns cleared his throat. \u201cThis is going to be unproductive with him present. Unless he intends to use his alternative interrogation skills,\u201d he said with a point at Nick. He stood to go.</p><p>Nick was on his feet so fast Zane didn\u2019t even have a chance to grab for him. He blocked Burns\u2019s path, and the two men stood eyeing each other, trapped in the space between the chair and the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cSon, you don\u2019t want to make a mistake here,\u201d Burns said almost kindly. \u201cYou need to get out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from you. Sir. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>Burns narrowed his eyes and jutted his chin out, but he must have seen just as plainly as Zane could that Nick wasn\u2019t going to let him leave this room. He gave a curt nod and returned to the chair by the fireplace.</p><p>Nick remained standing, his arms crossed over his chest like a bouncer at a club.</p><p>Zane gave him a wary once-over before turning his attention back to Burns. \u201cWas he one of your men?\u201d</p><p>Burns cleared his throat and nodded. \u201cHe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he planted with the Stanton company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was already part of the Stanton company,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThey\u2019re developing highly classified equipment for the military, we needed a watchdog. We recruited him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you come out and say that when we found his body?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause Stanton can\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have to tell you what a mess it would be if it got out that a government agent had infiltrated a private company like that. You can imagine how that would make Stanton and his board of directors react if they found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put him up to introducing Deuce and Livi?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Zane rubbed his fingers over one temple. \u201cSo, his sole job was to guard this technology being developed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means whoever killed him probably did it for the information he was protecting,\u201d Nick said to Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told us this,\u201d Zane said to Burns.</p><p>Burns shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s need-to-know, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman\u2019s life, the cook? Her blood is on your hands,\u201d Nick growled. \u201cAll your cloak-and-dagger bullshit, all it does is get people killed.\u201d</p><p>Burns didn\u2019t answer. He sat staring at Nick, his expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Zane said gently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go find Grady and Abbott, see what they found?\u201d</p><p>Nick continued to glare at Burns, his nostrils flaring and his jaw jumping as he clenched his teeth. He finally nodded and turned to leave. The door slammed shut behind him.</p><p>When Zane returned his attention to Burns, the man was still watching the door. His face had softened, and he seemed almost melancholy. He sighed heavily when he met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI admire his loyalty. And his fire. That was why I tried to recruit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirector Burns,\u201d Zane said, continuing with his questioning despite the surprise of learning that Burns had actively sought Nick out as well as Ty and Elias Sanchez. \u201cWhy would someone take the watch off one of your operatives? Is information stored in it?\u201d</p><p>Burns frowned deeply. \u201cNo. No, all it has is the GPS. And that\u2019s all a live feed; it doesn\u2019t store information. For that, you\u2019d need the accompanying software system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is that?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Burns shrugged. \u201cMy office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way to reach it remotely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could go through my tablet or laptop. Neither of which I have here. I\u2019ve honestly never tried.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, even more confused than he had been. \u201cWould breaking the watch corrupt the GPS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the information that\u2019s already been sent. Why crack the watch open?\u201d Burns asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have no idea. The watch makes no sense right now, and it\u2019s gone, so . . .\u201d Zane ran a finger over his nose. \u201cWho would even know it was special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who knew it had GPS. Another operator. Anyone who\u2019s done black ops or dark ops and used a similar system, including Grady and O\u2019Flaherty. I would suspect even you would have known to do that, had you recognized the watch for what it was.\u201d</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes. \u201cSo, whoever knew the watch was a tracking device is who we\u2019re after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suppose, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think that was need-to-know?\u201d Zane asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>Burns sat forward. \u201cZane, you\u2019ve always been a big-picture kind of guy. That\u2019s a unique ability. You shouldn\u2019t lose it.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t find his voice to respond.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>Zane met his eyes. There were so many things he wanted to say to this man, and most of them would probably end with a punch being thrown. He almost wished he\u2019d unleashed Nick just so he could witness it. He had to remind himself, though, that Burns was also the reason he and Ty were together at all. The reason they had remained partners long enough to solidify their relationship, even if it had been for ulterior motives. Burns was the one who\u2019d given Zane his second chance. He couldn\u2019t find it in himself to truly hate the man even though he wanted to for the underhanded things Burns had done.</p><p>He swallowed hard and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Nick practically pounced on Ty and Kelly as they were making their way through the great hall toward the kitchen stairs. His sudden appearance damn near kicked Ty\u2019s instakill into action.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you find?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>Ty examined him with a growing hint of apprehension. He was as taut as a bowstring, and Ty could tell the next person to pass in front of Nick\u2019s target area was going to seriously take one for the team. \u201cDid you do violence to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in my mind,\u201d Nick growled. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>Kelly held up the laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s password protected. We\u2019re going to let Zane take a stab at it.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him incredulously. \u201cTake a stab at it? Really?\u201d</p><p>Kelly blinked. \u201cOh. Oh, that was an unintentional pun. That was bad form, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Nick just shook his head.</p><p>Ty snorted, though, feeling guilty for doing it. \u201cWe were heading for the meat locker to get Milton\u2019s phone, see what we could pull off it,\u201d he told Nick. \u201cWhat\u2019d Burns have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilton was one of his.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s blood seemed to run a little colder. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded curtly. \u201cGarrett made me leave before I heard anything else.\u201d</p><p>Ty could imagine why Zane had kicked Nick out if he\u2019d been half as wound up in there as he was now. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said carefully. He and Kelly shared a glance. Ty\u2019s eyes drifted down to Kelly\u2019s little bag of medical tricks, still slung over his shoulder. Kelly gave him an almost imperceptible nod. \u201cYou two go see what you can do with the phone, I\u2019ll take the laptop to Zane, see if he can get past the security on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat really the best use of our time right now?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Ty came up short, frowning at Nick. \u201cYou got something better to do?\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted and turned to stalk off toward the kitchen stairs. Ty hissed at Kelly and pointed to his bag as Kelly handed off the laptop. \u201cSedate the fuck out of him if he goes off the rails.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted and gave him a smart salute, then jogged after Nick.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Ty whispered to himself before turning and going off to find Zane.</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>Ty skidded to a halt on the slick marble floor. He\u2019d walked right past Zane, coming out of the parlor door. Ty turned on him, eyes wide. \u201cMilton was one of Dick\u2019s guys?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded grimly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so Burns says Milton was guarding some sort of new technology or information, he isn\u2019t sure which.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they cut him open to find, huh? Thinking he swallowed it? Has to be a memory chip or . . . a flash drive wouldn\u2019t go down easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely not. Abbott\u2019s convinced they didn\u2019t find it, though. That\u2019s why they took the watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the GPS?\u201d Ty guessed.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he probably stashed it somewhere, and the watch can tell you where he\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they can\u2019t read it without the proper equipment. Why would they take it? And why fucking smash it?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cThey might not know any of that. Thought it was a transmitting chip. I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s with the laptop?\u201d</p><p>Ty held it up for Zane. \u201cIt\u2019s Milton\u2019s. Password protected. You think you can get into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Zane said again without hesitation. He took it from Ty and glanced around the great hall. \u201cLet\u2019s go find somewhere quiet.\u201d</p><p>Ty trailed after him, a smile playing on his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of sexy when you take charge like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ty,\u201d Zane said, but his voice trembled with laughter.</p><p>The kitchen had mostly been cleaned up by the time Nick and Kelly got back down there, but Nick still hesitated, just as he\u2019d done that morning at breakfast. It was embarrassing as hell to completely lose it like he had, even if it had happened before in front of Ty and Kelly, even if he had pulled both of them through similar episodes of their own. Nick didn\u2019t like not being in control of himself, and he definitely didn\u2019t like the idea that he\u2019d taken a swing at Kelly without even realizing what he was doing.</p><p>Kelly placed a hand at the small of his back in silent support before he made his way over to the freezer where all three bodies were being stored. There was no guard down here, but why would there be? Milton\u2019s body had already been picked clean of everything the perpetrators wanted, the cook had merely been collateral damage, and Nikki had just been placed in there. Who would have thought to guard the dead bodies in the first place?</p><p>For that matter, who would have expected dead bodies at a wedding? Ty and Zane, that\u2019s fucking who. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick wandered into the pantry, scanning the shelves. He grabbed a glass canister of white rice and stuffed it under one arm, then went off in search of a mixing bowl.</p><p>\u201cI wonder why they didn\u2019t take his phone, too,\u201d Kelly called from the freezer. \u201cI mean, they take a broken watch and slice him up on a guess that he\u2019d swallowed whatever it is, but they don\u2019t take his phone just \u2019cause it\u2019s waterlogged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re obviously looking for someone who\u2019s never dropped his phone in a toilet,\u201d Nick said. He poured the rice out into a stainless steel mixing bowl.</p> <p>\u201cHa. Ha ha.\u201d Kelly came up to stand beside Nick at the counter and placed the phone beside the bowl. \u201cConsidering you\u2019re the one who told me to put it in the rice, you shouldn\u2019t make jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live on a boat; I can get water out of anything.\u201d Nick absently reached across the counter for a small glass jar of toothpicks and plucked one out to put in his mouth. He began taking the cell phone apart and shoving each piece into the rice separately.</p><p>Kelly leaned over the counter to rest his chin on his hand. Nick glanced at Kelly as he shoved the SIM card and battery deep into the rice.</p><p>Kelly was watching his face instead of his hands. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, voice gone soft and intimate.</p><p>Nick swallowed hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If Garrett hadn\u2019t been up there with me, I would have taken Richard Burns\u2019s head off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhether he deserves it or not, that\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Kelly straightened, then pushed himself up to sit on the edge of the counter. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a while for that rice to do its thing. Why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s going on with you, Lucky? Maybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at the counter, at Kelly\u2019s hand resting against the white tile, his eyes tracing the lines of Kelly\u2019s long fingers. Kelly tapped them against the tile, and Nick met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy dad,\u201d he started, but he lost his voice before he could go further. He shook his head in frustration.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s sick?\u201d Kelly guessed.</p> <p>Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say to you when he called for you to come see him? You haven\u2019t been right since.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t answer, chewing on the toothpick as he stared at the rice.</p><p>Kelly was silent for a few moments, then took in a deep breath. \u201cWhen I was going through the foster system, I saw a lot of kids who were there because they\u2019d been abused. This one kid, he was a few years older than me. Close to aging out of the system. He got word his mom had died of an overdose. He was all torn up about it, and I just couldn\u2019t understand why. His scars were still healing. So I asked him. And he told me he was glad she was dead. He was mourning the mother he could have had. Should have had.\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent, his eyes on Kelly the entire time.</p><p>Kelly patted his cheek and smiled sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to mourn. You do it for you, not him.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and forced himself to swallow past the knot in his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re not at the mourning stage just yet. He needs a new liver. He wants me to get tested to see if I\u2019m a match.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s expression changed from one of gentle sympathy to something else entirely. His eyes sparked, and the lines around his mouth grew hard as he squared his shoulders. \u201cHe wants you to donate a piece of your liver?\u201d</p> <p>Nick nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. I want to let him die.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded, frowning in sympathy. But then he shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d never forgive yourself. Even if everyone knows he deserves it.\u201d</p><p>Nick lowered his head. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grabbed at his shirt front and pulled him sideways until Nick was standing right in front of him, between his legs. Kelly hugged him fiercely, and Nick buried his face in Kelly\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cThe decision you make, you make it for you. Not him,\u201d Kelly whispered into his ear. \u201cYou make it for you. And I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Nick gripped him hard, hugging him for dear life.</p><p>Kelly sniffed and smiled against his neck. \u201cYou do you, boo boo,\u201d he said, his voice shaking with laughter.</p><p>Nick pushed away from him, fighting back tears with a surprised snort. \u201cThere\u2019s something so wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you love me.\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t sit still. He bounced his knees, he tapped his toes, he cracked his knuckles. He finally picked up a pen and began twirling it around his fingers just to give his hands something else to do as he watched Zane fiddle with the laptop.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I got around the basic password protection, but there\u2019s a little extra encryption on this thing,\u201d Zane finally told him. \u201cI would call him paranoid if he hadn\u2019t ended up dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he was one of Burns\u2019s guys,\u201d Ty said, shaking his head. \u201cWas he recruited before or after Deuce and Livi started dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty,\u201d Zane said without taking his eyes off the laptop screen.</p><p>\u201cWould Dick really put a spy into Deacon\u2019s future in-laws?\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, that seems like a stretch even for Dick. I wonder if Deuce dating her was what brought Dick\u2019s attention to the Stanton company, or if Milton really did plant that seed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty,\u201d Zane repeated obediently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask him? Maybe he\u2019ll tell you more than he told me.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed heavily, shaking his head. \u201cHe won\u2019t tell me anything, he\u2019ll just glare at me like he used to when I was little and make me feel like I\u2019m ten. You know who should talk to him? Dad. It\u2019d be just as uncomfortable as it was when Irish was interrogating me; I bet he\u2019d tell Dad anything. Are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and cocked his head at Zane. His brow was furrowed and his curly hair was a bit awry from running his fingers through it so many times. He had his tongue stuck between his lips and probably didn\u2019t even realize it. Ty stood, stepping behind Zane to massage his tense shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m distracting you. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his neck, leaning into Ty\u2019s hands. Ty was silent, letting him work. He still didn\u2019t understand what Zane was doing, but finally Zane sat back and put both hands in the air triumphantly. \u201cEat that, DOD!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got through?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and clicked one more button that turned the blue screen of the laptop into the normal desktop screen Ty was used to seeing. Dozens of files littered the screen, most of them labeled in some sort of numerical code.</p><p>Ty rested his chin on Zane\u2019s shoulder, dejected. \u201cThis is going to take a while, huh?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cMight want to take a seat.\u201d</p><p>Nick sifted through the bowl of rice with great care, placing each piece of the cell phone on a microfiber towel he had found in a drawer. Kelly watched over Nick\u2019s shoulder. When they had all the pieces, Nick began putting it back together.</p><p>He held the reassembled phone in his palm, and he and Kelly both scowled at it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s charged,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Nick turned it on and held his breath. The sound was garbled and the screen was a digitized mess as the phone powered on, but they could sort of make out what they were seeing on it. Nick first went to the list of recent calls. Kelly scrambled to get his own phone out and take pictures of the screen. They got partial lists of Milton\u2019s last calls, then moved on to the text messages. Some of them were beyond comprehension, but others were clear enough to make out. Kelly took photos of all of them.</p><p>The phone began to make a metallic whirring sound.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a bad sound,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and keep taking pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an \u2018I\u2019m going to blow up\u2019 sound,\u201d Kelly insisted.</p><p>\u201cI know, but we only have one chance to get this shit.\u201d</p><p>The phone popped, and they both jumped. The smell of burning electronics accompanied a sizzling sound, and after the first threat of fire, Nick dropped the phone into the bowl of rice. It sparked and fizzled, and the smell of burning rice mingled with the lingering aroma of industrial-strength cleanser in the kitchen.</p><p>Kelly huffed and sniffed at the bowl of rice. \u201cTold you.\u201d</p><p>Nick glared at his profile. \u201cWhat did we get?\u201d</p><p>Kelly flipped through the photos of the text messages on his phone. \u201cIt looks like he was setting up a meeting, maybe. These times are from the other night. How the hell was he getting service to send these texts?\u201d</p><p>Nick leaned over and squinted at the photos. They were basically poor copies of a rough original, and some of the words were unintelligible. But reading through the last dozen or so texts painted a pretty clear picture, and it wasn\u2019t hard to fill in the blanks. \u201cHe was setting up a buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA buy? Like, what, he was selling something?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and pointed at the text message. \u201cIt\u2019s shorthand. He was meeting a buyer at eleven last night, and he wanted money wired. Apparently his buyer had cash instead and they were arguing over payment. I can\u2019t tell more, it\u2019s too fuzzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he was selling the defense contract technology Stanton\u2019s company is developing?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded grimly. \u201cYeah, I do. Odds are he either tried to cheat them, or he changed his mind, so his buyer killed him. I\u2019m guessing they thought he had the information on him, but he didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why they came back for his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are we talking here? A flash drive? A memory chip? It has to be something small enough to swallow if that\u2019s where they were looking. And his room hadn\u2019t been tossed.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not a techie. We\u2019ll take it to Garrett, see if he knows. See what they\u2019ve got off that laptop.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded and stuffed his phone back into his pocket. They left the mess they\u2019d made. There was no one to complain about it now anyway.</p><p>Kelly glanced at the freezer as they headed for the steps. \u201cHey, maybe one of them will donate a liver to your dad.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked over his shoulder at Kelly, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. Three perfectly good livers sitting in there,\u201d Kelly said, completely deadpan. \u201cNobody\u2019s using them. I\u2019ll go get one for you.\u201d</p><p>Nick gaped at him. \u201cHow the hell did you ever pass your psych evals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cheated off your papers.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes and started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThe Navy gives bubble tests. When in doubt, go with C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it? Navy? The sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! You love puns.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, unable to stop himself.</p><p>Kelly plucked at his shirt as they headed up the steps, stopping him. Nick looked back at him, one eyebrow raised, expecting another joke. But Kelly was turning to head into the kitchen again. \u201cYou know, the cook hadn\u2019t been dead but for a few minutes when we came down here yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, his eyes darting toward the bottom of the steps. It dawned on him where Kelly was going with that. \u201cHow\u2019d the killer get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Kelly glanced up at Nick. \u201cThe steps are the only way in or out, we would have seen them leaving from the hall upstairs. Or hell, maybe even passed them on the steps.\u201d</p><p>Nick waited a breath, then stepped to stand beside Kelly.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s possible they hid well enough for Ty to miss them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said immediately. They descended the stairs again, standing at the bottom to look around the massive kitchen. It was mostly open. The cabinets had glass faces, and the counters and islands all had open shelves beneath. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide down here, not unless you get into one of the ovens.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grunted. \u201cAnd there was definitely no one in the freezer; I went in there.\u201d</p><p>Nick paced a few steps into the kitchen, craning his head to seek out impromptu hiding spots. \u201cI mean, you could do it, I guess. There\u2019s . . . I don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to be really slick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr small,\u201d Kelly added. \u201cI bet a woman could have hid down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone that small wouldn\u2019t have been able to pick Milton up and hang him on that meat hook. There were two people. No way they could have hid, not from Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Kelly said, his shoulders slumping.</p><p>Nick\u2019s attention turned from the shiny appliances and bright white counters to the stone walls of the room. He peered upward, noticing the architecture for the first time, the way the room itself was laid out. \u201cThis was a chapel,\u201d he said in surprise.</p><p>Kelly glanced up, pursing his lips. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a Scottish church built in the late nineteenth century, there would have been a pulpit on the right side of the chancel. Sometimes the pulpit had a space beneath it or behind it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cI think I saw it in one of those house makeover shows,\u201d Nick admitted, shrugging. He retained all kinds of normally useless information from books, podcasts, and TV shows he kept on as background noise when he was working. He\u2019d never lost a trivia game.</p><p>\u201cOkay, which side was the right side?\u201d</p><p>Nick pointed toward the wall that abutted the rest of the house. They scanned over the stone carvings, the same angels they\u2019d seen on the fireplace in their bedroom. Nick didn\u2019t see anything that looked like a hidden or raised space where the pulpit would have stood, but he saw something else he recognized. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBall and chain,\u201d he said, smacking Kelly\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t call me that unless we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Nick smirked and stepped closer to the wall, running his hand over an angel with a chain through its wing. \u201cBall and chain,\u201d he repeated. \u201cLike in our room.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly came closer and took the gun from the small of Nick\u2019s back, stepping away and raising it, at the ready. Nick gave him a nod, then pulled the wing of the angel and flattened himself against the wall as something inside the stone clicked. It grated across the floor, making both Nick and Kelly cringe from the sound. Kelly kept the gun up, though, aimed at the darkness revealed inside the wall.</p><p>When it became obvious that it was empty, Kelly lowered the gun and they shared a glance. \u201cGreat,\u201d Kelly huffed. \u201cOur killers know the place.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Ty let his head hang, rubbing at his eyes. He looked up at a heavy sigh from Zane.</p><p>\u201cMore dead ends?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just too much chaff, here,\u201d Zane said in frustration. \u201cWithout something to go on\u2014a number, a keyword\u2014there\u2019s no way to find anything.\u201d</p><p>He gave up on the folders and instead pulled up Milton\u2019s email. They were scanning through it when something heavy clanked behind them. Ty whirled, reaching for a gun that wasn\u2019t there. Zane stood as well, but neither of them was armed. They tensed, preparing for whatever came out of the wall.</p><p>The leather-covered panel beside the fireplace swung open, and Kelly stepped out, gun in hand, sweeping the room before he pointed it at Ty and Zane. He straightened quickly, lowering the gun.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nick stepped out behind him a moment later, brushing cobwebs off his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ty shouted. He looked around, searching for something, anything, to throw at them. \u201cYou scared the shit out of us, what if we\u2019d been carrying? We could have shot you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but you didn\u2019t,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cHow did you two end up in the walls again?\u201d Zane asked, sounding like a weary mother scolding her children.</p><p>\u201cDoc realized we should have seen the killer when we went down to the kitchen. So we started looking for places he could have been hidden.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned widely. \u201cWe found another entrance instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Ty demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe carvings of angels with a ball and chain,\u201d Nick said. He glanced over the fireplace beside him, then pointed to one of the carvings. \u201cThey\u2019re the way in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen about half a dozen of those in the house.\u201d Zane sounded scandalized. \u201cI even saw one on the exterior, at the corner wall near the patio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscape route,\u201d Nick guessed.</p> <p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Ty finally said. \u201cSo you two found these passages by accident. How do our killers know they\u2019re there?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged and scratched idly at his forearm. \u201cFamily? Staff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if they\u2019d be in any public plans of the place,\u201d Zane added. \u201cA little research could have exposed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThese were basically a maze of panic rooms. They were built to protect the family from war, invasion, revolt. They would have been secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to sit the family down and see who knows about them,\u201d Kelly surmised. He checked the gun and then stuffed it back into Nick\u2019s jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the phone?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cIt kind of . . . blew up,\u201d Kelly answered.</p><p>\u201cBut we did get photos of some things before it went. From what we can tell, he used texts to set up a meeting last night. He either had a signal booster or he was the one blocking everyone else\u2019s signal. He was selling something to someone on the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he was all packed up,\u201d Ty said. Kelly nodded. \u201cHe was getting his money and getting out. So how\u2019d he end up dead instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal gone bad,\u201d Nick said with another careless shrug. \u201cChange of heart. Who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo indication of what he was selling?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were hoping you could tell us.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cLet me get back to this, then.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly came closer as Zane sat once more, and they all watched the screen as Zane pulled up the list of emails again. Ty scanned the subjects and the occasional first line of each. They all seemed to be rather innocuous work-related missives, except for the few that looked like online shopping receipts.</p><p>Finally, Ty patted Zane\u2019s shoulder and pointed at one of the emails. \u201cSee what that one says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shipping confirmation from Brookstone?\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cJust . . . humor me.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged and pulled up the email. But as they looked at the shipping confirmation, they realized it wasn\u2019t actually confirming the purchase or shipping of any goods. It was merely a time, date, and address from which the package had supposedly been shipped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fake,\u201d Kelly said in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen this,\u201d Nick told them. He tapped the screen. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this with call-girl rings from Vice. You place an order, and they send you a receipt that looks like you were shopping online. Then to set up time and place, they use a shipping confirmation. It hides the paper trail, allows people to pay in different ways, and keeps your records looking clean if anyone gets into them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, he was ordering call girls?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Ty frowned harder, reading over the email again. \u201cThat\u2019s Deacon\u2019s address in Philly,\u201d he realized. His breath left him in a rush. The date was for two days from now. \u201cHe ordered a hit on my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Ty.\u201d Zane\u2019s voice was even, but Ty could hear the anger in it.</p><p>Kelly touched Ty\u2019s arm, and when Ty met his eyes, Kelly was frowning hard. \u201cNo one has any interest in killing your brother. Amelia\u2019s the one who\u2019s valuable, right? This probably wasn\u2019t a hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kidnapping?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty gritted his teeth. His entire body began to shake, and he had to take a deep breath to keep himself calm. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already dead, Ty,\u201d Nick reminded him.</p><p>Ty stalked back and forth, fuming as he thought about the innocent little girl upstairs being stolen from her bed, taken by strangers, all so someone somewhere could make a buck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him again, then!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, someone already did that too,\u201d Kelly pointed out. \u201cYou want to go step on his intestines? They\u2019re still in a bag on the freezer floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Nick muttered.</p><p>Kelly shrugged, unapologetic.</p><p>Nick stepped in front of Ty, blocking his path. \u201cYou want some real answers, Ty?\u201d</p><p>Ty gritted his teeth, balling his hands into fists.</p><p>Nick raised both eyebrows. \u201cThen how about you go talk to Richard Burns and ask him some hard questions for once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Irish, why not just point a loaded gun at the man,\u201d Kelly said wryly. He stepped up behind Ty and put both hands on his shoulders, turning him until he could force him to sit. \u201cLet\u2019s get a little more information before we go off storming the castle, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI second that,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty was shaking his head, still fuming even as Kelly put pressure on both shoulders to keep him sitting. \u201cDick never would have let it get that far if he knew. He wouldn\u2019t put Deuce or Amelia at risk for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Ty glared at him, but he wasn\u2019t so far out of control that he didn\u2019t realize he was looking for a target, any target, to vent his anger on. Nick had always recognized when Ty needed someone to aim at, and he usually found Ty a suitable target, even if it was himself. But this time Nick didn\u2019t. His jaw was tight and his green eyes were hard, and Ty didn\u2019t understand why.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Ty asked him, standing to square his shoulders against Nick\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ve been questioning me at every turn ever since we got deployed. You want to talk to me about this, Irish? Or should we keep going around in circles while people are dying?\u201d</p><p>Nick flattened his lips into a thin line and nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a long time, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t fucking talk to me,\u201d Ty blurted. \u201cWhen have we ever let something hang between us like this? When have you ever kept secrets from me as big as him?\u201d He waved his hand at Kelly. \u201cAnd he sure as hell isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019re keeping close to the vest. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve told a lot of lies over the years,\u201d Nick said, his voice low and hard.</p><p>Ty\u2019s body went cold, tingling with the rush of realization. The things he had said and done, he\u2019d been able to validate them all to himself at the time: He was protecting Zane by not telling him that Burns had ordered him to keep an eye on his partner. He was following orders and keeping his teammates safe when he didn\u2019t tell them why they were being discharged. Nick, though . . . his definitions of truth and honor were more black-and-white than Ty\u2019s ever had been.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve even told some of those lies to each other, but damn it, Ty,\u201d Nick hissed, finally letting the anger break through his cool fa\u00e7ade. \u201cYou looked me in the eye and you lied to me. You lied to me when it mattered. You lied to us, and then you kept asking us to stand beside you like those lies wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to go on like I still trusted you, Ty, but I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know if I will again. This is me faking it \u2019til I make it, and I guess I\u2019m not very good at it when the shit starts hitting the fan.\u201d</p><p>Ty wanted to throw up. It was like being caught red-handed by someone you idolized and getting looked at like you were trash. Ty couldn\u2019t handle that kind of look from Nick.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Nick was barely controlling his temper, Ty could hear it in his voice. \u201cShould I have raised my hand and said \u2018me too\u2019 when you and Zane were throwing down in New Orleans? Should I have done it in the hospital with Kelly lying there with a hole in his chest because your past came back to bite us? Or maybe on the ship. In front of all those men who were calling you captain. Should I have done it then?\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked hard, nodding in understanding. Nick had always put the good of the collective above his own desires and needs. He would let an issue tear him to shreds inside before he caused a ripple amongst a team. The only reason he was saying it now was because Ty had pushed him to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about being right,\u201d Nick snapped. \u201cI care about looking at my best friend and knowing he\u2019s telling me the truth. And I can\u2019t do that anymore!\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t swallow. He couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t make a sound. He couldn\u2019t do anything but stare at Nick and search desperately for a reason for Nick to trust him again. \u201cI was following orders, Irish,\u201d he finally managed to whisper. \u201cIf anyone will understand that, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I understand.\u201d Nick tapped a finger at his forehead. \u201cI understand if you were given the order to put one between my eyes, you\u2019d feel bad at my funeral.\u201d</p><p>He turned and paced away, leaving Ty with his mind reeling, his heart in his throat.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Kelly said softly. \u201cI understand this has to happen, but we need to shelve this for a few more days. Can we do that?\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t turn around. Ty took a deep breath and nodded, though, trying to regain his voice. He met Zane\u2019s eyes, surprised to find his lover watching him sadly. \u201cOkay,\u201d Ty rasped. \u201cLet\u2019s see what else we can find. We know Amelia wasn\u2019t what Milton was trying to sell last night. So there\u2019s something else here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepartment of Defense technology,\u201d Zane offered. \u201cThat has to be what he was selling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe find out who the buyer is, we find the killer,\u201d Nick said. His voice was still low and angry.</p><p>Kelly snorted. \u201cHow do we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said with a nod. \u201cZane and Kelly stay here, go through that laptop for anything even remotely related to this. Nick and I will go talk to Burns and Stanton.\u201d</p><p>Zane gave him a raised eyebrow, his eyes darting to Nick. \u201cIs that a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first good one he\u2019s had,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>Ty glared at him, torn between hurt and angry. \u201cWhy not? We\u2019re professionals here.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cBecause . . . well, sending you two out there together is like giving a toddler a lit match and telling it to go play in the sagebrush.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Ty shared a frown. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ty insisted. He shook himself out, squaring his shoulders. \u201cNick\u2019s calm. I\u2019m calm. Everybody\u2019s calm. Murderers to find, kidnappers to kill.\u201d</p><p>It was Zane and Kelly\u2019s turn to exchange frowns. They both shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cNick can stay here with me and go through the emails; we\u2019ll discuss the interviews from yesterday,\u201d Zane proposed. \u201cYou and Kelly go question Stanton and Burns.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted but nodded. \u201cFine. Irish, let me have that gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Nick said, and he sat in the chair beside Zane and crossed his arms.</p><p>Kelly grabbed Ty\u2019s elbow and dragged him toward the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The constant press of Nick\u2019s presence beside Zane was beginning to make him edgy. He didn\u2019t know if it was simply because of how worked up Nick was, or if it was something about Nick\u2019s current mien that made sitting beside him almost physically painful. Zane had always known Nick to be a calming presence in a room, not the epicenter of something that felt like it was about to explode. That was usually Ty\u2019s role.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Zane finally asked him.</p><p>Nick turned his head but didn\u2019t quite look at Zane. He nodded, but his jaw was tight. \u201cHe plucks people up and puts them out there, tells them they\u2019re doing good. But he leaves them hanging in the wind. Just out there hanging and . . . dying. And for what? Their country?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>Zane didn\u2019t even have to ask who Nick was talking about. \u201cBurns tried to recruit you when he did Ty and Sanchez, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go in with them?\u201d</p><p>Nick leaned back in his chair, rubbing his hands over his face. \u201cIt felt wrong. Everything he told us, it just felt . . . it\u2019s hard to explain. It felt like maybe he wasn\u2019t the good guy.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at Zane quickly, probably to judge his reaction. Zane tried hard to keep his face neutral.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to tell Ty and Eli why I didn\u2019t like it, why I hadn\u2019t agreed to do it. But I couldn\u2019t explain the feeling, and there wasn\u2019t a fucking thing I could point to to back me up. Ty had already made up his mind, and you know how he is when he thinks he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jesus Christ, you add in making his dad proud and he\u2019s a brick wall. I gave up on Ty, but I begged Eli to come to Boston with me instead of signing up for Burns.\u201d He trailed off, eyes on the desktop. His eyes were no longer focused on anything but the past.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but stare at him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook himself and met Zane\u2019s eyes again. \u201cEli stuck with Ty. He said he\u2019d rather go out with his boots on than be a civilian. And Ty told me I was a coward for refusing the offer and going back home to Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zane asked, dumbfounded by that disclosure. He\u2019d always imagined Ty and Nick so tight they had to be untied to take a piss. To discover they\u2019d ever shared a harsh word was a revelation. And to hear that Ty had gone so far as to call Nick a coward, well . . . it gave Zane serious pause, especially after what he\u2019d just witnessed. That Nick had been harboring the same feelings of betrayal Zane had felt . . . how the hell had he done it without letting it tear him apart?</p> <p>Nick was nodding. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear from him for a solid year. And I didn\u2019t try contacting him either. After ten years of going with gut feelings, it hurt like hell that neither of them would just trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you two get right again?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick was silent, staring at the desk, and Zane realized he already knew the answer. Ty and Nick never had gotten right again. Not really. And then New Orleans had happened, with all those secrets and lies spilling over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou remember on my boat, when you asked why I kissed Ty when I did?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Zane nodded, not keen to relive those memories and emotions. \u201cYou said you knew you\u2019d already lost him. I thought you meant . . . to me. That wasn\u2019t what you meant, though, was it?\u201d</p><p>Nick was nodding, not seeming to realize that he was doing it. The issues between the two men went deeper than even Ty or Nick knew. They\u2019d both simply been playing the parts they were familiar with, loyal to the very painful core, without questioning why it felt different.</p><p>Something about it made Zane inexplicably sad. Ty and Nick had the most pure friendship Zane had ever witnessed; to see that it had crumbling foundations hurt his heart.</p> <p>\u201cBurns took a handful of the best Marines in the Corps and turned them into six pieces of nothing. And all the bullshit his little side jobs put them both through? Eli being shot down like a fucking dog in some hotel room.\u201d Nick met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo yeah, I\u2019m having a hard time controlling the urge to punch Richard Burns in the face. Or Ty, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cUnderstandable.\u201d He waited a beat, glancing at Nick again. \u201cI\u2019ll hold him down for you if you decide to go for it.\u201d</p><p>Nick barked a laugh and smiled wryly. He jutted his chin out toward the laptop, scratching idly at his arm. \u201cOkay, so what are we looking for here?\u201d</p><p>Zane turned his attention back to the computer. \u201cWe\u2019re . . . we still need a place to start. We\u2019ll go through the other emails, see if we can make a timeline, see if there are any keywords or numbers that repeat. Did you come up with anything like that in your interviews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeywords or special numbers?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cNot really. Only number I got out of it was the time on the watch. Goddamn, why am I itchy again?\u201d Nick rolled his sleeve up and frowned at his arm. He\u2019d scratched it almost to the point of bleeding. He glanced over his shoulder at the wall where he and Kelly had emerged. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be something in those walls, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s not itchy. I wonder why you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurse of the red hair, I guess,\u201d Nick said wryly. He stopped scratching, staring at the desk and his notepad for a second before looking up at Zane with wide eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one on the island who\u2019s been itching.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Kelly made their way to the dining room, where a sort of buffet lunch had been set up. With the cook dead, the head of the house still sedated, and the staff all frightened and grieving, everyone else was just doing whatever could be done to make life easier. The buffet was being cleared up already, though. Ty checked his watch.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was so late,\u201d Kelly said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYeah, time flies when you\u2019re in a freezer playing with someone\u2019s intestines.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted. \u201cTell me about it. Every time.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him, but Kelly was maintaining a straight face. He met Ty\u2019s eyes and grinned impishly.</p><p>\u201cI think almost dying did something weird to you; you\u2019re like the beginning of a horror movie,\u201d Ty told him. He returned his attention to the large dining room, searching for Stanton or Burns. He didn\u2019t see either man, but he did spot Deuce and Earl, sitting in a corner eating. He tapped Kelly\u2019s chest and gestured for him to follow as he wound his way toward their table.</p><p>Deuce saw them coming and gave them a halfhearted smile. Ty and Kelly both pulled up chairs and sat down.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the investigation going?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cNot too good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d Earl asked.</p><p>Ty shifted uncomfortably. How the hell should he even get into this with his dad, who had known Burns since they were teenagers? It would be like someone telling him that Nick had been doing all the things Burns had been doing for years, using his son to do it. He licked his lips, stalling until he could come up with something.</p><p>\u201cMilton was a spy,\u201d Kelly told them before Ty could speak. Ty gaped at him. Kelly reached out and plucked a cucumber from Earl\u2019s plate. He pointed it at Earl. \u201cFor your buddy, Burns.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him as he crunched down on the cucumber. Deuce and Earl were both wide-eyed, mouths hanging open.</p><p>Earl finally turned to Ty. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . basically, yeah.\u201d Ty glared at Kelly, and Kelly shrugged. \u201cBurns runs certain operators for jobs that . . . aren\u2019t really aboveboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about black ops,\u201d Deuce said. \u201cUncle Dick runs black ops for the FBI? It\u2019s not just you?\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, wondering why it had suddenly gotten so damn hot in this place. \u201cYes. And the dead man was one of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re one of his?\u201d Earl asked in a stunned voice.</p><p>Ty met his father\u2019s eyes and nodded.</p><p>Earl sat back, exhaling slowly. \u201cThat rat bastard.\u201d</p><p>Ty put up a hand, trying to calm himself more than anyone else. \u201cLet\u2019s just focus, here. Do you know where Dick is right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since Zane and Nick came to talk to him,\u201d Earl said through gritted teeth. \u201cHe came back to the table, said he had to get something from his room. Haven\u2019t seen him since.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, glancing at his brother. Should he tell Deuce what they\u2019d found on the laptop? One more glance at his father\u2019s angry face and Ty decided he\u2019d lit a fire under enough of the Grady family for now. He pushed back in his chair. \u201cIf you see him, tell him we need to talk to him, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll tell him all right,\u201d Earl growled.</p><p>Ty nodded, retreating with Kelly toward the great hall. Once they rounded the corner, Ty turned and smacked Kelly in the arm. \u201cWhat the hell was that, Doc?\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Kelly rubbed at his arm, scowling. \u201cWhat? You were going to take a fucking week before you got around to telling them. Wasn\u2019t it more painless my way?\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cNick is going to strangle you in your sleep in the first six months, I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cHe tries that every night.\u201d</p><p>Ty squeezed his eyes closed, holding his head. \u201cI told you, no sex stories and I won\u2019t freak out. That was our deal!\u201d</p><p>Kelly was laughing, an evil little giggle that Ty knew well.</p><p>\u201cI have a very graphic imagination, okay? Do you want me to freak out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun to watch you freak out. Reminds me of the old days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much right now,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>They made their way toward the back patio in search of Burns or Stanton, but it was deserted. It seemed people were staying inside, sticking close to where they felt safe.</p><p>\u201cEveryone must be locked in their bedrooms or something,\u201d Kelly observed wryly. He and Ty shared a frown. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re rooming with a killer?\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and surveyed the patio one last time. Then Kelly\u2019s words truly sank in, and a cold dread began to settle in his stomach. He turned to Kelly. \u201cLocked doors don\u2019t mean shit in this place, not with the passages in the walls. Even if they\u2019re not rooming with a killer, they\u2019re still in danger.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded and shrugged. \u201cHasn\u2019t that been true from the beginning?\u201d</p><p>He and Ty stared at each other, then Kelly began to nod when he saw the look dawning in Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDifference is, we know they\u2019re in danger now,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Ty turned to head back inside, striding for the dining room and Deuce. There were still a few people perusing the buffet, but for the most part the house felt deserted. Ty placed both hands down on the table where Deuce and Earl still sat and sighed heavily. \u201cWe have to get everyone in one room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Deuce demanded as he took to his feet.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. Will you just help us gather everyone for me, get everyone together in that big sunroom? I promise I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, the sunroom?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound safe at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see through the walls, Doc,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, good point,\u201d Kelly huffed, then patted Ty\u2019s shoulder and jogged away.</p><p>Deuce stared at Ty for another moment, then nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Ty left them there without further explanation, running after Kelly to head back to Zane and Nick. Finding the killer amongst them wasn\u2019t the priority right now. Making sure no one else wound up in that freezer, that was Ty\u2019s goal.</p><p>They met Nick and Zane emerging from the study, both men looking like they\u2019d discovered something important.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get everyone together,\u201d Ty called to them.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get to the freezer,\u201d Zane told Ty as he and Nick brushed past them. Ty and Kelly shared a confused frown, then turned and followed.</p><p>They were almost to the kitchen steps when the lights flickered around them and went out.</p><p>The entire house was thrown into near darkness. The great hall had no windows, nothing to let light in except for the patio doors at the very far end, which were still covered with the massive tent. The storm was darkening the horizon, and the winter light was waning. Zane couldn\u2019t see a goddamn thing. He turned and reached out, cracking his knuckles against someone\u2019s hard muscles and earning a surprised whoof in return.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d he whispered, grabbing at the man he\u2019d hit.</p><p>\u201cYou better know it\u2019s me if you\u2019re grabbing me there,\u201d Ty responded wryly.</p><p>Zane snorted and pulled him closer, hugging him tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the shit is this?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d Nick shouted. Something banged in the darkness as they all remained still to let their eyes adjust. \u201cUnfuck your shit, Scotland!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStorm hit the generators?\u201d Ty asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cOr someone hit them,\u201d Zane said softly.</p><p>\u201cThis place is run off a single power generator?\u201d Kelly asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s run off wind, solar, and hydro power, just like all the other island communities in the Hebrides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know so fucking much about these islands?\u201d Ty shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cI watch Discovery Channel when I can\u2019t sleep!\u201d Nick shouted back.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I did not know that,\u201d Ty said, sounding both angry and apologetic at the same time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane grunted. \u201cOkay, everyone calm down. The power being out isn\u2019t a big deal. We need to get to the freezer to check that body. We have a theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we still need to gather everyone in the sunroom,\u201d Ty added.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one\u2019s safe in this house alone. And right now everyone is separate and alone. Hell, it\u2019s the only place with light now. Why are we going to the freezer?\u201d</p><p>Nick flicked his phone on, shining the light of the flash on the floor.</p><p>\u201cJust . . . you two head for the generators, see what\u2019s going on out there,\u201d Zane said as he trailed after Nick and his light. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you in the sunroom and help gather everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Ty hissed, following and grabbing Zane\u2019s elbow. \u201cAre either of you even armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty has his gun.\u201d Zane squeezed Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>When Nick disappeared down the steps, the light went with him, and Ty\u2019s face was enveloped by shadow. \u201cWell that\u2019s great, Zane, but Doc and I aren\u2019t armed so I\u2019d rather not go out into the stormy night to check the generators that some psycho with an ax probably just killed, not without at least a sharp stick or something.\u201d</p><p>Zane nearly laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay together then. Come on.\u201d</p><p>The flashlight reflected off the stainless steel of the kitchen, and Nick moved carefully toward the freezer, checking any blind spots and making certain they were alone down there. Kelly pulled the freezer door open, and Nick shined the light inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are we doing down here, anyway?\u201d Ty asked again.</p><p>Zane glanced at his shadowed face. \u201cNick is itchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Kelly asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the walls,\u201d Nick said. He had his knife out, cutting through the thick plastic bag they\u2019d wrapped Nikki Webb\u2019s body in. He and Zane moved closer, handing their phones off to Ty and Kelly.</p><p>They examined the girl\u2019s arms and legs, finding several scratches. The skin was reddened and torn in some places, just like Nick\u2019s forearm.</p><p>Nick was nodding as he looked her over. \u201cShe mentioned being itchy when I interviewed her. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. But whatever\u2019s making me itch, it got to her too. She\u2019s been inside the walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, so she\u2019s one of our doers?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like,\u201d Zane said. \u201cShe could be the woman we saw on the beach. Means her partner killed her. He\u2019s tying up loose ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllies being killed means the endgame,\u201d Ty pointed out. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t even fucking know what game we\u2019re playing yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide and seek?\u201d Kelly suggested.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty huffed.</p> <p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Nick growled. He sounded truly angry. He and Ty stared at each other in the light of Kelly\u2019s phone.</p><p>Zane could sense something coming to a head. He just hoped it waited until they were off this island.</p><p>Kelly subtly moved to stand between them. \u201cWe could be after just one person now. That\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that,\u201d Zane told him. He took his phone back from Ty. \u201cLet\u2019s get back upstairs, check the power, and get some questions answered.\u201d</p><p>They vacated the freezer, closing it carefully behind them. Zane took Ty\u2019s arm and held him back as Nick and Kelly went up the stairs. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you two? What set him off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ty asked, though he sounded a little too nonchalant to truly be clueless.</p><p>\u201cI mean why does O\u2019Flaherty look like he wants to deck you? And why\u2019s it all coming out now?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged, glancing up the steps. \u201cStress, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything to him about him and Kelly, did you?\u201d</p><p>Ty seemed offended that Zane would even imply that. He huffed in answer. \u201cNo. What\u2019s bothering him, it\u2019s our issue. Him and me.\u201d He pulled his arm away and started up the steps. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the great hall, Kelly was trying to explain to Nick why they needed to go to the sunroom, but Nick had planted himself in the middle of the hall, arguing that he needed to get into Nikki Webb\u2019s room and search her things.</p><p>\u201cIt might already be too late, but we need to see what she had up there. She might have answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to arm ourselves is what we need to do,\u201d Ty countered. \u201cWho cares who\u2019s doing this or why if we\u2019re all dead by morning?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at him, then he and Kelly shared a look. Kelly nodded, but Nick\u2019s jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cGun room? Or our rooms?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Ty said with a nod at Nick and Kelly. He tossed Kelly the key to their room. \u201cGather everything we\u2019ve got from our rooms. You know where I stash my shit. We\u2019ll head for the hunting stuff. Meet in the sunroom.\u201d</p><p>Before they could separate, though, Stanton stalked out of the sunroom, two of his Snake Eater bodyguards trailing after him with lanterns.</p><p>\u201cI hope you have a good reason for causing this sort of alarm, young man,\u201d he said to Ty. His normally placid voice echoed off the walls of the great hall.</p><p>Ty took a few steps to meet them. \u201cSir, we\u2019ll explain everything, but right now you and everyone else are safer together in the sunroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen join me, won\u2019t you? And explain now before there\u2019s a panic.\u201d Stanton waved a hand toward the sunroom doors, and Ty had little choice but to do as he was asked. The request wasn\u2019t exactly unreasonable, after all.</p><p>Ty gestured for the others to come with him. Zane would rather have them there as backup if things got out of hand, so he was glad Ty was at least on the same page with him. The Snake Eaters took up their posts on either side of the doors, and they wouldn\u2019t let Ty follow Stanton in until he submitted to a search.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking serious right now?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>English put a meaty hand on Ty\u2019s chest and pushed him a step back. \u201cYou\u2019re doing your jobs. We\u2019re doing ours. Hands up.\u201d</p><p>Ty did an impressive job of keeping a tight rein on his temper, doing as he was asked. English ran the wand over him, then let him in the room. The others each went through the same routine, with Nick\u2019s hip setting the wand off again. Frost patted him down just as he\u2019d done the first night, quietly joking about his shrapnel being inconvenient, then let Nick through. Nothing else pinged, though. Where and when had Nick stashed his gun?</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, you have the room,\u201d Stanton announced once the glass doors were closed.</p><p>Ty glanced over the small crowd. He looked to Stanton again, narrowing his eyes at the man. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Mr. Stanton,\u201d he said, his tone changing to one that made Zane groan internally. He was about to do something ill-advised, Zane knew that much.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eyes, Zane saw Nick and Kelly share a glance and then subtly move farther apart, spreading out. They knew that tone of voice too.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve determined one of the victims is actually a culprit. One of the victims was trying to sell your company\u2019s technology. And one of the victims was trying to buy it,\u201d Ty announced, keeping his voice bland and almost amused. \u201cCare to guess who is who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of a joke?\u201d Stanton asked.</p><p>\u201cTy, what the hell is going on?\u201d Deuce asked from one of the sitting areas.</p><p>\u201cDid Ernest Milton have access to the DOD tech you were developing?\u201d Zane asked Stanton.</p><p>Stanton looked briefly shell-shocked before recovering his wits and nodding. \u201cBut only pieces of it. He was trying to sell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo someone on this island,\u201d Ty provided.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of obvious it wasn\u2019t the cook,\u201d Kelly added drily.</p><p>Stanton rubbed at the bridge of his nose, shaking his head. \u201cThis makes no sense. Ernest would never sell that technology. He knew how sensitive it was, and he was a patriot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we all,\u201d Nick murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe also didn\u2019t have all the pieces. Without all three sets, it\u2019s useless to any buyer. Is that what got Ernest killed?\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty, earning a raised eyebrow in return. Three sets? That meant it was possible Milton had gone through with the sale of his information, hoping his buyer wouldn\u2019t be wise to how many pieces there were.</p><p>\u201cWho has the other pieces?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI control one,\u201d Stanton answered. \u201cIt remains with me at all times. The other remains with the head of security. He is currently in Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilton wasn\u2019t just selling his piece of the technology,\u201d Ty told Stanton. His eyes darted to Deuce and Livi. When he spoke again, it was through gritted teeth. \u201cWe found a confirmation on his laptop. He\u2019d hired someone to kidnap Amelia from their home in two days\u2019 time. Probably as leverage for your piece of the information.\u201d</p><p>Deuce lurched to his feet, protesting wordlessly. Stanton put a hand to his mouth, turning to look at Deuce and Livi before meeting Ty\u2019s eyes again. \u201cThat . . . I told Milton to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Livi cried.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a kidnapping,\u201d Stanton said, raising his voice as more people protested. \u201cIt was a test of your security, to see if someone could get to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to tell us this?\u201d Deuce shouted.</p><p>\u201cOnce the wedding date was moved, the point was moot.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a step back and turned to Zane, frowning as the Stantons and Gradys began to argue. The shouting and accusations bounced off the walls, wild gesticulations and posturing mirrored by candlelight in the darkened glass. The scene quickly devolved into chaos, but Ty and Zane ignored the feuding families.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s not adding up, right?\u201d Zane asked. Ty nodded. \u201cIf Milton was running a check on Amelia\u2019s protection, it\u2019s possible he was doing the same thing the night he was killed.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded again, covering his mouth with his hand as he spoke. \u201cHe could have been baiting the buyers, trying to find out who they were. If they killed him, it means he recognized them, and they knew him well enough to know he wouldn\u2019t be selling this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo our bad dead guy is now a good dead guy?\u201d Kelly whispered. He\u2019d come up behind Zane, so quiet in the confusion Zane hadn\u2019t realized he was there.</p><p>Zane glanced over his shoulder. Kelly stood with his arms crossed, scowling. Nick hung back, edging farther from the three of them. Zane did a double take when he saw the look in Nick\u2019s eyes, like he was staring into the distance, no longer truly with them.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty and Kelly both turned to investigate, both of them stiffening when they noticed Nick edging closer to the door like he might be trying to escape. But Nick didn\u2019t look for an escape when he suffered his flashbacks. He went on the attack.</p><p>The Snake Eaters had waded into the fray, trying to separate Stanton from the rest of the angry group. Stanton, though, had Livi by both arms, apparently trying to explain his actions to his daughter as she shouted at him. One of the Snake Eaters, the woman named Avery Kline, came up beside Stanton and pried his hands from Livi. Then, in the confusion, she wrapped her arm around his neck and yanked him backward, pulling her gun and using him to shield her body from the other Snake Eaters. Then she fired into the air before Zane could move to stop her.</p><p>The shot echoed, like fire bouncing off their eardrums. The glass ceiling shattered and rained shards down on the occupants of the room. Ty and Kelly both hit the ground, covering their heads. Neither man had seen what Zane had seen; they\u2019d merely heard the shot and reacted. Screams of terror and pain followed. People dove to the ground, shielding their loved ones or covering their ears. Rain poured in through the shattered panes. Ty and Kelly clambered to their feet again.</p><p>\u201cAnyone makes a move and I put one in his ear!\u201d Kline shouted. She directed her words to her fellow Snake Eaters, who all looked stunned by her betrayal. She knew they were the only ones in the room who were armed because they\u2019d wanded everyone as they came in. \u201cGuns down, now!\u201d</p><p>English pulled his lapel aside, showing her his weapon. He glanced at Frost and Park, nodding for them to do the same. All three men set their guns on the floor with great care.</p><p>\u201cI came here for one reason, and I\u2019m getting off this fucking island. Now,\u201d Kline said to Stanton. She pointed her gun at Livi\u2019s head. \u201cTake me to that memory drive or I kill her.\u201d</p><p>Stanton nodded furtively. She began to back toward the doors, dragging him backward with her. She aimed the gun at Zane and the others, eyeing them suspiciously as they stood with their hands in the air. She sneered at them. \u201cFucking Recon, my ass.\u201d</p><p>Another gunshot tore through the sound of the torrential rain, and then the bullet tore through Avery Kline\u2019s head, dropping her as Stanton cringed away from the splatter of blood and brain matter. He stumbled away, leaving Nick standing behind the body of the woman he\u2019d just shot, gun still drawn.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Force fucking Recon to you,\u201d Nick said to the dead woman. \u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Ty and the others stood in stunned silence. The only sound in the room was the rain pouring in through the ruined roof. Ty looked from the bleeding body to Nick and back. He didn\u2019t dare move, and he was glad the rest of the room seemed too stunned to make any sudden motions that might set Nick off. He didn\u2019t know if they were losing Nick to the past, or if the man had been paying closer attention to the Snake Eaters than Ty and the others had and had simply anticipated a move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Either way, it paid to be careful around him.</p><p>Nick turned his weapon on the other Snake Eaters when English made a move toward his gun. \u201cLeave them,\u201d Nick ordered. \u201cBackups too, on the ground.\u201d</p><p>English, Park, and Frost all complied without complaint. They were all hardened veterans; they recognized a man on the edge when they saw one. They kicked their guns toward Nick and backed away from them, hands held above their heads.</p> <p>Nick glanced at Ty and the others, nodding his head toward the weapons. Kelly jumped when he realized Nick wanted him to move, and he bent to gather the guns and extra clips, handing the spares over to Ty and Zane and checking them before shoving two of them into his pants. He gave Nick a curt nod, never speaking a word. They reminded Ty of Bonnie and Clyde knocking over a bank.</p><p>Nick surveyed the people in the sunroom. Ty glanced over them as well, wondering what Nick was looking for. Several people were drenched from the rain, including Deuce and Livi. More were bleeding from cuts caused by falling glass. Mara\u2019s cheek was bleeding, and Earl was cupping her chin to examine it, paying Nick and his gun no attention whatsoever.</p><p>Everyone else was staring at Nick, not sure if he was a hero or a new villain.</p><p>\u201cNext person who wastes my time with a lie is losing a kneecap,\u201d Nick announced.</p><p>Villain, then.</p> <p>Ty moved slowly, coming up behind Kelly to whisper in his ear. \u201cCan we take him out without hurting him?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t need to. Just watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree pieces of tech. Three targets,\u201d Nick said, addressing Stanton. \u201cWhat are they contained on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComputers. Secure files. You don\u2019t need the gun,\u201d Stanton said, trying to sound calm and failing.</p><p>\u201cIt seems more effective than being pleasant and trustworthy,\u201d Nick countered. \u201cHow are the files accessed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA key code. A six-digit code. I only know mine. And then an override code must be entered. I\u2019m the only one who knows that as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, at least they won\u2019t have to cut out your eyeballs for the security or anything. Next time, don\u2019t make yourself the key,\u201d Nick said wryly. He lowered the gun, stuffing it in the small of his back. He glanced at Kelly, then Ty and Zane, and shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re running short on time here.\u201d</p><p>Ty gaped at him. He finally snapped out of it and turned to Stanton, feeling the need to both apologize and yell at the man. The Snake Eaters were all glaring at them, looking mutinous.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your other man?\u201d Ty asked English.</p><p>\u201cKid duty.\u201d</p><p>Ty walked over to him and handed him his gun back. He held up the backup. \u201cI\u2019m keeping this \u2019til I can find a better one.\u201d</p><p>English nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cGet all these people into a room and keep them there. Preferably one without a carving on the wall of an angel attached to a ball and chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d English asked, his tone flat and tired.</p> <p>\u201cJust . . . roll with it.\u201d Ty checked his clip, then shoved the gun into his belt. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back with more weapons. Keep everyone calm.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to his men, casting a stray glance at Nick to make sure he hadn\u2019t truly snapped. Nick was smiling crookedly at him, though. Ty had to fight against his own smile. Nick had obviously enjoyed that a little too much.</p><p>He gave orders as they left the sunroom and emerged into the darkened great hall. \u201cRound up all the weapons, and any stray guests or staff you run across. The kids are in the nursery on the third floor, get them down here.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both gave him curt nods and jogged off toward the grand staircase. Ty and Zane followed the light of Zane\u2019s phone toward the room they\u2019d seen on their tour the first day, where stag heads and stuffed birds mingled with hunting rifles and antique weaponry.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ty said as they walked. \u201cWhy would she go bonkers now? No one was onto her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe she thought we had more than we did, took the offensive route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone can handle the cloak-and-dagger shit like you can, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if Nikki Webb was the woman who killed Milton on the beach and the cook in the kitchen, she had a man with her. How the hell does Kline fit in? That means we have three killers on the island. And the Snake Eaters can\u2019t fucking be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we get armed, we\u2019re taking Amelia and keeping her with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>They took a wrong turn and had to backtrack, getting confused with all the lights out. Zane insisted he knew where they were, though, and Ty trusted his mental maps to get them there.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so was that crazy or savvy?\u201d Zane finally asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick. Is he pretending to be crazy to scare people into telling him the truth? Or is he actually crazy and scary?\u201d</p><p>Ty winced, shrugging. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cThat was ruthless. It was kind of hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking start with me, Zane. I\u2019m not even kidding.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed, but went quiet when they found the door to the room ajar. A sense of impending doom began to settle in Ty\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Zane turned his light off, and Ty toed the door open. There was just enough light still coming through the windows for him to see the broken glass of the empty gun cabinet.</p><p>\u201cWell, that can\u2019t be good,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Nick let Kelly lead them to their rooms to gather all the weapons they\u2019d packed. Nick trailed to a stop in front of Nikki Webb\u2019s door.</p><p>Kelly turned and gave Nick a questioning shrug. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to search her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Six told us to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck what he told us, Kels,\u201d Nick growled. \u201cHe\u2019s not our Six anymore, and he\u2019s wrong this time.\u201d</p><p>Kelly looked stunned for a moment before nodding. He strode closer and grabbed Nick by his shirt, yanking him closer to kiss him. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you back here in five.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, breathless as Kelly pulled away. He watched Kelly fade into the darkness, then turned to the room Nikki Webb and what\u2019s her face, the Sun Tzu fan, had shared.</p><p>He knocked first, wishing he could remember the other woman\u2019s name. She\u2019d fucking spelled it for him, for Christ\u2019s sake. There was no answer to his knock.</p><p>He knocked again, then waited a beat before trying the doorknob.</p><p>A sound from the stairwell halted him. He went still, cocking his head to listen. There was a thump upstairs, then a grunt and a quiet click. He crept toward the stairs, listening intently. The only sound he could discern was the soft whimpering of a small child. It was so distant he couldn\u2019t tell if it was coming from upstairs, or from his memory of the past.</p><p>With a last look back at the hallway, he started up the dark steps to investigate.</p><p>When Ty did a head count of the people milling about in the dining room, he was alarmed to find only half the people on the island were present, and neither Nick nor Kelly were among them yet.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is everyone else?\u201d he asked Deuce in a whisper that seemed to echo in the large room.</p><p>Deuce shrugged. He was still drenched from the rain in the sunroom. \u201cEveryone refuses to come out of their bedrooms until the ferry gets here. And frankly, Ty, with all the good guy shooting going on here, I don\u2019t blame them. Why do you want all of us down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you bring Livi over here, please?\u201d Ty requested, trying to keep his tone soothing.</p><p>Deuce went to retrieve her, murmuring to her as they rejoined Ty near the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you know about the passages inside the walls of the house?\u201d Ty asked her, deciding that easing into things was no longer an option.</p><p>She blinked rapidly at him, shaking her head. \u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Deuce said disapprovingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. Nick and Kelly found an entrance in their bedroom. There are passages that go through the entire house. That\u2019s how the killers got into the kitchen and killed the cook. That\u2019s how they\u2019ve been moving around without being seen. Deacon, all the rifles and small arms used for hunting have disappeared. Someone is either armed to the fucking teeth, or they\u2019re making sure none of us can be. No one is safe locked in their rooms. We need to get everyone down here, make sure we have safety in numbers. And we need to find every carved angel with a ball and chain in its wing. Those are the entrances. I also need to know every single fucking person on this island who knew about those passages.\u201d</p><p>Deuce was nodding urgently, but Livi seemed stunned. Even when Deuce moved away, she remained rooted to the spot, her mouth ajar. Ty put a gentle hand on her shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ball and chain wings,\u201d she said, her voice dazed. \u201cThere\u2019s one in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s heart dropped. \u201cThe one on the third floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids are all up there,\u201d Livi whispered. \u201cWe thought they\u2019d be safe with the nanny and a bodyguard at the door. Ty . . . Amelia is up there.\u201d</p><p>Nick climbed the winding stairs, his mind a swirl of emotions he didn\u2019t normally find himself hindered by. He was grieving over the life he\u2019d been forced to take. He was conflicted over the combination of guilt and nonchalance he was feeling over the decision to take that shot instead of the admittedly more risky option of trying to restrain her. And he was angry. He was furious, in fact, and no amount of trying to walk it off seemed to be able to cool him down.</p><p>That in and of itself told him that he was closer to cracking than he had been in a very long time. It had gotten beyond his normally impressive level of control, and with nowhere to go and lick his wounds, it would continue to spiral unless he could find a way to block it all out until he had a chance to decompress.</p><p>He and Ty had been through many fires together. They\u2019d had a few fights. After the year they\u2019d spent not communicating at all, Ty had been the one to reach out to Nick, first saying that he missed him and then adding that he needed help from someone he could trust. Nick hadn\u2019t hesitated. He never did. Ty was his best friend, and no matter what they did to each other, they would always be brothers. His loyalty was reciprocated too, with Ty jumping to his side whenever Nick needed him.</p><p>Nick wasn\u2019t sure he could forgive Ty for all the lies he\u2019d uncovered in the past year, though. He hadn\u2019t been able to get over it even while they\u2019d been deployed, and now that they were here, embroiled in someone else\u2019s problems again, Nick couldn\u2019t reconcile the anger and betrayal. Not this time.</p><p>He came to the last riser of the staircase, and his thoughts were interrupted by another thump and a quiet whimper. Something about the sound\u2014a sound he heard in his dreams, a sound he\u2019d made hundreds of times as a boy\u2014made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He took the last few steps two at a time. He moved quickly and silently in the dark, taking care the floorboards beneath his feet didn\u2019t creak. He got to the nursery door and nearly tripped over the body of the Snake Eater on the ground. It was Hardin. Blood was streaming from a wound on the man\u2019s forehead. Nick checked his pulse and found nothing. He put his palm over Hardin\u2019s staring eyes and closed them.</p><p>\u201cHooah, soldier,\u201d he whispered. He patted the dead Snake Eater down, but his weapon was gone. Nick reached for his own gun and raised it toward the door.</p><p>He hesitated only another second before he pushed the door open. The nanny was standing near the massive fireplace with her back to the door. The five Grady cousins were all cowering in the corner, the oldest boy trying to shield the younger ones with his small body. He was no more than ten.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take her!\u201d he shouted at the nanny.</p><p>Maisie backhanded the boy so hard he stumbled to the side. He quickly recovered and put himself back in front of his cousins with a determined snarl, blood dripping from his lip.</p><p>Nick saw red and shoved into the room. The woman turned when she heard him, startling and taking a quick step back. Nick stalked toward her, not slowing when she pulled a gun with a silencer from the folds of her dress and pointed it at him. She wasn\u2019t even holding the damn thing the right way. He flinched when she pulled the trigger, but nothing happened. She\u2019d forgotten to take the safety off.</p><p>She fumbled with the weapon, still backing away from him, her face contorting in terror. She screamed for help, the shrill cry enough to pierce eardrums. She finally managed to get the safety off, and she fired rapidly, a frightened spray of bullets from a person who\u2019d obviously never handled a gun before. One of the shots burned as it went past Nick\u2019s ribs. She nearly stumbled over her own feet when the shot didn\u2019t even slow Nick down, and Nick was on her before she could even think about reloading the gun. She tried smacking at him and kneeing him in the groin, both moves he easily deflected. He held her gun hand by the wrist and wrapped his fingers around her throat, picking her up by her neck until her toes were barely able to touch the ground.</p><p>She fought to bring the gun up, choking and sputtering. The way she fought, she certainly wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d taken out the Green Beret at the door. She wasn\u2019t alone. Just as he thought it, Nick heard the heavy footsteps of someone coming down the hallway. Her partner must have been doing a perimeter check, leaving her to retrieve Amelia alone.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Nick asked, letting her toes graze the floor so she could breathe to answer.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get what they want no matter what you do,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cHalf a million pounds for one little girl. I couldn\u2019t say no. No one could.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick loosened his grip, setting her back down. He yanked the gun from her hands and tossed it away, still glaring at her with murderous intent. He waved a hand at the children. \u201cFireplace,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>They hustled to obey. Nick told them how to open the secret door. Then he raised his gun.</p><p>Maisie took a halting step back and stumbled over a toy on the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re not a killer. Not like them. I can see that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Nick asked with a slow smile. He began backing toward the fireplace. The footsteps grew slower and quieter as they approached. He couldn\u2019t risk a gunfight with an unknown number of assailants and five children in the room. He\u2019d have to retreat.</p><p>\u201cMaisie?\u201d a man whispered from behind the half-open door. The accent was Scottish.</p><p>Nick waited a breath, until he could feel the wall behind him, until one of the kids reached up and took his hand. Then he raised his gun and fired at the man in the doorway.</p><p>Ty had to fight the urge to dive to the ground when the anguished screams and booming gunfire echoed through the house. Everyone froze, struck momentarily dumb by the unexpected sound of battle. Ty\u2019s eyes met Zane\u2019s for a brief moment before they both lunged out of their chairs and sprinted out of the dining room for the stairway. They met Kelly on his way down, out of breath and panicked.</p><p>One look at him and Ty knew something was horribly wrong. \u201cWhat is it, is it Nick?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly shook his head jerkily, his eyes straying to the people in the foyer. \u201cNot Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids?\u201d Deuce blurted.</p><p>A tray of coffee crashed in the foyer. Concerned cries echoed off the marble of the great hall. There were gasps and murmurs as the panic and confusion became contagious.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what happened?\u201d Deuce demanded. His limp was almost absent as he rushed up the steps.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cNick and I split up. When I came back he was gone, and when I heard the shots I went up to the third floor, but the room\u2019s empty. There\u2019s no one there but two dead bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Nick?\u201d Ty asked again.</p> <p>Kelly opened his mouth, but no words came out. He managed to shake his head and spread his hands wide. \u201cHe\u2019s not up there, he\u2019s not down here. He\u2019s gone too. Maybe he went after whoever took the kids.\u201d</p><p>Zane cursed under his breath, the sound sending shivers down Ty\u2019s spine. \u201cDo you think Nick got lost in a flashback?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Deuce grabbed Ty by his shirtfront. \u201cYou said we could trust him!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Ty gripped his arms and shook him violently. \u201cStop! We\u2019ll find them. Come with me and keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Ty and the others followed Kelly to the third floor playroom where the kids had been stashed for safekeeping. The nanny who\u2019d been assigned to watch them was laid out on the floor, bleeding from several gunshot wounds. Her face was bloody. A windowpane was shattered, and the wind whipped into the room, tugging at their clothing and hair. Bullet holes littered the rock walls behind her, and more had lodged into the door of the nursery, like she had fired back at an assailant shooting from the doorway.</p><p>The room itself was a shambles, with toys tossed about and furniture turned over.</p><p>\u201cIs this . . . normal for a kid\u2019s room?\u201d Zane asked carefully as they stood and surveyed the scene.</p><p>\u201cAside from the dead nanny and the bullet holes . . . sometimes,\u201d Deuce answered helplessly. He caught sight of something and pounced on it, picking up Amelia\u2019s ratty gray lamb and holding it up for Livi to see.</p> <p>Livi covered her mouth with her fingers as tears began to stream down her face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find them,\u201d Ty assured her. \u201cSomeone get in those fucking walls and start looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould Nick have done this?\u201d Deuce shouted. \u201cSomeone took out that guard, and he was a Green Beret!\u201d</p><p>Ty met Kelly\u2019s eyes, at a loss. They both knew Nick would never, ever hurt a child, no matter how lost in his memories he became. But would he hurt the Snake Eater who\u2019d been guarding the door? Or the nanny? If they stood between him and someone he thought he needed to rescue? Yeah. Definitely.</p><p>Zane cleared his throat and stepped closer to Kelly, speaking so low Ty could hardly hear. \u201cWould the, um . . . the medication he\u2019s on, would it cause behavior like this?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head vehemently.</p><p>\u201cWhat medication?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Kelly rubbed at his eyes and shook his head again. \u201cHe takes propranolol for a tremor in his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTremor,\u201d Ty echoed. \u201cWhat the fuck, since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPropranolol?\u201d Deuce said as he came closer. \u201cThat\u2019s sometimes prescribed for PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not Nick\u2019s issue,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not,\u201d Zane grumbled. \u201cEvery member of your team has PTSD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, a shrink now?\u201d Ty snapped. Zane shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt can be hidden well, especially by people like you,\u201d Deuce insisted with a wave of his hand at Ty. \u201cCould he have snapped and done this? Or run off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, people like me?\u201d Ty took a step that put him face-to-face with his fuming brother.</p><p>Zane stepped between them and put a hand on both their chests.</p><p>\u201cSomething would\u2019ve had to have triggered him,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Nick sure as hell wouldn\u2019t hurt those kids,\u201d Ty added with a pointed look at Deuce.</p><p>\u201cThen find them, Ty!\u201d Deuce shouted.</p><p>Zane took Deuce\u2019s shoulder and held him even when he tried to shove away. \u201cYou need to calm down,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Livi was still crying, but she gripped Deuce\u2019s elbow. \u201cThey\u2019re right. We\u2019re not helping by panicking.\u201d</p><p>Deuce took a deep breath and stepped away, running his hands through his hair. Ty gave Livi a nod of thanks, then noticed several more people in the doorway, watching and waiting. He hesitated, momentarily indecisive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure no one came by you, Doc?\u201d Zane asked Kelly.</p><p>\u201cPositive. I was right there at the stairs when the shooting started. By the time I got up here, it looked like this. No one got by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans they went through the walls,\u201d Ty murmured.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we need to find the kids,\u201d Zane announced, taking control when Ty still hesitated. \u201cSplit up into groups of four or five, no one goes anywhere alone. Check every room top to bottom and then lock it behind you as you leave. Start at the wings and work inward to the center of the house.\u201d</p><p>Zane divided them into groups and then assigned each group a wing and level of the house. The groups split off and headed for their assigned areas. Ty was already fidgeting, trying to map out the directions Nick could have gone as Zane gestured to Emma, who was still standing at the doorway. \u201cYou come with us. We\u2019ll circle the house, see if we can pick up anything outside. If Nick\u2019s in the walls, he would have headed for that escape door at the corner of the patio. Deacon, Livi, you two stay here in this room in case the kids ran for it and try to come back. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Deuce\u2019s jaw tightened, but he nodded. \u201cFind my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>They collected flashlights, then Ty led Zane, Kelly, and Emma down to the front door and outside. There had been a break in the storm, but Ty didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d be able to find anything out there, or how long the rain would hold off. They spread out and began scouring the grounds, Ty and Zane moving one way, Kelly and Emma the other, searching in a circle around the mansion for tracks or signs of a struggle. It took them too many minutes to reach the gardens in the back of the house where the inner passages would have led someone to exit.</p><p>Ty was too worried to talk, too worried to question Zane about how he\u2019d known Nick was taking medication, or why Nick hadn\u2019t told Ty about any of these things that were going on in his life. What the hell kind of friend had Ty been to him that he felt he couldn\u2019t share? And now Nick was missing, God knew if he was okay, and the last real words Ty had exchanged with him were in contempt and anger.</p><p>It made Ty physically ill. His hand holding the flashlight began to tremble.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay, Ty,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot something!\u201d Kelly called out in the darkness. He and Emma were waving their flashlights, and Ty and Zane hurried through the inky night to find them. When they reached the spot, they could see deep prints in the muddy grass. The strides were long and the footprints were obscured by motion and mud.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was running,\u201d Ty said. He played his light over the path, peering back at the house. The tracks didn\u2019t come from the patio, but rather the corner of the wall. The same corner where Zane had seen the carved angel with its ball and chain. That proved their theory correct, but it didn\u2019t make Ty feel any better.</p><p>They followed the tracks for several yards, realizing there had been no attempt at covering them.</p><p>\u201cIf this was Nick, it\u2019s sloppy as hell,\u201d Kelly finally said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be him.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t comment. Normally he would have agreed with Kelly; he\u2019d never seen Nick leave a trail this obvious. But if Nick really had suffered a full-blown flashback or panic attack, who knew what state of mind he was in? The children all knew and trusted him. They would have followed him if they believed he was protecting them.</p><p>\u201cGot blood here,\u201d Ty called. They were losing evidence to the rain quickly, and almost as soon as he\u2019d spotted it, the blood had been washed away. The ball in Ty\u2019s stomach grew heavier when he realized the tracks were leading them directly to the cliff\u2019s edge. He picked up the pace, no longer trying to read the story the tracks were telling them. Kelly stopped and picked up something that glinted in the light of his flashlight.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he whispered. He held up a gold claddagh ring that Nick rarely took off. \u201cThis is his.\u201d</p><p>Ty broke into a jog, following the obvious path in the grass until they took a sharp left. Ty momentarily lost the trail, then picked it up again. The cliff\u2019s edge opened up at his side like the gaping maw of some primeval monster, angry waves crashing far below. Nick had run along the edge of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cWas he going for the cliff?\u201d Zane asked, sounding just as confused as Ty was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould he have survived that fall?\u201d Emma asked, sounding stunned and horrified.</p><p>\u201cThe fall, yes, if he cleared the rocks,\u201d Kelly answered. \u201cThe water, no. Not for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould he have cleared the rocks?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty gave a helpless shrug. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know. I know I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . why would he do this?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>Ty had no answer. He backtracked, trying to find some clue in the trail. He finally saw one in a patch of mud, and he bent to look closer. \u201cThere was someone else out here.\u201d</p><p>Zane came to look over his shoulder, offering the light of his flashlight as well. Ty showed them Nick\u2019s track, light and barely there in the grass. There was another, heavier print in the mud. It overlapped Nick\u2019s footprint, meaning whoever had made it had come after.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was chasing him,\u201d Emma surmised. \u201cThere was someone else up there with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one pair, though,\u201d Ty told them. \u201cNick was running from one guy? That doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the fucking hounds of the Baskervilles!\u201d Kelly shouted. \u201cNick would have stood and fought! Nothing scares Nick enough to make him run, to try to jump off a fucking cliff! Nothing!\u201d</p><p>Ty reached out to take Kelly\u2019s arm, but the man shoved him away and pointed a finger in his face. \u201cHe came here for you, Ty! He came here because you\u2019re his brother, and he\u2019d do anything for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Doc,\u201d Ty managed to say, his voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well he wouldn\u2019t have left those kids unprotected, I don\u2019t care what kind of flashback he was having! And he wouldn\u2019t have run! He wouldn\u2019t have run away! He would have stood and he would have fought! You know he would have fought!\u201d</p><p>Ty held up both hands, wanting to comfort Kelly but too confused and heartbroken to try. He didn\u2019t understand what the tracks were telling him. Everything he knew about Nick screamed the evidence was lying, because damn right Nick would have fought. Ty had seen him stand his ground in situations where even Ty wanted to duck and cover. Nick would have fought to his very last breath no matter what he was facing.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he would run,\u201d Zane said after a few moments of silence.</p><p>Kelly turned on him, eyes blazing in the light of the flashlights. Thunder crashed right over them, and the skies opened up again. Zane held up a hand to avoid Kelly\u2019s angry words.</p><p>\u201cHe would run from someone,\u201d Zane said again. \u201cIf he was leading them away from something else. Something he was protecting.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at him for a beat, then he and Ty locked eyes as they both realized what Zane was saying.</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s the one who moved the kids,\u201d Ty said quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s not pursuing someone. He took the kids. He must have been there before the shooting started.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swiped a hand over his mouth, looking down at the tracks and then to the cliff. \u201cHe must have gotten wind of something coming and didn\u2019t have time to call for help. He hid the kids, then took off running, left a trail an idiot could follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I found that trail,\u201d Emma grunted.</p><p>Somewhere in the darkness ahead of them came three gunshots in rapid succession, then a garbled shout through the pouring rain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh Jesus,\u201d Ty breathed as he shined the weak light of his flashlight into the night.</p><p>Kelly jammed the ring onto his finger, then cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, \u201cNick!\u201d</p><p>His voice was swallowed by the pounding surf below and the downpour from above. They all waited, holding their breaths, desperate for a return call. Ty couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the beat of his heart, the sound of the surf and rain, and his desperate desire to hear his best friend\u2019s voice. All the sounds of that moment were, to his ears, Nick crying out for help.</p> <p>The touch of Zane\u2019s hand to his shoulder spurred him on, and they followed the sound of the gunshots, holding to the swiftly dissolving trail, watching it zigzag like Nick had been dodging something. It came nauseatingly close to the edge at times.</p><p>The wind and rain whipped at Ty\u2019s thin shirt, whistling in his ears, stinging his eyes until they teared. He had no doubt those gunshots hadn\u2019t been heard inside the thick walls of the mansion.</p><p>They climbed the incline that led to the crumbling ruin of the lighthouse on the hill. When they hit the top of the hill, the scene before them kicked Ty\u2019s instincts into gear, and he and Kelly both threw themselves to the ground. Zane followed suit, and Kelly pulled Emma down so they wouldn\u2019t be seen.</p><p>A man stood at the very edge of the jagged cliff, holding something bundled in a white blanket that practically glowed in the moonlight. Ty could tell it was Nick merely by the set of his shoulders. Another man stood with his back to them, pointing a gun at Nick.</p><p>\u201cGive me the kid, and no one gets hurt,\u201d the man with the gun shouted into the wind. His accent was Scottish.</p> <p>Ty\u2019s breath left him in a rush. \u201cAmelia,\u201d he gasped. Nick was holding Amelia, clutching her to his chest to protect her.</p><p>If Nick said anything, his response was lost in the wind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need her alive!\u201d the gunman shouted. \u201cI just need pieces of her to send to her granddaddy!\u201d</p><p>Zane grabbed at Ty\u2019s arm and back, trying to keep him from getting up, but Zane wasn\u2019t fast enough. Ty lunged to his feet and charged the man. He hit him from behind. The gun went off as Ty and the gunman tumbled to the ground.</p><p>Ty rolled several feet away, flattening out in time to see Nick, his side bloodied by the stray shot, lose his balance and fall over the edge of the cliff with Amelia in his arms. Ty scrambled to his feet and dove toward the edge of the cliff, grasping desperately. His fingers found Nick\u2019s, and their hands clasped together, the momentum dragging Ty several feet in the wet grass and ripping something apart inside his shoulder. He dug his toes in, managing to stop their slide. He wound up with his chest at the edge of the cliff, his shoulders and head hanging over, and his fingers wrapped around Nick\u2019s forearm.</p><p>Nick hung from one arm, grasping Ty\u2019s wrist in an iron grip. He swung freely over the jagged rocks and the frigid ocean below. A teddy bear fell away from his other hand, the white blanket fluttering after it. Nick watched them fall, then grimaced up at Ty.</p> <p>\u201cGive me your other hand!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>Nick reached up and fumbled for Ty\u2019s other hand, but when he moved and his weight shifted, Ty began to slide again. The earth beneath him was soft and muddy, the grass wet.</p><p>Nick cried out in pain and dropped his hand, shaking his head. \u201cLet go, Ty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you! Find a foothold until we get help!\u201d</p><p>Nick tried to reach out for the cliff\u2019s inverted face, but as soon as he moved, Ty slid yet again. The cliff was too far away for him to touch it, much less grab for anything solid.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d Nick shouted. \u201cWe\u2019ll both fall if you don\u2019t let go!\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, flat out refusing to accept that. He tried to pull Nick up, but his separated shoulder screamed even when he flexed his muscles in preparation for moving. He felt a hand at his belt, heard Emma shouting at him.</p><p>Ty opened his eyes again, meeting Nick\u2019s. \u201cI can\u2019t lift you, you\u2019re going to have to climb.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t climb,\u201d Nick said through gritted teeth. Even hanging by a thread over certain death, he sounded annoyed with Ty for being an idiot.</p><p>\u201cTry!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t climb if you\u2019re the thing I\u2019m climbing because you\u2019re not attached to anything! Fucker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it anyway, Jesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>Nick made one more attempt to reach for Ty with his other hand, but it merely pulled Ty closer to the edge. Gravity tugged at him, taunting him, beckoning him toward the sea as the top half of his body slid over the sloped edge. The earth beneath him began to crumble, falling into Nick\u2019s face and hair.</p><p>Nick shook it away. He looked back up, meeting Ty\u2019s eyes. He sounded calm when he spoke. \u201cLet go, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting go,\u201d Ty told him. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me be the reason you die,\u201d Nick growled. He relaxed his fingers, leaving Ty to cling to him alone.</p><p>Ty let out a whimper as he tightened his hold. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me, Nick, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I have help, they\u2019re coming! Just hold on!\u201d Even as he spoke, though, he could feel himself slipping. Where the fuck were Zane and Kelly? He shouted over the roar of the ocean, \u201cHelp!\u201d</p><p>Nick reached down, fumbling for his belt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>He pulled a knife from a sheath, looking up at Ty with a grim smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do it,\u201d Ty said. \u201cDon\u2019t you stab me, you fucker!\u201d</p><p>Nick flicked the knife over his fingers, the blade catching the reflection of a streak of lightning.</p><p>\u201cZane! Doc!\u201d Ty shouted. He shook his head at Nick. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare stab me with that knife!\u201d He tried to slither backward, desperate to get more purchase in the ground, to hold Nick there until more of the others came to their aid. Emma didn\u2019t weigh enough to keep them from going over the edge.</p><p>Nick\u2019s green eyes were unreadable, the knife in his hand. Ty shook his head. \u201cI gave you that knife for your birthday, you motherfucker!\u201d</p><p>Nick made one last lunge, swiping the knife through the air, aiming for Ty\u2019s forearm, aiming to create a scar that Ty would carry in his nightmares for the rest of his life. The motion of his body pulled Ty even closer to the edge, and Ty squeezed his eyes closed because he would be damned if he let go when that knife sank in.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting go.</p><p>Zane heard a sickening crunch when Ty made contact with the man. He didn\u2019t know if it was Ty\u2019s bones breaking or the other man\u2019s, but the way the man sprawled told Zane those cracked bones probably belonged to him. The gun went off when Ty hit him, then again when he hit the ground. Zane felt a bullet whiz between himself and Kelly, narrowly missing both of them. Neither man took cover, though. They both bolted forward to attack.</p><p>Zane grabbed the gun as it skidded across the wet grass and backed away to train it on the mystery attacker. He needn\u2019t have bothered because Kelly pounced on the man, hitting him over and over until his knuckles were bloody and raw and the man was nearly unrecognizable.</p><p>\u201cKelly!\u201d Zane shouted, moving closer as Kelly continued the thrashing.</p><p>\u201cYou mess with my fucking team!\u201d Kelly shouted. He grabbed the man\u2019s shirt and pulled him off the ground, throwing himself into the next punch. \u201cChase him off a fucking cliff and think that can kill him!\u201d He threw another brutal punch, then pulled him up and put their faces close together. There was no way the man was conscious. He gurgled as he breathed. His eyes rolled into the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cDoc!\u201d Zane shouted.</p><p>Kelly sneered at the killer, and he hissed when he spoke. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how we deal with your kind, you sniveling little son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Zane stuffed the gun in the back of his belt and went to pull Kelly off the man before he could beat him to death. Kelly tried to break from Zane\u2019s grasp, but Zane shouted at him. \u201cWe have to help Ty and Nick!\u201d</p><p>Kelly stopped struggling immediately, and his head whipped around. It was then that Zane noticed Ty stretched out, hanging over the edge of the cliff. Emma had Ty\u2019s belt in her hands, pulling with all her might. Zane could see her boots creating furrows in the grass as they slid over.</p><p>Zane and Kelly both scrambled to the cliff. Zane threw himself over Ty\u2019s back, hoping his weight would slow the inexorable pull of gravity. They got there just in time to see Nick draw his knife. Kelly reached over the edge, catching Nick\u2019s forearm with his hand before Nick could strike.</p><p>Kelly yanked the knife out of his hand and tossed it into the night. He grabbed his arm with both hands. Ty screamed in pain when he tried to help, but neither man let go. Zane slid his arms under Ty\u2019s and used him as if he were a rope. The three of them worked together to pull Ty and Nick from the brink.</p><p>Once Ty was on solid ground, Zane let go of him and grabbed at Nick\u2019s shirt, then his belt, helping Kelly haul him over. Nick scrabbled at the wet grass, looking for purchase, but he never found it. He and Ty both would have gone over for sure.</p><p>When they got far enough away from the cliff, Nick sprawled on his back, breathing hard. Kelly fell onto his ass and put a hand on Nick\u2019s stomach, laughing in relief. But Zane crawled toward the edge, his panic enough to override his fear of heights. \u201cDid Amelia fall?\u201d he cried.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her,\u201d Ty groaned. He was rolling around in the grass, holding his right arm. \u201cIt was a decoy.\u201d He sat up, wincing. Some of those cracking bones had obviously belonged to him. He glared over at Nick, who was on his back, a hand held to his stomach. \u201cAsshole!\u201d</p><p>Nick responded with a weak laugh. Kelly knelt next to him and shined his flashlight on his torso. His shirt was bloodied and torn.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Kelly shook his head and shoved his flashlight into Zane\u2019s hands. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. We need to get him inside though.\u201d</p><p>Ty crawled closer. \u201cIs he conscious?\u201d</p><p>Kelly tapped his fingers against Nick\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cQuit it, Jesus Christ.\u201d Nick swatted at Kelly\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s conscious,\u201d Kelly answered.</p><p>Ty leaned over him. \u201cWhere are the kids, Irish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found a place to stash them,\u201d Nick answered. His words were a little slurred. \u201cGave the oldest one a gun and told him to shoot the next person who came around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick lifted his head, looking at the man Kelly had beaten half to death. \u201cGuy took out the Snake Eater at the door, sent the nanny in for Amelia. The oldest boy wouldn\u2019t let her get to her; that\u2019s when I walked in.\u201d Kelly took Nick\u2019s arm and helped him to his feet. They all clambered off the wet ground and moved further away from the treacherous edge of the cliff, going to stand over the groaning form of Nick\u2019s attacker.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jockie Fraser,\u201d Ty said, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cThe groundskeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so the groundskeeper and the nanny?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cThis is an island thing and not a Snake Eater thing? Damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me twenty bucks,\u201d Nick told him.</p><p>\u201cFucker!\u201d Ty shouted as he tore his eyes away from Fraser to look at Nick again. Zane could see the warning signs coming. Ty grabbed Nick\u2019s shirt, heedless of either of their injuries, and shook him. \u201cYou tried to stab me so I\u2019d let you go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have taken you with me, Ty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStab me so I\u2019d let you fall!\u201d Ty shouted, not appearing to hear anything anyone else was saying as Kelly and Emma both tried to calm them. Zane moved forward, putting a hand on Ty\u2019s shoulder that Ty didn\u2019t even notice. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking remember the last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember shoving a friend off a cliff to save your life!\u201d Nick cried. He pushed away from Ty, holding his bloody side.</p><p>\u201cStupid, selfish fucking son of a bitch!\u201d Ty took a swing before Zane could stop him, catching Nick under the chin.</p><p>Nick staggered backward into Kelly, who barely managed to catch him and keep him on his feet.</p><p>Zane lunged, wrapping his arms around Ty before it could turn messier. Ty was breathing hard, almost gasping for every breath, and he was very nearly sobbing. Zane placed himself between the two of them. Ty rested his chin on Zane\u2019s shoulder, then lowered his head, and Zane hugged him close, not sure what else to do for him but make sure he didn\u2019t try to hit anyone else.</p><p>Nick had his hands on his knees, apparently trying to shake the cobwebs after Ty\u2019s punch. Zane knew what a sucker punch from Ty felt like. Not many men could come back from one, certainly not quickly. Nick\u2019s angry face was highlighted by a streak of lightning that hit too close for comfort. The rain was still torrential, obscuring their vision, making it hard to hear.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what it would do to us if you fell?\u201d Ty shouted at Nick, his voice breaking. \u201cWhat it would do to me?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head, looking wobbly. He hadn\u2019t tried to straighten up yet. He fell to his knees, and before Kelly could grab him, he tumbled face-first into the grass.</p><p>Kelly knelt beside him, a hand on his cheek. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just fucking great, Ty!\u201d</p><p>Zane held Ty tighter. His entire body was trembling. It was like trying to hold on to a bolt of pure energy.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the kids?\u201d Emma shouted over the sound of the storm and the crashing waves below.</p><p>\u201cThose kids could be anywhere. How the hell are we going to find them before someone else does?\u201d Zane snarled. He pointed at Fraser. \u201cWe all know there are more people on the island working with that asshole.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Ty whispered. He was apparently just realizing that he\u2019d knocked unconscious the only man on the island who might know where the kids were hidden.</p><p>Amelia might not have been Zane\u2019s blood, but he still considered her his niece. She was somewhere in danger, being hunted by ruthless people who\u2019d already killed to get to her, and they were all helpless to find her.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane grunted. \u201cWe have to go find Amelia. Doc and Emma will take care of Nick. Come on.\u201d</p> <p>Ty met his eyes, nodding dazedly. He turned his attention back to Kelly. \u201cWhere would Nick stash them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t know,\u201d Kelly snapped. \u201cMaybe if he was conscious he could lead us there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was going on instinct, where would he have gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know,\u201d Kelly stammered. \u201cThere\u2019s so many places inside those walls he\u2019d . . . it has to be the basement. He always took his sisters to the basement when his dad was drunk. He\u2019d have gone down until he couldn\u2019t go anymore, then he would have hid them. Anything underground. Look underground.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave a curt nod. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s a start.\u201d He looked down at Nick one last time, hesitating. \u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry when he wakes.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly glanced up, glaring briefly. \u201cTell him yourself.\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled Ty away before he could respond. They turned to hurry back to the mansion, but Kelly called after them.</p><p>\u201cHe always booby-trapped the stairs! Be careful! Think like Nick!\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned. \u201cThink like Nick. I\u2019m going to fucking die in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>When they approached the front door of the mansion, the feeling of foreboding once again crept into Zane and settled in his stomach. This time, though, he was pretty sure he had a good reason for it.</p> <p>They slowed as they came to the door, left ajar to reveal the gaping black hole of the interior. Both of them took out the weapons they\u2019d stolen from the Snake Eaters, checking that they were loaded, making sure the safeties were off. It was something they\u2019d done a hundred times before, maybe a thousand times: readying themselves to head into danger, taking that last moment to prepare. As partners. Sometimes side by side, sometimes with only a voice on an earpiece to let Zane know Ty was with him.</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty, who was shoving the clip back into his gun. They would never be partners again. The realization hit Zane hard. Ty met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Zane said quietly.</p><p>Ty stared at him for a few breaths. \u201cShould I ask you to marry me now?\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t stop himself from grinning, but he shook his head. \u201cAsk me after we live through this.\u201d</p><p>Ty stepped closer and placed a gentle hand on the back of Zane\u2019s neck as he kissed him. \u201cI love you too,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou find Amelia,\u201d Zane said, his voice hoarse when Ty moved away. \u201cI\u2019ll go for Stanton, make sure he\u2019s safe. He\u2019s probably the next target.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, and they headed into the house.</p> <p>In a few steps, Ty was gone, vanished into the darkness. It was a not-so-gentle reminder of what his lover was capable of, but it comforted Zane in ways he didn\u2019t want to examine too closely.</p><p>He made his way to the dining room, where he could see the flickering light of the fireplace, candles, and hurricane lamps. He lowered his gun when he stepped into the room.</p><p>Earl was sitting in a dining chair facing the doorway, a rifle aimed at Zane. He lowered it and nodded to him, setting the weapon across his legs again.</p><p>Zane gave the room a quick glance.</p><p>Mara sat with her arm around Susan Stanton, who was crying quietly. Mara\u2019s cheek had been roughly bandaged. Several others appeared to have been wounded by the falling glass. They needed to get Kelly in here to tend to them.</p><p>Stanton sat with his son, Theo, their heads bowed over a table as they spoke quietly. They were examining a map or blueprint, making marks on it. A dozen other guests were huddled around dining tables, some with blankets or coats wrapped over their shoulders, others conversing quietly or simply staring at Zane.</p><p>The Snake Eaters were gone.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s English and his boys?\u201d Zane asked Earl.</p><p>\u201cDid you find the kids?\u201d Earl asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Earl\u2019s shoulders slumped. He looked older than he usually did, but the shadows from the fire did odd things to people\u2019s appearances. \u201cStanton ordered them to search the house for Amelia. He told them her safety was more important to him than his own, so they went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Zane hissed. \u201cTy\u2019s off looking too; if they run into each other there\u2019s going to be some\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d Earl provided wryly.</p><p>Zane grunted.</p><p>\u201cI figure if Stanton\u2019s a target, then you\u2019re looking at last line of defense,\u201d Earl said with a tap to his chest. \u201cWe found this rifle on the wall above the fireplace. It\u2019s loaded, but I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019ll fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a knife?\u201d Zane asked. Earl nodded and patted his hip.</p><p>Stanton had noticed Zane there and was making his way to them.</p><p>\u201cDid you find Nick?\u201d Earl asked.</p><p>Zane nodded, waiting until Stanton and Theo joined them. \u201cHe interrupted the nanny and the groundskeeper trying to kidnap Amelia. He stopped them, and sent the kids into the passages within the walls. He hid them somewhere inside the walls and then ran as a decoy for Fraser.\u201d He met Stanton\u2019s eyes. \u201cDid you know those passages were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we used to play in them when I was a boy,\u201d Stanton answered. He was nearly mumbling, frowning so hard his eyebrows were touching. \u201cJockie Fraser? I\u2019ve known him since he was little. He was Theo\u2019s playmate on the island during the summers when we\u2019d visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJockie did this?\u201d Theo asked, looking horrified. It was the first time Zane had seen the man with any sort of expression. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe caught him with a gun, threatening to send pieces of Amelia to your father. Believe it,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>Theo and Stanton both blanched. Zane could hear Earl growling, and he took a deep breath, sorely tempted to go off the rails with them and rage about the threat to the little girl. Others had drifted closer, listening in, probably wanting to know if they were safe now, if it was all over. Zane looked over them and raised his voice to be heard.</p><p>\u201cNick couldn\u2019t tell us where he stashed the kids, so it\u2019s simply a matter of finding them before anyone else does now. Who else knew about the walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife. Some of the older staff. We never told the kids when they were little, we were afraid they\u2019d play in them and get hurt or lost. Frankly, I\u2019d forgotten about them. What about Jockie? Did he talk? Tell you who else is involved?\u201d Stanton asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not capable of much of anything right now,\u201d Zane admitted. \u201cBut when he is, we\u2019ll get everything we need out of him, I can guarantee you that.\u201d</p><p>Hamish Boyd, the butler Zane had only met the day he arrived, forced his way through the crowd. He used a cane to do it, shoving at people with it to clear his path. \u201cDid I hear you say Jockie and Maisie are responsible for this?\u201d</p><p>Zane met the old man\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d lost his wife to this ordeal, possibly the greatest loss of anyone on the island. Zane wasn\u2019t sure how to answer him.</p><p>\u201cHow were two locals connected to the bodyguard lady?\u201d Earl asked. \u201cOr the maid of honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Zane answered, mirroring their growing frustration with his own. \u201cAll we know is the target, and that is the information Mr. Stanton is protecting.\u201d</p><p>There was a ruckus from several of the people standing in front of Zane, and when Zane looked over his shoulder, Kelly, Nick, and Emma were there, Jockie Fraser supported between Nick and Kelly. He was unconscious. And very, very bloody. Kelly had really worked him over. Zane was beginning to see the doc in a new light.</p><p>\u201cHas he said anything?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>Kelly shook his head. Nick didn\u2019t much look like he should be supporting anyone\u2019s weight at this point, not even his own, and Emma was having a hard time helping him. They cleared off one of the dining tables, and Zane helped Kelly heft Fraser onto it as Emma and Earl guided Nick to a chair.</p><p>Earl came up beside Zane and looked down at the unconscious Scot on the table, then around at the people gathered and gawking. \u201cSomeone get some rope.\u201d</p><p>Ty took the steps two at a time, racing up to the third-floor nursery. Every step jarred his shoulder, but he knew putting the damn thing back in by himself would just risk permanent damage. He was out of breath and his arm was on fire by the time he reached the door. Deuce and Livi both stood when they heard him coming, their eyes wide and hopeful. They clung to each other as Ty stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cWe found Nick. He\u2019s the one who took the kids. He hid them to keep them safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Livi asked.</p><p>\u201cHe heard the nanny here trying to take Amelia. She was working with the groundskeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJockie?\u201d Livi asked in horror. \u201cBut Maisie and Jockie have lived on this island all their lives! Her mother was my nanny, and his father was the groundskeeper before him. We played with them when we were little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the whys,\u201d Ty said impatiently. \u201cI don\u2019t have any answers yet. All I know is Nick couldn\u2019t tell us where he hid the kids, just that he did, and then he went running to lead Fraser away from them. I need to get into the walls and find them.\u201d</p><p>Livi glanced at the entryway, gaping open beside the fireplace. \u201cDaddy\u2019s men went in there ten minutes ago to look. They said my dad insisted.\u201d</p><p>Ty jerked toward the opening, alarm streaking through him. One Snake Eater had already been proven to be a traitor. And one Snake Eater was dead. How the hell could they trust any of the ones left?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that look, Ty?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>Ty met his brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the fuck to trust out here. I\u2019m at the \u2018shoot first and feel bad later\u2019 stage.\u201d</p><p>Deuce nodded, then brought Livi\u2019s hand up to his lips and kissed it. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Ty thought about arguing, but he knew from the look in Deuce\u2019s eyes that he\u2019d never keep him out of those passages. His baby girl was in there. Ty nodded. \u201cYou take the flashlight. I\u2019ll take the gun.\u201d</p><p>Livi held on to Deuce\u2019s hand when he took a step toward the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m coming too!\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped and watched them, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Deuce opened his mouth to protest, but Livi pointed her finger in his face. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me I can\u2019t come \u2019cause I\u2019m a girl. I\u2019m smaller and more mobile than either of you; you might need me in those passages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say you can\u2019t come because you\u2019re a girl,\u201d Deuce said soothingly. He reached into the passage and grabbed a handful of spiderwebs, complete with desiccated bugs and one very pissed-off spider. He held it up to her face. \u201cI was going to say you can\u2019t come because of this.\u201d</p><p>Livi barely restrained a scream, but she did manage to smack Deuce in the face before hopping away and doing a little \u201cget it off me\u201d dance. \u201cFine!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cHead downstairs so you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Deuce told her, then followed Ty as he ducked into the passage, aiming his powerful flashlight toward the curving stone steps near the exterior wall of the house.</p><p>Ty could already feel himself panicking a little over the closeness of the walls.</p><p>\u201cYou going to be okay in here?\u201d Deuce asked softly.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cIf a bunch of kids can follow a crazy guy with a Boston accent and a gun down here, I can do this.\u201d</p><p>Deuce chuckled almost desperately. When they got to the stairs and Deuce pointed the light down, Ty\u2019s breath left him in a rush. It was so narrow they would both have to turn sideways to get down it. Ty\u2019s shoulders might not even fit. He certainly couldn\u2019t lead with his gun. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be five-finger fucking me,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Deuce patted him encouragingly. If his brother could be calm and supportive when his toddler was down here, in danger, with nothing but a ten-year-old with a gun and this maze of darkness to protect her, then Ty could deal with his claustrophobia.</p><p>He started down the steps, cussing the entire way, scraping rock and dust off the walls with his shoulders, wondering if it would be easier just to miss a step and ride down the damn things like a slide at a waterpark. It was certainly steep enough. The walls were so tight Deuce didn\u2019t even have trouble with his bad leg. All he had to do was flex his arms and the walls held him in place as he took each torturous step.</p><p>It seemed like an eternity until they reached the next floor. The passages went off in three directions. They followed the outer walls, but also went into the heart of the house, probably between two bedrooms.</p><p>Deuce shone the light down each passage, cursing under his breath.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d have kept going down until they couldn\u2019t go anymore,\u201d Ty said, echoing Kelly\u2019s advice.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Nick. Nick always took his sisters to the basement to protect them from his dad. Then he\u2019d go back up and push his dad\u2019s buttons so he\u2019d be the target instead of them. It\u2019s the way he works.\u201d</p><p>Deuce was silent, nodding sadly. They continued down the winding stairs. Ty had to take deep breaths to keep himself calm, but whenever he did, he\u2019d get mouthfuls of dust, cobwebs, and musty air. He had to fight not to start coughing and alert anyone to their presence. Concentrating on the struggle was the only thing keeping him from panicking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eventually they\u2019d have to start making noise, calling out for the kids, risking unfriendlies being drawn to them. The Snake Eaters were down here somewhere, and friend or foe, if they startled those men, blood would be spilled. Ty wanted to go under the radar for as long as possible.</p><p>When they finally reached the bottom of the staircase, there were only two passages to choose from: right or left. Ty should have been able to breathe a sigh of relief, but there wasn\u2019t enough room in the subterranean hallways to even puff out his chest. He closed his eyes, bringing his gun up to rest the cool barrel against the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Deuce asked, his whisper harsh in Ty\u2019s ear.</p> <p>Ty nodded and swallowed past the knot of panic in his throat. \u201cOkay, Nick would have been leading them, acting on instinct,\u201d he muttered, trying to put himself into the mind-set Nick must have been in. He\u2019d rather be in Nick\u2019s mind-set than his own right now anyway.</p><p>\u201cIs he a lefty or a righty?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cLefty, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven no time to think it through, he\u2019d go with his dominant side. He\u2019d choose left.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow, and Deuce shined the light toward his chest so they could see each other.</p> <p>Deuce nodded. \u201cTrust me. Go left.\u201d</p><p>Ty picked the left passage and they hurried down it, trying to be silent and listen. Water dripped, and some unidentifiable banging sound echoed in the distance. It could have been the pipes of the old house, or someone moving on the main level above them, or even the Snake Eaters down here searching.</p><p>When they reached another intersection, the space opened up. It looked as if they were nearing an older part of the house, or maybe even tunnels that predated the mansion. Ty instructed Deuce to shine a light on the stone, and when he did, they stared at it with matching frowns. There was a jagged line of mismatched masonry. The bottom half was smooth, gray stone, worn with time and put together with such precision and skill that no mortar had been used. The top was a mixture of darker rock and brick and mortar.</p><p>\u201cThis looks like ruins from that castle,\u201d Deuce said, running his hand over the bottom half of the stone.</p><p>\u201cOh God. If this was part of the castle complex, these tunnels could go all over the island. Livi said there were lava tubes and caves. They would have used those to connect these things.\u201d</p><p>Deuce put a hand over his mouth, shaking his head.</p> <p>A wave of desperation and fury swept over Ty. He was completely powerless to do anything to help his brother, or any of the people he loved, right now. He had rarely experienced that kind of helplessness, and he didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. \u201cNick couldn\u2019t have taken them far in the time he was down here; they have to be close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they got tired or impatient? What if something scared them and they moved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her back, Deacon. I swear to you.\u201d</p><p>Deuce just nodded, still covering his mouth.</p><p>A voice echoed off the damp walls, and Ty grabbed Deuce\u2019s shoulder and pushed him against the wall, flattening himself beside his brother at the corner of the intersection.</p><p>\u201cShould have been marking these fucking walls!\u201d someone was saying.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re never getting out of here,\u201d another voice commented, sounding calm and collected despite his prophecy of doom.</p><p>The echoes made it impossible to tell, but Ty thought it sounded like English and Frost.</p> <p>He whistled low to get their attention. Their shuffling footsteps halted, and everything went silent. A light played over the walls.</p><p>\u201cIdentify yourself,\u201d English finally called.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Grady.\u201d Ty didn\u2019t step into sight, though. He handed his gun to Deuce and put his finger to his lips. Deuce nodded. \u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We didn\u2019t realize how fucking big these tunnels were down here,\u201d English answered. \u201cThank Christ you\u2019re here, though, do you know where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can lead you out.\u201d Ty put one hand out into the passage to let them know where he was, then carefully stepped out into the light of their flashlights. The three remaining Snake Eaters all looked relieved to see him. None of them made an untoward move, but then, he hadn\u2019t told them where they were yet so it didn\u2019t ease Ty\u2019s suspicions.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help you keep looking for her,\u201d Frost offered.</p><p>Ty nodded, both grateful and still wary. He pointed the way he\u2019d come. \u201cWe\u2019re a straight shot from the stairs up. That way. If you need to get out. Small spaces, man.\u201d He patted his chest, then held his breath, waiting to see if they\u2019d make a move or if they were on the up-and-up.</p><p>English came forward, his light aimed toward the ground. \u201cGot anything to mark it with when we come back this way?\u201d</p><p>Ty breathed a sigh of relief. He wasn\u2019t going to be turning his back on these men anytime soon, especially not with one arm out of commission, but at least for now they\u2019d passed his test. He bent and picked up a small rock, marking on the wall with it. It made a faint chalky line on the stone. Ty did it again harder, trying to make sure they\u2019d see it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back up those stairs,\u201d English said to Frost and Park. He indicated his massive shoulders and arms. \u201cI damn near got stuck coming down them. Maybe we can find an exit on this level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen has an exit,\u201d Deuce said. He turned his flashlight back on and handed Ty his gun. English and Frost both jumped when he spoke, then calmed immediately when they realized it was him. Riddle Park didn\u2019t seem surprised, though. He was hanging back, probably for the same reasons Deuce had been. Ty met English\u2019s eyes, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cI hear you, man,\u201d English said. \u201cCan\u2019t be too careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially since Kline . . .\u201d Frost glanced from Ty to Deuce.</p><p>\u201cThis was her first run with the company,\u201d Park told them. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t us.\u201d</p><p>English was nodding. \u201cShe\u2019s on me and I\u2019ll take responsibility for that. If you don\u2019t want to trust us, I don\u2019t blame you. But these fuckers killed Hardin, and he was our brother. We want this. We\u2019ve got your back on this, Sidewinder.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared into his eyes and saw nothing but truth and anger and pain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss. He died protecting five young lives. Man\u2019s a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes he is.\u201d</p><p>Ty filled them in on what they\u2019d learned, and where they should be searching for Amelia and the other children.</p><p>\u201cWhat about bringing O\u2019Flaherty down here?\u201d Frost asked. \u201cCan\u2019t he lead us to them? Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty winced, hesitant to admit he had knocked their only solid lead unconscious during a fit of anger. \u201cHe was wounded, but when he wakes he\u2019ll be the first one down here searching. The problem is he said he was going so fast, he\u2019s not sure he knows where they are. He also said he gave the oldest boy a gun, so we need to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any more Tangos to be worried about here?\u201d Frost asked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. Fraser\u2019s alive,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cSo we\u2019ll get it out of him. But we have to assume someone else was leading this thing. To be able to reach your girl and turn her, it couldn\u2019t be a local in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Deuce said, his voice shaking. \u201cCan we please find my baby girl?\u201d</p><p>Ty gripped Deuce\u2019s shoulder and squeezed. \u201cWe\u2019ll stick together, when we come to a split, we\u2019ll divide into groups. Cover more ground that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just call to them if they\u2019re down here?\u201d Frost asked.</p><p>\u201cIf someone\u2019s down here looking for them and they answer our calls, there\u2019s no guarantee we get to them first,\u201d English answered before Ty could respond. \u201cWe should look first.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and glanced at Deuce again. \u201cThat\u2019s your call, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my baby girl out there. I\u2019m not letting anyone get to her before I do. We\u2019ll look for them.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave him a curt nod. He hadn\u2019t expected any other answer. He turned to English and the others. \u201cWhat did you see the way you came from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are storage rooms,\u201d Frost answered. \u201cSome of them look like they were once jail cells.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Deuce shared a look. \u201cDefinitely part of the castle complex,\u201d Deuce grumbled.</p><p>\u201cCastle?\u201d English asked. \u201cIt\u2019s on the other side of the island.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cYou see our problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d English snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhat information do we need right now?\u201d Kelly asked Zane. When Fraser had regained consciousness, they\u2019d tied him to a dining chair, and Earl was now standing with a shotgun aimed at his face.</p><p>\u201cWe need to know how many, and who. The whys and hows can come later,\u201d Zane whispered. He was watching Kelly work, fascinated. Kelly was patching Nick\u2019s side up, with Nick laid out on a table, his face turned away from them. The bullet had grazed him, skipping off a rib. It had been just enough to knock him over the edge of the cliff and draw blood, but it hadn\u2019t done any permanent damage. Kelly had cleaned it and was using some sort of skin glue from his medical kit to close it up.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we get what we need from him, I\u2019m going into the walls to find Ty,\u201d Zane told them. \u201cHe\u2019s been gone too long, something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe passages open up when you go down a level,\u201d Nick said, his voice having returned to his usual soothing, sedate tone. \u201cIt\u2019s a maze down there, natural caves and lava tubes mixed with man-made tunnels and rooms. They probably go all the way over to the castle ruins.\u201d</p><p>Zane felt the blood draining from his face. That was a lot of territory to cover. \u201cCan you find those kids, O\u2019Flaherty?\u201d Zane asked, his voice coming out rougher and more accusatory than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>Nick turned his head and met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He sat up when Kelly was done. Kelly had cut his tattered shirt off him, so there was nothing for him to put back on. His green eyes were hard when they landed on Jockie Fraser, and his jaw was set. \u201cGive me five minutes with him first.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked from Nick to their prisoner, who was staring at them with wide eyes. Earl glanced over his shoulder when he heard Nick\u2019s words. He met Zane\u2019s eyes, then nodded. They\u2019d already tried asking him questions. It hadn\u2019t been very effective, with Fraser repeatedly refusing to answer and demanding legal counsel. It was time for a new tack.</p><p>Earl and Zane picked Fraser\u2019s chair up, carrying him between them into the game room next door, where the billiards table took up most of the space. Nick followed them, still shirtless. He grabbed a towel from behind the bar and threw it over his shoulder, then he sat to unlace his shoes and pull them off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Fraser asked when they set his chair down, eyes still wide. Earl checked his bonds, refusing to answer.</p><p>Nick took one of his socks off, then stood and strolled over to the billiard table. He glanced over at Fraser as he reached into one of the pockets, then pulled one of the billiard balls out and dropped it into his sock. His expression stayed completely blank the entire time.</p><p>Fraser began to shake his head. \u201cYou\u2019re insane. You can\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can be avoided if you tell us what we need to know,\u201d Zane said. \u201cWho paid you?\u201d</p><p>Fraser glared at Zane. His hawklike nose was badly broken and his eyes were swelling shut from the beating Kelly had given him.</p><p>\u201cStart talking, Fraser, or I let him at you,\u201d Zane said with a jerk of his head at Nick.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d Fraser spat.</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cI may be.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder at Nick, who was standing and staring at Fraser with the same dead-eyed expression he\u2019d awoken with. \u201cBut he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Earl patted Zane on the shoulder and headed for the door. Zane lingered, giving Fraser a last chance to talk and watching Nick with a sinking feeling in his stomach. Nick met his eyes, letting the heavy billiard ball swing in its sock, demonstrating just how effective it would be as a weapon.</p><p>Fraser jutted his abused chin out, refusing to speak again.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t say anything more before retreating through the door. When he turned to pull it shut, he got a glimpse of Nick standing in front of Jockie Fraser, his feet shoulder-width apart, his bare back covered with a Celtic cross tattoo that followed his spine from the base of his neck to the small of his back. Three whiplike scars crisscrossed his muscular back and shoulders. The makeshift ball and chain hung from his hand, swaying as Nick wrapped the end around his fingers.</p><p>Zane lowered his head and pulled the door shut before the first scream could tear through the great hall.</p><p>Ty turned the corner and almost smacked into a brick wall before Deuce could follow with the flashlight. He held his arm, trying to keep it from throbbing as they stood in the dead end of the corridor, fuming and desperate.</p><p>\u201cBacktrack,\u201d Ty murmured, and they made their way back to the last intersecting corridor. Ty made a large X on the wall, and they continued to retrace their steps.</p><p>\u201cWill you let me at least tie your arm down?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cI need it. It\u2019s fine,\u201d Ty insisted, and he slid his hand into his waistband as a makeshift sling.</p><p>They met up with the other three at what Ty had deemed the crossroads, a large section of tunnel that appeared to have been cut from a natural cavern.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Deuce asked the others. They all answered with negatives, and they all looked sympathetic to Deuce\u2019s increasing desperation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Frost assured him. He even put a hand on Deuce\u2019s arm to offer him a little comfort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty ran his hand through his hair, sucking in a ragged breath as the walls edged closer and closer to him. The weight of the earth pressed down from above. Even though he knew they were no longer under the mansion, they were still under tons and tons of dirt. What if they were under the hill? What if the lighthouse ruins were up there, weighing down, crumbling, threatening the integrity of the stonework?</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he whispered, grasping at his chest.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe, man. We need to double-time this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d English asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s claustrophobic,\u201d Deuce told the others.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s fucking call for them and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, but he looked at Deuce almost desperately.</p> <p>Deuce met his eyes in the light of the flashlights, his jaw jumping. \u201cYou promise me you\u2019ll get to them first.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to them, Deacon, I swear to you. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Deuce handed Ty his flashlight and stepped toward one of the tunnels, cupping his hands around his mouth and calling out for the kids. His voice shook as it echoed through the tunnels.</p><p>Each man held his breath, waiting. The blood was beginning to roar in Ty\u2019s ears when a small voice echoed along the corridor. Deuce gasped.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Ty whispered harshly. He pointed at English. \u201cGo, go!\u201d</p><p>The three men started down the corridor in pursuit of the child\u2019s call. Ty took a moment from his panic to admire their precision. He really hoped none of them turned out to be bad guys, because he liked all three men, and he hated killing people he liked.</p> <p>Deuce tugged Ty\u2019s good arm. \u201cCome on, Ty, hold on a little longer.\u201d</p><p>Ty ran with him, helping Deuce on his bad leg and relying on his brother to lead him through the obscure, cramped spaces.</p><p>A silenced gunshot boomed through the passages ahead of them, followed by shouts and cries that seemed to echo and multiply. Deuce cursed and quickened their pace. Ty had no idea how his leg was keeping up. He supposed the concern of a parent overrode everything else. Their flashlight bounced off beams from the Snake Eaters\u2019 lights, and they came upon all three men taking cover at an intersecting passage. The muffled wailing of a baby came from around the corner.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s shooting?\u201d Ty called.</p><p>\u201cKid shot at us when we tried to open the door,\u201d Frost answered. \u201cThey\u2019re locked up in a room, looks like an old root cellar.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Deuce and nodded for him to go around the corner. \u201cCall out, tell them who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper! It\u2019s Deacon, buddy, we\u2019re here to take you back. Open the door, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty heard the boy\u2019s muffled response through the hole he\u2019d shot in the thick door. \u201cNick told me not to open the door unless someone gave us the password! You might be with someone who\u2019s making you say it\u2019s okay!\u201d</p> <p>Deuce looked back at Ty, eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Nick,\u201d Ty grunted. He closed his eyes against the thought of the narrow passages pressing down on him. \u201cFucking password.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart kid,\u201d English said. He was still crouching against the wall, his gun and flashlight in his hands, his large body stooped and hunched to fit into the narrow corridor.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes. He was beginning to hyperventilate, struggling for the breath to stay calm, to keep his mind clear. He\u2019d never make it out of these fucking tunnels if he didn\u2019t leave soon. Now. They had to get those kids out and moving right now. \u201cCooper, open the door!\u201d he shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s Ty and Deacon, kid, we need to get you back to your parents!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the password?\u201d Cooper shouted back.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Ty hissed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d</p><p>Frost and Park both covered their mouths to muffle their laughter.</p><p>Deuce took Ty\u2019s good arm. \u201cCome on, Ty, you know Nick better than anyone. What fucking password would he give these kids?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, gasping for breath. He groped at the stone walls, searching for something solid. Cool and solid and immovable. Something strong enough to hold up the thousands of pounds of dirt and rock above them. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Deuce grabbed him and pulled him toward the door, grasping Ty\u2019s face in both hands. \u201cBreathe, brother, come on. Calm your mind. Think. Please, Ty, my baby is in there.\u201d</p><p>They could hear Amelia wailing inside the room. The gunshot had come from the silenced weapon Nick had taken off the nanny, but it had still probably been incredibly loud and frightening in that enclosed rock room.</p><p>Enclosed and locked.</p><p>Enclosed, locked, and under tons and tons of rock.</p><p>Ty rested his forehead against the thick wooden door and fought the urge to be sick. Deuce\u2019s hand was on his shoulder, squeezing, keeping him grounded, but his head was swirling with panic and terror.</p><p>What word would Nick give them? One word to let them know they were safe. One word he would trust someone else to say to them in his absence, since he\u2019d fully expected to be killed or at least maimed by Fraser when he left them. One word. One word that, in Nick\u2019s mind, meant everything.</p><p>Ty took in a deep breath. \u201cOohrah.\u201d</p><p>Zane and Kelly sat together on a bench seat in the great hall, watching the door to the game room in silence. The walls were so thick, they couldn\u2019t really hear anything from inside. Zane was thankful for that much.</p><p>\u201cI should be down there helping look for Amelia,\u201d Zane insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou should be right here,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWhen Nick gets answers, we\u2019ll need you here. Ty\u2019s a big boy, he can handle himself.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at him, trying to convince himself Kelly was right. If Fraser gave them information, Zane was the only one who had enough pieces of the puzzle to do anything with it.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cWhen Nick gets answers. You really think he\u2019ll be able to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick has extensive experience with, uh . . . enhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d Kelly said, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alternative set of procedures?\u201d Kelly said, turning his head to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. He wasn\u2019t smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture. Nick was trained to torture.\u201d Kelly returned his gaze to the door, his expression unchanging.</p><p>Zane stared at his profile for several seconds before turning his attention back to the door.</p><p>Darkness had fully set in, but they\u2019d lit every fireplace, candle, hurricane lamp, and lantern they could gather. It made the mansion feel truly gothic, with flames flickering everywhere, shadows being cast in all directions, and the fireplaces crackling and giving off enough warmth to make walking into a room feel like coming in out of the cold.</p><p>Zane would have really enjoyed a blackout like this, in a place like this, if it weren\u2019t for all the dead bodies piling up in the freezer.</p><p>There was a bang and crash from the kitchen, and voices began to echo up the steps. Zane and Kelly both stood and started toward the stairwell, shining flashlights down and holding their guns at the ready.</p><p>The first person to come into sight was John English, a frightened child in each of his massive arms, clinging to his neck. He raised his head when the lights hit him.</p><p>\u201cYou found them, they\u2019re all safe?\u201d Zane blurted, lowering his weapon.</p><p>English nodded and continued up the steps. Frost and Park followed behind him, the two older boys between them. The kids were all smudged with dirt and spiderwebs, their clothes dusty and covered in some sort of white rock dust. But they were all safe.</p><p>English and his Snake Eaters headed for the dining hall, where they could reunite the children with their parents. Deuce and Ty were having a harder time mounting the stairs, mostly because Deuce was clinging to Amelia and refusing to use the hand railing to help him up the steps, and Zane instantly recognized Ty in the throes of a very real panic attack.</p><p>He and Kelly darted down the stairs to assist.</p><p>Deuce refused to let his little girl out of his arms, so Kelly helped him up the steps, taking his weight.</p><p>Once Deuce and Amelia were in safe hands, Ty slid down the stairwell wall and refused to move. Zane knelt in front of him, setting his light on the step above them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, doll,\u201d he whispered. He gently touched Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Ty gasped in breath after breath, shaking his head. He wouldn\u2019t open his eyes, so Zane simply leaned in and kissed him. Ty wrapped his arms around Zane\u2019s neck, clinging to him, unable to even speak.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d made it out of those walls without breaking down completely. He slipped his arm around Ty\u2019s waist and hefted him to his feet. \u201cCome on. Big and open upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s fingers dug into Zane\u2019s shoulder as Zane helped him up the steps. As soon as they made it out of the stairwell, Ty let go of him and awkwardly lowered himself to the ground with one hand, flattening out on the cool marble. He pressed his cheek to the floor and stroked his fingers over the tile. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see you again,\u201d he cooed to it.</p><p>Zane barked a laugh before he could stop himself. \u201cNice to see I was missed.\u201d He bent and put a hand on Ty\u2019s head. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded jerkily, finally opening his eyes. \u201cWe found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Come on.\u201d Zane helped him off the ground and headed for the bench where Kelly was once again sitting. Ty\u2019s steps were wobbly, but he seemed to be shaking the panic off. He always did.</p><p>Zane sat next to Kelly, and Ty stood for a second, his brow knitted in confusion. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for Nick,\u201d Kelly answered. He pointed at the door.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cHe is. I wouldn\u2019t put bets on Jockie Fraser, though.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked from him to the door again. \u201cNick\u2019s in there with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting information,\u201d Kelly provided.</p><p>\u201cOh no. No, no,\u201d Ty murmured. He started for the door.</p><p>\u201cTy, we gave the man a chance to talk,\u201d Zane called after him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Fraser I\u2019m worried about!\u201d Ty shot over his shoulder.</p><p>The door opened before Ty could reach it. He stumbled to a halt in front of Nick. Zane and Kelly both lurched to their feet. Nick stepped out, glancing around the hall and at Ty. He met Kelly\u2019s eyes, then Zane\u2019s, and beckoned them in with a jerk of his head.</p><p>\u201cWe need Earl, too,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Zane frowned in confusion, but turned and called for Earl to join them. They followed Kelly into the room, closing the heavy door behind them.</p><p>Jockie Fraser was slumped in the chair. His face didn\u2019t look any worse than it had when they\u2019d left him in here, but since it had already looked like he\u2019d gone a round with an MMA fighter, that wasn\u2019t saying much.</p><p>His hands, still tied to the arms of the chair, were quite obviously broken. Zane had no doubt there were other injuries they couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>Nick walked up to stand beside and a little behind Fraser\u2019s chair, and Fraser winced away from him with a whimper. Zane stared at him in morbid fascination.</p><p>\u201cTell them what you told me,\u201d Nick ordered.</p><p>\u201cThe man who hired us,\u201d Fraser gasped. He licked his lips and took shallow, rasping breaths like he couldn\u2019t get enough air. \u201cHis name was Burns. Richard Burns.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Nick had known the name would cause a shock wave, but he was so eager to get the hell out of that room and away from the man he\u2019d been questioning, he hadn\u2019t cared about what sort of responses to expect.</p><p>Ty remained motionless, staring at Fraser with the sort of blank expression that said he was rapidly playing through all the possible reactions in his head to find the most appropriate one. Zane and Kelly both made noises of confusion and disbelief. And Earl turned on his heel, storming out of the room under a cloud of curses.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Ty finally whispered.</p><p>Nick lowered his head and started for the door, brushing past Ty as he went. He didn\u2019t intend to be here for the second round of questioning.</p><p>Ty grabbed his elbow and frowned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick glared at him. \u201cNext time you need help, you call Digger.\u201d He stalked out of the room before Ty could respond, and sought out the darkest, most remote corner he could find, treading into territory of the house he hadn\u2019t explored. He didn\u2019t care, though; he just needed to get away from that room and get the blood off his hands. His back hit the wall of the alcove he\u2019d found, and he slid to the ground, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes and curling his fingers through his hair.</p><p>The captain who\u2019d strolled through camp one day fifteen years ago had plucked Nick from the canteen and told him he had extra duty for him. When Nick had learned they wanted him to train with CIA interrogators, he\u2019d flat out refused, insisting he wasn\u2019t cut out for that sort of thing. They\u2019d told him that was the very reason they\u2019d chosen him.</p><p>Well, fuck them. Nick had been right. He wasn\u2019t cut out for it.</p><p>The scuff of a bootheel alerted him to someone near, and he raised his head. His night vision was still ruined, but it didn\u2019t matter. The beam of a flashlight swept across his bare feet.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d Kelly whispered. He came closer, the flashlight remaining on Nick\u2019s feet instead of climbing higher. All Nick could make out was Kelly\u2019s silhouette. He knelt and handed Nick a bundle. \u201cI got you a change of clothes. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and took the shirt. He leaned forward and slipped it on, realizing that he\u2019d been freezing and hadn\u2019t even noticed. His fingers were shaking when he tried to button it up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelly covered them with his own, lowering Nick\u2019s hands into his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered. Then he took both sides of the shirt and pulled Nick toward him. He buttoned the shirt in silence, only meeting Nick\u2019s eyes when he was done. \u201cWe have another night on this island. And there are still a lot of lives in danger. You did what you had to do.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep telling ourselves that, huh?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. Then he took Nick\u2019s hand and helped him off the ground. \u201cGet out of those pants.\u201d</p> <p>Nick managed to huff a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re wet! Pervert.\u201d</p><p>Nick shed the remainder of his wet clothing and changed into the dry garments Kelly had brought him. He hated to admit it, but it felt better just being dry and warm. Kelly took the cuff of Nick\u2019s soaked jeans and wiped at his hands for him, holding the flashlight between his cheek and shoulder so he could see the dirt and blood.</p><p>Nick remained quiet, even when Kelly held his hand and watched his fingers trembling for a few seconds. There was nothing further to say about any of it.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Kelly murmured. \u201cZane had an idea about the computer files. He said he wanted your help.\u201d</p> <p>When they reached the study, they found a fire blazing and giving off enough light to see the darker corners of the room. Zane was seated behind Milton\u2019s laptop. He and Ty were having a heated discussion, one that cut off sharply when Nick and Kelly entered the room.</p><p>\u201cYou found something?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cFraser\u2019s still talking,\u201d Zane told them. \u201cHe said he met with a man in a pub on the mainland a month ago who offered him a million US dollars to do this. He was to recruit Maisie as well. Neither could turn down that kind of money for something they thought would end with a ransom job and everyone returned safely.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat in a chair by the fire, beginning to shiver. Kelly hovered near him, the fire casting odd shadows over the lines of his frown.</p><p>Ty was watching both of them, his expression unreadable. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t know who killed Milton, just that it wasn\u2019t either of them. They had nothing to do with buying his information; their sole purpose was to get to either Stanton or Amelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where Nikki comes in?\u201d Nick guessed. \u201cMilton was her mark?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can only assume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kline?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick glanced up at him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hot, kickass lady you shot in the face,\u201d Kelly provided.</p><p>\u201cThe back of the head, really,\u201d Zane added.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you!\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>\u201cShe was a backup to make sure the others got the job done,\u201d Ty said. \u201cI guess. I don\u2019t know. She thought she was the last man standing and panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurns does like his backups,\u201d Nick said.</p> <p>Ty narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut!\u201d Zane said loudly. \u201cFraser said that the morning Milton\u2019s body was discovered, he did stumble over Maisie and the body. But Maisie told him she\u2019d been slipped a handwritten note under her door in the middle of the night. It told her to go find the body, break the watch, and change the time. If that failed, she was to take it and dispose of it.\u201d</p><p>Nick scowled hard enough that the bruises on his face hurt. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresumably to destroy what they thought was stored info about his past movements. Jockie didn\u2019t know, and he didn\u2019t ask. But he said that before Maisie could change the time, they were interrupted by other staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cThat means if Nikki was in the walls and Maisie was the one who wanted the watch, they were probably the ones who cut Milton open. Dude, talk about nightmare nannies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus. You have no proof of any of that,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cOh, excuse me Mr. I\u2019m Not a Cop Anymore.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes. \u201cSo if Maisie just broke the watch but didn\u2019t change the time, why is it wrong? Did Milton do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only assume the time on Milton\u2019s watch is something he wanted us to know,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThe question is what does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the file number,\u201d Nick realized.</p><p>Zane grinned and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking. Milton left it as a hint in case he didn\u2019t make it. He knew that watch was special, something connected to Burns and even Ty. He knew they\u2019d know that type of watch wouldn\u2019t show the wrong time unless it was set wrong. The only reason it didn\u2019t ping was because Maisie broke it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Burns, where the fuck is he?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cDad has the villagers out with their pitchforks looking for him,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the killers who left that note for Maisie, or they\u2019d have just done it themselves. That was the big kahuna. Burns would sure as shit know to tell Maisie to get rid of that watch, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurns isn\u2019t masterminding these murders, Irish,\u201d Ty snapped.</p><p>\u201cOur job is to get into that file,\u201d Zane said with a pointed look at Ty. He turned his attention to Nick. \u201cI think the file number he used for this information was also the code to his part of the DOD info. What was the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201c3:48,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re six-digit file names.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou want me to remember the seconds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have your iPad with the pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know what happened to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen yeah, I want you to remember the seconds,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Nick glanced at Kelly, incredulous. Kelly shrugged and tapped his temple. \u201cYou were obsessing about it. You know what time it said.\u201d</p><p>Nick snapped his mouth closed and leaned forward, resting his chin on his hand. \u201cIt looked like a smiley face,\u201d he finally said. He stood and took a clock off the mantle. \u201cTen, maybe. Give or take five seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I can work with.\u201d Zane turned back to the computer, stretching his shoulders before beginning to type. He was at it for almost ten minutes, long enough for Ty to get twitchy and start pacing, for Kelly to lay himself out on the couch, and for Nick\u2019s mind to travel back to the sound of a billiard ball cracking ribs and a man begging for mercy.</p><p>\u201cFound it,\u201d Zane finally announced. \u201cIt was military time. Fifteen, not three.\u201d</p><p>They crowded around his seat, all of them trying to see the computer screen. Dozens and dozens of files were contained in the password-protected folder. As Zane clicked from one to the next, they began to tell the story of what Milton had been involved in, and what he\u2019d been trying to do on the island.</p><p>There was evidence and documentation of all the threats Stanton had received. Evidence that Amelia was indeed a target. Evidence that someone intended to hit them at Livi and Deuce\u2019s wedding. There were photos of Nikki Webb and her true identity, her fake passports, and several jobs she\u2019d been suspected of being involved with. She was a professional hitter.</p><p>\u201cThis says she always works alone, never with a partner. Why\u2019d she change up her MO?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cA million-dollar payday will do that,\u201d Ty reasoned.</p><p>The files had nothing listed on her partner, though. Whomever she had been spotted on the beach with was still a ghost. Still on the island. Still a threat.</p><p>Milton related in a document that he intended to engage Nikki by agreeing to sell her the information she was after, and then take her out. Obviously, things hadn\u2019t gone to plan. Milton hadn\u2019t been expecting a second person at their meeting.</p><p>\u201cExplains the crack to the back of his head,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>There were communications from Richard Burns, labeled with shorthand that Nick recognized as meaning a third party had provided the information. They detailed three of Stanton\u2019s island staff who were involved and warned that the two groups might be controlled by the same people, and therefore aware of each other and able to join forces if need be.</p><p>\u201cBurns knew all this was coming,\u201d Nick said through gritted teeth. He turned and shoved at Ty. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t he tell Deacon to cancel this shit?\u201d</p><p>Ty was speechless, still staring at the screen in disbelief. \u201cBurns isn\u2019t responsible for this.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned away, shaking his head. Kelly moved with him, patting his stomach like he was trying to keep him calm. Nick knew, though, that Kelly had determined over years of practice that the best way to keep Nick from attacking was to grab him right around the hips and upend him before he could get going. Kelly wasn\u2019t comforting him, necessarily, he was just preparing to put him on his ass if he lost it.</p><p>And he was damn well about to lose it.</p><p>Zane could see the warning signs, he just didn\u2019t know what the hell to do about them. Before coming here and spending more time with Nick and Kelly, he hadn\u2019t even known Nick was capable of losing his temper, much less the many and sundry things he\u2019d demonstrated tonight. He really was more like Ty than Zane had ever guessed. Looking between the two of them, at the two friends squaring off against each other, at the rock and the hurricane, Zane couldn\u2019t guess who would win the coming fight. He didn\u2019t want to find out, either.</p><p>\u201cSomething bigger\u2019s going on here, Ty, something it sure as hell looks like Dick Burns knew was coming. If he didn\u2019t plan it all to begin with!\u201d Nick hissed. He pointed toward the staircase. \u201cNow either you go up there, find him, and find out what the hell it is, or I will!\u201d</p><p>Instead of bellowing back at him, Ty put his hands up in appeasement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Nick snarled.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and nodded. \u201cOkay, just calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of being calm,\u201d Nick said, his voice dropping to a measured murmur. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being used. This ends tonight, whether by your hand or mine.\u201d</p><p>Zane was of the opinion that Nick was far more threatening when he was cool and composed than when he was shouting. Kelly seemed to agree; he took a careful step away from them, moving to stand beside Zane.</p><p>\u201cJust give it the night, okay?\u201d Ty tried. \u201cEveryone is safe right now. The ferry comes tomorrow, and then we\u2019ll have time to deal with everything, figure this shit out. Just one night of peace for everyone before we go demanding answers and stirring shit up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne night of peace?\u201d Nick repeated incredulously. \u201cSix people are dead! We\u2019re investigating this bullshit on an island in the middle of fucking nowhere because we\u2019re trapped here! There are people panicking all over the fucking place, all the weapons are still missing, and we are one pig\u2019s head on a stick away from Lord of the Flies! A night of peace went out the fucking window when we landed, Beaumont!\u201d</p><p>Zane was pretty sure Nick was going to have a stroke if Ty opened his mouth one more time. He and Kelly both moved closer, prepared to break up yet another argument between them.</p><p>\u201cBurns may still have you like a puppy on a leash, Ty, but I\u2019m not his fucking golden retriever. National security or not, family or not, we have to get answers from him. We fucking deserve answers from him, everyone on the island does.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s nostrils flared and he pointed a finger in Nick\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t even pretend this is about closure for these people, that this isn\u2019t about your beef with Burns,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019d gladly lock that bastard up and throw away the key. Far as I\u2019m concerned, if it weren\u2019t for him, Eli would still be alive and I wouldn\u2019t have a box of his things sitting on my boat that I\u2019m still afraid to go through!\u201d</p><p>Ty took a step toward him. Nick put a hand on his chest, pushing him back. He held up his finger like a parent scolding a small child, daring Ty to come at him again.</p><p>\u201cEli was loyal!\u201d Ty shouted. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t left us, if you\u2019d stuck with us instead of crawling home with your tail between your legs, maybe he\u2019d have had someone watching his back and he\u2019d still be here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kelly said. He grabbed Zane\u2019s sleeve to stop him from moving to interfere. \u201cNope. He\u2019s going to get what he deserves now.\u201d</p><p>Nick grabbed Ty\u2019s jacket and pulled until they were almost nose to nose. \u201cDid you ever stop and think, Ty, if you had listened to what I was saying then, listened to what I was trying to tell you about Burns and his fucking job offers, none of it would have gone down the way it did?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s jaw tightened. He began to shake his head, and Nick let him go, shoving him away.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t,\u201d Nick snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s never on you, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty still looked furious, but Zane could see something else creeping into his expression: the realization that Nick might be right.</p><p>\u201cEli was loyal. He could have taught you a thing or two about it,\u201d Nick said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, O\u2019Flaherty!\u201d Ty shouted. \u201cI know what loyalty is, and that man is like a father to me! If you had a father you gave a shit about, you\u2019d be doing the same thing!\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s jaw clenched and he took a step back, putting himself out of Ty\u2019s reach. Or perhaps putting Ty out of his reach. His next words were whispered. \u201cI\u2019m tired of risking my life for you, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty staggered back as if Nick had shoved him. He couldn\u2019t form a response even as Nick turned and stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him and rattling the ancient glass panes in the windows. They watched him go, all of them stunned into silence.</p><p>Kelly shifted his weight, and the floorboard creaked under his boot. Ty tore his eyes away from the doorway to blink at Kelly and then Zane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh God, did I really just say that?\u201d Ty asked, voice hushed.</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat, looking indecisive. He finally took a step for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll go after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty held out a hand. \u201cNo, I . . . I\u2019ll go talk to him.\u201d</p> <p>He stood rooted to the spot for a few more seconds before he seemed to work up the courage to head for the door. He closed it gently behind him, leaving Zane and Kelly in the uncomfortable silence left behind.</p><p>Kelly glanced at Zane and smiled weakly. \u201cGood times, huh?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cI hope Nick kicks his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Kelly frowned. \u201cMaybe we should . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow them?\u201d Zane provided. \u201cYeah, definitely.\u201d</p> <p>Ty found Nick sitting on the very edge of the cliff, perched on a rocky outcropping that didn\u2019t threaten to shoot him over the edge like the grassy parts did, his feet dangling over the side. Ty hesitated to move closer, finally fighting past his innate fear of falling in order to edge up to the cliff and sit. He settled down beside Nick, gravity pulling at his legs, the cold rock beneath him threatening to pitch him over the edge to the rocky sea below.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t guess we could have a heart-to-heart somewhere less likely to end in you pushing me off a cliff, could we?\u201d he asked wryly.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t answer. He was gazing past his own feet at the whitecaps glowing in the moonlight.</p><p>Ty was finding it hard to breathe against the tightness in his chest. They\u2019d had their fights over the years, some of them just as nasty as the words they\u2019d exchanged minutes ago. Nick always gave as good as he got, though, so him just walking away scared Ty. Truly scared him. Everything about Nick had felt different since they\u2019re returned home from deployment, and Ty didn\u2019t know what to do about it.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as it came out of my mouth, I tried to take it back,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Nick lifted his head and sighed.</p> <p>\u201cYour father doesn\u2019t deserve for you to care. I know that, Nick. I know that. And you\u2019ve always been there for me, even when you probably should have told me to go fuck myself.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t respond. He ducked his head again and swiped his hand over his chin.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Ty tried. \u201cI know what you\u2019ve done. I know what you are. I was . . . are you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, Tyler,\u201d Nick said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known that from the start. That\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve stayed friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re both assholes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You really think anything you say can hurt my feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been a very good friend to you,\u201d Ty said, almost choking on the sentiment. \u201cNot nearly as good as you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Nick finally looked at him. \u201cYou earned my loyalty when you sat beside me on that bus to Parris Island. And every day after. So the times you want to be a complete cockholster like tonight, I tend to overlook it.\u201d</p><p>Ty tried hard not smile. He snorted quietly, then bit his lip so he wouldn\u2019t laugh. \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence, both staring out at the water, both knowing the conversation wasn\u2019t done. When Nick spoke again, he didn\u2019t preface it with anything, not even an audible inhalation.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop drinking in front of Zane.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded slowly. \u201cI realized that the other night. Did he say something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s hard for him regardless, and you\u2019re a sloppy drunk.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded again. It wasn\u2019t anything he didn\u2019t already know or hadn\u2019t told himself. He\u2019d needed to hear it from someone else, though. Nick had always been good at that.</p><p>The silence threatened to return when Nick chose not to expound on his advice. When he spoke again, he changed tacks faster than Ty usually did.</p><p>\u201cMy dad is dying.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him, struggling with his immediate reaction to the news. Finally, he just went with it. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cThat was my first thought, too.\u201d</p><p>Understanding finally dawned on Ty. \u201cAnd you been feeling guilty ever since, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll always feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what\u2019s been going on with you? I know you have Kelly now, but . . . if you need to talk about it, I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs a new liver,\u201d Nick said, still staring off into the water. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the only one in the family who might be a match to his blood type and size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants a part of your liver?\u201d Ty blurted. \u201cWell, fuck him!\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed.</p><p>Ty wavered between outrage and fear. \u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do it,\u201d Nick started, his voice low and calm like it almost always was, \u201cI might as well be putting a gun to his head and pulling the trigger. That\u2019ll be on me, not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one would blame you.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t answer. He stared off into the night for several minutes. Both of them were silent. Then Nick lowered his head and brought his hand up to his eyes. His broad shoulders slumped like he was finally bending under a huge weight, and he gasped for air.</p><p>Ty scrambled closer to him, the cliff\u2019s edge always in the back of his mind, and put his arm around Nick. Nick collapsed into him, and Ty cradled his head against his chest, beginning the rocking motion that always brought him comfort when he needed it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time one of them had held the other when he broke down like this, and it probably wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>Ty patted Nick\u2019s hair and rested his chin on top of his head. Nick had stood like a rock in a tempest his entire life, rain beating at him, the tides trying to carve away his soul, the relentless howl of the wind always at his shores. But Nick was the first to smile, the first to laugh, the first to joke. He was the first to put his shoulder to yours when the storm came calling.</p><p>He deserved more than a family who turned their backs on him. More than a lifetime of second best. And he damn well deserved more from Ty than to be merely an afterthought when Ty needed help.</p><p>The more Ty thought of it, of the way Nick\u2019s smile could light an entire room despite how broken he had always been, the angrier he became. His body began to tremble and he held Nick tighter. Tears came unbidden to his eyes and he hung his head, ashamed to realize he wasn\u2019t worthy of the loyalty Nick had always given him. He would never be worthy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he gasped. He ignored the tears and kept talking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been a shitty friend. And I\u2019m sorry about Eli. If we\u2019d listened to you, then he\u2019d still be alive. You were right, and I\u2019m so goddamned sorry he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Ty,\u201d Nick said, his voice muffled by his own tears and Ty\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou were right then, and you\u2019re right now about talking to Burns. I\u2019ll go with you, okay? We\u2019ll talk to him together.\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed a breath and sniffed. \u201cYou better not be getting snot in my hair,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Their laughter was a pitiful mixture of sniffles and snickers. It was the only way either of them knew to combat the pain and sadness.</p><p>\u201cListen, your dad . . . I don\u2019t want you to do it because you\u2019re my brother, and I love you, and you deserve to live your own life.\u201d Ty cupped Nick\u2019s face between both hands. His voice was stronger when he spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent your whole life trying to prove to yourself that you\u2019re a good man. Well, you are. I may not be one, but I know one when I see him, and you\u2019re the best there is. So don\u2019t you dare go off and risk yourself for him if you\u2019re just trying to prove that to yourself again, you understand? I don\u2019t want you to do it. But if you do, I\u2019ll be right there with you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave a single nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d Ty met his eyes for a few more seconds, then released him and sat straighter. He wiped at his face, still sniffing. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Nick grunted, smacking Ty\u2019s chest with the back of his hand. \u201cIs that a boat?\u201d</p><p>Ty wiped his eyes again. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t see anything \u2019cause I\u2019m crying like a little bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boat,\u201d Nick insisted.</p><p>Ty squinted out over the water. He heard footsteps coming up behind them and turned to see Zane and Kelly approaching carefully. Nick scrambled to his feet and put his hand under his nose, shielding his night vision from the reflection of the moon off the waves.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the bigger launches. The tides are pushing it back in.\u201d</p><p>Ty finally made out the flashing, bobbing emergency beacon of the boat Nick had spotted. \u201cThat\u2019s a long way out, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you swim that?\u201d Zane asked as he came to stand beside Ty.</p><p>\u201cWe sure as fuck can. We\u2019ll need wet suits,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no,\u201d Kelly said. Nick peered at him. Kelly crossed his arms. \u201cFuck no. You wait until daylight to swim that shit or I\u2019m not patching you up from the hypothermia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess than thirty hours before the ferry\u2019s due,\u201d Zane reminded them. \u201cNo need for drastic measures yet, okay?\u201d</p><p>They all nodded, though Nick seemed reluctant. He stared off at the blinking lights until Kelly grabbed his arm and pulled him away. \u201cCome on. They\u2019ll be getting dinner together soon. We need to eat or we might start getting pissy with each other. We wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted and let Kelly pull him. Ty and Zane watched them walk away. They both had their heads down, watching their footing, and Kelly soon snaked his hand around Nick\u2019s waist. Nick threw an arm over his shoulders, and it was like the most natural thing in the world for both of them. Ty still wasn\u2019t quite processing the two of them as a couple, but nothing about them felt wrong when he watched them like this.</p><p>Zane tapped his shoulder. \u201cCan we please move the fuck away from this cliff?\u201d</p><p>Ty scooted backward, then crawled until he felt he was a safe distance away before taking to his feet. Zane laughed at him the whole time.</p><p>\u201cBastard knows I\u2019m scared of heights,\u201d Ty mumbled. He brushed at his knees and then his ass, but the wet grass had soaked through his jeans. They started off toward the gardens and the mansion beyond.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he mean when he said you earned his loyalty on the bus to Parris Island?\u201d Zane asked quietly.</p><p>Ty sighed in the darkness. \u201cYou heard the whole thing?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged apologetically. \u201cWe were afraid someone would get tossed off the cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValid.\u201d They walked in silence for a few seconds before Ty cleared his throat. \u201cWhen we were loaded onto the bus for Basic, we were all pretty much young and stupid and scared, you know? Kids from all different places, all different backgrounds. Some of them were nervous and chatty, some of them were too scared to talk. There were a couple loners who we all kind of pegged as guys who wouldn\u2019t make the psych cut.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I saw Nick. Big kid, you know? I mean he\u2019s a big guy now, but he was already almost that size to start with. Most of us at seventeen or eighteen, we could fit three to a fucking bus seat. The red hair and the green eyes, he was kind of hard to miss. He was sitting on a bench, ramrod straight. A couple guys were kind of poking fun at him for trying to pretend he was already a Marine with the posture. And a bunch of us had noticed he had a black eye, but his knuckles weren\u2019t bruised. They were on him because he\u2019d obviously been in a fight but hadn\u2019t fought back or even defended himself.\u201d</p><p>Ty had to stop and shake the memory a little before he could continue. It still made him angry. Zane was silent, letting him gather his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThrough all that shit they were talking, Nick never said a word. He just sat there and watched them. He didn\u2019t look angry. He didn\u2019t look amused. He was just . . . sitting there, blank. And for some reason I was fascinated by it, so I watched him. I mean, one look at him and you could tell Nick was a hardass. I remember thinking, this is someone with restraint. This is someone who\u2019ll take a punch to the face and walk away instead of brawling. This is someone I need to know, because I knew I\u2019d never be that kind of person. And the more shit he took, the angrier I got for him. So when we loaded onto the bus, I made sure I sat beside him.\u201d He began to laugh with the memory. \u201cI had to shove a kid and tell him to keep moving to get to the seat, and I just plopped my happy ass next to him.\u201d</p><p>Zane smirked. \u201cI can imagine what that looked like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the look he gave me when I sat, like, \u2018Oh my God, who is this idiot and why is he smiling?\u2019 I introduced myself, shook his hand. And I realized, the way he reached for my hand, that the reason he\u2019d been sitting like he had was because his ribs were hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Zane sounded as angry as Ty had been back then. \u201cHis dad?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cA parting gift for abandoning the family to go play hero when he should have been going to work and earning money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope Nick lets him rot,\u201d Zane said under his breath.</p><p>Ty nodded his agreement. He knew it probably wouldn\u2019t happen, though, because Nick wouldn\u2019t be able to live with himself if he didn\u2019t do what he could to save someone, even someone as evil as his own father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyway. One of the guys sitting in front of us turned around to say something and I told him to shut the fuck up and turn back around before he got a handful of something he wasn\u2019t ready for. Nick told me later it was the first time someone had stood up for him just because they could. Ever. First time in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he says you earned his loyalty when you sat down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. When I asked him who\u2019d broken his rib, he said his father. When I pointed at his knuckles and asked why he hadn\u2019t hit back, he told me he had. But he\u2019d used a baseball bat.\u201d Ty smiled when he remembered the silence that had come over the kids sitting around them, eavesdropping. There had been no mistaking Nick\u2019s tone for a joke, but Ty had laughed his ass off at the time. \u201cI just told him I liked his style, and we were inseparable after that. When I got news that Deuce had been in his wreck, I was . . . Nick was the one who kept me from going AWOL. We looked out for each other, had each other\u2019s six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou two going to be okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty said without giving it even a second of thought. \u201cI need to do better by him.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the patio of the mansion, they found a lot of activity going on, much more than could be justified by the tail end of dinner or the fact that someone had partially repaired the generators. As they stepped into the circle of light cast by the landscape lighting, Nick came jogging out to them, Kelly on his heels.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Nick grimaced, trying to catch his breath. \u201cRichard Burns is dead.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>They tried to keep Ty out of the room, but he bulled his way past all three of them, so they just followed him in, hanging back. Earl was there, refusing to leave. Richard Burns was sprawled on the floor. There was no blood, no obvious injuries or signs of violence on his body. The room, however, hadn\u2019t come through unscathed. Tables were overturned, pictures and lamps had been knocked to the floor, even a small chaise lounge had been tumbled over and crashed into a wall.</p><p>The stone walls were so thick throughout the mansion that no one had heard what seemed to have been a pretty epic battle.</p><p>The electricity was working again in parts of the mansion, including this room. Ty didn\u2019t know how, and he didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cHis neck\u2019s been broke,\u201d Earl told Ty. His voice was gruff. He knelt beside Burns\u2019s body, holding the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cDad . . .\u201d Ty took a few halting steps and stopped again. His knees went weak, and he would have sunk to the floor if a strong arm hadn\u2019t wrapped around him.</p> <p>He gripped Zane\u2019s shirt, clinging to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Earl\u2019s eyes traveled over all four men. \u201cLook around this room,\u201d he said, his voice full of gravel and anger. \u201cTell me what happened. And then find out who did this.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, his breath coming harder, his focus narrowing down to nothing but the body on the ground.</p><p>Kelly knelt by the body. \u201cMay I, sir?\u201d he said to Earl.</p><p>Earl refused to let go of Burns\u2019s hand, but he nodded. Kelly began to check the body over. Zane left Ty where he stood, moving to search the room along with Nick. Ty finally tore his attention away from the body of his adopted uncle and began to scour the room too.</p><p>Burns had obviously fought against his attacker. He\u2019d fought with all the skill and knowledge he\u2019d acquired in his years. Someone had still managed to take him out, and for that they\u2019d either been very good, caught Burns when his guard was down, or both.</p><p>Anger and grief boiled deep in Ty\u2019s gut. He could barely concentrate on the crime scene. Zane and Nick had made a round of the room and returned to the body, hovering over Kelly as they waited for his report. Ty could find nothing but the obvious signs of a struggle in the room. If they had actual crime scene equipment, they might be able to do something with this, but no visual evidence had been left behind. In a fight like this, something should have been left behind.</p> <p>Ty swallowed hard. \u201cIt was a pro.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sat back on his heels, sighing and glancing up at Nick and Zane. \u201cHe\u2019s been dead for hours. Probably right after he left your interview with him.\u201d</p><p>Ty was still moving around the periphery of the room, unable to look back at them. He couldn\u2019t see Richard Burns on the ground like that.</p><p>\u201cCould it have been Kline?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cShe certainly had the capability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know there\u2019s at least one more out there, a guy. The man we saw on the beach,\u201d Zane reminded them.</p><p>\u201cCould that have been Fraser?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t and . . . I believe him,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever tell the truth when it was us?\u201d Ty asked him.</p><p>Nick gave him a negligent shrug. \u201cA man like Fraser hasn\u2019t exactly been trained for what I put him through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a medical examiner,\u201d Kelly announced, trying to cut the tension, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty sure his neck was snapped.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to Burns\u2019s chin, refraining from lifting it off the floor. They had to get down on the ground to see what he was talking about. Ty moved closer, looking almost sideways in an attempt to see but not see. There were bruises where Kelly was indicating, like someone had taken his chin and jerked it.</p><p>\u201cThe positioning\u2019s all wrong,\u201d Nick murmured. He was on his hands and knees beside Kelly, tilting his head to see.</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cEither it wasn\u2019t someone with training, or Burns fought like hell and fucked up their hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the person was injured,\u201d Zane pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBurns was a large man,\u201d Nick added. \u201cAvery Kline would\u2019ve had a time of this too, no matter how skilled she was. Trying to snap someone\u2019s neck when they\u2019re a foot taller than you isn\u2019t exactly easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would explain why she panicked and made that move on Stanton,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Earl was glaring at both men. \u201cI ain\u2019t hearing any answers from you two, just a bunch of maybes.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Zane both glanced at him guiltily before going back to their examination. Earl got to his feet and paced a few steps, his eyes meeting Ty\u2019s. He stopped in front of him, then put his arm around Ty\u2019s shoulders, releasing him quickly when Ty winced away, holding his dislocated shoulder. Earl took his good arm again, and Ty was forced to look at the body of Richard Burns.</p><p>Earl pointed at him. \u201cLook at that man, son.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at his father for a few moments, then turned his eyes to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI met him on a helicopter going into the jungle, Ty. You know what that is?\u201d Earl grabbed Ty\u2019s shirt front, pulling him closer to whisper in his ear. \u201cThat\u2019s Nick on the ground, Beaumont. You go fucking find who did this, and you kill him.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at the men kneeling. At the body on the floor. His stomach turned at the thought of any of these men in Burns\u2019s place, lying dead on the floor, murdered. He remembered the anguish of standing at Elias Sanchez\u2019s funeral, of carrying that casket. He remembered the desperate need for revenge.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Earl stormed out of the room. He had to go somewhere and grieve, somewhere to be away from the body of his oldest and dearest friend. And to deal with guilt, because he\u2019d spent the past several hours enraged over the things he\u2019d learned about Burns.</p><p>The Grady family would never be the same after this loss.</p><p>Zane clambered to his feet and came to Ty, taking him by his good arm. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said into Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty shook his head, his nostrils flaring and his focus narrowing to a pinpoint. \u201cSomeone else was behind this, Zane. Someone else was orchestrating this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ty, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else did all this!\u201d Ty shouted, jabbing his finger at Burns\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cTyler,\u201d Nick barked. \u201cGet your ass in gear and go!\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded woodenly, moving to obey that tone of voice almost automatically. Zane stayed with him, fingers digging into his arm.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Zane asked as soon as they were on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThey killed him, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane stopped halfway down the steps and pulled him closer. \u201cI know.\u201d He turned Ty to him, making sure he met his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken a lot of hits in the last few days, Ty. Let me take this last one for you.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, struck breathless, struck speechless. He snaked his arm around Zane\u2019s neck and hugged him tight. He nodded, still unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll round up everyone physically capable of doing this,\u201d Zane murmured against Ty\u2019s hair, \u201cand we\u2019ll find out who it is even if we have to take Nick\u2019s ball and chain to every one of them.\u201d</p><p>There were a great deal of complaints when Ty and Zane gathered every able-bodied person in the dining room and frog-marched them into the study, but the weapons they wielded and the look in Ty\u2019s eyes were enough motivation to get everyone moving and keep them cooperating.</p><p>There were two groomsmen: Christian and Matthew. Three bridesmaids: Catalina, Miyoko, and Ashlee. Livi\u2019s brother, Theo, and Emma\u2019s cameraman, Marley. Mackie and Hamish Boyd were the only two staff members who remained, since Fraser was still tied up in the game room. And Ty had somehow convinced the three Snake Eaters to come peacefully. Zane didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d built that rapport, but he was grateful he didn\u2019t have to wrestle John English through a door he didn\u2019t want to go through.</p><p>Twelve suspects.</p><p>Several others joined them to help keep order, and to help parse the evidence. Stanton, Earl, Mara, and Chester were there, as was Emma, who was still protesting Marley\u2019s inclusion in the suspect pool. Deuce and Livi had left Amelia with Livi\u2019s mother, Susan, and come to be part of the meeting. Nick and Kelly soon came into the room as well. Several of the people who\u2019d heard Jockie Fraser\u2019s screams shied away from Nick when he entered the room.</p><p>Zane moved toward the corner, nodding for Nick to join him. \u201cGot anything we can cull the herd with?\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him for a few seconds. \u201cI never realized how disturbing your accent is until you use cow analogies.\u201d</p><p>Zane fought hard to keep his face as deadpan as Nick\u2019s. \u201cYeah okay, say car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. Kelly narrowed down time of death to a six-hour window, but he wants to make sure everyone knows he\u2019s essentially guessing. Considering the last time Burns was seen was six hours ago, I\u2019m going to back him on his assessment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zane huffed.</p><p>\u201cHe told me that when he and Ty went looking for Burns, Earl said he hadn\u2019t seen him since his talk with you and me. So . . . it\u2019s probably safe to say he went to his room and someone was waiting there for him.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cNo one could have knocked on Burns\u2019s door and surprised him. You\u2019re right, they would have had to\u2019ve been lying in wait. Okay, let\u2019s see what we can shake loose.\u201d He gave Nick\u2019s shoulder a pat and stepped away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Ashlee Knight demanded. Zane knew her only as the bombshell from Nick\u2019s notes. She certainly looked the part.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been one last murder,\u201d Zane announced.</p><p>There was a murmur of shock and alarm, but at least half the people in the room looked like they just wanted to go to bed. Death was no longer traumatic for the island.</p><p>Zane glanced at Nick and Ty, holding his breath. They had so little to go on, he was going to have to bluff his way through this. He hoped they would play along.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve captured or killed all the people responsible for this massacre, all but one,\u201d he said to the people crowded into the room. \u201cThe ladies in the room can relax, the killer we\u2019re looking for is a man.\u201d</p><p>The three bridesmaids shared relieved, frightened glances before going to sit on a chaise near the far wall, holding each other\u2019s hands and leaning on each other in a huddle.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying the killer you\u2019re looking for is in this room right now?\u201d Christian Orr asked. He\u2019d been introduced to Zane as Deuce\u2019s best friend from Philadelphia.</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell hope so,\u201d Zane drawled.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mathew Ferguson shouted. He glanced to the wall, where Deuce stood amongst the other observers. \u201cDeacon, are you serious right now? You\u2019ve known me since we were freshmen in undergrad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust roll with it, Matt,\u201d Deuce told him. \u201cThey\u2019re good, they\u2019ll find out who did this. You got nothing to worry about. Unless you killed someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell!\u201d Matthew shouted, but he remained seated.</p><p>Zane stepped into the corner for another refrain, beckoning Ty, Nick, and Kelly with him. A buzz of nervous conversation started up behind them. \u201cWho the hell do we like for this?\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Kelly shook his head. \u201cI want to see if I\u2019m right, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to take bets, don\u2019t you?\u201d Nick asked, voice flat.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and rubbed his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat we really need is a confession,\u201d Nick said to Zane. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything but hunches here. We need someone to stand up and say they did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that all?\u201d Zane glared at Nick as he moved away again. The other three remained in the corner, watching him.</p><p>Zane considered the remaining suspects. Nine now. Three military men trained in the art of combat. Two old men who\u2019d worked on the island all their lives, one who\u2019d lost his wife to this mess. Three privileged, well-educated males from Pennsylvania, one of whom had everything to gain from his father\u2019s death or downfall. And then there was Marley, the adventuring cameraman Emma Grady was willing to vouch for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNick, how long ago was Fraser contacted?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree weeks. And Livi, you met Nikki Webb when?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo months ago.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Emma, narrowing his eyes. \u201cWhen did your team get shelved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month ago. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Deuce ask you to bring your cameraman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week, when he invited me to the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>Zane nodded, narrowing his eyes at Marley King.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes grew wider and he pointed to himself. \u201cI\u2019m a vegetarian,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t kill things. Hell, I don\u2019t even like cutting my grass, man. That fresh-cut grass smell? That\u2019s plants in distress!\u201d</p><p>Kelly moved closer to Zane, lowering his head and crossing his arms. \u201cBurns\u2019s knuckles were fucked up, man. Whoever he fought with would have bruises starting to show. See if any of them are wearing makeup.\u201d</p><p>Zane peered at him. \u201cMakeup?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded, completely serious.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it was Kline?\u201d</p> <p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cGot to start somewhere, right?\u201d</p><p>Zane took a deep breath. \u201cAnyone got any makeup remover on them?\u201d</p><p>Catalina Cruz raised her hand, as did Ashlee, who was sitting beside her. They dug in their purses and produced several disposable wipes. Kelly collected them with murmured thank-yous, then turned to Marley as he took one of the wipes out of its packet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing makeup,\u201d Marley told them, chuckling nervously. He waved a hand at his face. \u201cNobody on this island can match this perfect skin tone.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was smiling, but he still gave Marley\u2019s face a few swipes. He examined the wipe, then showed it to Zane.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re free to go, Mr. King,\u201d Zane said. He was pleased, because he really liked Emma\u2019s cameraman.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking serious with this?\u201d Theo Stanton asked. \u201cMakeup remover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone want to confess and make this go faster?\u201d Nick asked. He was leaning against a side table near the door, arms crossed over his chest.</p> <p>John English stepped forward. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ll volunteer to get my damn face wiped off next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Matthew and Christian said in unison.</p><p>Zane caught English throwing Ty a wink and a smirk. He knew what needed to happen here, and it seemed he was helping out. Ty appeared to trust the man, so Zane would as well. For now. If he threw Ty another wink they\u2019d be having problems, though.</p><p>Kelly went to each man, wiping their faces with the makeup remover wipes. When he approached Theo, the man stood and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not touching me with that.\u201d</p><p>Kelly cocked his head, and a slow smile developed on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Ty asked Theo. \u201cAllergies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s called civil rights, and I have them. I haven\u2019t killed anyone, Jesus Christ.\u201d He waved imploringly to his father and sister. \u201cThis is ridiculous, you both know I\u2019d never do this to our family!\u201d</p><p>Nick cleared his throat. \u201cKelly, put him down.\u201d</p><p>Kelly moved with shocking speed, wrapping Theo up and pinning his arm. Then he stepped between Theo\u2019s legs, turned, and dropped to his knees, letting gravity hurl Theo over his shoulder and flatten him on the floor.</p><p>Theo lay gasping for breath, shocked into immobility. Livi screamed, and Stanton shouted a wordless protest, but no one else moved.</p><p>Zane stepped forward and pulled his gun, pointing it at Theo\u2019s face. \u201cHow about you answer some questions the easy way, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded, still gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cIf company secrets were sold, what would happen to the company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d lose the DOD contracts. Shareholders would start selling off left and right. We\u2019d be forced to liquidate everything in the following year. In eighteen months, we\u2019d be bankrupt.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced over his shoulder at Stanton.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were part of this, I would be digging my own financial grave. The company\u2019s worth billions of dollars; no rival could offer me enough money to give that up, much less betray my family,\u201d Theo said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Zane relaxed and stuffed the gun back into his pants. He and Kelly helped Theo up. \u201cNext time just let him wipe your damn face,\u201d Zane said. He gave Theo a shove toward his family and turned to the remaining suspects.</p><p>Hamish Boyd pushed to his feet, using his cane to make his way toward Zane. \u201cIf you are truly considering me or Mackie as suspects over these hired thugs, you must be a sad example of a Yank policeman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s me,\u201d Nick broke in. He\u2019d drawn his weapon and had it pointed at Hamish\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cHis cane is a gun, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes darted to Hamish\u2019s cane.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen them before,\u201d Nick assured Zane. \u201cIt\u2019s a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous!\u201d Hamish shouted. He raised the cane to wave it around, and Ty hit Zane from the side, tackling him to the ground and covering his body with his. There was a sound like someone opening a biscuit can, and then the room devolved into madness. Zane rolled to his feet, drawing his weapon.</p><p>Solomon Frost, the blond Snake Eater who seemed to have made friends with everyone, had tackled Nick to the ground, and they were now wrestling over the gun in their hands. It went off, punching a hole through the wood paneling near Deuce and Livi\u2019s heads. Livi screamed and Deuce lunged in front of her, shielding her and forcing her low to the ground. He reached out for the woman next to him, Miyoko Mason, who was holding her bloody arm and screaming that she\u2019d been shot. The bullet fired from Hamish\u2019s cane gun had hit her instead of Zane.</p><p>Hamish was frantically groping for something on the handle of his cane, and just as Kelly was about to take a run at the old man, he found the switch and a short knife flipped out of the bottom of the cane. Kelly skidded to a halt and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck kind of butler are you?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Hamish grinned and pointed his cane at Kelly\u2019s face. \u201cA bitter one.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t know which way to turn or who to help first. Ty hadn\u2019t gotten off the round yet. He was curled on his side, holding his arm, but it wasn\u2019t clear if he\u2019d been shot or if he\u2019d merely aggravated his already hurt shoulder.</p><p>Nick hadn\u2019t yet gained the upper hand against Frost, but he had managed to land an elbow or two to the man\u2019s face and wrap his legs around Frost\u2019s waist so he couldn\u2019t roll off and get away.</p><p>Kelly had his gun out, pointing it at Hamish and ordering him to stand down. But he didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to pull the trigger, and the old butler could see that.</p><p>\u201cYou had your own wife murdered,\u201d Kelly said to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve obviously never been married.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pursed his lips thoughtfully, shrugging like he might understand that reasoning.</p><p>English and Park pounced on Frost, burying Nick under yet another dog pile of limbs. Zane turned his gun on Hamish, only to fire off to the right at the last second when he saw a man standing directly behind Hamish, shovel raised high.</p><p>Chester took a mighty swing and whacked Hamish in the back of the head. The butler collapsed to the ground, his cane falling harmlessly at his side. English managed to subdue Frost, holding him in a headlock as Nick scratched and clawed his way out from under their weight.</p><p>Zane still stood in the middle of the chaos, every sense alert to every movement, every fiber of his being telling him there was still danger.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck just happened?\u201d Deuce shouted.</p><p>Chester laid his shovel over his shoulder and grinned at Zane. English and Park finally got Frost on his face, holding him down with a knee to his back. Kelly was helping Ty off the ground, looking at his shoulder and nodding. Nick was still sprawled on the floor, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cAnyone have any rope?\u201d English called out.</p><p>Kelly pulled out a pair of handcuffs and thrust them at Park.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you have those?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Kelly shrugged and grinned. \u201cThey\u2019re Nick\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, no,\u201d Ty blurted, covering his eyes.</p><p>Nick laughed. He rolled over and pushed himself to his hands and knees, but he remained there, either unable or unwilling to stand. He glanced up at Ty and Zane. \u201cHe likes the uniform, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no!\u201d Ty cried.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just unnecessary,\u201d Earl said from the doorway. He had grabbed Mara and the two uninjured bridesmaids when the shooting had started and shoved them out of the room to safety. He also had the antique rifle from the dining room in his hands.</p><p>Hamish moaned and began to move. Zane shoved him to his back with the toe of his boot and pointed his gun in the old man\u2019s face. \u201cStart from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who paid us,\u201d Hamish said groggily. His head was bleeding freely, but no one cared. \u201cAnd you know the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJockie came to me with this plan. He said a man in a tavern had approached him. This island belonged to our families for centuries, and look at us! We\u2019re servants on our own home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else was involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one! My wife had second thoughts and said she was going to tell Stanton, so we voted to get rid of her. That woman Nikki killed Aileen, then she and Maisie cut open Milton\u2019s body to make you think Aileen was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Ty grunted.</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d Kelly added.</p><p>\u201cWho killed Milton and why?\u201d Zane demanded.</p><p>\u201cI think we have that answer over here,\u201d English called. He had his gun in Frost\u2019s mouth, and he took it out and pressed it to Frost\u2019s cheek. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki figured out Milton was working for the government. She told me she needed backup for their meet,\u201d Frost told them. He sounded both ashamed and sorrowful, like the entire thing had been something he\u2019d been convinced to do rather than wanted to do. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d English snarled. \u201cLenny\u2019s dead because of you. You\u2019re dead to me too, for all you\u2019re worth.\u201d</p><p>Frost blinked up at him, his jaw tightening.</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d Park ordered. They were the first words Zane had heard the man speak.</p><p>\u201cMilton gave Nikki a flash drive. She gave him a suitcase of money. Then I hit him in the head and we left him there. We didn\u2019t realize until later that the flash drive was corrupted. It put a virus on the computer we uploaded it to and erased everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put that flash drive on my laptop?\u201d Zane asked, remembering the inexplicable failure of his brand-new laptop.</p><p>Frost nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill Nikki?\u201d Zane asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes. That was my job, to clear her after she\u2019d done hers. I thought I was the last man standing, so when people kept dying I started freaking out too. And I didn\u2019t even fucking know Kline was with us until she went crazy and put a gun to Stanton\u2019s head. I swear to God I didn\u2019t kill the guy upstairs!\u201d</p><p>Park stood and walked away from him. He took his sunglasses off and rubbed his hand over his eyes, revealing one that was milky white and another that was dark as obsidian. Then he put the glasses back on.</p><p>English shoved the gun harder into Frost\u2019s face. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hired you?\u201d Zane shouted at him. \u201cWas it Richard Burns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That was the name we were instructed to give, to cause chaos because he was on the island. The locals all thought he was the guy, okay? He was being set up. We were supposed to take him out at the end, but I swear I didn\u2019t do it! It had to have been Kline or that fucking gardener!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us a name!\u201d English demanded, digging the gun under Frost\u2019s cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cHe was South American! The guy who hired me. De la Vega, okay? I never saw his face!\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s entire body flooded with ice. He lowered his weapon, blinking as the edges of his vision began to darken. De la Vega. The head of the Vega cartel, the man who\u2019d tried to kill them in New Orleans. He\u2019d come after Zane through Ty, and when that hadn\u2019t worked, he\u2019d come through Deuce\u2019s in-laws.</p><p>Zane turned to meet Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIs that the guy from NOLA?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe guy who got Kelly shot?\u201d Nick asked through gritted teeth. He had finally climbed to his feet.</p><p>\u201cThe locals, they all thought this was about money, about getting their island back. But that was just because we needed a smoke screen. It wasn\u2019t even about the stuff on the flash drive! Our job was to retrieve the information, then plant it in Garrett\u2019s computer so he\u2019d go down for the theft,\u201d Frost admitted. \u201cAll de la Vega wanted was for Garrett to go down. That\u2019s it. I asked him, why not just kill the guy? And he said he wanted Garrett to suffer. That\u2019s all he said.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly were both staring at Zane, but Zane\u2019s world was narrowing as he listened. Ty\u2019s hand came to rest on his back.</p><p>Frost\u2019s voice was going higher, pleading as he explained. \u201cBut when the flash drive scrambled his laptop, the mission should have been aborted. I swear to God, Boss, that\u2019s when I retreated. These fucking island hicks don\u2019t know when to stop or we\u2019d have just walked away!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane sat heavily, his heart and head throbbing. \u201cThis was never really about Stanton\u2019s company. This was about me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>They stood on the edge of the cliff, staring out at the moon sparkling on the waves.</p> <p>The boat bobbed in the distance, its emergency beacon blinking and reflecting on the water like Christmas lights. It made Nick miss his boat. He always lined the vessel with strings of lights for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cDo we try for it?\u201d English asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Kelly grunted. \u201cI say we swim for that bitch, fuck waiting for the ferry.\u201d</p><p>Ty, Nick, and Zane murmured in agreement. Park merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s physically capable of making that swim?\u201d Nick asked, looking down the line at all of them.</p> <p>Ty shook his head. Kelly had put his shoulder back in joint, to the tune of much squabbling and name-calling and Ty screaming in the end.</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t injured at all, but he looked dubious. \u201cI can try for it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not a very strong swimmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good for it,\u201d English said with a nod.</p><p>Nick looked him up and down. \u201cDude, is there a wet suit that will fit you?\u201d</p><p>English laughed. \u201cProbably not on this island.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head. The sea was far too cold to swim without a wet suit. He\u2019d die before he got halfway there.</p> <p>\u201cI can swim,\u201d Park said. His arms were crossed, and he was still wearing his sunglasses even in the dark of night. \u201cBut perhaps we should use that canoe on the beach instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d Ty and Zane blurted at the same time.</p><p>Park nodded toward the beach below. None of them could see what he was seeing, so Nick lay out on the edge of the cliff and shined his light down there. A battered red canoe reflected back at them.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell?\u201d Nick asked over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHis sunglasses have night vision,\u201d English answered, deadpan.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Ty and Kelly both said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Both their shoulders slumped in disappointment, and Nick laughed. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was really that funny or if he was just at the end of his sanity. He didn\u2019t really care either. He stood and brushed himself off, then patted English on the chest and jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the beach below. \u201cIt\u2019s all you, buddy.\u201d</p> <p>English nodded, gesturing to Park.</p><p>\u201cWait, we can\u2019t send them alone. What if they leave us here?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick raised an eyebrow at his lover, but it was a valid question. He glanced at English, who was nodding.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Who wants to go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Zane offered. He and Ty exchanged a glance, communicating silently for a few seconds. Then Zane checked the ammunition in his gun. Nick handed him his knife with a nod.</p><p>They turned to English to see if he\u2019d object. The big man shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s already told me he can\u2019t swim. If I want to kill him, I\u2019ll just tip the canoe.\u201d He gave them all a cheeky grin, then turned to make his way down to the beach.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ty said. \u201cOh, hell no.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He followed after English, leaving the four of them up top to watch their progress through the real set of night vision goggles they\u2019d found in the stash of weapons Frost had cleared from the mansion\u2019s stalking room.</p><p>Park turned to them, frowning. \u201cGarrett know how to drive a boat like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>Park shrugged. \u201cNeither does John.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes and shoved the night vision goggles at Kelly, then began to strip himself of any unnecessary accessories.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of Green Beret doesn\u2019t know how to handle a boat?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he does,\u201d Park said, beginning to grin. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait up!\u201d Nick called to the two men, jogging to catch up to them on the beach path.</p><p>The sun was rising when the boat neared the shoreline. The dock was the only place even remotely capable of taking a vessel the size of the craft they\u2019d retrieved, but there was too much damage and debris to get close. They had to ferry people two and three at a time, using the canoe and the lifeboat they\u2019d found on board. Ty wasn\u2019t even able to help do that because of his throbbing shoulder. He sat aside and watched despondently.</p><p>They left the house as it was, the bodies where they\u2019d been lying, save for Burns, who they\u2019d wrapped in canvas and taken with them. Earl had been adamant he wouldn\u2019t leave Burns behind. Luggage was left in the rooms, only the necessities taken with them back to the mainland. Hamish, Fraser, and Frost were all tied down, tied up, and gagged so none of them could speak for the entirety of the two-hour boat ride back to the mainland. Mackie had been left to his cottage and his destroyed dock.</p><p>Nick worked on the radio, trying to raise assistance. He finally picked someone up, but they couldn\u2019t understand his accent and he couldn\u2019t understand theirs. He wound up cursing into the radio and giving up on trying to raise anyone else.</p><p>Ty stood beside him at the helm, feeling as if they still had so much left to say but not sure where to even start. He was still having trouble pushing past the shock of Richard Burns\u2019s death. He couldn\u2019t imagine going through that loss without Nick to help him.</p><p>Nick finally looked him up and down. \u201cYou look like hell, Ty, go sit down.\u201d</p><p>Ty remained for several more seconds. When Nick glanced at him again, Ty said, \u201cI love you like my own brother. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve got to be mad at me for a while. But remember that, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick gave him a curt nod, swallowing hard. Ty turned away from him, heading out of the pilothouse. Deuce met him in the doorway, Livi on his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou two okay?\u201d Ty asked them.</p><p>\u201cToday was our wedding day,\u201d Livi said, her voice choked. She covered her mouth, fighting back tears. Then she took a deep breath. \u201cWe wanted to thank you for what you did. We were coming to thank Nick.\u201d</p><p>Nick still had his back to them, but his head was turned, listening and watching out of his peripheral vision.</p><p>Livi moved past Ty and went up to Nick, not saying a word, merely hugging him. He was forced to take one arm off the wheel to return the hug, his big hand gentle on her slim frame.</p><p>Livi was crying quietly when she released him. She moved back to Ty and Deuce, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ty asked again, unsure of what to do for them.</p><p>She laughed shakily and nodded, wiping at her face. \u201cAfter everything that happened, I feel so stupid. I just . . . I thought we\u2019d be married when we got back to the mainland. It wasn\u2019t even official, it was just a . . . stupid ceremony on a stupid island!\u201d</p><p>Deuce pulled her into a hug, resting his chin on her head. He met Ty\u2019s eyes, smiling weakly.</p><p>Ty nodded in understanding. Then an idea hit him. He turned to Nick again, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>Nick stiffened when he saw the look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the captain of this ship.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes darted from Ty to Deuce and Livi, who were both frowning at Ty in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou can marry them.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared, his mouth hanging open. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can marry us?\u201d Livi asked.</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just as official as a ceremony on a stupid island.\u201d</p><p>Livi\u2019s blue eyes grew wide and hopeful.</p><p>Nick pointed a finger at her. \u201cI\u2019m immune to those looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes, Irish, you can marry them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to perform a marriage ceremony, Ty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Deuce said quietly. \u201cEveryone we love is on this boat. That\u2019s all that matters. Just say man and wife for us in front of our families.\u201d</p><p>It seemed like Nick was going to protest, but he finally cursed under his breath and turned to slow the boat.</p><p>As soon as he turned back, Livi darted toward him and hugged him around the neck. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. Then she left the pilothouse to get everyone together.</p><p>Deuce gave Nick a smile and a nod before going off after her. Ty couldn\u2019t keep from grinning as Nick glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you regret this,\u201d Nick warned, walking past.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they\u2019d gathered everyone, and Nick was at the bow of the ship, Livi and Deuce standing before him. No one was with them, no best man or maid of honor, no father of the bride giving her away. Livi had put her wedding dress on, sans all the accessories, to leave her in a beautiful white sheath gown that spread out in a train behind her. Amelia sat on the train, gnawing on the expensive silk.</p><p>Nick took a deep breath. Ty could tell he was nervous. Probably close to just throwing himself overboard rather than doing this. He finally looked at Deuce and Livi and gave them a signature O\u2019Flaherty grin.</p><p>\u201cDeacon Grady,\u201d he started. \u201cDo you intend to spend the rest of your life with this woman? Love her, cherish her, let her pick out the curtains, and shield her body from any future bullets?\u201d</p><p>Deuce chuckled and gazed at Livi, reaching to take her hand in his. \u201cI do,\u201d he said softly. He slid a ring onto her finger, never taking his eyes off her face.</p><p>Nick turned to Livi.</p><p>\u201cOlivia Stanton,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said before he could continue. She wrapped her arms around Deuce\u2019s neck and kissed him. The boat erupted in cheers and applause, and Deuce took Livi in his arms and turned her, dipping her for a kiss. Amelia grabbed onto Livi\u2019s train and slid across the deck as it moved, laughing gleefully.</p><p>Nick stood with his hands spread, incredulous. \u201cWhy am I even up here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Livi and Deuce laughed merrily, kissing again before Deuce set her on her feet once more.</p><p>\u201cOnly other part of this thing I know is \u2018you may now kiss the bride!\u2019\u201d Nick told them, clearly offended that he hadn\u2019t been able to at least do that part.</p><p>Livi laughed again and stepped forward to give him a kiss on the cheek, and then she and Deuce turned to their family and loved ones and raised their joined hands. Everyone clapped for them, some people giving off whistles and howls. Deuce bent to pick Amelia up, and he wrapped his arm around his wife, walking into the crowd with his family. Ty stood to the side, still clapping, watching his brother with a smile on his face. Zane was next to him, brushing against him as he clapped.</p><p>He glanced up at the bow of the boat only to find Nick watching them.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else want to get hitched while I\u2019m up here?\u201d Nick asked, staring at Ty and Zane pointedly.</p><p>Ty swallowed past the sudden knot in his throat and turned to Zane, warmth spreading through him. Zane\u2019s eyes had widened, his mouth parted but no words coming out. Ty grasped his hand and kissed his fingers. \u201cWill you marry me, Zane?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Zane looked from him to Nick and back, a grin spreading across his lips. Then he shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered, laughing.</p><p>Ty huffed and fought not to smile.</p><p>Nick walked past them, shaking his head. \u201cDamn, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cold,\u201d Kelly added before they were gone.</p><p>Ty and Zane both watched them go, then turned back to each other, both of them smiling. Ty pulled Zane to him and kissed him, holding him by a handful of his hair so he couldn\u2019t get away. \u201cI\u2019ll get you eventually, my pretty,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I look forward to it,\u201d Zane mumbled against his lips.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Ty, Nick, and Kelly were still in their dress blues. Zane had loosened his tie and removed his suit coat because he refused to be in a funeral suit longer than he had to be. They\u2019d retreated from the graveyard and taken up residence in a local tavern, one Ty had apparently frequented when he\u2019d been based in Washington, DC.</p><p>Zane was drinking Coke. Ty had ordered a scotch to toast Richard Burns, but after that he\u2019d stuck to Dr Pepper. Zane had caught a glance between Ty and Nick that spoke clearly to the fact that Nick had read Ty the riot act at some point about drinking in Zane\u2019s presence.</p><p>Nick and Kelly were drinking water. Zane didn\u2019t know whether to be grateful to them or to be pleased that these men, men who reportedly had always been hard-drinking, hard-partying hooligans, would refrain for him.</p><p>Either way, he\u2019d given them each a nod in recognition of what they were doing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe all this shit circles back to me,\u201d Zane said, staring at the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cIf you pull one of those \u2018everyone I love dies, let me disappear\u2019 moves on me, I\u2019ll hunt you down,\u201d Ty told him.</p><p>Zane laughed sadly. \u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the mole,\u201d Ty told him, almost growling. \u201cHe knew Burns was closing in on him. He\u2019s the only one could have known enough information to feed to de la Vega and pull this shit off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis the same mole who made the mess in New Orleans?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Zane nodded, still staring. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to end until the cartel is gone. Or I am.\u201d</p><p>The table fell silent, and the sounds of the noisy tavern began to fade until Zane was sitting in the silence of his own head, staring at the wood grain of the table.</p><p>\u201cSo this de la Vega guy,\u201d Nick finally said. Zane raised his head, blinking away the deep reverie he\u2019d been lost in. Nick was lounging in the corner of their booth, his arm around Kelly\u2019s shoulder, his other hand on the table like he was accustomed to sitting with people he didn\u2019t hide his hands from. He tapped his fingers and met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow do we take him out?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane smiled. \u201cThat\u2019ll just have to wait until after your little surgery, now won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes and took a sip of water. He was donating his liver to a father who had terrorized him all his life. He was a better person than Zane, that was for sure. Zane would\u2019ve sat back and watched the man die.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll investigate from our end,\u201d Ty said, sounding determined and a little scary. Zane liked it. \u201cTo get to de la Vega, we have to get to the mole. That\u2019s our first move.\u201d</p> <p>They all nodded, glancing around at each other.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re coming back to the FBI?\u201d Zane asked Ty.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cWe both know I can\u2019t. I think what you call me now would be the Wild Card.\u201d</p><p>Zane met his lover\u2019s eyes, thrilled to see the life back in them. Whatever had happened to Ty and Sidewinder out there, it had sapped the joy out of all of them, taken the very thing that made them capable of walking through Hell and doused it. But now, looking at these three men, with a purpose given to them once more, with a mission, Zane could see that fire returning.</p><p>De la Vega had poked the wrong hornet\u2019s nest this time.</p> <p>Nick fought to open his eyes when he heard voices. He finally managed to make his head fall to the side and peered through his eyelashes to see who was in the room. The motion must have drawn attention, because the voices stopped and the room fell silent.</p><p>Nick closed his eyes again.</p><p>A moment later a cool hand was on his forehead. \u201cNick?\u201d the voice whispered. \u201cWake up, babe.\u201d When Nick finally got both eyes open, Kelly was smiling down at him. He grazed his fingers along Nick\u2019s cheek and bent to whisper in his ear. \u201cLots of people here to see you.\u201d</p><p>A separator curtain screeched as it was pulled across the room to give them a little more privacy. He was still groggy as hell, and it took him a long time to focus, and an even longer time to understand what was going on. He\u2019d given a piece of his liver, one he\u2019d managed to keep healthy by some miracle, to his father. It hadn\u2019t even really been a choice for him. As soon as the tests came back saying he was a good match, he knew he had to do it.</p><p>His father would live on, whether he deserved to or not. Nick\u2019s conscience was clear, and the missing piece of his liver would eventually grow back. He hoped.</p><p>Almost a dozen people were crowded around, all holding some form of \u201cspecial delivery\u201d baby presents.</p> <p>He started to laugh but had to stop when pain threatened. \u201cAssholes.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane were both there, as were Owen and Digger. Nick had known they would be, though, because they\u2019d flown in last night to be with him before the operation. Digger stood at the foot of the bed, and Owen was sitting in the corner holding a huge teddy bear that hid most of his body. When he realized Nick was awake, he stood and placed the bear in the chair to move closer.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling, O?\u201d Digger asked.</p><p>\u201cLike less of a man,\u201d Nick said, drawing laughs from the others.</p><p>\u201cYou look it,\u201d Digger told him, and held up a jar filled with liquid and some sort of . . . stuff.</p><p>Ty quickly grabbed the jar and hid it from sight. \u201cDude, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGator livers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll help his grow back faster!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely no.\u201d</p><p>Nick groaned and tossed his head to the side, trying to purge that visual from his mind before that visual purged his stomach.</p><p>\u201cSo gross,\u201d Ty muttered, and he left the room with the jar under his arm.</p><p>The rest of them were still laughing when Ty returned, and Nick finally managed to look back to the foot of the bed without feeling the need to throw up.</p><p>Kat and Erin were standing there, both of them with bouquets filled out with baby\u2019s breath, little pink daisies, and balloons. They giggled as they placed the dainty arrangements on the table near the wall. Even Nick\u2019s oldest nephew, Patrick, had come with them. He was snickering gleefully when he handed Nick a card that everyone had signed. It read, \u201cCongratulations on your special delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you guys do, send out a memo?\u201d Nick asked, still trying to avoid laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed appropriate,\u201d Ty said. He held up a bouquet of cookies on sticks, all of them in the shape of baby bottles, shoes, and bonnets, then set it down on the table next to Nick. The vase read \u201cFor the Little One.\u201d</p><p>Owen tapped Nick\u2019s foot, then gestured between him and Kelly. \u201cYou two got some \u2019splainin\u2019 to do, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc couldn\u2019t stop pacing in the waiting room. Finally, he just blurted out that he needed a hug because he loved you and he was freaking out.\u201d</p><p>Nick managed a warm smile. \u201cYou okay with it?\u201d</p><p>Owen nodded, pursing his lips. \u201cOkay enough to provide hugs in waiting rooms, I guess. I\u2019ll reserve my final judgment for the whole story. Assuming I\u2019m going to get it?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. Digger wrapped an arm around Owen\u2019s shoulders and patted his chest like he was proud of him.</p><p>Kelly chuckled. He held to Nick\u2019s hand tighter. \u201cWhen Nick can have a beer again, we\u2019ll sit you down and explain all you want.\u201d</p><p>Owen seemed satisfied with that. Nick found his throat getting tighter. He no longer had any secrets from any of them. His conscience was clear again, and it was a massive weight off his mind and soul. All he could do was nod and blink back tears of relief.</p><p>The only thing that didn\u2019t fit the theme was the gift Zane had brought him. It was a box of shotgun shells, the right kind for Nick\u2019s Ithaca 37 pump action. They were green-tipped, though, with little radioactive symbols etched on them.</p><p>\u201cZombie rounds,\u201d Zane told him, tongue in cheek. \u201cIn case you came out of the surgery mostly dead.\u201d</p><p>This time Nick laughed even though it hurt. He held to his side gingerly, trying to keep from laughing harder. \u201cThese should come in handy, Garrett. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also brought you season one of The Walking Dead. We\u2019ll sit and watch while you recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this . . . zombie bonding?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Nick grinned up at Zane, nodding. \u201cA man after my own heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought zombies were after brains,\u201d Kelly said wryly. He pointed at Zane. \u201cYou stay away from his heart, that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>The group chuckled. Nick rolled his eyes and closed them again, still smiling. And while he could hear the others shuffling around and murmuring quietly, he couldn\u2019t force his eyes back open. \u201cThanks for coming guys. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t . . . stay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s hand came to rest on his forehead again, then slipped down to cover his eyes so he\u2019d stop struggling to try to open them. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back when you\u2019re not out of it, okay? Sleep.\u201d</p><p>Each visitor came up to the bed and gave Nick some sort of touch before leaving, whether it was a kiss on the forehead from his sisters, a squeeze of the shoulder from Owen, or a gentle fist bump from his nephew. They all seemed to know what the contact would mean to him regardless of whether he could drag his eyes open to see them again. Ty leaned over him and hugged him tightly, pressing his cheek to Nick\u2019s and calling him brother, telling him he loved him. Zane petted his head affectionately.</p><p>He heard them file out until the room felt empty.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s fingers drifted down his arm, making Nick smile. \u201cThe surgery went well,\u201d Kelly told him. \u201cYour dad\u2019s in ICU, but he\u2019s doing fine. They\u2019ll be bringing him in here later on, so don\u2019t be surprised if he shows up.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. He could honestly say that he didn\u2019t care how his dad was doing. He\u2019d done everything in his power to give him a fighting chance, and the man was on his own from now on. Nick was done with him. He squeezed Kelly\u2019s hand and took a deep, painful breath.</p><p>\u201cDid you really mean it when you said you were done carrying a gun?\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Nick forced one eye open. A frown marred Kelly\u2019s features, and his eyes were sad and sympathetic. He leaned closer to Nick.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to give up something you love because of me. And I\u2019m worried that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Nick forced both tired eyes open and blinked hard, trying to keep them from watering. \u201cKelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cBecause in a few months you\u2019ll be mostly healed up. In a year you\u2019ll be whole again. The Boston PD would take you back in a heartbeat, and you\u2019re one hell of a detective. You\u2019re a better detective than you were a Marine, and Nick, that\u2019s saying something because you were one hell of a fucking Marine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s saying a hell of a thing, you know? And you don\u2019t just give up on something you\u2019re that good at, Nick, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always liked your job. And you love a mystery. You\u2019re not happy without a mystery to solve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mystery,\u201d Nick said. He reached up to trail his fingertips down Kelly\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019d have you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted.</p><p>\u201cI want us to start something, Kels. You and me. Something we\u2019ll live through. Something we\u2019ll grow old doing. We can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m a cop.\u201d</p><p>Kelly bit his lip, and his eyes were just as misty as Nick\u2019s. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t answer. He was staring at Kelly, completely smitten, wondering why it had taken him so fucking long to realize he loved the man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything with you, Kels. Anything you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grasped Nick\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure something out. You see, I can tell you I love you, and it\u2019s the same words I\u2019ve always said to you from the first day I realized you\u2019d have my back in a firefight. I love you, brother. Those are the same words I say to Six and Digger and Ozone. You know? They were the same words I said to Eli the last time he called. They were the same words my parents said the night they left and died in the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly,\u201d Nick managed to say as tears began to fall for some reason. He pressed his hand to Kelly\u2019s cheek. A tear hit his thumb and he realized they were both crying.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand why those are the same words I have to use for a feeling that\u2019s not the same anymore,\u201d Kelly continued, his voice lower, more intimate and more confused. \u201cI . . . I need you. I adore you. I want to wake up every morning and make you fix me breakfast so I can watch you cook. I want to . . . I want to spend the rest of my life with you doing things that make life worth living. I want to make you smile. I want you to take me to every baseball stadium out there and teach me every single little thing you know about the game because I love the way your eyes light up when you talk about it. I want to . . . what words do I use for this feeling if \u2018I love you\u2019 has already been used?\u201d</p><p>Nick tried to swallow against the lump in his throat and couldn\u2019t. He shook his head, at a loss. He stared into Kelly\u2019s eyes for long moments before finally attempting to speak. \u201cHow about . . . marry me?\u201d</p><p>Kelly smiled and wiped at his eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly bent to kiss him, his lips barely grazing Nick\u2019s. Then he kissed him harder, stopping only to sniffle and wipe his cheeks again, using Nick\u2019s hospital gown to do it. He rested his head on Nick\u2019s shoulder, and Nick wrapped a clumsy arm around his neck.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Nick,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cNo matter what those words meant before, we know what they mean now. They\u2019re ours now. Just ours.\u201d</p><p>Nick whispered the words in Kelly\u2019s ear, feeling a new weight to them. Instead of a sense of panic like he\u2019d half expected, he felt nothing but calm. He could marry Kelly tomorrow and never look back, never regret the decision. He and Kelly could spend their lives together\u2014as boyfriends, as husbands, as partners-in-crime, as any damn thing they wanted\u2014and there wasn\u2019t a thing about that prospect that made him nervous. He buried his nose in Kelly\u2019s messy hair and closed his eyes, unable to keep them open any longer with Kelly\u2019s scent engulfing him and lulling him to sleep.</p><p>Kelly kissed him gently one more time, then placed something in Nick\u2019s hand and positioned his thumb over a button. \u201cRest, babe. Here\u2019s your morphine drip. Enjoy it for me. I\u2019m going to go get food with the others, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick managed a smile, and Kelly kissed him once more, but he still couldn\u2019t drag his eyes open as Kelly left the room.</p><p>Marry me. It made him smile as he drifted off to sleep.</p><p>He floated in and out of awareness for a while. He wasn\u2019t really in pain, but it wasn\u2019t a restful sleep either. The beeps and shuffling footsteps and whispered words of the hospital were soothing in a way, and eventually even the steady breathing of his father in the next bed after they moved him into the room was something that eased Nick\u2019s mind.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what it was that disturbed him, but his eyes were open before he realized he was awake. A male nurse stood next to his bed, checking his vitals and messing with the machines. Nick looked him up and down, moving nothing but his eyes to do it. Then, for some reason, his mind began casting around for something, anything, that could be used as a weapon.</p><p>He tossed his head like he was suffering through a restless sleep and then rolled, edging toward the table where Ty\u2019s heavy crystal vase of joke cookies sat. A hand shot out and gripped his wrist, wrenching his arm until he whimpered. Another hand landed on his incision, making him cry out and curl into a protective ball. He grabbed at the man\u2019s arm, trying to push it away, trying to get away from the agony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glared up into the eyes of the nurse, recognition dawning as he tried to gasp for air.</p><p>\u201cAlmost got the drop on me, O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Liam Bell drawled. \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><p>The bed on the other side of the curtain creaked as Nick\u2019s father moved. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?\u201d</p> <p>Liam glanced over his shoulder, letting up on the pressure on Nick\u2019s arm and incision. He reached out to the screaming machines and silenced them somehow, then pulled the green mask down his chin. A smirk curled his lips.</p><p>Nick pressed his hand to his incision, feeling blood seeping through the stitches. He curled up and rocked, unable to stop himself. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were under the weather,\u201d Liam said, his tone entirely conversational. He pulled up a chair and sat, then gently took Nick\u2019s hand in his, cradling the morphine clicker in Nick\u2019s palm. He wrapped Nick\u2019s fingers around it and pressed his thumb against Nick\u2019s, making him push the button a few times. \u201cLet\u2019s just up this a little, shall we? Can\u2019t have you in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay over there, boy?\u201d Nick\u2019s dad asked.</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Nick managed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Liam rolled his eyes and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He yanked the curtain aside, standing in the middle of the room to look down at Brian O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s bed. \u201cYou have some fucking nerve, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said as he examined the equipment around Brian\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a friend of your son\u2019s, don\u2019t mind me,\u201d Liam murmured distractedly.</p><p>\u201cBell, leave him alone,\u201d Nick tried to say, though his voice was weak and his words were slurring and panicked. He tried to reach the call button, which had been moved out of the way to make room for the box of zombie shells.</p><p>Liam plucked Brian\u2019s IV line between two of his fingers, then pulled a syringe from his pocket. He whistled as he injected whatever was in it into the IV.</p><p>\u201cLiam!\u201d Nick shouted. He reached for his own IV to yank it out, intending to get out of bed, but his movements were sluggish and his mind was growing foggier. He couldn\u2019t manage it. His hand landed on the shotgun shells, prepared to hurl the box at Liam\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cRelax, he\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019ll just go to sleep.\u201d Liam tossed the syringe in a receptacle and then leaned over Brian. \u201cI ever see you with a drink in your hand again, I\u2019ll put a hole through your fucking skull. Understand? You don\u2019t deserve this man as a son.\u201d</p><p>Nick saw the anger and fear in his father\u2019s eyes before the medicine Liam had injected him with put him to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWanker,\u201d Liam added. He pulled the curtain closed again and sat down beside Nick. He batted Nick\u2019s hands away from the heavy box of shells, then from the IV line and the nurse\u2019s call button. His movements were extremely gentle considering he\u2019d just jabbed the heel of his palm into Nick\u2019s incision several minutes before. He patted Nick\u2019s chest. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p><p>Nick groaned and tried to shove him away, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just slink off to somewhere and die like you were supposed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew now would be the best time to see you, since when you\u2019re healthy you tend to punch first and discuss after you\u2019ve tied me to something that\u2019s not very fun.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted.</p> <p>\u201cTo get right down to it, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d Nick growled. He tossed his head and writhed on the bed, fighting through the pain.</p><p>Liam took his hand in his, pushing Nick\u2019s thumb to hit the morphine drip again. He held on to him this time, as if he were offering comfort.</p><p>Nick glared at him. \u201cHow could you convince yourself I\u2019d help you do anything?\u201d</p><p>Liam glanced at the doorway. \u201cBecause I finally have leverage over you.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes darted toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou and the Doc, yeah? Never saw that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt him and you\u2019re a dead man. I\u2019ll hunt you down and make you suffer, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept those terms. And . . . I am suitably intimidated by the violent declarations of an otherwise gentle man. The thing is, I\u2019m going to need your help. The details are a bit fuzzy yet, but rest assured it is something you and only you can assist me in doing. And when the time comes, I\u2019m going to need you to mobilize without questions and without your nasty habit of being morally opposed to . . . things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Stuff.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s breathing was growing more labored, and it was harder to fight past the morphine to keep his eyes open. The only reason he was even still conscious was pure hatred.</p><p>Liam smiled kindly at him. \u201cYou help me on one simple task, and then you and the Doc sail off into the sunset together. You refuse, and I finish the job New Orleans started with that hole in Doc\u2019s chest.\u201d</p><p>Nick squeezed his eyes closed, gritting his teeth against the mere notion. He thought he might throw up.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSay no to me, O\u2019Flaherty, and I go downstairs right now and off him. He\u2019s in the cafeteria sitting beside a window. Perfect head shot from across the street. Can you imagine Tyler\u2019s face with the doc\u2019s brains spattered all over it? I imagine he\u2019d be quite devastated.\u201d</p><p>Nick curled onto his side and covered his eyes with his hand. He hated himself for doing it, but he clutched at Liam\u2019s hand harder as pain and grief wracked his body. \u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe have a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them come to harm,\u201d Nick said. He looked up at Liam, desperate. \u201cI do whatever you want and you leave them all alone. Give me your word.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled fondly. \u201cI always liked that about you, O\u2019Flaherty. You were the one Sidewinder who actually meant it when you said, \u2018I promise.\u2019 You have my word. Do I have yours?\u201d</p><p>Nick glared at him, the molten hatred threatening to burn right through his heart. He managed to get the word out anyway. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled brilliantly and patted him on the cheek. \u201cThere\u2019s my white knight. Now, surely I mustn\u2019t remind you that anyone you tell about our little arrangement will come to a sticky end.\u201d</p><p>Nick could do nothing but grit his teeth and glare up into Liam\u2019s ice-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch. Speedy recovery and all that,\u201d Liam drawled, smirking like it was some private joke. Then he pulled another syringe from his pocket and put Nick out of his misery.</p><p>Zane tossed his badge and keys on the counter and shoved the door shut behind him. The days at work seemed to be getting longer, the responsibilities weighing heavier. He wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he had the will to stick this through. The only thing keeping him there was the very real threat that still hovered over everyone and everything he loved. He had one more battle to fight.</p><p>And then he was ready to sleep in with his lover, to curl up on a Sunday and watch football, to read a fucking book without wondering when he\u2019d be called into work.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d he tried. The house was still and quiet. The Mustang hadn\u2019t been parked in the back, so Zane was pretty confident Ty wasn\u2019t home. The disappointment was striking.</p><p>He shrugged out of his jacket and began thumbing through the stack of mail on the counter, but a small box sitting there caught his attention. He set the mail aside and picked up the box. It was black with a simple white ribbon on it. A notecard tucked into the ribbon read, \u201cOpen Me Now.\u201d</p><p>Zane smirked. It had almost become a joke between them, Ty\u2019s many and varied ways of asking Zane to marry him. Zane almost dreaded the day he was convinced to say yes because then the attempts and the fun of saying no would stop.</p><p>He slid the ribbon off the box, still smiling and shaking his head. Inside was a purple velvet bag, and when Zane peered inside he found a wide silver band. His stomach flipped as he shook it into his palm. It wasn\u2019t shiny or new, and it had obviously been handmade. Etched into the side were numbers Zane quickly recognized as latitude and longitude coordinates.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Ty,\u201d he whispered. He was chuckling as he pulled out his phone and punched the coordinates into his GPS. It gave him directions, telling him the location was less than half a mile away. At least it was close.</p><p>Zane grabbed his coat and slid the ring onto his right ring finger. It was a perfect fit. He walked several blocks toward Fell\u2019s Point, then turned where his phone indicated and began searching for somewhere that looked like it was supposed to be his goal.</p><p>When he found his destination, it was not what he was expecting. The only reason he even knew he was there was because Ty was sitting on the front stoop, waiting for him.</p><p>Zane peered up at the three-story building. It was brick, with white trim that was flaking and falling off to reveal green underneath. The front door was covered with stickers and graffiti, and the glass had been covered up with paper grocery bags. A torn black and orange For Sale sign was taped to it.</p><p>The windows all boasted corbels and hand-carved wood, but they were visibly rotting. The basement steps on the sidewalk led to a dark hole that may or may not have been home to vagrants at night. The only thing that could be said for the building was that it probably had an incredible view of the harbor from the back, and that Zane\u2019s lover was sitting on its concrete steps.</p><p>Zane snorted as Ty stood to meet him. He held up the ring and wiggled his finger. \u201cI can\u2019t say this is your best attempt.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned. He turned and tapped the For Sale sign. \u201cI bought it.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile fell, and he glanced up at the dilapidated building again. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Ty pulled the door open. It was unlocked. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, you bought this building?\u201d Zane stuttered as he followed Ty inside. \u201cWith what, Monopoly money?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s laugh echoed off the empty interior. Inside, the building didn\u2019t look much better. There was an old bar that stretched the length of the narrow front room, and in the back were steps going up and what may have been a storeroom with a rear exit.</p><p>Ty lifted his hands and turned to Zane, smiling almost shyly.</p><p>Zane gaped at his surroundings. \u201cI\u2019m . . . confused.\u201d</p><p>Ty patted the bar. \u201cIt used to be a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has two stories upstairs. It needs complete renovation, so we can gut it and do whatever we want to it.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up again, imagining all the work that would take. Ty without a job and without any leads on the mole was beginning to be a scary prospect.</p><p>He turned back to Ty, still waiting for when this would turn into a good idea.</p><p>Ty was still smiling gently. \u201cYou see, no matter what we do to the row house, we\u2019ll always know it was mine first. We can\u2019t cleanse it of that and make it truly ours. But here we can start fresh. Build whatever we want.\u201d</p><p>Zane bit his lip, nodding. \u201cOkay. What about this level, though? It\u2019s still a commercial district.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realized the one thing Fell\u2019s Point didn\u2019t really have,\u201d Ty said, his voice sincere and hopeful, \u201cwas a bookstore.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s stomach flipped. He loved old book stores. Loved the smell of them, loved to walk through them, loved sitting in them and reading in a ratty old chair. Ty had known that from the beginning, from the day in New York City when he\u2019d gamely followed Zane into a bookstore and sat there as Zane browsed.</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cAnd we could sell black market orchids from the back.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath left him. He was standing in the middle of the craphole building Ty had bought him, and suddenly he could see what Ty was truly proposing. A life where neither of them carried a gun. A life where Zane could sit in a bookstore all day, could know that Ty would be there when he went home, right upstairs. A life for them, together. A future. Ty wanted them to cut and run.</p><p>Zane thought he had experienced love before. Thought he had known what it felt like to be the center of someone\u2019s world.</p><p>He had been wrong, because it had never felt like this.</p><p>Ty squared his shoulders and straightened himself. He cut quite the figure, his steady presence overpowering the dusty surroundings. His voice was quiet and clear. \u201cWill you marry me, Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed, and his shoulders slumped with relief. He moved toward Zane, reaching out to hook his finger through the bullet hole in Zane\u2019s jacket and pull him close. \u201cThank Christ, \u2019cause I was out of ideas after this.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed with him, the sound echoing off the bones of their future home, ringing in a new chapter in their lives like the bells of a cathedral. Their laughter was still echoing off the walls when Ty took Zane\u2019s face in both hands and kissed him for all he was worth. They wrapped around each other, clinging to the promise of the life they could have. </p> </body></html>"]
