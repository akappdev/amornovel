Adam was probably irritable after that business with the apple, so Eve would have done her best with some leaves and string.</p><p>So why was it still so hard to decide what to wear? As her maid tossed a seventh rejected gown onto the bed, Isidore, Duchess of Cosway, tried to decide whether her husband would prefer her in a ruby-colored velvet with a low d\u00e9colletage or a sky-blue open robe with a little train.</p><p>The decision would be easier if she\u2019d actually met the husband in question. \u201cYour Grace looked delightful in the white lustring silk,\u201d her maid said, a mulish set to her jaw indicating that Lucille was losing patience with all the tiny buttons, hooks, petticoats, and panniers involved in each change.</p><p>\u201cIt would be so much less complicated if I only had a few vines to work with, the way Eve did,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThough my marriage could hardly be called Edenic.\u201d</p><p>Lucille rolled her eyes. She wasn\u2019t given to philosophical musings about marriage.</p> <p>Not only were Eve\u2019s sartorial options limited, but she and Adam went into the wilderness. Whereas she, Isidore, had lured her husband, the Duke of Cosway, out of the wilderness of equatorial Africa, and yet the note she\u2019d received saying he\u2019d arrive tonight sounded just as peeved as Adam. Men never liked to be given directions.</p><p>She should probably wear the pale yellow gown, the one embroidered with flower petals. It had a disarming air of female fragility. Isidore plucked it back off the bed and held it in front of herself, staring into the glass. Never mind the fact that docility wasn\u2019t her best virtue; she could certainly look the part. For a while.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent choice, Your Grace,\u201d Lucille said encouragingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll look as sweet as butter.\u201d</p><p>The dress was edged in delicate lace and dotted with pale ribbons. \u201cWe\u2019ll put flowers in your hair,\u201d Lucille continued. \u201cOr perhaps small pearls. We could even add a bit of lace to the bodice.\u201d She waved her hand in the general area of Isidore\u2019s chest.</p><p>Masking her bosom (one of Isidore\u2019s best features, to her mind) seemed like taking wifely modesty too far. \u201cPearls?\u201d she said dubiously.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Lucille said, getting into the spirit, \u201cyou could carry that little prayer book from your mother, the one covered with lace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrayer book? You want me to carry a prayer book downstairs? Lucille, have you forgotten that we are currently at the most notorious house party in all England? There\u2019s not a guest at Lord Strange\u2019s party who even owns a prayer book except myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer Grace, the Duchess of Berrow, has a prayer book,\u201d Lucille pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSince Harriet happens to be at this party incognito\u2014and dressed as a man\u2014I doubt that she will be wandering around with her prayer book in hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would give you an air of virtue,\u201d her maid said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cIt would give me the air of a vicar\u2019s wife,\u201d Isidore said, throwing the dress back onto the heap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meeting His Grace for the first time. You don\u2019t want to look as if you belong at one of Lord Strange\u2019s parties. In that dress you look as young as a debutante,\u201d Lucille added, obviously thinking she\u2019d hit on a powerful point.</p><p>That settled it. Isidore was definitely not wearing the yellow gown, nor pearls either. She was no debutante: she was all of twenty-three years old, even if she was meeting her husband for the first time, after eleven years of marriage. They\u2019d married by proxy, but Cosway hadn\u2019t bothered to return when she was sixteen\u2014or eighteen\u2014or even twenty. He had no right to expect that she\u2019d look like a debutante. He should have imagined what it was like to get older and older while her friends married and had children. It was a wonder that she wasn\u2019t as dried up as an apple.</p><p>A chilling thought. What if he decided that she really was nothing more than a dried-up apple? She was far beyond the age of a debutante, after all.</p> <p>The very thought made Isidore\u2019s backbone straighten. She\u2019d played the docile wife for years, preserving her reputation, waiting for her husband\u2019s return. Longing for his return, if she admitted the truth to herself.</p><p>And what made Cosway finally come home? Did he suddenly remember that they\u2019d never met? No. It was the news that his wife was visiting a house party more famous for its debauchery than its lemon cakes. She should have thrown away her reputation years ago, and he would have trotted happily out of the jungle like a dog on a leash.</p><p>\u201cThe silver with diamonds,\u201d she said decisively.</p><p>Lucille would have paled, but her maquillage didn\u2019t allow for such extravagancies of emotion. \u201cOh, Your Grace,\u201d she said, clasping her hands like a heroine about to be thrown from the parapet, \u201cif you won\u2019t wear the yellow, at least choose a gown that has some claim to modesty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Isidore said, her mind made up. \u201cDo you know what His Grace\u2019s note says to me, Lucille?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Your Grace.\u201d Lucille was carefully displacing the pile of glowing silk and satin, looking for Isidore\u2019s most scandalous costume, the one she rarely wore after its first airing resulted in an impromptu duel between two besotted Frenchmen, fought on the cobbles in front of Versailles.</p><p>\u201cIt says,\u201d Isidore said, snatching up the piece of stationery that had arrived a few hours before: \u201cI discover I have some missing property. And he added a cryptic comment that seemingly announces his imminent arrival: Tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lucille looked up, blinking. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband appears to think I\u2019m a missing trunk. Perhaps he considers it too much work to travel from London to recover me from Lord Strange\u2019s party. Perhaps he expected that I would be waiting on the pier for his boat to come in. Perhaps he thinks I\u2019ve been there for years, tears dripping down my face as I waited for his return!\u201d</p><p>Lucille had a hard-headed French turn of mind, so she ignored the edge in Isidore\u2019s voice. She straightened with a gorgeous swath of pale silver silk, glittering with small diamonds. \u201cWill you desire diamonds in your hair as well?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>This particular dress fit so closely that Isidore could wear only the smallest corset, designed to plump her breasts and narrow her waist. The gown was sewn by a dressmaker to Queen Marie Antoinette, and it presupposed that its owner would grace the mirrored halls of Versailles\u2014a far cry from the smoky corridors of Strange\u2019s residence. Not to mention the fact that she would be rubbing shoulders with everyone from dukes to jugglers. Still...</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI may lose a few diamonds by the end of the evening. But I want my husband to understand that I am no stray trunk that he can simply throw into his carriage and transport to London.\u201d</p><p>Lucille laughed at that, and began to nimbly lace the proper corset. Isidore stared in the mirror, wondering just what the Duke of Cosway expected his wife to look like. She looked nothing like a pale English rose, given her generous curves and dark hair.</p><p>It rankled that Cosway had spent years jaunting around foreign lands, while she waited for him to return. Had he even thought of her in the past ten years? Had he ever wondered what had become of the twelve-year-old girl who married him by proxy? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had a strong feeling that to Cosway she truly was nothing more than a piece of forgotten property. It made her feel slightly crazed: that she had spent so many years wondering what sort of man she\u2019d married, while he wandered around looking for the source of the Nile, never giving her a second thought.</p><p>\u201cLip color,\u201d she said to Lucille. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll wear the diamond-heeled shoes as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Grande Toilette,\u201d Lucille said, and then laughed, a Frenchwoman\u2019s sudden laugh. \u201cThe duke won\u2019t know what happened to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Isidore said with satisfaction. \u201cI had it wrong, Lucille. Eve isn\u2019t the right model. I should be thinking about Cleopatra.\u201d</p> <p>Lucille was wrestling with Isidore\u2019s panniers and just mumbled something.</p><p>\u201cCleopatra sailed down the Nile in a ship plated in gold,\u201d Isidore said dreamily. \u201cMark Antony took one look at her and lost his heart in a moment. And it wasn\u2019t because she looked like a modest wife.\u201d</p><p>Lucille straightened up. \u201cModest will not be the word that comes to the duke\u2019s mind when he sees you in this gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Isidore said, smiling at herself as Lucille dropped a shimmering veil of silver over her head. The bodice fitted as if it were sewn to her body which, in fact, it had been. The fittings had been tedious, but worth every minute. At the waist the silk pulled back in soft billowing folds, revealing an underskirt of blue watered silk. One might not immediately notice the tiny diamonds sewn all over her bodice and skirts, but they made the gown luminescent. It was a gown that turned its wearer into a queen.</p><p>Queen Cleopatra, to be exact.</p> <p>But all the diamonds in the world couldn\u2019t stop the cold fear that gripped Isidore\u2019s heart when she descended the stairs some time later. She was going to meet her husband. For the first time.</p><p>What if he were ugly? Well, he was certain to be weather-beaten, at the very least. Likely there wasn\u2019t good hygiene in Africa, Isidore told herself. Cosway might be missing some teeth. He might be missing an eye! He might be\u2014</p><p>But she stopped herself before she began lopping off his limbs. Whatever he was and however he looked, she would finally have a real husband. She could have children. She could be a real duchess, rather than a woman known to some as the Duchess of Cosway, and to others as Lady Del\u2019Fino. She\u2019d longed for this event for years.</p><p>The thought sustained her as she strolled into Lord Strange\u2019s sitting room. There was a vivid moment of silence as the gentlemen in the room took stock of Isidore\u2014or perhaps more precisely, Isidore\u2019s tiny bodice\u2014followed by such a concerted rush in her direction that she actually flinched. No duke was among them. Cosway had yet to arrive.</p><p>Men were men, she kept telling herself whenever she felt a pulse of nervousness about her husband. French or English, explorer or juggler, the silver gown brought them all to their knees.</p><p>But the sensuality of the gown felt different this time. In the past, she\u2019d ignored men who gaped at her bosom. Now she suddenly realized that a husband\u2019s response involved more than just a lustful gaze. To put it bluntly, Cosway had every right to drag her straight up the stairs.</p> <p>To bed.</p><p>Bed!</p><p>Of course she wanted to sleep with her husband. She was curious, she wanted children, she wanted...she wanted to throw up.</p><p>Her friend Harriet took one look at her and pulled her out of the sitting room\u2014when it happened.</p><p>The front door was open and snow was blowing in. The butler was saying something about unseasonably cold weather, and then...</p><p>A man laughed, and in that instant, Isidore knew. It was Cosway. She could only see his back: he was enormous, wrapped in a greatcoat with a fur hat. She panicked. \u201cI have to go upstairs!\u201d she whispered, stepping backwards, nearly tripping in her eagerness to flee.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Harriet said, holding her arm.</p><p>And it was. The great mountain of a man turned and then, as if there were no one else in the entry, his eyes met hers and he recognized her. He didn\u2019t even glance at her dress, just looked into her eyes. Isidore gulped.</p> <p>Black hair tumbled over his collar as he pulled off his hat and handed it to a butler. But he didn\u2019t take his eyes from hers. His skin looked warm, a honey-dark color that no one could call weather-beaten.</p><p>Without saying a word he swept into a deep bow. Isidore\u2019s lips parted to say\u2014what?\u2014as she watched him bow and then she curtsied, a moment too late. She felt as if she were caught in the acts of the play. He was\u2014</p><p>If Cosway were Mark Antony, Cleopatra would have fallen at his feet, rather than the other way around. He didn\u2019t look like an English duke. He didn\u2019t have powdered hair, or a cravat, or even a waistcoat. He looked untamed.</p><p>\u201cMy duchess, I presume,\u201d he said, catching her hand and kissing it.</p><p>Isidore managed to pull herself together enough to introduce him to Harriet, but her mind was reeling. Somehow in all her imaginings, she\u2019d forgotten to imagine\u2014a man.</p><p>Not a nobleman, with delicate fingernails, and powdered hair. Not a ruffian, like many of the men attending Lord Strange\u2019s house party. But a man who moved easily, like a lion, who seemed to swallow all the air in the entry, whose eyes ranged over her face with a sense of ownership...Her heart was beating so quickly that she couldn\u2019t hear anything.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t one-legged, or toothless. He was probably one of the most beautiful men she\u2019d ever met. She had lost track of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess and I leave in the morning,\u201d he was telling the butler.</p><p>In the morning? Isidore was gripped by a sense of fear so great that she couldn\u2019t imagine even walking to the carriage. If she were utterly honest, she had imagined a man who would be slavishly grateful to discover that his wife was so beautiful. But now...</p><p>She thought she had all the power. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>She had to take command. Cleopatra, she thought desperately. Cleopatra would not allow herself to be transported like a piece of luggage.</p><p>\u201cI myself do not plan to leave for several days,\u201d she said, smiling at him even though her heart was thundering in her chest.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that Cosway wore no cravat. He wore a gorgeous jacket of pale blue, but it was open straight down the front. Long cuffs fell over his hands, the wrist button undone. He looked as if he were ready for bed. The very thought stoked her nerves.</p><p>He took her hand in his, and raised it to his lips again. Isidore watched his lips touch her glove and felt herself shiver.</p><p>\u201cAh, but sweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cI am all eagerness for our wedding.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Isidore just thrilled to the sound of that sweetheart, to the way his eyes warmed her, to the secret shiver she felt in her legs.</p><p>But then she realized what he had said. \u201cWe are wed,\u201d she pointed out, withdrawing her hand from his. He looked amused, so she added: \u201cYou may have ignored the fact for years, but I assure you that it is true.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s where it all went wrong.</p><p>It started there...and it ended with Isidore alone in a bedchamber that night.</p><p>Not to mention, Isidore, still a virgin, on her way to London the next day.</p><p>He might as well have labeled her, the way they did trunks:</p><p>Isidore, property of the duke.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>February 21, 1784</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a virgin and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour husband is a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he won\u2019t bed me.\u201d</p><p>Jemma, Duchess of Beaumont, sank into a chair with a look of almost comical dismay on her face. \u201cDarling, if there ever were grounds for annulment, these are they. Or this is it,\u201d she added with some confusion. \u201cIs he some sort of monk?\u201d</p><p>Isidore shook her head. \u201cNot that I\u2019m able to see. He says he will bed me eventually\u2014just not until we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are married!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. I may call myself Lady Del\u2019Fino, but the truth of the matter is that in the eyes of the law, I\u2019m Duchess of Cosway.\u201d Isidore dropped into a chair opposite her friend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married for eleven years, last I counted. And it\u2019s hardly my fault that my husband is still a virgin. If he hadn\u2019t been chasing all over Africa looking for the source of the Blue Nile, we could be utterly bored with each other, like other well-bred English couples.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. Unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent the last seven years fending off lechers in every court in Europe, waiting for him to return home, and what does he do? Decide we\u2019re not truly married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t he fall directly into your bed, virgin or no?\u201d</p><p>Isidore glanced at herself in Jemma\u2019s glass. Men had lusted for her ever since she turned sixteen, and the particulars hadn\u2019t changed: black hair, pale skin, generous bosom. In short, something short of Venus, but delectable enough to send most men into a lustful frenzy.</p><p>\u201cOne has to assume that Cosway is fascinated by the exotic,\u201d Jemma continued, \u201cand you have such a deliciously un-English look about you. Your eyes are a gorgeous shape, not like the little raisins most of us have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as exotic,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cand more to the point, he seems to want someone more skilled in a domestic capacity. Not more than ten minutes after we met\u2014for the first time!\u2014he inquired whether I had been doing any weaving lately. Weaving? Was I supposed to whip out a spindle and sew a fine seam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven I know that one doesn\u2019t sew with a spindle, which implies that Cosway has a gross disappointment in store if he\u2019s counting on your domestic skills,\u201d Jemma said, laughing. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s the type that babbles when faced by a desirable woman. It\u2019s a surprisingly common affliction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I was watching him closely, and he gave no sign of being overcome by lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven Beaumont, who hardly notes anything outside the House of Lords, told me after my masquerade that you had the most beautiful mouth of any woman in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont said that?\u201d Isidore said, feeling a little thrill of pleasure. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. Though I have to say, Jemma, I shouldn\u2019t like my husband to praise other women to my face.\u201d</p><p>Jemma shrugged. \u201cAccording to your own assessment, as a well-bred English couple, we are merely adhering to type. I don\u2019t think you should panic, Isidore. I expect Cosway is madly attracted to you and he\u2019s just conveying his deep respect by holding a ceremony in front of a bishop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s deranged,\u201d Isidore said flatly. \u201cIt must have been all that sun in Africa. We married by proxy, but it was still a marriage. I was only twelve years old, but I remember it perfectly well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jemma said, rallying, \u201cmaybe the duke wants a romantic ceremony now that he\u2019s returned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd maybe he\u2019s utterly mad and bizarre,\u201d Isidore said, putting her fear into words. \u201cWhat sort of man stays a virgin until he\u2019s near to thirty? That\u2019s almost disgusting. How am I supposed to introduce him to the bedroom, Jemma? Men do this sort of thing on their own. Honestly, if he\u2019s never used his equipment\u2014well, who\u2019s to say that it will function at all?\u201d</p><p>Silence answered her.</p><p>Isidore could feel her eyes growing hot. \u201cI just want to have my husband go to bed with me so that I can be a proper duchess, use my title, and have a child. Is that too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>Jemma reached over and took one of her hands. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, darling.\u201d</p><p>Tears started sliding down Isidore\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI was never unfaithful to Cosway. The Comte de Salmont told me\u2014in rhymed couplets\u2014that I was more delicious than a 1764 cognac, and given his cellars, that was a true compliment. I finally returned to Italy because Salmont was so extravagant in his pursuit, but I didn\u2019t sleep with him, even when he threatened to kill himself.\u201d She sniffed, and Jemma handed her a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cI kept to my part of the bargain, although any woman in her right mind would expect her husband to show himself when she came of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildhood marriages are a huge mistake,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI shall never allow Beaumont to arrange one for a child of ours. People should be adults when they marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fussy. Truly I\u2019m not. I may have flirted with men as handsome as Salmont, but I like men of other types too. Even short ones. I\u2019ve told myself for years that no matter how Cosway looked when he finally staggered out of the jungle, I would do my marital part charitably if not enthusiastically. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he unacceptable?\u201d Jemma asked with some curiosity.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh\u2014no,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. His looks are irrelevant. He\u2019s manifestly odd. Odd!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another idea. Perhaps Cosway is just too intelligent to have interested himself in carnal matters.\u201d</p><p>Isidore gave her a watery smile. \u201cShow me the man who\u2019s too intelligent to use his tool, and I\u2019ll show you a dunce.\u201d The words came out more harshly than she intended.</p><p>\u201cThe most obvious explanation is that he\u2019s following some sort of religious law. Did he say anything about going to church? Likely he\u2019s a Puritan. Aren\u2019t they terrifyingly severe when it comes to base appetites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent almost no time alone with him,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cand if he has converted to a puritanical sect, he neglected to inform me. He arrived at the house party, scooped me up as if I were a parcel he\u2019d left behind, announced that we were to be remarried, and dropped me in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, dropped you in London?\u201d Jemma said, frowning. \u201cDropped you where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Nerot\u2019s Hotel,\u201d Isidore said dispiritedly. \u201cWe stayed there last night. I hardly need say that we didn\u2019t share a room. He told me\u2014without asking my opinion\u2014that I should wait in the hotel until he returned from his estate.\u201d</p><p>Jemma cleared her throat. \u201cObviously Cosway is not au courant as regards English customs. What did you reply?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much or as sharply as you might expect. He assumed that I would unthinkingly obey him, and though I can hardly believe it, I did. Now all I can think of are the cutting things that I should have said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve discovered one of the primary activities of married life, and so quickly too,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost weeks formulating the witty remarks that I should have said to Beaumont.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did manage to tell him that I would stay with you rather than remain in the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you discuss this hotel business on the way to London from the house party?\u201d</p><p>It was humiliating to admit the truth of it. \u201cHe barely entered the carriage before he fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCosway fell asleep after meeting you for the first time? Meeting his wife for the first time?\u201d</p> <p>Isidore nodded. \u201cI believe the truth of it is that I am not what he expected, Jemma, and certainly not what he wanted. When he arrived, the night before, he seemed taken aback by my gown. I was wearing my silver gown. Do you remember that costume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could forget the twist of cloth pretending to be a bodice. I\u2019ve seen larger diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed to me that from the view of convenience, not to mention desire, that the gown was the perfect welcome to a missing husband,\u201d Isidore said with a deep sigh. \u201cWhen I wore it in Paris, the Comte de Salmont said\u2014well, never mind what he said. My husband just asked if my taste was always this unorthodox. I did not take that to be a compliment. He then retired to bed. By himself, one hardly need add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew men could resist you in that gown,\u201d Jemma said, a frown pleating her forehead.</p><p>\u201cThe following morning,\u201d Isidore said with a sniff, \u201che ordered everything packed up and I barely said goodbye to Harriet before he bundled me into the carriage. Whereupon he went to sleep rather than talk to me. I\u2019ve married a monster!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he is indeed a monster, then you needn\u2019t stay married to him,\u201d Jemma said practically.</p><p>\u201cHow can I not? He\u2019s planning a wedding celebration in the chapel at Revels House. Which means that I have the prospect of seeing my mother-in-law, a pleasure that I have carefully avoided for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jemma, I forgot to tell you this part! While he was in Africa, he went to the wedding of a princess. It lasted four days. Or perhaps fourteen, with constant feasts and entertainments. I have a terrible suspicion that he\u2019s planning something like that for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really doesn\u2019t seem very English, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the most unusual aspect of it,\u201d Isidore said, putting down her handkerchief. \u201cI gather the wedding culminated in an orgy, though given Cosway\u2019s lack of interest in acts of intimacy\u2014at least with me\u2014I would surmise that he does not plan to mimic this particular aspect of the royal wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn orgy. Not to mention the fact that the participants drank warm blood from a sacrificed cow as part of a fertility ritual.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s mouth fell open. Then she said, \u201cCosway is holding the wedding celebration at his estate, at Revels House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect the Archbishop of Canterbury would look askance at warm blood, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his mother will be there?\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWarm blood,\u201d Jemma said. She covered her mouth but a giggle escaped. \u201cCan you just see him passing a cup of that to his mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dowager is one of the most upright, English\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe could be the queen!\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThe queen! She\u2019s that rigid. I know this is really crass, darling, and obviously you\u2019re going to have to annul the marriage on grounds of pure insanity, but may I have an invitation to the wedding, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps to laugh about it,\u201d Isidore said with a sniff.</p><p>Jemma got up and perched on the arm of Isidore\u2019s chair. \u201cMarriage is a great destroyer of logic, but I do think it\u2019s a benefit to begin with a sane husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen the way he was dressed. No wig, no hair powder. No cravat! He had a lovely coat, but it was open down the front, with no waistcoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see him,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it unkind to pay a visit to Bedlam just to laugh at the patients, but if a madman is walking among us...Truly, at this point you should probably visit a solicitor, Isidore. Beaumont\u2019s offices are in the Inns of Court so he\u2019s surrounded by men of that profession. He can point out a good one.\u201d</p><p>Isidore sniffed again. \u201cI wish my mother were alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could lend you my mother-in-law, if you like,\u201d Jemma offered, giving her a hug.</p><p>\u201cIs she the one who populated your house with pictures of Judith holding Holofernes\u2019s head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! She obviously had a fractious relationship with my father-in-law and came up with creative ways to express herself. She might be just what you need to give the wedding celebration an extra little something.\u201d</p><p>Isidore leaned her head against Jemma\u2019s arm. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how desperately hopeful I was until Cosway walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it instantly apparent that he\u2019s mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He looks like a muscled explorer, all browned by the sun, and rather wild. He has a big nose, but he looks all man, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut then he turned out to be so very unmanly. The virginity, for example, is so disconcerting. I\u2019m afraid he might tell everyone at the wedding,\u201d she burst out.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not ashamed. He says it\u2019s the best gift he could have brought me. I\u2019m going to be the laughingstock of all England. Isidore, the Virgin Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I think of it, Isidore, if my husband had been a virgin when we married, he wouldn\u2019t have had a mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne has to assume not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were the case, we would have had a chance at a decent marriage,\u201d Jemma pointed out.</p><p>Isidore sighed. \u201cI certainly won\u2019t have to fend off other women. Believe me, once the ton gets wind of his odd ideas, there\u2019ll be no competition for his dubious charms.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s arm tightened around her. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it would be better to initiate annulment proceedings now on the grounds of nonconsummation, or just get the marriage annulled later, on the grounds of mental instability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCosway is probably going back to Africa in any case,\u201d Isidore said dispiritedly. \u201cHe won\u2019t be around for the proceedings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a Red or a Green Nile to trace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would know? I thought the Nile was in Egypt somewhere, but he talked of Abyssinia. I can\u2019t say that I had much education in geography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s really going back to Africa,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cthen you might want to stay married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the title, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019ll stay around long enough to create an heir, and then he can wander off for a decade or so.\u201d</p><p>Isidore got up, walked a few nervous steps before she blurted out her darkest fear. \u201cIf he\u2019s capable of making an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not, then you know what you have to do. Your first duty to the title is to produce an heir, and if the duke isn\u2019t capable, then you find a man to do the deed. That\u2019s a fact of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of that,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cdidn\u2019t you move back to England precisely to give Beaumont an heir?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeaumont doesn\u2019t want to engage in heir-making activities until I finish the chess match I started with the Duke of Villiers. But Villiers is still recovering from brain fever and his doctor won\u2019t allow him to play chess. Which is actually a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Beaumont and I are getting to know each other,\u201d Jemma said lightly.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet not intimately?\u201d</p> <p>Jemma started laughing. \u201cYou would put up with the warm blood, the orgies, and the unpowdered hair, if only your husband would take you to bed, Isidore. Isn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d</p><p>Isidore felt a pulse of humiliation, but after all, Jemma was her dearest friend. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-three,\u201d she said. \u201cTwenty-three! I\u2019m curious! You should see the way Harriet acts with Lord Strange when they think no one is looking. I came across them kissing in a corridor, and the air fairly scorched around them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Isidore,\u201d Jemma said, meaning it. \u201cThough I feel compelled to tell you that the whole bedroom experience is rather overrated, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been easier if Cosway expressed the slightest interest in the occasion. At this rate, I\u2019m going to terrify the man if we ever get to a bedchamber.\u201d She took another nervous turn around the chamber.</p><p>\u201cI think you should probably prepare for the worst,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt seems very likely to me that incapability lies at the heart of this situation. It would explain why he\u2019s a virgin, and also why he\u2019s making such a fuss out of the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother wedding delays the inevitable. Perhaps he\u2019s thinking that although he may not have functioned in previous attempts\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharing a cup of warm blood will make it all better?\u201d Isidore couldn\u2019t help it. She started laughing again, a kind of laughter halfway between joy and despair.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThat sounds just like something a man would think up.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Revels House</p> <p>Country Seat of the Duke of Cosway</p><p>February 21, 1784</p><p>Simeon Jermyn, Duke of Cosway, expected to feel an overwhelming tide of emotion when his carriage drew up before Revels House. After all, he hadn\u2019t seen his childhood home in well over ten years. He arrived just before twilight, when the lowering sun made every turret and angle (and Revels House had many) look sharp and clear against the fading blue sky.</p><p>Of course he was poised to quell any such unwelcome emotion. As a follower of the Middle Way, he understood that to live in peace was to anticipate the danger of chaos. Revels House reeked of chaos: even as a mere child he had longed to escape his parents\u2019 pitched battles, his father\u2019s frenzied speeches, his mother\u2019s fierce claims of privilege. They sent him to Eton, but that meant that he had free access to a library full of books describing countries unlike his own. Families unlike his own.</p><p>Of course, it was possible that when he came home to the sleepy, tamed English countryside, with Revels House sitting in the midst like a plump teapot, he would be overcome by a sense of righteous pride.</p><p>But instead of pride, he found himself looking at the fields as they drew closer and marking their neglected appearance. The gravel on the long drive wasn\u2019t just unraked; great swaths of the road were nothing more than ruts carved from dry mud. The trees hadn\u2019t been pollarded in years.</p><p>Instead of pride\u2014or joy\u2014he felt an unwelcome prickle of guilt, which intensified as he climbed from the carriage to find a broken window in the east wing, and bricks that badly needed pointing.</p><p>At least Honeydew, the family\u2019s butler, looked the same. For a moment it felt as if Simeon had never left home. Honeydew\u2019s three-tiered wig still ended in a stubby tail in the back; his frock was cut in the style of twenty years ago, and lined with brass buttons. Only his face had changed: years ago, Honeydew had a youngish, mournful face, from which his nose jutted like some sort of miserable mistake. Now Honeydew had an older, mournful face. It suited him. He used to look like a boy who had unexpectedly discovered a dead body; now he looked like a man who had judged life and found it wanting.</p> <p>A moment later Simeon walked into his mother\u2019s sitting room. Some of his earliest memories involved interminable lectures delivered in this room. His mother believed in driving her points home with enthusiasm\u2014and repetition. On one occasion she had taken a full hour to inform him that a gentleman does not curl his lip at a portrait of an ancestor. Even if the said ancestor looked like a silly booby in a ridiculous frill.</p><p>Like Honeydew, the Dowager Duchess looked the same...and yet not the same.</p><p>She sat bolt upright on a settee, her skirts occupying whatever space was not taken up by her bottom. He knew little of current women\u2019s fashions, though styles had obviously changed since he left England. Yet his mother seemed to be wearing clothing from twenty years ago.</p><p>She rose and he saw her embroidered bodice, decorated with a ladder of bows down the front, and revised his estimation: more than twenty years ago. In truth, her costume was precisely as he remembered, from her tall white linen cap to her train. It was only her face that had changed. He remembered her bursting with authority and life, her rosy cheeks and sharp eyes epitomizing the model of duchess-as-general. But now she looked wrinkled and surprised, like an apple gone soft after a winter in the cellar. She looked old.</p><p>She extended a hand. He fell to one knee and kissed her beringed finger. \u201cCosway,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust that you recovered your wife from that den of iniquity.\u201d He had arrived in London to find alarmed letters directing him to travel immediately to a country house party to rescue Isidore. Which he had done.</p><p>\u201cMother, I missed you these twelve years,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes sharpened and he saw a trace of the woman he remembered, one who abhorred any display of emotion other than disdain and disappointment.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she said, her voice glacial. Then he remembered how many hundreds\u2014nay thousands\u2014of his comments had been received with that single, damning word. \u201cYou will forgive me for doubting your word, since you were at liberty to return at any time.\u201d</p><p>It was a fair point. \u201cOn receiving your note,\u201d he offered by way of amelioration, \u201cI traveled to Fonthill. My wife was perfectly fit.\u201d He paused for a moment, wondering if he was supposed to report on the state of his bride\u2019s virginity.</p><p>\u201cI trust you both left the environs immediately.\u201d</p><p>She folded her hands together. It was almost impossible to see her knuckles due to the flare of jewels. He remembered that about his mother too: she was like a magpie in her delight in shiny things, jewels, gold, silver.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the duchess? She should be here with you. Your responsibilities to the Cosway line of descent have been sadly neglected.\u201d</p><p>Simeon couldn\u2019t help wondering if his mother intended to monitor how often he visited his wife\u2019s bedchamber. \u201cIsidore is in London. She will remain there while I prepare a wedding celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding! You are married; what need have you for a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were married by proxy. I should like to celebrate our vows properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff and humbug!\u201d his mother snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s one and same with those other romantic notions with which you always stuffed your head! Rubbish!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsidore agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsidore? Isidore? Who is Isidore? Are you, by any chance, referring to your wife, the Duchess of Cosway, by her personal name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p> <p>Now they were on familiar ground. The groundswell of a lecture rolled toward him. He sat down, remembering a second too late that he should have asked her permission.</p><p>But he settled back into his chair rather than spring to his feet. The lecture, which began with his impertinent behavior in referring to his wife by her given name and deviated into the disgraceful, un-English nature of that name (Isidore), swelled like a river in springtime, giving him time to catalog perplexing aspects of his return.</p><p>His mother was brilliantly dressed in figured silk. But her chamber had faded, the hangings and upholstery apparently not having been touched since long before his father died three years ago. The house didn\u2019t even smell good. There was an underlying miasma that hinted of the privy. Had no one noticed?</p><p>He would have returned to England sooner, had there been a problem with money. His solicitor forwarded the estate summary every year and at no time did it indicate a shortage of funds to furbish the house, to pollard the trees, or to keep the fields in good trim.</p><p>It was a long hour.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Revels House</p><p>February 22, 1784</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going dressed like that?\u201d The Dowager Duchess of Cosway was no stranger to a shriek, but on this occasion she excelled. Any reasonable elephant would have stampeded.</p><p>\u201cRunning,\u201d Simeon answered. For propriety\u2019s sake he had pulled on a simple tunic; he usually ran bare-chested, dressed only in short trousers.</p><p>\u201cRunning to what?\u201d his brother Godfrey asked, following their mother into the entry.</p> <p>It was a reasonable question. Simeon had outrun the occasional lion (but only with the help of a friendly tree). He had failed to outrun a crocodile and almost got eaten as a punishment. There was nothing to outrun in the prim English countryside that surrounded Revels House; one had the feeling that not even wolves dared intrude on the duchy\u2019s herds.</p><p>\u201cI just like to run,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s excellent exercise and I enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>His mother and brother spoke at the same moment. \u201cWhat are those shoes?\u201d Godfrey asked, and \u201cYou must stop that practice at once,\u201d his mother commanded.</p><p>Simeon sighed. \u201cShall we retire to the drawing room and discuss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drawing room?\u201d his mother asked. \u201cWith you\u2014with you unclothed as you\u2014\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to be able to continue, just flapped her hand in the air.</p><p>Godfrey was just the age to be enjoying himself enormously. The only way Simeon could explain the fact that he had a thirteen-year-old brother, when he himself was almost thirty, was to picture his mother and father having a prolonged and energetic marital life. Given that his mother had a look of perpetual outrage and a figure that resembled a cone-shaped beehive, he refused to imagine it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not clothed,\u201d Godfrey said, laughing madly. \u201cI can see your knees!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to run like this,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cWould you like to try it? I have several spare trousers of this nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to contaminate him!\u201d his mother blustered.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cYou may address me as Your Grace when we are in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I invite you to my private chambers, we are in public!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Simeon ignored this. \u201cWhen I return, if you would be so kind as to grant me the honor of an audience for a mere five minutes, I would be most grateful.\u201d He swept a bow, a duke\u2019s bow.</p><p>\u201cThe honor of an audience?\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cDo you say that to savages when you meet them, Simeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not address the duke with such familiarity,\u201d the duchess snapped at Godfrey.</p><p>Simeon winked at his brother and pulled open the front door before Honeydew could reach it. Then he tore down the steps, leaving his family temporarily behind.</p><p>Two minutes later he was running down a neglected lane behind his estate. The estate could fairly well be summed up by the word neglected. He pushed that unpleasant thought away and fell into the physical pleasure of feeling his legs pound against the ground, his heart race, the wind tug his hair back from his head.</p><p>He had learned about running for pleasure, rather than for escape, from an Abyssinian mountain king named Bahrnagash. To cross into Abyssinia by the mountain pass, one must appease Bahrnagash. Given that the man was famous for putting strangers to death and dividing their possessions among his tribesmen, Simeon had been a bit concerned.</p><p>When Simeon was challenged to a race\u2014the reward for winning being his life and the lives of his men\u2014he thought he had a decent chance. Bahrnagash turned out to be a little man with a close-shaven head, wearing a cowl and a pair of short trousers. He had to be fifty years old. He wore no shoes, and showed no inclination to remove his coarse girdle, into which was stuck a heavy knife. Simeon estimated he could run his way to freedom.</p><p>They gathered in the great courtyard of the mountain fortress. Simeon\u2019s cavalcade cheered with all the lustiness of men wildly outnumbered, and picturing themselves sliced open from gullet to gizzard. Bahrnagash\u2019s men cheered with the enthusiasm of men seeing horses for the first time, and knowing a good thing when they saw it.</p><p>A gun cracked\u2014and Bahrnagash leapt away like a man possessed. He ran up the pass as if he were a mountain goat. Simeon ran after, head down, heart pounding.</p><p>Bahrnagash ran straight up, leaping from rock to rock. Simeon followed, his longer legs allowing him to cover ground quickly, though his lungs were burning.</p><p>Bahrnagash was in his stride now, and they ran on and on. The air was thin and Simeon\u2019s head started swimming. He thought blearily that he couldn\u2019t possibly win the race, so he might as well die trying.</p><p>Three hours later Simeon collapsed. Bahrnagash hesitated, waited, returned. Simeon\u2019s chest hurt so much that he thought there might be blood in his lungs.</p><p>After a while, he sat up and asked whether Bahrnagash intended to stab him and leave his body for the jackals, or whether they would return to the fortress first.</p><p>Bahrnagash was picking his teeth with his great knife. He grinned, every huge white tooth visible. No challenger had ever survived three hours, and rather than kill Simeon, Bahrnagash thought he\u2019d like to have him in his army.</p><p>It took several weeks for Simeon to convince his new mentor to let him continue into Abyssinia. \u201cNo one even knows why they are fighting in that country,\u201d Bahrnagash told him grumpily, \u201cbut they always are.

The news reached him relatively soon after the event, a mere two months after the funeral. Simeon had been traveling through Palmyra, going to Damascus. He had ducked into an English church that loomed up on a Damascene street and offered prayers.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t until he walked through the door of Revels House that he really understood. His burly father\u2014the man who had thrown him in the air, and thrown him on a horse, and thrown him out of the hay loft once for gross impertinence\u2014that man was gone.</p><p>The house seemed like a dry well, empty and lifeless. His mother had turned into a shrill, screaming dictator. His little brother was plump and indolent. The estate was neglected. Even in the house itself, things were cracked and broken. The rugs were stained; the curtains were faded.</p><p>Whose fault is it? asked his conscience.</p> <p>I\u2019m here now, he retorted.</p><p>He was back in England, to clean up the estate, manage his family, meet his wife.</p><p>His wife.</p><p>Another subject that he could examine only cautiously. He\u2019d probably mishandled their first meeting. She was the opposite of what he expected. The Middle Way taught that beauty was only an outward shell, but Isidore\u2019s beauty flared from within, as potent as a torch. She was like a princess, only he\u2019d never seen a princess who had all her teeth.</p><p>At the very thought of her he had to slow down, because of confusion in his body about what he wanted to be doing at that moment. Running? Or\u2014</p> <p>The other.</p><p>He adjusted the front of his trousers and started to run faster.</p><p>Luncheon began on the wrong foot when Honeydew served bowls of thin broth. Simeon had forgotten that foolish English idea that broth was filling or, indeed, suitable for anyone but a wretched invalid.</p><p>He was ravenously hungry, having run an extra hour in a punitive effort to regain control over his body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for the next course,\u201d he told Honeydew.</p><p>Honeydew nodded, but Simeon thought he saw anxiety in his eyes. The table was lit with tallow candles fit only for the servants\u2019 quarters, so Simeon couldn\u2019t see his face very clearly, but the reason for Honeydew\u2019s anxiety was soon clear. Next they were each served one paper-thin slice of roast beef.</p> <p>The following course was even more surprising. Simeon stared down at a sliced hard-boiled egg, across which was drizzled a brownish sauce, and lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cHoneydew,\u201d he said, keeping his voice even with an effort, \u201cwould you be so kind as to detail the menu?\u201d</p><p>His mother intervened. \u201cI designed the menu, as is necessary and proper. You can thank me, if you wish. This is a dish of oeufs au lapin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggs,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a sauce made from rabbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely you have grown accustomed to rough fare,\u201d she commented.</p><p>Godfrey was forking up his egg with a sort of desperate enthusiasm that made Simeon wonder about the next course.</p> <p>There wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>\u201cYou must be joking,\u201d Simeon said, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cWe had eggs and meat in the same meal,\u201d his mother said, staring at him. \u201cAnd a sustaining broth to start. We do not eat lions\u2019 flesh in England, you know! Your father and I always kept a moderate table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a moderate table,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cThis is starvation fare.\u201d</p><p>Godfrey leaned across the table and whispered loudly, \u201cOne of the footmen will bring you a large plate of bread and cheese before bed if you wish, Simeon. Sometimes there\u2019s drippings as well.\u201d</p><p>Their mother clearly heard, but she curled her lip and stared at the opposite wall.</p><p>No wonder the poor boy was round. Since his mother was not providing the food a growing boy needed, he had learned to hoard like a hungry beggar\u2014and overeat when he had a chance. Simeon turned to the butler. \u201cHoneydew, ask Mrs. Bullock to send whatever she can serve up within a few minutes, and I do not mean bread and cheese.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew bowed and hastened from the room. His mother huffed and averted her eyes as if Simeon had belched in her presence.</p><p>But Godfrey asked, rather shyly, \u201cHave you ever eaten a lion, brother?\u201d</p><p>The dowager duchess opened her mouth and Godfrey amended his question, \u201cYour Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on a regular basis,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cThere are tribes in the Barbary states who depend on lions as a source of food. I assure you that if they did not eat an occasional lion or two, the lions would multiply and gobble them instead.\u201d</p><p>It was amazing the way his mother could convey utter disdain without glancing at him or saying a word. He turned back to Godfrey, whose eyes were shining with interest. \u201cI once ate a stew composed of three different lions, as I understood it. It was rather gamey and tough, and not a flavor that I would wish to repeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten a snake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d their mother said sharply.</p><p>That was all the conversation enjoyed at the Duke of Cosway\u2019s dinner table.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>February 22, 1784</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose that if I ordered a particularly enticing nightdress it might arouse him? Or do you suppose that nothing can arouse him at all? Jemma, do you know anyone we could ask about male incapability?\u201d</p><p>Jemma wrinkled her nose. \u201cMust we talk of this over breakfast, Isidore? Since the poor man has never seen a nightdress in his life, I advise simplicity. Ribbons rather than laces, for example. He might not be able to handle laces.\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked down at her coddled eggs and felt a little nauseated. \u201cI really do wish my mother were alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would your mother do in this situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would laugh. She used to laugh a great deal. She was Italian, you know, and she thought Englishmen were very foolish. Mind you, my father was Italian and she thought he was just as foolish as the worst Englishman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were sailing. A sudden squall came up and swamped their boat.\u201d She was able to say it now, years later, without her voice breaking. Which was something of an achievement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Jemma said. And being Jemma, she looked genuinely sorry.</p><p>\u201cAt least I have memories of her and Papa. And the aunt who raised me afterwards was truly wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she from your mother\u2019s side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she was my father\u2019s sister. She accompanied me to the Cosway estate after the funeral; people thought that since I was affianced to a duke, it made sense for his mother to raise me. Since Cosway had reached his eighteenth year, we went through the proxy marriage. But I was clearly miserable living there, so my aunt snatched me away shortly thereafter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine that the duchess must be an appalling companion. I met her only once, but she gave me a strict set-down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duchess\u2014or dowager duchess, rather\u2014does not believe in grief,\u201d Isidore said, remembering. \u201cShe told me so repeatedly. I think she was quite happy to see the back of me, although she tried to make me return once she learned more of my aunt.\u201d</p><p>Jemma raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt is a violinist. She told the duchess she would take me to live with my father\u2019s relatives in Italy, but in fact we traveled around Europe as she gave concerts. We lived in Venice on and off, but we went farther afield as well, to Prussia, France, Brussels, Prague...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow unusual.\u201d And, after a moment: \u201cThe Duchess of Cosway\u2019s daughter-in-law in company with a traveling musician.\u201d Jemma grinned. \u201cIs your aunt still alive?\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded. \u201cShe leads a rather quiet life now. A few years ago she professed herself tired of wandering about Europe. We kept expecting that Cosway would return. So we would say, one last trip to Vienna! But somehow there was always another trip, and never a message from Cosway. She moved to Wales when I turned twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She married a painter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Anyone I might have heard of?\u201d</p><p>Isidore said it reluctantly. \u201cOne of the Sargents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Owen Sargent! The man who painted Lord Lucien Jourdain in the nude with just a bunch of violets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must have seen the portrait,\u201d Jemma said, delighted. \u201cWere the violets just where you might expect? And did he wear his wig? I heard so, but I couldn\u2019t countenance it.\u201d</p> <p>Isidore sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened, but I\u2019m so much more strait-laced than my family. Do you know, Jemma, I really didn\u2019t wish to see Lord Jourdain without his clothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsidore...\u201d Jemma said imploringly.</p><p>\u201cOf course he wore a wig. And a patch. I remember being surprised by the size of his\u2014ahem\u2014violets.\u201d Isidore picked up her cold tea and drank a sip, put it down again. \u201cPerhaps I should follow Cosway to the country and force the question, Jemma. I can strip myself naked in his bedchamber and see how he responds. If he responds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on how much you wish to be a duchess,\u201d Jemma replied. \u201cIt could be embarrassing for both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to be a duchess. I\u2019ve thought of myself as a duchess for years. And all those years I told myself that I would accept whatever sort of man the duke turned out to be. I steeled myself to accept a man with one leg, or any number of vices. I just kept telling myself that I wanted to be truly married, to be able to have children, and stop living this half existence.\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded. \u201cI absolutely understand, darling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the real difference between a one-legged and a mad husband? I can tolerate this sort of derangement on a daily basis. He doesn\u2019t hear voices the way Lord Crumple does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderfully brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Cosway is unable to respond to me...perhaps not.\u201d Isidore pushed all her eggs to one side of her plate. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine myself choosing a consort simply in order to provide an heir. I\u2019m not a very adventuresome woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost women would not be in your untouched state, given a husband who didn\u2019t return from Africa for this many years. You are, as they say in the Bible, a pearl above price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a tedious pearl,\u201d Isidore said, moving all her eggs across the plate again. \u201cI realized that during my stay at Lord Strange\u2019s estate. I don\u2019t want to have interesting conversations about French letters, or watch dissolute plays featuring half-naked mythological gods. And I don\u2019t want a marriage predicated on my need to find a substitute in the bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should certainly determine if Cosway is capable,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIf he is not, you can annul the marriage. If he is, you can resign yourself to his eccentricities.\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded. She had read Tacitus on how to conduct a war, and Machiavelli on how to conquer a kingdom. She could launch a campaign so overwhelming that her husband would never know what hit him. The dowager duchess was almost certainly attempting to convince her son to wear clothing befitting a duke. Well, Isidore was going to spend her time trying to get him out of those same clothes.</p><p>She pushed her plate away. Advance planning was crucial to any plan of war. \u201cIf I send a message to Signora Angelico, she will send me a nightdress on an urgent basis.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant trap. A capable man, presented with such a nightdress and your figure inside, will react swiftly. If not...\u201d</p><p>Isidore reached up and pulled the bell cord to summon her maid. Cosway\u2019s days as a bachelor\u2014and a virgin\u2014were numbered.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Revels House</p><p>February 22, 1784</p><p>Simeon\u2019s father had rarely made use of his study. He was an outdoors sort of man. Simeon\u2019s happiest childhood memories were of afternoons spent tramping through wet forests, looking for game.</p><p>It made him uneasy to walk into his father\u2019s study and sit down behind his great oak desk. He felt as if his father would erupt back into life, bellowing at him. Simeon shook his head. His greatest teacher, Valamksepa, had taught him the importance of maintaining peace by exerting personal control. He could hear the man\u2019s soft voice in his ear, telling him that hunger, pain, thirst, lust...all of those things were nothing more than insects biting at the soul.</p><p>A man walked through life on the path he created for himself. He did not allow pettiness to lead him astray. Valamksepa\u2019s teachings had kept Simeon calm in the face of tribal unrest, the death of half his camel-drivers from intestinal fever, and fierce sandstorms. This was nothing in comparison.</p><p>Simeon took a deep cleansing breath and sat down, pushing aside stacks of paper. Then he paused and looked again. An undated bill of trading for purchase of thatchery materials, presumably for mending village roofs. He looked at the next one. An imploring letter from a cottager, requesting winter wheat. His mother\u2019s spidery handwriting noted, \u201cDone.\u201d He glanced through the first ten or fifteen. Only a very few contained his mother\u2019s notations; the rest appeared to have been ignored.</p><p>Anger is nothing more than the other side of fear...and both drive a man to his knees. A man never falls to his knees from anger, lust, or fear. The three most dangerous emotions.</p><p>Simeon picked up a few more of the papers and read them. Valamksepa had forgotten to speak of guilt.</p><p>Hours later, he raised his head from a stack of papers and stared blearily at his butler.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, would you like me to bring you a light breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Simeon ran a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven in the morning. Your Grace ought to go to bed,\u201d Honeydew said disapprovingly.</p><p>Had he really stayed up all night? He had. And yet more papers awaited, stacked in crazy piles around the desk. He\u2019d found a new cache at four in the morning, letters from solicitors pleading for their clients\u2019 payments, letters from his father\u2019s solicitors containing information about the estate, about investments...The only thing that seemed to characterize this particular pile was that they were written on hot-pressed paper rather than foolscap.</p><p>Could it be that his mother hadn\u2019t responded because she didn\u2019t like the type of paper the writers employed?</p><p>The very idea of asking her made him want to groan.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast,\u201d Honeydew prompted.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt you would like to bathe before eating,\u201d the butler said, \u201cI shall order a footman to prepare one for you directly.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a hint. It was more like a royal command.</p><p>\u201cI have a few more papers to read,\u201d Simeon said. At some point people in his household would have to stop treating him like the rebellious sixteen-year-old boy he had once been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes later he raised his head. \u201cAh, Honeydew. I forgot to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is now one o\u2019clock,\u201d Honeydew informed him.</p><p>Simeon looked with some surprise at the tray next to him. Apparently, he\u2019d eaten all the toast without noticing.</p><p>\u201cThose papers have been waiting for years, Your Grace. Surely a night or two won\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome\u2014nay, many\u2014of these papers extend back into the days when my father was alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The butler\u2019s face was utterly inexpressive.</p><p>\u201cYet my father didn\u2019t suffer a long illness; he died in a carriage accident. How could\u2014\u201d Simeon bit off the words. It wasn\u2019t appropriate to ask the butler why his father had stopped answering estate mail.</p><p>And yet it was true. Incredibly, it seemed that his father had made a practice of not paying bills until he absolutely had to, until letters from solicitors reached hysterical and unpleasant depths. He knew. He\u2019d found all the letters. He even thought there was a system to it: his father paid after the fourth or fifth dunning letter, and then quite frequently only part of the bill.</p><p>Apparently tradesmen were so happy to receive a few pence on the pound that they ceased their complaints. It was inconceivable.</p> <p>Well, perhaps it was conceivable in the case of a man with no substance. Yet the Duke of Cosway could hardly be described as poor.</p><p>Simeon kept turning back to the estate books, neatly kept, neatly laid out. The estate was thriving. He couldn\u2019t explain how or why. There had been no improvements made in years. His father had fired the estate manager years ago. But it was. He could pay off all the outstanding bills and feel no pinch.</p><p>So why had his father done it?</p><p>There was only one person who could tell him, and he didn\u2019t wish to speak to her.</p><p>\u201cMr. Kinnaird has arrived, Your Grace,\u201d Honeydew said.</p><p>Thank God. His father had somehow neglected to fire Kinnaird, the manager of his London properties, perhaps because he didn\u2019t see him often. \u201cSend him in immediately, please.\u201d</p> <p>Kinnaird entered, bowing. He was a tall, nervous-looking man with a skinny bottom that showed to no great advantage in his short frock-coat. With it he wore horizontally striped stockings, undoubtedly because his valet thought the effect would give his legs more breadth.</p><p>\u201cKinnaird,\u201d Simeon snapped, thinking that the man looked like a fool. And then: A fool to whom I cheerfully dispatched thousands of pounds worth of fabric and jewels over the years.</p><p>His hand tightened under the table, but he made his voice affable enough. \u201cPlease, sit down, Mr. Kinnaird. I do apologize for my brusque greeting just now. I find myself worried by the state of Revels House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntirely understandable,\u201d Mr. Kinnaird said, rather unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell me where all the fabrics and other items that I sent my mother over the years might be found?\u201d Simeon asked.</p><p>\u201cThe East Warehouse in Southwark,\u201d Mr. Kinnaird replied. He pulled out a small black notebook and opened it. \u201cYou first sent ten boxes of stuffs from India in 1776, Your Grace. Those were stored in the upper reaches of the warehouse. As they arrived, succeeding goods were numbered and placed in similar shelving. In 1779, we purchased the warehouse, the better to maintain security. It is guarded around the clock, and all goods are dry and free of infestations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the stones and other nonfabric goods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJewels were sent on two occasions, arriving in England in March 1781 and in November 1783. On neither occasion did I judge our warehouse to be sufficiently secure. Those materials are stowed at Hoare\u2019s bank in London. I have here the bills of deposit, co-signed by the bank manager, myself, and the captain of the vessel in question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Kinnaird,\u201d Simeon said, \u201cI have misjudged you. I\u2019m afraid that when I entered this house and realized the state it was in, I jumped to the worst of all possible conclusions.\u201d</p><p>Kinnaird looked about him. \u201cI cannot take offense, Your Grace. The truth is that the dowager duchess did not welcome my visits, nor did she accept the goods you sent for her personal use. I returned those trunks to the warehouse as you will see on the itemized list.\u201d</p><p>Simeon sat for a moment. \u201cDid she give any explanation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is rather set in her ways, Your Grace, as I have noticed elderly ladies often are. Perhaps India and Africa seem too distant for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather that she did not allow you to act as a man of business for her, given\u2014\u201d he gestured \u201c\u2014the stacks of papers I find here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace. She informed me that she would continue to run things precisely as your father had done. I did inform you of this in a letter, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every letter reached me,\u201d Simeon said, staring sightlessly at the piles of foolscap covering his father\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Kinnaird,\u201d Simeon said finally, \u201ccould I ask you to return to London and arrange for transfer of the goods I intended as gifts? They can be transported here. I am in the process of directing payment of all overdue bills.\u201d</p><p>Kinnaird cleared his throat. \u201cI should inform you that Mr. Honeydew occasionally forwarded bills to me that had to be paid and naturally I took care of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he would steal them from this table and send them to you in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat allowed the household to keep running, Your Grace,\u201d Kinnaird said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to accept that one\u2019s mother has lost her mind. Gone uncooked. Thrown her pancakes to the roof. However you want to put it.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Kinnaird,\u201d he said. He paused. \u201cHave the servants\u2019 wages been raised since my father died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord. Nor for some years before that sad event. However, I took the liberty of giving each of them a Boxing Day present that brought their wages to near-current rates. Again, Mr. Honeydew was invaluable in this respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs were you, Mr. Kinnaird.\u201d</p><p>Kinnaird\u2019s knees turned inwards and he gave an odd little bob that Simeon thought indicated pleasure. \u201cThank you, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Simeon felt like going for another run, but instead he made his way to his mother\u2019s chambers and knocked on the door.</p><p>She was sitting before a small secretary at her window. Simeon realized with a sinking heart that her desk, too, was stacked with sheaves of paper.</p><p>He dropped into the bow that she required, waited while she held out her hand to be kissed, waited while she arranged herself in a chair and motioned him to another. Though they were in the country, and surely not expecting morning callers, she wore a high powdered wig hung with teardrop pearls.</p><p>\u201cYou have come, of course, to apologize,\u201d she said, folding her hands. \u201cI expected as much from your father\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>When had his mother\u2019s voice become so high and quavering? When had she developed that slight hitch in her step? When had she become so old?</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d he began.</p><p>She raised her hand. \u201cI see no reason that you, a duke, should address me by a term suitable for a schoolboy\u2019s use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d he started over. \u201cI am concerned about the state of the paperwork in the study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about that,\u201d she said, bestowing him with a gracious smile. \u201cI took care of everything regularly. I was brought up to manage a large estate, and I have continued to do so since your father\u2019s death. In every case I noted the instructions I gave Honeydew, so that you have a thorough record.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are some unpaid bills,\u201d he observed.</p><p>\u201cOnly if the bill was absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I do not grasp the problem. The local candle-maker, for example, does not appear to have been paid in over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA case in point. How on earth could we have used two hundred tallow candles? Acting as the guardian of your estate, I could not allow chicanery to continue. Either the servants are stealing candles, or the chandler is defrauding us. Either way, the bill remains unpaid until I am satisfied about the matter. Your father was very firm, very firm indeed, when it came to matters of thievery. He couldn\u2019t abide a thief!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Simeon murmured. \u201cDo you have any idea, Mother, why he didn\u2019t pay the estate bills? There are a great number unanswered, from well before his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the thieves,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cThey charge us double, you know, because of the title. They think they can get away with robbery because the dukedom is so well respected.\u201d</p><p>He doubted that. In fact, he had no doubt but that the majority of the people living around the duchy loathed the name, seeing that they had been defrauded of proper payments for years.</p><p>\u201cAnd now...your apology.\u201d She looked at him expectantly.</p><p>For the life of him, he didn\u2019t know what he was supposed to apologize for.</p> <p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou are just like your father!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI used to have to instruct him in the precise wording of this sort of thing as well. You have come to apologize for the dissolute manner by which you showed your lower limbs not only to myself, but to the household staff. The lower orders are highly susceptible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusceptible to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmorality and vice, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my bare knees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour knees, Cosway, are not only unattractive but uninteresting. I am certain that the footmen would rather not see them, and neither would I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the immorality thereof?\u201d Simeon enquired.</p><p>\u201cTo be unclothed before the lower orders, except in necessary situations, is to be avoided at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my bare knees,\u201d Simeon said obediently. \u201cYour Grace, would you like me to take care of such correspondence as you are unable to manage?\u201d He nodded toward the desk.</p><p>His mother raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo I appear to be an invalid? No? Well, then, why on earth would I wish you to take care of my correspondence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d his mother said magisterially. \u201cThere is rather too much thinking going on in this household. Honeydew has always been prone to thought, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bad for his digestion, as I\u2019ve told him time and again.\u201d</p><p>Poor Honeydew, Simeon thought. Probably spent a bit too much time thinking about how to pay bills. Guilt curdled his stomach. \u201cNow you must forgive me,\u201d he said, rising.</p><p>She shrieked. Simeon dropped back into his seat.</p> <p>\u201cYou may not rise while I am seated,\u201d she said, patting her chest. \u201cNor may you leave until I dismiss you.\u201d</p><p>Simeon ground his teeth. \u201cI must needs retire, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d She came to her feet nimbly enough. \u201cYou are dismissed.\u201d</p><p>He bowed and left, feeling as angry\u2014and as small\u2014as a schoolboy.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Revels House</p><p>February 24, 1784</p><p>The next morning the weather changed, and with it the odor in the house swelled and grew to a stench, the kind that reached out, grabbed a man\u2019s breath, and took it away. It wasn\u2019t that Simeon hadn\u2019t smelled it\u2014or worse\u2014before. But he hadn\u2019t expected to smell it in his own home.</p><p>He was literally staring down into a pile of shit. He dragged a hand through his hair and turned to Godfrey.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe water closet?\u201d Godfrey said.</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d He would have loved to summon up withering sarcasm, but he was too tired.</p><p>Godfrey leaned over and showing extreme bravery, peered down the hole. \u201cLoathsome smell. I hate the water closets. The servants\u2019 privy behind the kitchen gardens is much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me they\u2019re all like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re always worse on damp days and it\u2019s raining today. You should smell the house after ten days\u2019 rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not working,\u201d Simeon said flatly. \u201cWater closets are supposed to have water running through them. These need to be cleaned out.\u201d</p><p>The concept had clearly never entered Godfrey\u2019s mind. \u201cI don\u2019t think Honeydew would like one of the footmen to go down there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might never come back up. Do you know what we pay a footman?\u201d</p><p>Simeon sighed. He knew precisely how much a footman should be paid for a year\u2019s work\u2014and the Cosway estate had been paying approximately half of that amount. \u201cFootmen don\u2019t do this sort of work. I believe iron-workers do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIron-workers?\u201d Godfrey sounded puzzled, as well he might be. Clearly, no iron-worker had lifted a finger to the pipes in years.</p><p>\u201cWe need help.\u201d He was going to have to postpone the wedding until the spring. Simeon raked his hand through his hair again. God knows what Isidore would make of that announcement. He could hardly tell her that his mother had become so tight-fisted that the water closets hadn\u2019t been cleaned since the days of good Queen Bess.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose,\u201d Godfrey said tentatively, \u201cthat we could possibly have a proper water closet? Do you remember the Oglethorpes in the next county? Rupert showed me their new water closet. It\u2019s all marble. I mean, we couldn\u2019t afford anything like that, but perhaps running water?\u201d</p><p>Simeon backed out of the privy. \u201cGodfrey, we can have the whole house kitted up in marble if you wish.\u201d</p><p>Godfrey was at the stage where his legs were almost as long as the rest of him. He trotted along beside Simeon. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a large, thriving estate,\u201d he said, glancing at his little brother.</p><p>His eyes were round and his mouth was open. \u201cMother said we should never discuss the question of substance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not proper to have a house stink like a pigsty in summer,\u201d Simeon said witheringly. He couldn\u2019t criticize his mother to her face, nor yet to her child\u2019s. But he could point out the facts. \u201cThis is an extremely profitable estate. My wanderings resulted in a second fortune. We can have running water piped into every room, though I wouldn\u2019t know why we\u2019d want to.\u201d</p><p>Godfrey stumbled and almost fell over.</p><p>Simeon stopped. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at Eton?\u201d he said, something finally clicking in his brain.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cI\u2019ve been teaching myself since mother dismissed my tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw...shit!\u201d</p><p>Having left Godfrey wide-eyed at the idea that he would be attending Eton in the fall, Simeon walked back into the study and sat down. In front of him was a letter from a Mr. Pegg, requesting to be paid for the work he did between 1775 and 1780. Mr. Pegg had shoed the duke\u2019s horses, as well as kept the carriages in good repair. And while the Peggs had long served the Dukes of Cosway, he was afraid that he would no longer be able to... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simeon picked up the letter and walked upstairs to his mother\u2019s parlor. He went through all the elaborate rigmarole that prefaced a simple conversation with her: the bows, the kisses, the request to sit, etc.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d he began.</p><p>But his mother raised a hand. \u201cA lady initiates the subject of conversation, Cosway.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth.</p> <p>\u201cI want you to promise that you will be on your best behavior so that your wife is not frightened away by your oddness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall do my best,\u201d Simeon said woodenly. \u201cI intend to travel to London tomorrow and beg her pardon; I\u2019m afraid that our wedding celebration must be delayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall send a letter with you,\u201d she announced. \u201cI shall inform her that you suffered a brain fever. You will do me the great courtesy to confirm this account.\u201d</p><p>Simeon blinked. \u201cA brain fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Everyone knows that brain fevers are common in foreign parts. It could explain so much.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cYour wife is a kindly woman. It is true that she and I had some difficulties living in the same house; she was a headstrong and sometimes impudent girl with an odd habit of song. I found it onerous to have her about me. But I\u2019m sure all will be different now that she has reached an advanced age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA brain fever?\u201d Simeon repeated.</p><p>\u201cTo explain yourself,\u201d she said. Then she added, obligingly: \u201cYou.\u201d With a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at yourself, Cosway. You don\u2019t look like a duke. You look like some sort of minor accountant. You have none of the easy carriage of a true aristocrat. There are dark circles under your eyes, ink on your cuff. You wear no wig and no powder, you are inappropriately dressed, and although I have managed to coerce you into an appropriate level of manners when approaching me, I am not such a fool as to think you would be able to carry off such a trained dog show in front of others.</p><p>\u201cIn short, I need a story to present to the ton.\u201d She leaned forward again with an audible creaking of whalebone. \u201cAre you sure that you didn\u2019t suffer a brain fever, Cosway?\u201d</p><p>Simeon wished that Valamksepa were in his place right now. It would be interesting to see whether the guru could maintain his composure. After all, now that Simeon thought about it, Valamksepa sat about in a tent doing his teaching. It was a nice, clean tent, without a duchess in sight. Easy to banish anger in those circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Mother,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cI was lucky enough to escape brain fevers. This is simply the way I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, so I thought.\u201d An ominous pause: \u201cThe brain fever will explain everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no brain fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is now!\u201d She indicated a stack of sealed letters. \u201cI\u2019ve informed everyone of your precarious health. I\u2019d like you to frank these letters at your earliest convenience. My acquaintances will be kind, Cosway. Noblemen are kind to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, can you explain why Mr. Pegg\u2019s bill for shoeing the horses and maintaining the carriages was never paid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPegg? Pegg? Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Pegg family has acted as blacksmiths to the Dukes of Cosway for generations, or so he tells me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr so he tells you!\u201d she said, pouncing on it like a cat on a mouse. \u201cAy, there\u2019s the rub! They\u2019ll say anything. Don\u2019t pay it! Make him show you the work before you give him a ha\u2019penny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe work was done four years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a good blacksmith\u2019s work would endure a mere four years. If it hasn\u2019t, then you needn\u2019t pay him on the grounds of shoddy work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Mother, I must return to the study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t excuse you just yet,\u201d she said. \u201cHoneydew informs me that you find the water closets inadequate in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They stink.\u201d</p><p>She bridled, but it was his turn to raise his hand. \u201cThey stink, Mother. And the reason they stink is that Father installed water closets throughout this house and then neglected to have them cleaned out. The pipes must have burst years ago. Water is no longer running through the drains; they must be cleaned.\u201d</p><p>Her face was rigid with anger. \u201cThe duke did everything just as he ought!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ought to have had the pipes cleaned once a year. Honeydew tells me that Father judged it an untoward expense. Why, I can\u2019t tell. But the odor that infects this entire house is the result. For God\u2019s sake, it smells worse in a duke\u2019s house than it does in a Bombay slum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to speak to me in that pestering fashion! The duke installed the water closets in good faith. The pipes were created of such inferior material that they fell to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t father have them repaired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe demanded the pipes be repaired, naturally!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect he hadn\u2019t paid for the original work,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cHe had paid more than a reasonable amount, given the slip-shod work that was done. As witnessed by the fact that the drainage failed almost immediately. He was correct not to pay those thieving rascals!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He rose, ignoring the question of protocol. \u201cI wish I could find it in my heart to believe that was the truth. You have my apologies.\u201d He bowed and left, closing the door quietly behind him.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>February 26, 1784</p><p>The carriage drew up at the Beaumonts\u2019 townhouse at precisely ten o\u2019clock. Simeon knew because he had timed it to perfection. He was used to planning expeditions like minor military excursions, accounting for wayward tribes, robbers, sandstorms. In England, the road was smooth, the carriage functioned, nary a thief lurked to bring down his horses. He arrived in London the night before, woke up at dawn and waited for the appropriate hour to pay a call on his wife. It was all easy.</p><p>And nothing was easy.</p><p>For one thing he had to tell his wife, who already thought he was cracked, that their wedding had to be delayed. Again.</p><p>Isidore was undoubtedly contemplating annulment, and perhaps he should just let that happen. They could both find more suitable mates.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t what he pictured.</p><p>When he thought about his wife\u2014and he had, now and then\u2014he remembered a portrait of a sweet-faced little girl, dressed as richly if she were a Renaissance princess. That was why his father had arranged the marriage, of course. The Del\u2019Finos were rich as Croesus and his father wanted her dowry, and never mind the fact that his son was a child when the original contracts were drawn up.</p><p>Simeon had readily approved the proxy wedding when he was eighteen and far away in India. He had just begun studying with Valamksepa, and he refused to come home merely so that his father could draw down the second half of a dowry attached to a bride whom he\u2019d never met. He spent the next three years in rigorous solitude, learning endurance, manliness, the Middle Way. He had learned to create an oasis of calm around himself, no matter what happened on his right or his left.</p><p>But now that he was back in England, it all seemed complicated. One look at Isidore had dispelled his image of a sweet-faced child bride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was like a Renaissance princess. Or a queen like Cleopatra.</p><p>She was the most sensual woman he\u2019d ever seen in his life, and he had the women of the Sultan of Illa\u2019s harem for comparison.</p><p>If Isidore put on a gauzy dress and a couple of bracelets, she would have thrown the sultan\u2019s first wife into the shade. She was ravishing, with a mouth like a ripe cherry and a body that would make a eunuch weep. She was not what he expected in a wife.</p><p>In truth, she was not what he wanted in a wife.</p> <p>Wandering the East for years had taught him a few things about women and men, and all his conclusions led in one direction: it was much easier for a man if he had a docile wife.</p><p>Somehow, without even noticing it, he\u2019d fashioned Isidore into the picture of that wife. Shy, sweet, veiled. Of course he\u2019d been offered women\u2014and women had offered themselves\u2014numerous times over his adult life.</p><p>But they had never been tempting enough to overcome the teachings of Valamksepa. Lust, he had said repeatedly, is at the heart of many evils. Simeon had to admit that he probably would have brushed aside the question of evil, except for his inherent dislike of disease. For all he told Isidore that it was a moral decision, he didn\u2019t bother with fooling himself.</p><p>He liked to be healthy. Very healthy. And a man has only to be in the East for a day before he becomes aware of just what a syphilitic face looks like without a nose. Or he hears a joke about a private member dropping off the body.</p><p>He decided early that it wasn\u2019t worth it. The women he was offered were members of harems. The women who offered themselves were regularly partaking in all sorts of interesting bedroom activities, with a variety of partners.</p> <p>He could wait.</p><p>And he had waited.</p><p>Imagining, all the time, his cool, docile wife...the one who would have to be coaxed into kissing him, the one who would scream faintly at the sight of his body. In the month after he decided to return to England, he ran miles across the desert at night, curbing his body, preparing himself for careful, delicate advances to a terrified woman.</p><p>Idiot that he was.</p><p>His wife burned with sensuality. When he first met her she was wearing a gown that fit like a glove. It was the color of rain in the summer, and it sparkled with tiny diamonds. She had them in her hair too, and on her slippers. Everything about her said, I am delicious. I am expensive. I am a duchess.</p><p>And everything about her face said, I don\u2019t want to be a virgin.</p> <p>The front door to the Duke of Beaumont\u2019s house opened and a footman trotted down the steps. Simeon\u2019s groomsmen had already leapt down and were surrounding the carriage, rigidly at attention, like tin soldiers.</p><p>Isidore greeted him at the door to the sitting room. She wasn\u2019t the kind to wait sedately in a chair for a man\u2019s arrival. She was dressed in a gown that resembled a man\u2019s military costume. Huge flaps at the shoulders narrowed to a point at her waist before the skirts belled out again, over panniers, he supposed. He\u2019d seen a few women wearing those in the last few years\u2014mostly missionaries\u2019 wives, trying to preserve a ridiculous way of life while living in the wilds.</p><p>But on Isidore he suddenly understood the fashion. It was made to draw a man\u2019s eyes to the waist. Her impossibly small, delicate waist. And then above that, to the way her breasts swelled, with no hoops, just delicious, pink flesh against the military braid of her\u2014</p><p>He wrenched his eyes away.</p><p>What was he doing? He didn\u2019t care about women\u2019s clothing. Nor the body within. Valamksepa would say such things were mere frivolities.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Isidore,\u201d he said, once the door closed behind the butler.</p><p>\u201cDuke,\u201d she said, with a bend of her head.</p><p>\u201cEven my mother didn\u2019t address my father with such formality in private.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Cosway,\u201d she said, meeting his eyes. Her eyes were almond-shaped, and so beautiful that his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>A pulse of annoyance followed directly afterwards.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want a wife so beautiful that every jackal for miles would be slavering at her heels. No wonder his mother started babbling when she learned that Isidore was at Lord Strange\u2019s house party. Every hound in five countries must have been sniffing after her.</p><p>One might worry whether she had lost her virginity\u2014but no. Isidore\u2019s eyes were clear and true. Disdainful...annoyed...virginal. She had waited for him. There was something about that fact that gave him a queer feeling.</p><p>\u201cMy given name is Simeon,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe hardly know each other.\u201d Once you got past her beauty, there was another thing about her. She was angry.</p><p>He\u2019d spent years curbing his bodily impulses\u2014but every inch of his body was telling him like a drumbeat, she\u2019s yours, yours, yours...take her! Every bit of native caution, learned from years of dangerous living, was on the alert.</p><p>He could do without her.</p><p>It would ruin the quality and calmness of his life to have Isidore Del\u2019Fino as a wife. She had turned around and was now sitting down on a little sofa, pulling off her gloves. Her fingers were slender, beautiful, pink-tipped.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d he said, sitting down opposite her, \u201cI think we should discuss the question of annulment.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, her eyes flew to his, and one of her gloves dropped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou must have thought of it,\u201d he said, more gently. He picked up her glove and dropped it back in her lap.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would like an annulment, I would not stand in your way.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him for a moment, and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand himself. He\u2019d been offered one of the most beautiful women on three continents, and he was throwing her away. But she was trouble. The skin prickling all over his body told him that...as much trouble as he\u2019d ever encountered, and that included the crocodile who almost chewed off his toes.</p><p>\u201cI know that I behaved in an extraordinarily ungracious way, wandering around foreign parts and not returning to consummate our marriage. The least I can do is offer you another option, should you wish to take it. My mother has made it vehemently clear that I am unfit to marry a proper gentlewoman.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rested on his trousers. He wasn\u2019t wearing breeches. He didn\u2019t mind baring his lower leg when he was running, but he simply couldn\u2019t get used to slipping into stockings. His mother had shrieked, of course. Apparently no one wore trousers except for artisans and eccentrics.</p><p>He had replied with the obvious truth: it seemed that he was an eccentric.</p><p>\u201cEccentrics and robbers!\u201d his mother had added. \u201cYet even they wear white trousers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am wearing a cravat,\u201d he said to Isidore now.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t read her face. She had obviously noted the fact that he wasn\u2019t wearing hair powder or a wig. \u201cI tried on a wig with three rows of little snail shells over the ear. I looked like a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>There was just a suspicion of a smile at the corner of her mouth. If he could find rubies that color, he would...</p><p>\u201cDo you wear color on your lips?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shot him a look. \u201cWhy? Are you averse to women wearing face paint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why should I be?\u201d he said, surprised.</p><p>She seemed to relax. \u201cThere are men who consider themselves an apt judge of what a woman should or shouldn\u2019t wear on her face.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly the one to complain,\u201d Simeon said, \u201cgiven as I do not conform to all the customs of an English gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother tells me that I greatly underestimated your complaint regarding Nerot\u2019s Hotel and that, in fact, ladies stay in such establishments only while traveling outside London. I had no idea from your protest that the experience was prohibited for women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it my fault, then? I should have been more vehement?\u201d</p> <p>Simeon opened his mouth. Paused. \u201cI should have listened to you?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>There was a hint of a smile on her lips. \u201cYou must have worn a cravat at Eton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. But that feels like a lifetime ago. I am who I am because of the places I have been. And Eton is just a tiny kernel of my past. I\u2019m fond of English seasons. There were times in the midst of the desert when I almost cried to remember how beautiful our rain can be. But the core of me was shaped by the deserts of Abyssinia, by the sands of India.\u201d</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cThat\u2019s why I thought it was better to bring up the question of annulment rather than let it fester silently between us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wish to marry me?\u201d she asked bluntly, looking up at him.</p><p>He opened his mouth but she raised her hand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me once again that you are offering me an annulment for my sake. I know precisely the weight you put on my opinion; it was eloquently expressed by your absence in the past years.\u201d</p><p>He deserved that. And she deserved the truth.</p><p>\u201cI am beautiful,\u201d she added with a pugnacious kind of honesty that suggested it was second nature to her. \u201cI am a virgin. And we are married. So why would you wish to annul that ceremony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe desert changed me.\u201d</p><p>She waited, and he had the feeling that it was only by a masterful effort of self-control that she didn\u2019t curl her lip. Well, it did sound insane. Put that together with his virginity...\u201cI met a great teacher named Valamksepa, when I first traveled to India. He taught me a great deal about what it means to be a man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cA man is obviously not defined by his wig or his legs. So do tell me, what is the measure of a man?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was calm, but underneath were banked fires. He was right to annul the marriage.</p><p>\u201cA man is measured by his ability to control himself,\u201d he said, not allowing the scorn in her eyes to shake him. \u201cI wish to be the sort of man who never falls prey to his baser emotions.\u201d</p><p>She looked a little confused.</p><p>\u201cAnger,\u201d he told her. \u201cFear. Lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to avoid anger? How will you do that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOh, I feel anger. The key is not to act on it, not to let it affect me or become an intrinsic part of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what has this to do with me?\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d reached the stickler. \u201cI was taught,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cthat a man comes to his life with many choices. Only a fool believes that fate gives him his hand of cards. We make decisions every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage is one of the most important. If you and I were to marry\u2014really marry\u2014I would want to undergo the marriage ceremony with you because it marks that important decision. It was something I should never have left to a proxy. Those are my vows to make and to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not to make at all,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cThe fact is, Cosway, that your decision after meeting me is not to make those vows. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were initially happy to go through with a wedding ceremony,\u201d she said. \u201cYet now you talk of annulment.\u201d</p><p>She was playing with her glove again, pulling the fingers straight. A flare of fire went up from his belly. That small hand was\u2014his. His to unglove, his to kiss, his to...His.</p><p>He glanced down at his coat to make sure it was thoroughly buttoned. \u201cYou are not what I expected,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cMy mother sent me a miniature once we were married. That\u2019s how I recognized you at Strange\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. I sat for it while I was still living with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked sweet and docile. Fragile, really.\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>She had suddenly realized precisely why her so-called husband had initiated talk of annulments. He didn\u2019t think she was sweet or docile. And he was right.</p><p>\u201cMy parents had both died several months before the portrait was painted,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cLikely I was fragile. Am I to apologize that I have now recovered from that event?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I was merely explaining my mistaken impression.\u201d</p><p>Isidore just stopped herself from tossing her head like an offended barmaid. \u201cDuring my brief time in your mother\u2019s house, she continually expressed her doubt that I would develop the qualities of a good wife. I gather you agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that she turned her wish into reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s written to me regularly over the years, far more so than you have, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth did drop open and she leapt to her feet. \u201cYou dare to criticize me for not writing you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to criticize\u2014\u201d Simeon said, rising as well.</p><p>Isidore took a step toward him. \u201cYou? You who never wrote me even a line? You who sent the letters I did write you straight to your solicitors, since I received answers from them? You dare suggest I should have written you more frequently?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it in that fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think of it. You didn\u2019t think of writing to your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really my wife.\u201d</p><p>With that, Isidore completely lost her temper. \u201cI bloody well am your wife! I am the only wife you have, and let me tell you, annulment will not be an easy business. What kind of fool are you? When you agreed to that proxy marriage, you agreed to having a wife. I was there, even if you weren\u2019t. The ceremony was binding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>It only made her more furious that he showed no signs of getting angry himself. She took a deep breath. \u201cThen what precisely did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I have a queer idea of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes without saying,\u201d Isidore snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a great deal of marriage. And I\u2019ve spent a great deal of time assessing which marriages are the most successful. It seems absurdly obtuse, but for some reason I thought I had one of those marriages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said,\u201d Isidore noted with exaggerated patience, \u201cthat we weren\u2019t married at all. With whom did you have this perfect marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, with you. Except it wasn\u2019t really with you; I see that now. The combination of that miniature and my mother\u2019s descriptions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what did your mother say about me?\u201d Isidore demanded.</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well tell me the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never said a bad thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I am surprised.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe painted you as the very image of a perfect English gentlewoman: sweet, docile, perfect in every way.\u201d</p><p>Isidore gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou are particularly skilled with needlework, and sometimes stay up half the night stitching seams for the poor. But when you aren\u2019t engaged in charitable activities, you knot silk laces that are as light as cobwebs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said faintly, dropping back into her chair.</p> <p>\u201cLight as cobwebs,\u201d Cosway repeated, reseating himself as well. \u201cI remember actually considering whether I should request further details. I was establishing a weaving factory in India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeaving. You know, silks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were wandering around the Nile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that too. But I\u2019m afflicted by curiosity. I can\u2019t go to a new place without wanting to figure out how things are made, and how they might be made better. That leads to shipping them here and there, generally back to England for sale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a merchant,\u201d Isidore said flatly. \u201cDoes your mother know of this development?\u201d</p><p>He thought about it. \u201cI have no idea. I expect not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly feel sorry for her. You do realize that I wasn\u2019t even living with her during the time when she wrote all those letters describing my domestic virtues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA revelation I find, sadly, unsurprising. I\u2019m afraid my arrival has been a terrible shock to my mother. All the time she was sending me letters about my submissive, chaste wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am chaste!\u201d Isidore flashed.</p><p>He met her eyes. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p> <p>A flare of heat went straight down her back to her legs. \u201cSo you thought I was a meek little Puritan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTame,\u201d he said, nodding. There was an annoying hint of a smile in his eyes. \u201cMeek and obedient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother has much to answer for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI formed a picture of our marriage based on that wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but his face sobered. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously far more intelligent than the pliable woman my mother described, Isidore. So I have to tell you that from what I\u2019ve seen in the world, the best marriages are those in which a man\u2019s wife is\u2014well, biddable.\u201d</p><p>Isidore felt her temper rising again but pushed it down. What could she expect? He may not have the outward trappings of an English gentleman, but he was voicing what many a man believed.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough I would broaden the category. Were I to choose my own spouse, for example, I would like him to be, shall we say, civilized?\u201d</p> <p>His teeth were very white against his golden skin when he smiled. \u201cMeek and obedient, in other words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are not popular words among men. But I could see myself with a husband who was more quiet than myself. I have\u2014\u201d she coughed \u201c\u2014a terrible temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this sarcasm can\u2019t be good for you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou told me in the carriage that you like your every utterance to be straightforward.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI can see you riding roughshod over some poor devil of a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, stung. \u201cWe could simply discuss things together. And come to an agreement that didn\u2019t involve my opinion losing ground to his simply because I was his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable. But the truth of it is that you would smile at him, and crook your finger, and the man would come to you as tame as a lapdog.\u201d</p><p>Isidore shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of relationship you would understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall enjoy seeing you engage in it. If we annul our marriage and I can watch some other fellow experiencing it with you. Naturally I would repay your dowry with ample interest.\u201d</p><p>So he didn\u2019t want to come anywhere near her. Isidore was so stoked by rage that she could hardly speak. She was being rejected\u2014rejected!\u2014 by her husband after waiting for him for years. She got up again and walked a few steps away, the better to regain control of her face.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important in any relationship that there be a clearly designated leader,\u201d he was saying. \u201cAnd I would rather be the leader in my own marriage.\u201d Then he added: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Isidore, I won\u2019t rise this time.\u201d</p><p>Cosway would rather annul the marriage than marry her.</p><p>She waited for that news to sink in, but the only thing she could feel was the beating of her heart, anger and humiliation driving it to a rapid tattoo.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens,\u201d she said, schooling her voice to calm indifference with every bit of strength she had, \u201cJemma gave me the direction of the Duke of Beaumont\u2019s solicitor in the Inns of Court. I shall make inquiries as to how we go about an annulment.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of something in his eyes. What? Regret? Surely not. He sat there, looking calm and relaxed, like a king on his throne. He was throwing her away because she wasn\u2019t a docile little seamstress, because she would make him angry.</p><p>Angry\u2014and lustful. That was something to think about. She could unclothe herself right here, in the drawing room, and then he would have to marry her, but that would be cutting off her nose to spite her face. Why would she bind herself in marriage to a man like this? With these foolish ideas learned in the desert?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a trip there tomorrow afternoon?\u201d he was asking now.</p><p>Isidore refused to allow his eagerness to visit the solicitor to throw her further into humiliation. He was a fool, and she\u2019d known that since the moment she met him.</p><p>It would be better to annul the marriage.</p><p>She sat down opposite him, reasonably certain that her face showed nothing more than faint irritation. \u201cI have an appointment at eleven tomorrow morning with a mantua-maker to discuss intimate attire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntimate what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightdress for my wedding night,\u201d she said crushingly.</p><p>\u201cIf we visit the solicitor first, I would be happy to accompany you to your appointment .\u201d</p><p>Isidore narrowed her eyes, wondering about the look on her husband\u2019s face. She was no expert, but it didn\u2019t look like a man who was in control of his lust.</p><p>There were three things that no man was supposed to act on, weren\u2019t there? Anger, lust...and an idea of marriage that included what?</p><p>Oh yes.</p><p>An intelligent woman within a ten-foot radius.</p><p>That must be where fear came in.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>February 26, 1784</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>Jemma, Duchess of Beaumont, looked up from her chess board. She had it set out in the library, in the hopes that her husband would come home from the House of Lords earlier than expected. \u201cYes, Fowle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers has sent in his card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he in his carriage?\u201d</p><p>Fowle inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cDo request his presence, if he can spare the time.\u201d</p><p>Fowle paced from the library as majestically as he had entered. It was a sad fact, Jemma thought, that her butler resembled nothing so much as a plump village priest, and yet he clearly envisioned himself as a duke. Or perhaps even a king. There was a touch of noblesse oblige in the way he tolerated Jemma\u2019s obsession with chess, for example. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Naturally, the Duke of Villiers made a grand entrance. He paused for a moment in the doorway, a vision in pale rose, with black-edged lace falling around his wrists and at his neck. Then he swept into a ducal bow such as Fowle could only dream of.</p><p>Jemma came to her feet feeling slightly amused and thoroughly delighted to see Villiers. She used to think that he had the coldest eyes of any man in the ton. And yet as she rose from a deep curtsy and took his hands, she revised her opinion. His eyes were black as the devil\u2019s nightshirt, to quote her old nanny. And yet\u2014</p><p>\u201cI have missed you during my sojourn at Fonthill,\u201d he said, raising her hand to his lips.</p><p>Not cold.</p> <p>His thick hair was tied back with a rose ribbon. He looked pale but healthy, presumably recovered from the duel that nearly killed him a few months before. She felt a small pulse of guilt: the duel had been won by her brother, after which he summarily married Villiers\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Much though Jemma loved her new sister-in-law, she wished that the relation could have been won without injuring her favorite chess partner.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she said, leading him to the fire. \u201cYou\u2019re still too thin, you know. Should you be upright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could challenge you for that insult. I\u2019ve knocked on death\u2019s privy and came back to tell the tale, and you\u2019re saying I\u2019m too thin?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cDo say that you came to play chess with me? It has been over a month since your fever broke, and that was the length of time for which your doctor issued an embargo on the game, was it not?\u201d</p><p>He sat opposite her. She leaned forward, began rearranging the pieces; his large hand came over hers. \u201cNot chess,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNot\u2014chess?\u201d If not chess, what? She knew him to be a master at the game, just as she was. What did a master do, but play? \u201cI thought your doctor decreed merely a month without chess; have I mistaken the date?\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head back against the chair. \u201cI\u2019ve gone off the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it. I missed it at first, of course. I dreamed of chess pieces, of moves, of games I played or thought I played. But then slowly the urge left me. I\u2019ve decided to take another month at least before returning to the board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re voluntarily eschewing chess?\u201d</p><p>His smile was a bit rueful. \u201cI can tell you that it lengthens the days. How do people occupy themselves if they\u2019re not chess players?\u201d</p> <p>Jemma shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never known. So how is the party at Fonthill? Wait! Tell me about Harriet.\u201d And she held her breath, not knowing if Villiers was aware that her friend Harriet was having an affaire with the owner of Fonthill, Lord Strange.</p><p>\u201cHappy,\u201d he said, \u201cwith Strange. But I\u2019m afraid the festivities are dimmed at the moment, as Strange\u2019s daughter is quite gravely ill. I felt it was rude to tax the household with my presence under the circumstances, so I slipped away. I shall return in a day or two when, one hopes, the crisis will be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear! What sort of illness has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fever caused by a rat bite,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cBut the girl is apparently quite strong, and the doctor is sanguine that all will be well. Harriet is spending her time in the sickroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Harriet would do that,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s the affaire with Strange that I can\u2019t imagine. Isidore said that the air scorched around them.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI had no idea that the duchess was so poetic in her assessments. I gather Strange and Harriet are in love, a foreign emotion for me.\u201d His eyes rested on Jemma. \u201cAnd how are you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly. \u201cNot in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not unhappy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to take some answer from that, perhaps to a question he wasn\u2019t ready to put into words, for he nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo what of our match?\u201d she asked, surprised by her own keen disappointment in his refusal of chess.</p><p>\u201cOne move a day...that match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that match,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have so many outstanding matches that you don\u2019t remember? To bring it to your recollection, I have won one game, and you have won one game. That leaves one game to break the tie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do remember now,\u201d he said, watching her under his eyelids. \u201cLet me see...if our match went to a third game, the last one was to be played blindfolded and in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Jemma folded her hands. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that it\u2019s come back to you. I have been training my maid, Brigitte, so she can stand next to the bed and move our pieces appropriately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not picture the bedchamber occupied by others than ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is positively full of disappointments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely so. I\u2019m sure your maid could use more training. I\u2019d prefer not to play chess for at least another month. Besides, I must return to Fonthill; I didn\u2019t even say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like an old drunk who\u2019d been sitting on a pub stool next to a man for thirty years, only to be told his comrade has chosen sobriety,\u201d Jemma said, feeling distinctly nettled.</p><p>\u201cChess is better than alcohol...more addictive, more inflammatory, more intelligent.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a moment, and the edge of her mouth curled up. \u201cYou\u2019ll play again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will trust you to wait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never very good at waiting for men.\u201d Jemma was startled to hear the words come from her mouth. In one sense, she meant her husband. She waited three years for Elijah to fetch her from Paris when they were young, after she had flung herself across the Channel in a rage. He didn\u2019t visit until the fourth year, and by then it was too late. She had found a lover, and put her marriage behind her.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s heavy-lidded eyes dropped. \u201cI, on the other hand, am very good at waiting. For you, Jemma...I would wait quite a long time.\u201d</p><p>Jemma woke up. The conversation was happening\u2014perhaps had been happening\u2014on two levels for quite a while and she only now realized it. \u201cBeaumont should be home from Lords within the hour,\u201d she said, watching him. \u201cWill the two of you take your rapprochement from the sickroom to a drawing room?\u201d</p><p>Villiers smiled faintly. He didn\u2019t look in the least disappointed by her implicit rejection, which rankled her. Surely he ought to show more response to the invocation of her husband? \u201cUnfortunately, I have a previous engagement. But I wanted your advice. I may have temporarily lost my interest in chess,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am compensating by an increased interest in humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d she asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cYes. I, the eternal bystander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought you found the affairs of others exhausting and uninteresting. My goodness, Villiers, you\u2019re not planning to reform? I shall be so disappointed if it transpires that the only reason to invite you for an evening is because you lend an air of respectability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a terrible come-down,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cBut in truth, I feel no Puritanical leanings.\u201d There was a flare of something deep in his eyes that made her want to smile back, reach out her hand...</p><p>\u201cDo ask my advice, then,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m capable of wise pronouncements on almost any subject, and yet no one asks for evidence of my wisdom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeaumont doesn\u2019t come to you with knotty matters of state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can mock yourself, Jemma, but he couldn\u2019t find a better mind to consider those affairs.\u201d</p><p>Jemma could feel herself growing faintly pink\u2014and she never blushed. Never.</p> <p>Of course Villiers didn\u2019t miss it. His mouth curled into a mocking smile. \u201cI like blushing,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen do entirely too little of it, to my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be very useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUseful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more disarming than a woman\u2019s blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it. Most women wear so much face paint that blushing is not an option.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI often wear a great deal of face paint,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cParticularly if I think there is the slightest chance that I shall be shocked. If you are bent on reform, Villiers, I shall take to wearing it regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReform...\u201d he said. \u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>He had so much charm. He\u2019d never wielded it on her like this before. When he smiled at her, it was almost like a caress.</p><p>Suddenly she remembered his drawling voice saying that he gave her fair warning that he meant to have her.</p><p>She almost shivered. Villiers was beautiful, depraved, tired...her husband\u2019s enemy, though she never understood precisely why. She had offered herself to him last year and he had refused on the grounds of being Elijah\u2019s oldest friend. And then he had changed his mind.</p><p>Now Villiers apparently meant to woo her, if that word was appropriate for a married woman.</p> <p>She swallowed. She had promised Elijah that her scandals were over. She had come back from Paris to give her husband an heir. She felt dizzy.</p><p>Villiers didn\u2019t seem to notice her silence. Instead he took out a piece of paper. \u201cRead this, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>She opened it. The letter was headed with the Duke of Cosway\u2019s crest. \u201cIsidore\u2019s duke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that. Isidore is staying with me at the moment. He left her at a hotel, if you can countenance it, Villiers. A hotel! He left his duchess at a hotel and proceeded to drive to the country to see his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that story unsurprising, given my acquaintance with him. I actually played a game of chess with Cosway on the deck of some rapscallion prince\u2019s boat,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cOn the Nile river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same hemisphere. If you can imagine, it was twilight and stiflingly hot, around seven years ago, I suppose. I had decided for a number of reasons that I wished to travel to Arabia\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to play chess, of course. You had no redeeming reason for your journey, such as a love of exploration.\u201d</p><p>His smile was a wicked thing, the kind of smile that lured a woman. \u201cYou have me with a pawn, Jemma. I wanted to go to the Levant and play the chess masters there. But it was so damned uncomfortable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeat.\u201d He stretched out an arm and looked at his lace. \u201cI am a duke. It has been my charge since I was a mere boy, and while it has undoubtedly spoiled me, it has also marked me. I like to be clean, and I like to dress. Even in my bedchamber, if you can believe it, Jemma, I choose my garments with great care.\u201d</p><p>She had a sudden entertaining vision of Villiers wrapped in silk. Instinctively, she struck back. \u201cYou are so thin after your illness...I wonder that you do not need an entirely new wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a cruel truth,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI seek to build myself up, of course. I am so hopelessly vain that I could never allow myself to visit a lady\u2019s chamber until I am more fit.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps that was why there would be no third game in bed. It was to be a long campaign, she thought. The Duke of Villiers was setting himself out to entice her, before he allowed that last game to be played.</p><p>Of all the men who had ever assayed that goal, he was the most dangerous.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened during the chess match with Cosway?\u201d she said, wrenching her mind away from the question of Villiers\u2019s allure.</p><p>\u201cOh, he beat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been disconcerting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. I played like an idiot, and I knew why. It was just too bloody hot for an Englishman, though Cosway showed no signs of discomfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of man is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine, if you will, a rather magnificent vessel, belonging to the Bey of Isfaheet. There we sat, with a table of tiger-striped wood between us, the chess pieces carved from the same board. The bishop rode on a rearing lion; the queen was an African princess; the rook was a camel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were there, in embroidery and lace...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe picture of a proper English duke. No one else on board had a fifth of the clothes I did. And yet I had forsaken my waistcoat.\u201d He opened his eyes very wide. \u201cNo waistcoat, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the seriousness of your sacrifice,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt was twilight and the air lay on the river\u2014for we were on a river wider than I\u2019ve seen in England\u2014the air lay on that river like a fat whore on a six-penny bed.\u201d</p><p>Jemma snorted.</p><p>He looked at her innocently. \u201cDid I say something amiss?\u201d</p><p>He was potent...he was so potent in this mood. Wicked and sly and funny. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I reached out my hand to move one of the pieces, drops of sweat ran down my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet Cosway was not discomforted in the least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met him?\u201d</p><p>Jemma shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be fair to say that he\u2019s my opposite. No powder. His skin is brown from the sun, of course and he\u2019s muscled to a degree that is vastly ungentlemanly. But I think it\u2019s the great tumble of inky black hair, unpowdered and not even tied back, that truly marks him. One can easily imagine him fighting off four or five savages at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do that,\u201d Jemma said loyally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not such a fool as to ever put myself in that situation,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAs I recall, he wore short trousers that barely reached his knee along with a tunic-like affair, but at some point he removed that and had the boys dunk it in the river. They returned it to him wet. He appeared to be quite comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfair!\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that he was barefoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoots. Sturdy English boots made for an exploring Englishman, out to gather useful knowledge of the world\u2019s fauna and flora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came home,\u201d Jemma guessed.</p><p>\u201cI forsook all the chess games I might have won in the palaces of the great pashas...I succumbed to the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps,\u201d Jemma said wickedly, \u201cto your insistence on dressing like a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has occurred to me since. Vanity, thy name is Villiers. Do read his letter.\u201d</p><p>Jemma had forgotten about it. There was no formal salutation.</p><p>Villiers,</p><p>I\u2019m having a devil of a time since my return. Would you do me the honor of paying me a visit? There seems to be some disapproval of my ideas. You are, to my mind, the person best suited in the world to advise me on matters of precedence and respectability. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jemma chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI gather you\u2019ve reached the part when he talks about my ability to arbitrate standards of respectability,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking of you, all booted and laced, on board that ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letter continues.\u201d</p> <p>My mother assures me that I stand to blacken the title of Cosway throughout England for the next hundred years. If you could pay me a visit at Revels House, I would be most grateful.</p><p>Yours &amp; etc.</p><p>Cosway</p><p>Jemma looked up. \u201cWhat on earth can he be planning? Isidore said that he\u2019d alluded to a wedding celebration that included some sort of animal sacrifice\u2014but he can\u2019t be thinking of enacting a primitive rite here. He would be arrested!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for animal sacrifice,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAs someone who loves sirloin, I can assure you that many cattle have been sacrificed to keep me happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAnd Isidore mentioned orgies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that settles it. I knew you were the person to speak to. I shall have to pay him a visit, if only so that I can be part of the orgy planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you participated in many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrgies or weddings?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cI doubt you have been in any weddings,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYour engagement to my ward was your first and last, to the best of my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlack,\u201d he said. \u201cMy experience with orgies is just as thin. This will be such an education for me, combining two pursuits I have religiously avoided.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou surprise me,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI would have thought you had indulged in your youth, and then tired of such passionate pursuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem lies in my dukedom, I suppose, or in my spoiled nature. I have always thought of orgies as opportunities to share\u2014and I don\u2019t do that very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I wonder why you have pursued affaires with married women,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cRarely. Very rarely, and only against my better judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when the temptation is so great that there seemed no other woman in the world,\u201d he added gently.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I must tell you that my reputation may be blacker than I deserve. I have, as yet, had no affaires of that nature.\u201d He rose. \u201cI must continue to my appointment, duchess.\u201d</p> <p>She stayed in her seat for a moment, then looked up at him. \u201cLeopold.\u201d</p><p>Only the lowering of his eyelids showed that he registered her use of his personal name.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to say.</p><p>\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought you a present.\u201d</p><p>She rose, unable to find words, unsure what her response should be. \u201cA present?\u201d</p><p>He took out a fan and laid it on the table. \u201cA mere token, a nothing. It made me think of you.\u201d He turned to go.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked back.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you go to Revels House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall return to Fonthill tomorrow. If Strange\u2019s daughter is still ill, I shall travel on to Revels House in a few days.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI shall make very sure that you are invited to the wedding, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont and I shall be happy to attend.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure why she felt the need to bring her husband\u2019s name into the conversation. It wasn\u2019t as if Elijah didn\u2019t\u2014hadn\u2019t\u2014Elijah himself refused to bed her until the chess game with Villiers was over. He understood the potential that she might have an affaire with Villiers.</p><p>Jemma sat for a long time after the door closed behind Villiers and his rose-colored silks...thinking of men. Of husbands, lovers, chess masters, heirs.</p><p>Of men.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>February 27, 1784</p><p>The next morning</p><p>Isidore gave the direction to the groomsman, climbed into the carriage, and started pulling off her gloves.</p><p>\u201cDo you always take off your gloves whenever possible?\u201d Simeon asked.</p><p>Isidore glanced at him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t wearing gloves either.\u201d Nor a cravat, nor a wig, nor a waistcoat, but why indulge in specifics?</p><p>\u201cI dislike gloves, and it seems you do as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He leaned forward and took her hand, turned it over. His hand was large and callused, like a working man\u2019s hands. He wore no rings, not even a signet.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell my fortune?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how. I had my fortune told once in India. The whole experience scared me to death and I never toyed with such people again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d It was hard to imagine Cosway, who looked large and fearless, quailing before a fortuneteller.</p><p>\u201cHe told me that it was up to me to make sure that my fortune didn\u2019t turn out as he prophesied.\u201d</p><p>Isidore succumbed to curiosity. \u201cPlease tell!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMaybe when we\u2019re old and gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re old and gray together!\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry at me because I didn\u2019t return when you came of age or because I\u2019m offering you the chance now to annul the marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry with you,\u201d Isidore said, withdrawing her hand. Her voice sounded petulant, but she felt out of her depth with this huge man.</p><p>Shamefully, she kept looking at him and thinking virgin? How could he be a virgin? He looked all man, all male...</p><p>She could feel her cheeks getting pink.</p><p>\u201cOr are you angry at me because I\u2019m not knowledgeable about conjugal intimacies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said, turning to the window. \u201cLook, Cosway, we\u2019re passing by Somerset House. If you crane your neck you might see the loggia on the south terrace. It was just finished...The Inns of Court are very close now.\u201d</p><p>It was barely an hour before they were back in the carriage again. Isidore was in shock.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it!\u201d she said. \u201cYou ought to be able to annul a marriage easily on the grounds of nonconsummation. I\u2019m sure everyone told me so a thousand times over the past few years.\u201d</p><p>Her husband raised an eyebrow. \u201cI had no idea that people were so interested in the state of our bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCosway,\u201d Isidore said impatiently, \u201cI am twenty-three years old. I\u2019ve been jaunting around Europe for years. Unless people actually checked their Debrett\u2019s, they tended to think we were merely engaged, and I never corrected that impression. Even Jemma, one of my closest friends, thought that for a time. It was less humiliating to let people think such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are plenty who read their Debrett\u2019s like a Bible, so they know of the proxy wedding. They would inquire when you were returning. Nonconsummation has been mentioned to me many times. I know Villiers brought it up. And now it seems that it isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cosway said. \u201cEven if it were legal, I would have to pass a test of my incapability. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Isidore made herself say the words, because she had to know: \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo question.

He started pulling open his greatcoat. \u201cI could show you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is that I find it rather difficult to be around you,\u201d he said, leaning back and leaving his greatcoat alone, to her relief.</p> <p>She felt inexplicably hurt. Of course, he was eager to get an annulment, but there was no need to be so brutal about it. \u201cAccording to that solicitor, there are other ways to dissolve our marriage,\u201d she said a bit stiffly. \u201cSo you needn\u2019t give up the dream of your docile little hen-wit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHen-wit? Not a kind word, Isidore...But I wasn\u2019t referring to the question of annulment, but to the state of my cock.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayn\u2019t I use that word in front of a lady?\u201d he inquired, as mild as sweet butter and all the time his eyes laughing at her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she managed. \u201cIt makes you sound like\u2014like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, Isidore. I have the strangest sense that you and my mother are actually quite alike. But how can that be? After all, I rescued you from Lord Strange\u2019s notorious house party, did I not? Even I have heard tell of its brothel-like atmosphere. But here you are, quailing at a good, solid Anglo-Saxon word like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that language like that wasn\u2019t flying around Strange\u2019s dining room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried not to listen to that sort of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d He leaned forward suddenly. \u201cThen without inappropriate words, Isidore, may I assure you that when I\u2019m in your presence that part of my body stands to attention?\u201d</p><p>Isidore could feel herself growing pink. And she always thought she looked her worst with ruddy cheeks. \u201cMust you say these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou impugned my manhood,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have you thinking that I was a limp lily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would\u2014\u201d she said, and broke off.</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d His whole face was alight with amusement. \u201cReally, I do have to show you, Isidore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He barked with laughter. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you at Strange\u2019s house. Even in the half hour during which I managed to stay awake, I was told an entirely salacious story about a bishop. And his miter.\u201d</p><p>Isidore shuddered. \u201cI hated that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were you there?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cTo force you to return home, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my mother said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was right. I had reached the point at which I thought either you came home or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>Isidore suddenly saw exactly how to get back at him for offering to show her his equipment. She leaned forward and patted his hand. \u201cJemma told me once that it is a wife\u2019s duty to provide an heir if a husband is incapable. Since you showed little signs of returning from Africa, I decided I should begin to explore the possibilities.\u201d</p><p>All traces of amusement were gone from his face.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to produce an heir for me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAnd Cosway, if things are not entirely successful on our wedding night, should we decide to stay together, I wouldn\u2019t want you to worry. I can always\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will never substitute another man for me! I don\u2019t know where you got the damned idea that I might be incapable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one of us can know the truth to that,\u201d she pointed out. She was dancing on the edge of jeopardy and it felt wonderful.</p><p>His mouth opened like that of a fish out of water.</p><p>She leaned forward and patted his knee this time. \u201cA virgin at your age...well. I would never tell a soul.\u201d And she beamed at him.</p><p>It was a beautiful moment. It almost made up for the way he was planning to annul their marriage due to her unsuitability as a wife.</p><p>He surprised her.</p><p>After staring at her for a moment, he collapsed into a howling fit of laughter.</p><p>She sat silently for a moment, but Cosway had the kind of laughter that made you want to join in, and she couldn\u2019t keep herself from smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou think that because I haven\u2019t tried out the equipment on a woman, it doesn\u2019t work at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable\u2014\u201d</p><p>He started howling with laughter again, and finally straightened up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s so funny,\u201d she said with reasonable dignity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you. I suppose it\u2019s due to being a lady. One can only assume from your idea about my equipment that you yourself have never\u2014\u201d He raised an eyebrow suggestively.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, completely confused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never pleasured yourself.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She felt herself turning pink. \u201cI see no need to engage in coarse language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit and dam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about pleasure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind you apparently have never had.\u201d</p><p>Isidore kept silent. What pleasure she had had or not was none of his business.</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cNow look here, Isidore. My\u2014well, what word am I allowed to use, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Pizzle, I suppose. Though no one ever talks to me about pizzles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cYou just haven\u2019t given them the chance. Pizzle, for Christ\u2019s sake. Sounds like a word a five-year-old might use when learning to take a piss. Are you sure we can\u2019t do with a bolder word, one more in line with the size of the thing?\u201d</p><p>Isidore opened her mouth, shut it, opened it again and said: \u201cPizzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, my pizzle is a pizzalone, in Italian. A big pizzle, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>He was still making fun of her. She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing sadder than a man who feels the need to boast about the size of his equipment,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not boasting, just stating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to prove it?\u201d And he put his hands back on the front of his greatcoat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Simeon looked at Isidore. She was laughing and indignant at the same time. She didn\u2019t look docile, or sweet, or biddable...she looked like a banked fire waiting for just one spark to flare. She had never pleasured herself...she had never...she had waited.</p><p>His blood was pounding through his body, begging him, telling him, commanding him. It took all his strength to resist the impulse to pull her into his arms. \u201cI can completely understand your anxiety,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re buying a pig in a poke. Unlike the rest of the Englishmen around here, I haven\u2019t been strutting around brothels for the last fifteen years. But if we did marry, I wouldn\u2019t bring you any diseases, Isidore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou have a reasonable suspicion that my pizzle is not in working condition. Out of shape. Withered from lack of use. Tired from my own handling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I would have to prove it to you, obviously, before I could expect you to commit to our marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you yourself are not committed, since I\u2019m not a docile little hen-wit.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence in the carriage. Her summary of his marital ambitions seemed unnecessarily harsh. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I want to marry an unintelligent woman,\u201d he began painstakingly, but she interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of you, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>He had that look again, the one of total calm and control. Isidore understood Simeon a bit better now\u2014and pitied him for it. Her husband thought he had anger and lust under control, not to mention fear. He thought he had life under control.</p> <p>He was a fool, but that wasn\u2019t the same thing as being a madman, the way she and Jemma had thought he might be. And from what he was saying, he wasn\u2019t incapable. Clearly, she needed to think about what to do next.</p><p>\u201cIf we call it off, I\u2019ll go back to Africa directly,\u201d he offered. \u201cSign the papers and keep out of your hair while you find another husband.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cVery generous of you.\u201d She looked down and found that her hands had curled into fists. We call it off? Simeon clearly thought that he was as much in control of the end of their marriage as he had been of the first eleven years.</p><p>\u201cI expect it might put the new husband off his feed to have the old husband hanging around assessing him,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cI might want to engage in a pizzle contest, for example.\u201d</p><p>Isidore smiled stiffly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw such a contest in Smyrna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the Mediterranean sea, part of the Anatolian Empire. I met a vizier and his brother who were traveling to present themselves as possible spouses to a sheikh\u2019s daughter. The decisive factor? A pizzle contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSize and endurance,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cThe sheikh made his entire harem available for the duration of the contest. He invited me to join the contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the sheikh just taking anyone? Not that they shouldn\u2019t have offered it to you, but you are married,\u201d Isidore pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh, the sheikh wouldn\u2019t have cared about an English marriage. In order to enter the contest, you had to offer a tiger ruby. And as it happened, I have something of a collection. I do believe that some of the gentlemen in question had no expectation of winning the princess\u2019s hand but they were happily offering up tiger rubies anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the harem,\u201d Isidore asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful women,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cExquisite in every way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Her tone could have curdled milk. \u201cHow did you ever resist the temptation?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI had you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you,\u201d he put in. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s put it this way: I didn\u2019t have you. Yet. But you were worth more than a night in a harem and a tiger ruby.\u201d</p><p>Isidore thought of various remarks she might make, comparing her worth to that of the hen-wit, and stopped herself. \u201cWhat does a tiger ruby look like? I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous: rubies with a tawny yellow streak through them. They\u2019re tremendously rare. In the end the sheikh was able to garner only eight such rubies even with the lure of his harem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do you know? Did you go to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Vizier Takla Haymanot won, and after eleven days of feasting (Takla needed a rest after the contest), he married the sheikh\u2019s daughter. Then I bought the eight rubies from the sheikh and we were all happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you show me one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment. They\u2019re in the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bank? If I had rubies like that\u2014though of course their history is rather disagreeable...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisagreeable? They were traded for pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt the ladies of the harem felt so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they didn\u2019t, they did a good job disguising it. They got to choose, you know.\u201d</p><p>Isidore felt herself turning a bit pink, but she was fascinated. \u201cThey got to choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand that this particular sheikh had two hundred and thirteen wives in his harem. And he himself was rather elderly. So the young ladies in his harem had little entertainment. The eight suitors were brought forward, and the ladies were allowed to choose. That was another aspect of the contest: if no lady chose to bed a suitor in a given round, he was out of the competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would look lovely in a harem veil,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>If she forced a consummation to the marriage by prancing about wearing nothing but a veil, Simeon would never be granted an annulment. It was something to think about.</p><p>\u201cI rather like the way that sheikh managed things,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough if I were the princess, I would have talked the sheikh into changing the contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Simeon prompted.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be very interesting if the princess too had been able to choose her future consort, the way the ladies of the harem were. I presume the gentlemen in question were not dressed?\u201d</p><p>He looked genuinely surprised, which was very satisfying. He needn\u2019t think he was the only one who could talk about bawdy things.</p><p>The carriage drew to a halt and she automatically started putting her gloves back on.</p><p>Simeon reached over and pulled one away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then he snatched the other. And finally, when the carriage door opened, he flung them straight out into the street. They flew past the face of a startled groomsman, who gave a little shriek and stumbled backward, falling onto his bottom.</p><p>\u201cYou are utterly deranged!\u201d Isidore said with conviction, leaning forward to look at the street. \u201cI can\u2019t go to my appointment without gloves.\u201d Sure enough, her blue gloves were lying in a puddle of blackened rainwater.</p><p>\u201cYou hate them,\u201d Simeon said, leaping out of the carriage and holding out his own ungloved hand.</p><p>She ground her teeth and then put her hand in his.</p><p>The shock of heat she felt was entirely unreasonable.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>65 Blackfriars Street</p><p>February 27, 1784</p><p>They were before a row of houses, in a part of London Simeon didn\u2019t know. Not that he really knew London. \u201cDoesn\u2019t your mantua-maker own a shop?\u201d he asked. The groomsman was standing at the door of a small house.</p><p>\u201cWe are visiting Signora Angelico\u2019s studio, Cosway,\u201d Isidore told him. \u201cThis is a great honor, extended only to her countrywomen, so please try to behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you call me by my given name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not polite.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cMy name is Simeon. It\u2019s a good, workable name and I thank God I didn\u2019t end up Godfrey, like my poor brother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to call each other by given names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already call you Isidore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to do so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time you call me Cosway, it sounds like cock to me,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing. Maybe you should go right on calling me Cosway, and I\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Isidore laughed. \u201cFine. Simeon.\u201d</p><p>Signora Angelico worked in a large open room on the bottom floor. The first thing Simeon saw were the open shelves that lined the room. Rolled cloth\u2014silk, satin, taffeta\u2014was stacked to the topmost level. It reminded him of souks in Morocco. The colors glowed coyly from the ends of the rolls, deep red silk, lilac shot with silver, the clear yellow of buttercups in early spring. Below the cloth were boxes, filled to the brim and spilling forth their contents: thread, buttons, yards and yards of ribbon. Everywhere there was lace. Lace hanging from wooden poles, lace thrown into piles, thin rivulets of lace and fatter rivers of it heaped on the tables that scattered the room.</p><p>Isidore had walked directly into the room, while Simeon paused on the threshold. Now she was dropping a deep curtsy before a woman in late middle age, with a deliciously curvy figure. The mantua-maker was kissing Isidore energetically on both cheeks, calling her bella.</p><p>Then they both turned and looked at him.</p><p>Simeon walked forward and swept into a flourishing bow. \u201cDuke,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cmay I present Signora Angelico?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnorato di conoscerla, signora.\u201d</p><p>Isidore raised an eyebrow. \u201cI had no idea you spoke Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really, but I can improvise from Portuguese.\u201d He turned back to Signora Angelico who was declaring herself felicissima to encounter, finally, the marito of her darling little duchess, whom she had loved since the moment she first saw her.</p><p>\u201cSignora Angelico made gowns for my aunt for many years,\u201d Isidore explained.</p><p>\u201cYour aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lived with my aunt after we married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course! Your aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugustina Del\u2019Fino,\u201d Isidore filled in.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t know every bit of information about what she\u2019d been doing for the last eight years since they married...well, perhaps it was more than eight years.</p><p>Signora Angelico turned away, her hands in the air, scattering her seamstresses in all directions.</p><p>\u201cHow long have we been married?\u201d Simeon inquired.</p><p>Isidore glanced at him. She would make an excellent politician; she had a way of putting a fellow in his place with nothing more than a raised eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I ask if I did?\u201d he said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cWe were engaged in June, 1765, married by proxy in June, 1773.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. You said you were twelve when we actually married.\u201d</p><p>Signora Angelico was gesticulating madly from the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in India. How long did you live with my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matter of a few months. I\u2019m afraid that we were not suited temperamentally, and we all agreed that I would be happier with my aunt.\u201d She turned away. \u201cCara signora, arriviamo!\u201d</p><p>Signora Angelico was chattering away with Isidore in Italian, so rapidly that Simeon couldn\u2019t follow. She was pulling bolts of cloth from the shelves and throwing them on the table, screaming at her assistants, waving her hands around...</p><p>Simeon went back to thinking. So Isidore went to live with her aunt and presumably expected him to collect her up at some point.</p><p>Signora turned away so he said to her, \u201cJust when did you think I\u2019d come back for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven years ago.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting for me for seven years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think I\u2019ve been doing?\u201d And she turned away, cooing over the signora\u2019s choice of cloth.</p><p>Simeon stared down at the bolt of fabric. It was spun of a material so fine that it looked like cobwebs, and yet he knew he had finer in his warehouses. He had shipped home trunks of fabric.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever receive fabric I sent from India?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him and her eyes were like chips of blue ice now. \u201cThey must have gone as astray as you yourself.\u201d</p><p>With a sinking feeling, he remembered that he sent everything to his mother\u2019s direction, who then refused acceptance. It seemed a strange decision on his part, now he thought of it.</p><p>He had chosen beautiful pieces and put them to the side, sending them home with instructions that they be delivered to the duchess. It was only now dawning on him that there really were\u2014and had been for years\u2014two duchesses.</p><p>The mantua-maker was matching the silvery fabric with a delicate lace tinted a faint blue. Isidore would look like the snow princess in a Russian fairy tale, the ones in which the princess had a heart of ice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>Signora Angelico was clearly not used to being interrupted\u2014nor to being countered. She flew into a paroxysm of exclamations, half in English, half in Italian.</p><p>Isidore turned to him and hissed, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that sort of thing to Signora Angelico! The Queen of France herself has ordered night clothing from signora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whether she sews the king\u2019s slippers with her teeth,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cThis fabric isn\u2019t of the quality I\u2019d like you to wear. I may not care much for polite society, Isidore, but I know fabric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned to Signora Angelico. She was as ruffled as a hen in the rain, her cheeks stained with crimson, her hands waving wildly around her head.</p><p>But Simeon had bargained with many a tradesman in places where to lose the bargain was to lose one\u2019s head. \u201cThis fabric isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough!\u201d Signora Angelico\u2019s face took on a purple hue. \u201cThis is the very best, magnifico, lovely in every way, fit for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simeon rubbed it between his fingers and shook his head. \u201cIndian silk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilk from the looms of the Maharaja himself\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simeon shook his head. \u201cSignora, signora...surely you don\u2019t take me for a dunce?\u201d He pushed the fabric to the side and sat on the table.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Isidore said to him in an urgent undertone. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit before us.\u201d</p><p>Simeon snapped his fingers at one of the girls, who were flocking nervously against the wall as if they thought he would faint merely from the signora\u2019s frown. \u201cChairs for Her Grace and Signora Angelico.\u201d</p><p>Two of them scuttled over with straight-backed chairs, used by the girls while they engaged in hand-sewing. Perfect. Signora Angelico was now seated just below him. He smiled down at her. \u201cI can tell that you are a woman who adores fabric,\u201d he cooed. \u201cA woman ravished by antherine silk, so glossy and light, perhaps with a touch of mignonette lace.\u201d</p><p>Signora\u2019s whole face changed. \u201cYou know your fabrics, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cNow this\u2014\u201d he put a finger disdainfully on the silk she proposed. \u201cPaduasoy. A nice strong silk. Perhaps good enough for some. But not,\u201d and he gave every word a tiny emphasis, \u201cnot for my wife, signora.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou!\u201d she said. \u201cYou are going to lead my poor little duchess on a chase, are you not?\u201d Her black eyes snapped, but he could feel the rigid backs of her girls relax.</p><p>\u201cIt is a man\u2019s duty when faced with such beauty as graces my wife,\u201d he said solemnly, reaching down and bringing her hand to his lips. \u201cOf course, had I seen you in my youth...\u201d</p><p>Signora bounced to her feet. \u201cAs if I could have been tempted by such a callow young thing as a raw duke!\u201d She clapped her hands. \u201cLucia!

After that, Signora Angelico was putty in Simeon\u2019s hands. He rejected the tiffany as too harsh; they finally found a taffeta he found acceptable. It was cherry red, with only a touch of stiffness to it.</p><p>\u201cI see it falling to the ground with a froth at the feet and a small train.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the color...\u201d Signora Angelico shook her head. \u201cIf only I had a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWash it in tea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWash this fabric in tea?\u201d She looked down at the fabric. It looked as if it had been woven by fairies; if you let it fall through your fingers it sounded like a whispered song.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Simeon said. He kissed her hand again, and that was that. Isidore was to have a gown of tea-washed taffeta, edged in a thin border of glossy lace made in Brussels.</p><p>The signora was drunk with the garment she saw in her imagination. \u201cComing to the mid finger,\u201d she murmured to herself, \u201cd\u00e9colletage, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we finished?\u201d Isidore asked, standing up.</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cThese things take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d Isidore retorted, looking to make sure that Signora Angelico wasn\u2019t listening. She wasn\u2019t; she looked as dreamy as her aunt had while practicing a new sonata. \u201cThe first cloth would have been just fine. I can\u2019t imagine why you took such an interest, since the nightdress will presumably be for another\u2019s man\u2019s pleasure!\u201d</p> <p>Simeon opened his mouth\u2014and closed it. She had a point. Isidore was intoxicating; he tended to forget everything in her presence.</p><p>\u201cWe could have been home by now,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI have another appointment.\u201d She glanced down at the watch she wore on a ribbon and gave a little shriek. \u201cAnd I\u2019m late. If you please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must return to Revels House immediately,\u201d Simeon said in the carriage. \u201cThere are a few outstanding problems with the estate. I\u2019ll return to London next week and we can continue the discussion of our annulment.\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked at him. \u201cCertainly,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I happen to be in residence.\u201d</p><p>He looked absurdly surprised, given that her tone had been quite mild.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p> <p>February 27, 1784</p><p>The Duke of Beaumont had had a detestable day. His wife had not appeared at breakfast, and though Jemma rarely made an appearance, he had rather hoped she would. The House of Lords was erupting into all sorts of strange battles to do with Pitt\u2019s India Bill and the Mutiny Bill. The king had said Fox was trying to reduce him to a mere figurehead. Fox was trying to force the resignation of the ministry...</p><p>He was tired. He was so bone-tired that he actually wavered a bit as he descended from his carriage. One of his footmen darted forward as if he were a man of eighty, and Elijah had to wave him away. It was humiliating.</p><p>His body was failing him.</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d never fainted in public again, as he had last year. Right on the floor of the House of Lords, he had collapsed.</p><p>These days, to everyone\u2019s eyes, he seemed absolutely fine.</p><p>But he knew he wasn\u2019t. He felt a clock ticking over his shoulder, and its tick was louder since they\u2019d returned from the Christmas holidays. Perhaps because it had been so relaxing to go to the country for the holidays, to wander through one of Jemma\u2019s outrageous masquerades, to play chess with his wife, to bicker amiably about politics with acquaintances who didn\u2019t think the outcome of any particular vote was of much importance.</p><p>Returning to the seething brew that was the House of Lords was difficult.</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t fainted since the first time.</p><p>But he had passed out, just for a second, now and then. So far he had always been sitting down, and no one had realized.</p><p>But the truth\u2014the truth was that he needed to talk to his wife.</p><p>Jemma had come back from Paris so they could create an heir. He could hardly bring the words to the surface of his mind. This wasn\u2019t the way he wanted to bed Jemma. They had engaged in an elaborate, intricate ballet over the last year. They were beginning...</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what they were beginning. But he knew that it was important. More important than anything before.</p><p>And still his body failed him.</p><p>\u201cYou work too hard, Your Grace!\u201d his butler scolded him. \u201cThose rapscallions in the government need to learn to do without you for a time.\u201d</p><p>Only he knew that he had already cut back his workload. He smiled at Fowle, handed over his greatcoat, inquired of the duchess\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cIn the library, Your Grace,\u201d the butler said. \u201cWith a chess board, and waiting for you, I believe.\u201d</p><p>He walked into the library and paused for a moment just to savor what lay before him. Jemma was heartbreakingly, astoundingly beautiful. She was sitting in a patch of light cast by many candles, examining her chess board. She had her hair swept up in some sort of complicated arrangement, but not powdered. It was the color of old gold, the deep happy color of sunshine. She was wearing an open robe of flowered gauze, worked with gold twists, that came to a deep V over her breasts.</p><p>The pulse of longing he felt was for everything about his wife: her wit, her beauty, her breasts, her brilliance...</p><p>How in the hell could he not have realized it when they first married? How could he have wasted those years, thrown them away on politics and his mistress? Couldn\u2019t he have thought\u2014just imagined\u2014that perhaps time wasn\u2019t a gift one had for the asking? Couldn\u2019t he have remembered that his father had died at thirty-four?</p><p>And he was thirty-four, as of this month. Time wove its changes, marched apace...he would give anything to have back those first weeks of marriage when Jemma looked to him for advice, when she cuddled beside him in the morning, asking questions about the House.</p><p>Great fool that he was back then, he had leapt from their bed eager to be at the House, not sitting about with a wife whom he barely knew. Off to his mistress, who appeared during the noon hour on Tuesdays and Fridays. That was part of his routine: emerge from the House of Lords and exhaust himself with Sarah, right there in his office.</p><p>Good old Sarah Cobbett. She loved him; he loved her in a way. One had to hope that she was happy.</p><p>He\u2019d pensioned her off after Jemma caught them on the desk in his chambers.</p><p>The stab of guilt was an old friend, though it seemed to grow fiercer with the years, not less so.</p><p>For her part, Jemma seemed to have forgiven him. Perhaps.</p><p>She looked up at him, and her smile made his heart stop.</p><p>Life had given him a woman who was\u2014he knew it with a bone-deep certainty\u2014the most intelligent woman in Europe. And he had thrown her away to rut with a kindly woman whose only claim to intelligence was that she was never late to their twice-weekly appointment, not once during the six years in which Sarah was his mistress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t even remember Sarah\u2019s face now, which just made him feel guiltier.</p><p>\u201cLook at this!\u201d Jemma called to him.</p><p>He walked over and looked down at the board, rather blindly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a counter gambit credited to Giuoco. I think I\u2019ve improved on it. Look...\u201d and she moved the pieces so quickly that he almost didn\u2019t follow, but of course he did. Their brains were remarkably similar.</p> <p>He sat down.</p><p>\u201cTerrible day?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was almost too much. Her eyes were blue, like the midnight blue of the sky at night. And he wanted\u2014her. Life. To stay here, on this earth with Jemma. To see the child they would create, if they had time.</p><p>\u201cElijah!\u201d she said, startled. Slipped from her seat and sat on his knee. He turned his face into her shoulder. She smelled like roses.</p><p>He didn\u2019t cry, of course. He never cried. He hadn\u2019t when his father died, and he wouldn\u2019t cry over his own death either.</p> <p>But he put an arm around his wife and pulled her closer. She hadn\u2019t been this near to him in years.</p><p>It felt good.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Revels House</p><p>February 29, 1784</p><p>Simeon knew the moment that Honeydew opened the study door that there was more trouble. He put down his quill.</p> <p>The news that the Duke of Cosway had returned, and that he was actually paying the family debts, had spread like wildfire. Half of England seemed to be lined up outside the servants\u2019 door, begging five minutes to plead cases, generally to do with bills that his father or mother had refused to pay. Some stretched back twenty years.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a visitor,\u201d Honeydew announced.</p><p>Simeon waited, bracing himself for an irate creditor.</p><p>\u201cHer Grace, the Duchess of Cosway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d He bit off the curse. He was exhausted, he was dusty, and he could smell the water closets even with the door to his study closed. Isidore would probably take one look at this moldering excuse for a ducal palace and demand the annulment by tomorrow. Which would be a good thing, of course.</p><p>Honeydew had become distinctly more friendly, and had even stopped giving Simeon directives regarding his attire and manners. But he didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop himself this time. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simeon looked at him and Honeydew dropped the suggestion. Likely Isidore did think he should be wearing a wig and waistcoat buttoned to the neck with a cravat on top. Even more likely, she pictured Revels House as perfumed and elegant.</p> <p>He pulled his coat down, straightened his cuffs, noted the ink stain and dismissed it. He could bother with white cuffs and a cravat when he had to go to London and find himself another wife.</p><p>\u201cHer Grace is in the Yellow Salon,\u201d Honeydew said rather nervously.</p><p>\u201cYellow? Which one is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drapes used to be yellow,\u201d Honeydew admitted.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cThe Curdled Milk Salon.\u201d</p><p>There was actually a smile on his butler\u2019s face. \u201cThis way, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Isidore was seated on a straw-colored sofa, facing away from him. That straw color had once been lemon yellow, Simeon noted to himself. Isidore looked like a bright jewel perched on a haystack. His wife\u2019s hair was the glossy black of a raven\u2019s breast; her lips were cherries at their reddest. She looked like every boyhood fantasy he\u2019d ever had about an exotic princess who would dance before him, wearing little more than a scarf.</p><p>He glanced down and groaned silently.</p><p>He\u2019d tamed his body into perfect submission until he met his wife. He started buttoning his long coat as he walked forward, starting from the bottom.</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d he said, when he had crossed enough of the faded carpet so that she could hear him without a shout. The only thing his house had in abundance was space.</p><p>She leapt to her feet, turning to face him. She was wearing a tight jacket over a buttoned waistcoat, with a tall beehive hat on top of her curls. The jacket was a rich plum color; gloves of the same color lay discarded on the sofa beside her.</p><p>\u201cDuke,\u201d she said, sinking into a curtsy.</p><p>He walked toward her and didn\u2019t bow. Instead he took her hands in his and smiled down at her, resisting a sudden temptation to snatch her into his arms and steal a kiss. One didn\u2019t kiss a wife who was not a wife. \u201cThis is a lovely surprise.\u201d</p><p>When she smiled, her lips formed a perfect cupid\u2019s bow. \u201cI told you I might not wait for your visit to London. I hope I\u2019m not disturbing you,\u201d she said sweetly. She pulled her hands free and sat down.</p><p>He sat on the sofa facing hers. It gave a great squeaking groan on feeling his weight, as if it were about to collapse to the ground. \u201cI am embarrassed to welcome you here. The house is in a terrible state. This room, for example...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks clean,\u201d she offered, looking about.</p><p>It was clean. Honeydew would tolerate no dirt, but he had the feeling the butler worked to death the few housemaids his mother had kept in the household. He might as well get over the rough ground as quickly as possible. \u201cMy mother stopped paying bills a while ago. And she dismissed most of the household staff.\u201d</p><p>Isidore had a strange look on her face and he knew just what she was thinking. The odor had begun drifting through the room like a fetid suitor.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have the water closets cleaned, the slates repaired, the house painted, the furniture upholstered, the servants paid, the cottages re-thatched...\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s hand flew to her mouth, and over her nose as well. \u201cOh, dear!\u201d</p><p>Simeon nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t invite you to Revels House. When rain comes, and the wind shifts...\u201d</p><p>She put down her hand and to his great relief, she was smiling. \u201cYou looked tired when I first met you,\u201d she observed. \u201cBut now you look even worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a great deal of paperwork. Unpaid bills, solicitors\u2019 letters...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a large estate, and you are my husband, Cosway. It\u2019s yours. That is, it should have been yours long ago, but you never appeared to take charge of it so I have managed it.\u201d</p><p>His heart lightened even further. \u201cThe truth is that I have a great deal of money as well. And mystifyingly, so does the duchy. I have no need of substance, though I thank you heartily for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why...\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cExactly. My mother has long been a mystery to me. Did you understand her during your sojourn here?\u201d</p><p>Isidore picked up her gloves and carefully smoothed each finger. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I was far too young and coarse. Your mother is a woman of great sensibility.\u201d</p><p>He thought that was a nice way of saying the obvious: his mother was a raving lunatic, if not worse. \u201cShe didn\u2019t used to be like this,\u201d he offered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the shock of my father\u2019s death made things worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, but I do appreciate the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she said, standing up. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage everything on your own, Simeon.\u201d She looked around. \u201cHave you even raised the question of redecorating with your mother?\u201d</p><p>He rose, thinking about how casually she said his first name...finally. \u201cMy mother is having a difficult time adjusting to my presence. She is distressed by the fact that I am paying bills that she considers to have been presented by thieves. But after so much time has passed, I have no way of ascertaining whether the bills are fraudulent, so I am necessarily paying everything in full.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cThen I suppose my most pressing question is which bedchamber lies the farthest distance from a water closet?\u201d</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t plan to stay in the master bedchamber. Of course not. He\u2019d told her that he wanted to dissolve the marriage. What in the hell had he been thinking?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask the butler, shall I?\u201d she said, turning away. The line of her back was straight and incredibly slender. And then her hoops...the way her skirt billowed as she walked made him long to follow the line of her back down to her hips with his hand. With a silent groan, he pushed open the door for Isidore and she swept through.</p><p>What would Honeydew make of the duchess\u2019s request for a bedchamber far, far away? As it turned out, he was in entire sympathy.</p> <p>\u201cThe dowager duchess has her own water closet, of course,\u201d Simeon heard him telling Isidore. \u201cAnd how she can abide the odor on damp days...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably used to it,\u201d Isidore said, reasonably enough.</p><p>Back when Simeon was practicing meditation and first learning to control his body, it had been easy to maintain a manly discretion. When he arrived in Africa, and discovered running, he learned how to control bodily appetites such as hunger.</p><p>But England was endangering all his carefully erected barriers. His imperturbable, manly fa\u00e7ade was shaken. He was enraged at his dead father for avoiding his obligations. He was irritated by his mother. And worst of all, he was riveted by lust for his wife. If the truth be told, lust was absorbing at least half of his cognitive powers at any given moment, even given that he\u2019d had so little sleep.</p><p>He could hear Valamksepa in his mind\u2019s ear, intoning that no man need be at the behest of his emotions, and certainly not of his body. The memory sounded like water running over pebbles a long way away.</p> <p>Isidore put her hand on his sleeve and her touch sent a pulse of fire to his loin. \u201cSimeon, is Godfrey away at school? He was just a toddler when I last saw him. He must be in long pants by now.\u201d</p><p>Simeon gave her a wry smile. \u201cHe\u2019s thirteen and nearly as tall as I am. You\u2019ll meet him tonight.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cThirteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find him a tutor. My mother deemed Eton too expensive and yet she never hired a proper tutor. Luckily, he seems very bright and has taught himself, rather eclectically, from my father\u2019s library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont is sure to know an appropriate young man. Godfrey taught himself?\u201d</p><p>Another pulse of shame. He should have been here, making certain that his brother was properly raised. But Simeon made sure his face was impassive. It was weakness to admit weakness. \u201cHe will quickly catch up to his peers.\u201d</p> <p>Isidore gave him a quizzical look, but turned away to speak to Honeydew. \u201cI do not travel lightly,\u201d she said. \u201cSeveral carriages are following more slowly with my clothing.\u201d</p><p>When Honeydew took her upstairs to explore the most palatable bedchamber\u2014from an olfactory point of view\u2014Simeon returned to his study.</p><p>The last thing he wanted to do was be in the same room with Isidore and a bed.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Revels House</p><p>February 29, 1784</p><p>Isidore had never selected a room on this basis before: she and Honeydew entered each room and then sniffed. But the stench was pervasive. It followed them from room to room like a friendly dog.</p><p>She was beginning to wonder if there was an inn within ready distance when Honeydew suddenly said, \u201cPerhaps the Dower House, Your Grace. Would you consider it? I\u2019m afraid it hasn\u2019t been opened or aired, but it\u2019s a lovely little house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoneydew, I will consider any place that was not refurbished to include a water closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe water closets in this house might be excellent,\u201d Honeydew said, \u201cif only I could have persuaded His Grace\u2019s father, the late duke, to take proper care of the pipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are they to be cleaned?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Honeydew had a look of near agony on his face. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the duke has encountered some difficulty finding appropriate help, but we should have men here within a day or two. It truly wasn\u2019t as bad until this week...the damp weather.\u201d He wrung his hands.</p><p>\u201cI can see that there was little you could do.\u201d They walked downstairs and out a side door, and though Isidore would never say so, the relief of walking into the fresh outdoor air, brisk though it might be, was considerable. She saw Honeydew take a lungful as well. \u201cI suppose one gets used to it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d Honeydew said. It was clear that he had not grown accustomed.</p><p>They followed a gravel path around the house. The shambles of a formal garden stretched before them.</p><p>She turned to Honeydew, mouth open, but he had the answer. \u201cAs of two days ago, His Grace instructed the estate\u2019s remaining gardener to hire additional staff as expeditiously as possible. They will bring the gardens back into trim.\u201d</p><p>The Dower House was not really a house; it was more of a cottage. But it was charming, with a rosebush climbing over the windows. It was like a doll\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cWhat color will the roses be?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPale pink,\u201d the butler replied. \u201cThere are a great many of them. The vine hasn\u2019t been pruned as it ought, but it puts out a quantity of roses all the same. There are lilac trees around the back, but they won\u2019t bloom, of course, until late April.\u201d</p><p>He took out a huge circle of keys and finally managed to fit one to the lock. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anyone living here since His Grace\u2019s grandmother,\u201d he said, over his shoulder. \u201cWe used to air it out and clean it thoroughly, but in the past few years...\u201d</p><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t enough staff to spare.</p><p>After a small entryway, sunlight fell into a surprisingly large sitting room. The furniture was soft and covered with Holland cloths. There was no attempt at ducal elegance, quite the opposite. The walls were paneled in elmwood, painted a cream color with little pansies scattered here and there. The floor was flagstone, but a cheerful, if faded, rug hugged the middle. Best of all, the house smelled dusty but without even a whiff of sewage.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely!\u201d Isidore exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThe late duke\u2019s mother disliked formality,\u201d Honeydew said, bustling to pull open the curtains. \u201cPhew! Look at this dust. I\u2019ll summon all the housemaids immediately, Your Grace, and we\u2019ll have it clean and aired in no time.\u201d</p><p>Isidore had discovered a charming little bedchamber containing a large sleigh bed and one table stacked with worn, leather-bound books.</p><p>\u201cThe duke\u2019s grandmother was a great reader by all accounts,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cHer own life was quite a romantic tale.\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked up from a small copy of Tales of the Nile that she\u2019d discovered. It was falling apart, though she couldn\u2019t tell whether that was due to age or over-reading. \u201cRomantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you must ask His Grace to tell you about it,\u201d Honeydew said, darting about to throw back the shutters. \u201cThere now, if you would be so kind as to accompany me back to the house, we\u2019ll get the house tidy for you.\u201d</p><p>Isidore shook her head. She supposed she would have to reenter the house for dinner. But she couldn\u2019t face that yet. She tucked herself into a rocking chair, book in hand. \u201cI am exactly like my husband\u2019s grandmother,\u201d she said. \u201cA great reader. I shall be quite happy here. When the maids arrive, I\u2019ll simply go for a little stroll.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill your personal maid be arriving in the later carriages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lucille experiences stomach problems when she travels, so she generally follows me in a slow-moving carriage.

If you\u2019re quite certain that you\u2019re comfortable...\u201d He lingered, obviously disturbed by the idea of leaving her.</p><p>But Isidore was already opening up a book. \u201cI shall be perfectly happy here, Honeydew. Truly. Please send the dowager duchess my regrets that I cannot greet her due to the absence of my maid.\u201d</p> <p>She had a sudden thought. \u201cDo you know, I believe that I am strangely fatigued by my journey.\u201d She smiled at the butler, who had the discretion not to indicate that she seemed in the utter pink of health. \u201cI shall dine here tonight.\u201d</p><p>He bowed.</p><p>\u201cI should be honored if the duke would disrupt his schedule and join me,\u201d she added. \u201cQuite informally, of course. He needn\u2019t wear a cravat.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew\u2019s eyes were smiling, even if his face kept to a servantlike solemnity. \u201cJust so, Your Grace. I shall inform him.\u201d He bowed again. \u201cMay I add that your generosity as regards His Grace\u2019s attire will be greatly appreciated?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p> <p>Revels House</p><p>February 29, 1784</p><p>\u201cHer Grace is in the Dower House,\u201d Honeydew informed the duke. \u201cThe maids have been to clean, and she seems quite comfortable. We started a fire in the grate. The walls are damp, and it should quickly take away the chill.\u201d</p><p>The duke looked up from the letter he was writing and dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cReally? Because of the stench? I think I must be getting used to it, Honeydew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace. The air is somewhat drier than it was this morning and it\u2019s not so obvious. But we are due for more rain tonight, or so Mr. Sumerall, the gardener, has told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s well out of it, then,\u201d the duke said, looking exhausted.</p> <p>\u201cThe duchess requests that you dine with her in the Dower House,\u201d Honeydew said. In his estimation, the duchess wasn\u2019t coming back into the main house until the water closets were cleaned. Even if Mr. Kinnaird managed to find cleaning men in London\u2014and given the amount of money that the duke had given him, he ought to\u2014Honeydew thought that they wouldn\u2019t arrive for a day or two.</p><p>Besides, Honeydew was discovering he had alarmingly affectionate feelings toward the young duke who worked all day and half the night, and who was paying everyone, honest and true. The whole countryside was talking about it. A year ago he couldn\u2019t find a ripe melon without ready money, but now offers were flowing from all sides.</p><p>\u201cThis Mr. Purfew who claims to have done great service for the late duke,\u201d the duke said. \u201cDo you have any idea who that might be, Honeydew?\u201d</p><p>Honeydew pursed his lips. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t ring a bell. There was a Pursloe\u2014\u201d</p><p>The duke turned to an enormous ledger that lay open to his right. \u201cI\u2019ve already noted a payment to Pursloe, made yesterday, for four wigs purchased by my father ten years ago, payment refused on the grounds that they were too old-fashioned.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew judged it best to be silent.</p><p>But the duke smiled faintly. \u201cI suspect my father was buried in one of those old-fashioned wigs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe, sir, that there should be a letter thereabouts from a London wigmaker named Mr. Westby, who made the burial wig. It was His Grace\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p> <p>The smile fell from the duke\u2019s face and he looked to his ledger with a sigh. \u201cI haven\u2019t found Westby\u2019s letter, Honeydew. But I attempted to take a nap at one point and discovered a great trove of letters propping up the leg of the sofa. When you get a moment, could you have the footmen remove that sofa? It\u2019s beyond repair.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew saw that the velvet, claw-footed sofa had lurched to the ground, minus a leg. Moreover a sprinkle of straw haloed the floor around it, showing that its innards were openly disintegrating. He felt a rush of embarrassment. \u201cI am sorry that\u2014your father wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The duke held up his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cTruly. I am learning the depths of my father\u2019s stubbornness letter by letter and I can only admire you for staying in your post. I have instructed Kinnaird to double your wages; consider it hardship pay.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew drew himself upright. \u201cI thank you, Your Grace.\u201d Happy visions of retirement and a small cottage danced before his eyes. Then he returned to the subject at hand. It seemed to him quite odd that the duke and duchess were married, and yet not married. Not to mention sleeping, quite obviously, in different quarters.</p><p>What was needed was to create some good old-fashioned propinquity.</p><p>\u201cHer Grace has requested supper to be served in the Dower House,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall set a cover for you.\u201d</p><p>The duke nodded. But then, as Honeydew was leaving, he looked up from his desk and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to ask Godfrey to join us.\u201d</p><p>Godfrey? A thirteen-year-old joining the intimate dinner between a barely married man and wife? Honeydew could not approve.</p><p>\u201cI shall ascertain whether the young master is free to join you,\u201d he said, vowing to make quite certain that Godfrey was occupied.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m free,\u201d piped up a voice from the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cLord Godfrey!\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s brown curls popped up from the far side of yet another faded sofa. \u201cI haven\u2019t even met the duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were still there,\u201d the duke said, smiling at his brother. \u201cOne hour more and I\u2019m dragging you out on the roads for a run, Godfrey.\u201d</p><p>Defeated, Honeydew bowed and departed.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The Dower House</p><p>February 29, 1784</p><p>Isidore prepared her cottage with great care. A small army of housemaids cleaned it from floor to rafters. Then she sent two of the most capable-looking ones searching all over Revels House for bits of furniture.</p><p>By the end of the afternoon, she had her little dollhouse made up a trifle more comfortably. Candles shone all over the room. Upholstered chairs replaced the unpadded armchairs favored by the late dowager duchess. There was a vase of snowdrops that Isidore gathered in the garden, and the bed (large enough for two) was made up with snowy white linens and piled with pillows.</p><p>It was still a doll\u2019s house, but polished to a high gleam and smelling deliciously of French lilacs (thanks to some very expensive parfum), it spoke of creature comforts.</p><p>And seduction.</p><p>The footmen arrived with a small dining room table and Isidore had them move it twice before she decided the best place for it was in the corner of the sitting room, where she and Simeon would eat in a mysterious, slightly shadowed intimacy.</p><p>She sent a suggested menu to Honeydew, including hot, spiced wine that she could prepare herself at fireside.</p><p>She could just picture it: the duke with his broad shoulders, his jacket thrown open and his hair tumbling to his shoulders. She would play the immaculate, utterly delicious wife. If what he wanted was English womanhood in all its delicate docility, she could do that.</p><p>It was like a favorite story that she had already read, and now got to enact.

Jasmine had an innocent touch, she thought.</p><p>As she sat in the hot water, she refined her story to a trembling virginal bride facing a wild pirate king.</p><p>That sounded like just the sort of setting to appeal to Simeon. And he obviously wanted to believe it. Look how he\u2019d leapt at the idea that she\u2019d never pleasured herself.</p><p>She found herself smiling. This was going to be fun. She tried out a few sentences in her mind. Oh dear! It\u2019s far too large!</p> <p>Or would one say, You\u2019re far too large?</p><p>The etiquette of it all...Maybe she could just shudder, throw a hand over her eye and squeak, No, no, no!</p><p>Of course, the wild pirate would overcome the delicate flower\u2019s resistance. The key was to pretend not to enjoy it.</p><p>Or perhaps the key was to be afraid?</p><p>Simeon wasn\u2019t mad. And she had a fair idea that he truly was capable in bed. He was dressed oddly. But he looked male. In fact the very idea of him without clothes made her feel the opposite of frightened.</p> <p>She got out of the bath and picked up the toweling cloth left for her by Lucille. All she had to do was flirt with him until he took some liberties. Then she would launch into a version of the fragile English rose, and, she hoped, he would revert to wild pirate, and all her worries would be resolved.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>February 29, 1784</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do this evening?\u201d Jemma looked down the table at her husband. \u201cWe\u2019ve been invited to Lady Feddrington\u2019s soir\u00e9e in honor of the visit of the Prussian prince, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick; or there is a musicale given by Lady Cholmondelay; and of course there\u2019s the performance of As You Like It that we discussed last week, in which all the women\u2019s parts are played by boys.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah put down his napkin and stood up, walking around the long table to Jemma. She looked up at him inquiringly. He looked somewhat better than he had before eating: he was too young to look so bone-tired.</p><p>\u201cI am in no mood to watch boys prance about the stage,\u201d he said, taking her arm to bring her to her feet, \u201cbut I should be happy to escort you to either of the other events.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked at him. She fully expected him to say that he had to work. To read those documents that he was always reading, even at the supper table. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm. \u201cI have decided not to work in the evenings. I am at your command, duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jemma said, rather uncertainly.</p><p>They strolled toward the drawing room. \u201cI suppose the soir\u00e9e,\u201d Jemma said, deciding. \u201cI should like to dance.\u201d She was wearing a new dress, a delicious gown of figured pale yellow satin with a pattern of tiny green leaves. Her skirts were trimmed with double flounces and rather shorter than in the previous year.</p><p>Elijah looked down at her with a smile in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am wearing a new gown and I should like to show it off,\u201d she told him, thinking that there were nice aspects to having been married so long.</p> <p>\u201cThe hem reveals a delectable bit of your slipper,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>\u201cYou noticed!\u201d She stuck out her toe. She wore yellow slippers with very high heels, ornamented with a cunning little rose.</p><p>\u201cYellow roses,\u201d he said, \u201care not nearly as rare as a perfect ankle like yours, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood lord,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cIt must be a blue moon. You\u2019re complimenting your wife. Let me find my fan and my knotting bag\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fowle handed them to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely fan,\u201d Elijah said, taking it from her. \u201cWhat is the imagery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t looked closely,\u201d she said, turning away so that Fowle could help her with her cloak.</p><p>\u201cVenus and Adonis...and a very lovely rendition as well.\u201d</p><p>She came back and stood on tiptoe to see the fan, which he had spread before him. \u201cOh, I see. Yes, there is Venus. My goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be pulling poor Adonis into the bushes,\u201d Elijah said. She loved the dry humor he displayed when he wasn\u2019t acting like a hidebound and moralistic politician. \u201cLook at her breasts! No wonder the poor lad looks frightened and titillated, all at once. A tantalizing bit of art, this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t approve?\u201d she said. \u201cYou, the proper politician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Venus has offered to pull me into the bushes, so I could hardly say.\u201d He closed the fan. \u201cWhere on earth did it come from, Jemma? You didn\u2019t purchase the piece without looking at the illustration?\u201d Fowle threw a cloak around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cFans are a popular gift at the moment,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThis came from Villiers. He gave it to me a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he paid you a visit.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt a strange qualm. It was all so difficult, having her husband\u2019s boyhood friend trying to seduce her. \u201cHe came by to tell me of the strange doings of the Duke of Cosway.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw Elijah toss the fan dismissively toward one of the footmen. Of course, that left her without a fan for the evening. No one was ever without a fan. But she could say that she left it in the carriage.</p><p>She climbed into the carriage and sank into the corner, suddenly struck by a profound realization. It was too late for Villiers, fan or no. She would never drag him into the bushes. When she first returned from France, she was so angry with Elijah that she thought to have an affaire with Villiers, but he had refused her.</p><p>And now, now that Villiers had changed his mind...it was too late.</p><p>Elijah had kissed her a few weeks ago. He had kissed her twice, actually. It was absurd, it was deluded. She was riveted by the memory of those kisses.</p><p>He was her first, her only husband, her...</p><p>Whatever he was to her.</p><p>The truth was that she was infatuated. She spent her afternoons in the library, waiting for him to return from the House of Lords. She secretly read all the papers so that she could engage in clever conversation about the events of the day. She thrilled when reading accounts of his speeches, and trembled when he set out in the morning on a day that included a talk before Parliament.</p><p>Not that he knew it, of course.</p><p>She would rather die of humiliation than let her husband know that she was infatuated by him.</p><p>She kept telling herself that Elijah never bothered to come to Paris to bring her home when she had fled there as a young bride. She kept reminding herself of his mistress, but somehow she had lost her rage, or perhaps her enthusiasm for that rage.</p><p>It was gone, tucked away in a faded box of memories. And the only clear thing she knew about her marriage was that she was married to a man who was so beautiful, with his sharp cheekbones and English grace, his tall, strong body and intelligent eyes\u2014so beautiful that she would do anything to lure him back to her bed.</p><p>She was aware, while dressing, while putting on lip rouge, while putting on her shoes, that she was playing the most serious game of her life. He had to come to her. She could not chase him, beg him, or by any means at her disposal make it clear that he was welcome to her person...to her heart.</p><p>Though he was.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t work, not for life.</p><p>She wanted Elijah\u2014not the way she had him when they were first married, not with the genial affection and enthusiasm he showed for their awkward couplings. She wanted him, the Duke of Beaumont, one of the most powerful men in government, at her feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she wouldn\u2019t settle for less.</p><p>Villiers would be useful in her campaign. He and Elijah had been childhood friends and were now estranged. Good. She would use him. She would use any man in London who asked her to dance, if it would fan a spark of jealousy in her husband\u2019s civilized heart.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t jealousy that could do it. It was she: she had to be more witty, more beautiful, more desirable than she ever had been.</p><p>Elijah was seated in the opposite corner of the carriage, looking absently out of the window. As always, his wig was immaculate and discreet. Not for the Duke of Beaumont were pyramids of scented curls or immovable rolls perched on top of frizzled locks. He wore a simple, short-cut wig with curls so small they hardly deserved the label.</p> <p>Underneath, she knew, he had his hair clipped close to his skull. It was a style that would destroy the appeal of almost every man. But on Elijah it brought into focus his cheekbones and the gaunt, courteous, restrained masculinity of him.</p><p>By the time they arrived at Lady Feddrington\u2019s soir\u00e9e, the receiving line had broken up and the ballroom was crowded. They stood for a moment at the top of the steps leading down into the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit overwhelming,\u201d Elijah murmured. \u201cHow on earth do you ladies manage to move about a room like this, given the width of your panniers?\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled at him. \u201c\u2019Tis only the unfashionable who have very wide panniers this season. Look at myself, for instance.\u201d</p><p>He looked, and she felt his glance as if it were a touch. Not that she showed it. She had spent years in the court of Versailles; if those years had taught her anything, it was that she should never reveal vulnerability.</p> <p>\u201cYour skirts look as wide as a barnyard door,\u201d he said to her. But she saw the laughter in his grave eyes. He needed to laugh more.</p><p>She met his eyes with the kind of smile that told a man she liked him. It felt odd to give it to her husband. \u201cNarrower than many,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are precisely \u00e0 la mode,\u201d he said, taking her arm again. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>They reached the bottom of the steps just as the first notes of a minuet sounded. \u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI realize it is a great faux pas to dance with one\u2019s husband, but you could always say that you got it out of the way.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and had to swallow because of the beauty of his eyes. She put her hand in his. \u201cYou do me too much honor.\u201d</p><p>He bowed before her as the music continued, and they moved smoothly, together, into the steps of the dance. It separated them; she felt it as a physical ache.</p> <p>It brought them back together; she was afraid that her pleasure showed too much in her eyes, and she refused to look at his face. \u201cLook!\u201d she cried, her voice witless, \u201cthere\u2019s Lady Piddleton, dancing with Saint Albans. He must be gathering material...he is always so cruel about her.\u201d</p><p>Elijah didn\u2019t reply. When she stole a look at him, he met her eyes and there was something there.</p><p>Surely he would speak to her. Kiss her again. Tell her...</p><p>The dance ended and he bowed. Saint Albans was at her right elbow, her friend Lord Corbin at her left. Lord Sosney walked up with Lord Killigrew, veritably shouting over the din, \u201cDuchess!\u201d</p><p>She caught Elijah\u2019s eye for a moment, but he turned away.</p><p>And she turned away.</p><p>A chess player never shows the moment when she realizes that she might lose a game. That the board has turned against her; the black pieces are clustered for attack. The very best chess players revel in the chance to save themselves.</p><p>Jemma reminded herself that she was the very best.</p> <p>She turned, laughing, to Lord Corbin, holding out her gloved hand to be kissed.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>The Dower House</p><p>February 29, 1784</p><p>The table gleamed softly with old silver. Honeydew had conveyed Mrs. Bullock\u2019s promise that the food would be exquisite. The butler referred darkly to some exigencies in the recent past, but Isidore did not inquire further. She found that a combination of blissful ignorance and high expectations was the best policy when it came to household problems.</p><p>She was dressed in an informal open gown of the finest wine-dark silk. The overskirts pulled back into great loops of nearly transparent fabric, tied by forest green knots of silk. It was an unusual and charming garment\u2014and perhaps most importantly, the bodice was cut extremely low.</p><p>There was quite a lot of Isidore in the chest area. She generally viewed this feature dispassionately, as an attribute that made certain corsets impossible, and others very uncomfortable. But she wasn\u2019t blind to how much men liked to be presented with abundance; if Cosway turned out to be someone enchanted by an expanse of flesh that would suit a worthy milk cow, Isidore was just the right one to enchant him.</p><p>In fact, she thought she had the virginal male fantasy in play. Breasts barely covered, with light, billowing skirts that appeared easy to remove, check. Unpowdered hair piled in loose curls, check. Just a touch of haunting perfume\u2014the sort that smelled clean and innocent rather than French and seductive\u2014check and mate.</p><p>Years of assessing male attraction were coming in quite useful. She thought it was quite likely that the duke, her husband, would experience her femininity like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>There was only one thing she didn\u2019t envision.</p><p>Two males appeared at the door. Make that two virgins. And when they both walked in her front door, Simeon bending his head slightly so as not to strike his forehead on the lintel, it was his little brother Godfrey who looked as if he\u2019d been struck by lightning. He stopped short and Simeon walked straight into him.</p><p>His mouth fell open. Strange noises came out, resembling frogs singing on a summer night.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Simeon,\u201d she said, moving forward. Didn\u2019t he have any sense? Couldn\u2019t he have guessed\u2014</p><p>Apparently not. Without even a flicker of regret in his eyes, Simeon was turning to his brother and introducing him. \u201cGodfrey, stand tall. You haven\u2019t met the duchess for years, but I\u2019m sure you remember her.\u201d</p><p>Godfrey bowed so deeply that she was afraid he wasn\u2019t coming back up again. He did, eventually, face red and hair on end.</p><p>She dropped into a curtsy that unfortunately put her breasts directly under his nose. He turned purple and cast a desperate look at his brother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure,\u201d Isidore said. She gave him a kindly smile, one that said calm down.</p><p>But the duke was moving into the room and suddenly it seemed to have shrunk to half its size. Isidore stopped herself from falling back. It was just that Simeon was so...male. Very male. Very large.</p><p>\u201cWhat a charming little room this is,\u201d he was saying, wandering about just as if she wasn\u2019t there, quivering like a jelly tart fresh out of the oven.</p><p>\u201cYes, charming,\u201d she said, watching his shoulders. They were broad and beautiful. If he didn\u2019t even kiss her good night, she decided, that meant he was incapable.</p><p>Alternatively, it could mean that he found her unattractive. No. That option was unacceptable.</p><p>He pulled out her chair and she sat down, mentally giving herself a shake. Obviously, her earlier plan wouldn\u2019t work. But she had once boasted of her ability to make any man flirt. Flirtation was halfway to the bedchamber.</p><p>This duke wouldn\u2019t see it coming, and Godfrey could take a lesson in adulthood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned forward, employing the smile that set half of Paris on fire during her twentieth year. That would be the male half, naturally.</p><p>\u201cDo tell me about yourself, Simeon?\u201d she cooed. \u201cI feel as if I hardly know you.\u201d In her experience, there was nothing a man liked more than to talk about himself.</p><p>Simeon put his heavy linen napkin in his lap. \u201cI am so uninteresting,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cI would prefer to hear about you. What have you done during the years while I was wandering around Abyssinia and the like?\u201d</p><p>He was obviously a worthy opponent. He looked genial, friendly, utterly calm\u2014and about as interested as he would be if she were a nursemaid.</p> <p>\u201cI traveled Europe with my aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely you remember from my letters?\u201d She let just a tiny edge sharpen her words.</p><p>The footman was pouring wine and Isidore noticed out of the corner of her eye that Godfrey was drinking with marked enthusiasm. Did boys of that age drink wine? She had the vague idea they were all tucked away in schools; certainly one never saw them at formal dinners.</p><p>\u201cI expect that many of your letters did not reach me. I remember getting a note from my solicitor once informing me of some action he\u2019d taken on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you concerned that I might discuss intimate matters in my letters?\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised. \u201cI never considered the possibility, given as we had never met. What intimacies could we exchange? Of course I instructed my solicitors to act on my behalf with regard to any missive from my family that appeared on their desk. One never knew how long it would take to get mail, let alone to return my instructions to London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever wonder where your wife was?\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment and then said: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was straightforward.</p><p>\u201cI wondered where you were,\u201d Godfrey said eagerly. \u201cI still remember your stay at our house, though it was brief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Isidore said. He was in that gangly stage, where his legs seemed impossibly long. He had the nose of a man and the eyes of a child. \u201cYou were only...how old? It was \u201973.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was almost three,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember playing peek-a-boo with me? I thought perhaps you had come to live with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d Isidore said, seeing no reason to lie to him. \u201cBut I caused your mother such discomfort that my aunt decided it was better that I travel with her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe servants told stories about your visit for years.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>He had a funny little grin, this brother of Cosway\u2019s. \u201cNo one before or after has called the duchess a termagant to her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you see,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cWhat a good thing it was that my aunt agreed to take me with her. The heart palpitations your mother escaped once I left can only be imagined. I trust,\u201d she added punctiliously, remembering that she was speaking to a child and should add guidance, \u201cthat you did not follow in my disreputable example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not so terrible,\u201d Godfrey said earnestly. \u201cTruly. She gets frightened about money, and that makes her sniffy.\u201d</p><p>Simeon reached out and knocked his brother on the shoulder in what Isidore assumed was a fraternal gesture.</p><p>Honeydew entered, followed by footmen carrying covered dishes. They were placed on the side table, just as she had instructed when she was envisioning a seductive meal. Honeydew waved the footmen outside and served the table himself as the three of them sat in utter silence. Godfrey had finished his wine, so Honeydew poured him another glass before retiring to the great house. Godfrey looked interestingly pink, and Isidore decided he was not used to imbibing.</p> <p>Simeon\u2019s eyes had a kind of ironic laziness to them that she found rather attractive, given that most men\u2019s eyes took on a feverish gleam if she paid them attention, especially with her bosom on display.</p><p>\u201cDid you and your aunt live anywhere in particular?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He really had ignored all her letters, or not received them.</p><p>\u201cWe lived in Venice a great deal of the time,\u201d she explained, \u201cas my family is from that city. But my aunt plays the violin, and so we traveled to various European capitals and performed in the courts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a musician? You were travelling around Europe with a performing musician?\u201d Now he looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cWe always had enough to eat, Simeon. In case you were picturing her playing for pennies by the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you inform my solicitor if you were in that sort of situation? It was utterly inappropriate for a duchess and I would never have allowed it!\u201d</p><p>Godfrey was halfway through his second glass of wine but paused with the glass halfway to his lips. \u201cDid you travel about in fairs?\u201d he asked eagerly. \u201cI love fairs! One came through the village and my mother allowed me to attend. There was a wonderful fiddler named Mr. McGurdy. Did you ever happen to meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t meet Mr. McGurdy,\u201d Isidore said, enjoying herself hugely. \u201cWhy Simeon, are you saying that you would have travelled back to England before completing your investigation of the Nile had you known I was in extremis?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sour look. \u201cI would have instructed my solicitors to find you an appropriate situation if you didn\u2019t wish to return to my mother\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nunnery, perhaps?\u201d Isidore asked mockingly.</p><p>For a moment his eyes lingered on her chest. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have had you.\u201d She felt a flare of triumph.</p><p>\u201cWas it hard sleeping by the side of the road?\u201d Godfrey asked. He had finished his second glass and was sawing away at a piece of chicken in a manner that suggested his coordination was impaired.</p><p>\u201cI never slept by the side of the road,\u201d Isidore said, adding primly, \u201cthank goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand this family!\u201d Simeon said, putting down his cutlery. \u201cIsidore, you had access to whatever funds you wished. Not only did your parents leave you a considerable inheritance, but you could have drawn on my funds at any point. Why were you travelling with fairs? Why is everyone\u2019s attitude toward money so peculiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother doesn\u2019t know you have all that money,\u201d Godfrey said, turning to his brother owlishly. \u201cShe thinks we don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows,\u201d Simeon said grimly. \u201cShe sees the books. She simply can\u2019t bring herself to disperse any of it.\u201d</p><p>Godfrey frowned. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isidore shot her husband a look. His little brother had the bewildered look of a child who\u2019s been lied to. \u201cHer Grace showed her respect for her husband by continuing to operate the estate precisely as he had done, I have no doubt,\u201d she said.</p><p>Godfrey brightened. \u201cYes, of course. Father never allowed any untoward expenditures. He considered it a point of honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s little honor in not paying tradesmen for their honest work,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>Godfrey looked stricken again. Isidore took another try. \u201cWhen I visited this house many years ago, I remember being rather surprised by your father\u2019s frugal attitude. But in a frank discussion with your mother, she informed me that he considered himself merely the guardian of the duchy and hoped to pass on his estates intact, without wasting his substance as so many noblemen do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Godfrey reached for the sideboard and the bottle of wine, but Isidore gave him a minatory look and his arm dropped. He picked up his fork, but a moment later Simeon poured wine into all three of their glasses.</p><p>\u201cI would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me how you and your aunt were reduced to busking at fairs, given your birth, not to mention our marriage,\u201d Simeon said, his voice rather chilly. Apparently, it was her fault that at twelve years old she had failed to voluntarily enter a nunnery while waiting for his return.</p><p>\u201cSome say my aunt is one of the greatest violinists ever born,\u201d Isidore said. Godfrey had finished his chicken and looked a little dazed.</p><p>\u201cShe must have been better than Mr. McGurdy, then,\u201d Godfrey mumbled. \u201cThough he played a tambourine with his right foot at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy aunt played only the violin.\u201d</p><p>Simeon put down his fork again. \u201cI have felt as if I were living in two worlds for the past week or so, and this only confirms it. Are you saying that your aunt was in great demand, and you did not travel fairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we did not,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cShe had a long-standing arrangement to join the French court for the Easter season; Queen Marie Antoinette is quite fond of music, you know. My aunt would play solos for her in gardens of Versailles. Sometimes my aunt would steal into the great maze, and then begin to play. The ladies would wander into the labyrinth until they were able to find her by following the sound of her music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see that,\u201d Godfrey said.</p><p>\u201cI should like to play a musical instrument,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cOnce I was in an Indian bazaar and heard an old gentleman play a sort of violin-like instrument so beautifully that I began to weep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo weep?\u201d Godfrey said, his voice breaking in a high little squeal. \u201cYou cried, where anyone could see you?\u201d</p><p>Simeon smiled at him. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in a man crying.\u201d</p><p>Nor in being a virgin either, Isidore thought sourly.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s shameful,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cAnd do you know, Brother, I think it\u2019s a bit shameful that you\u2019re sitting down to supper without a cravat. Or a waistcoat. Her Grace\u2014\u201d he stumbled a little and slurred it together\u2014\u201cHer Grace is a duchess, you know. You\u2019re not paying respect to her. Or you\u2019re not respectful of her.\u201d He looked a little confused, but stubborn.</p><p>Simeon looked over at Isidore in an inquiring kind of way. \u201cDo you agree with my brother that the size or existence of a cravat determines the respect due a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a start,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cAfter that would have to come respect for a woman\u2019s opinions, of course.\u201d</p> <p>She had to admit: he was intelligent. He knew instantly what she was talking about. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I won\u2019t respect my wife\u2019s opinions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is your wife,\u201d Godfrey intervened.</p><p>\u201cBut that when it comes to an emergency, one person has to assume responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn emergency,\u201d Isidore said, ladling a generous dollop of scorn into her voice. \u201cWhat sort of emergency are you thinking of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll sorts.\u201d He raised his glass, his eyes dark and somber over the rim. \u201cI have been in enough difficult spots, Isidore, to know that dangers flock from every direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor example?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ever attacked by a lion?\u201d Godfrey asked. He was definitely slurring his words. He looked terribly sleepy and slightly nauseated.</p><p>\u201cNot lately,\u201d Simeon said.</p> <p>\u201cGodfrey, would you like to retire to my armchair for a moment?\u201d Isidore asked.</p><p>He just stared at her, until Simeon said, \u201cGodfrey.\u201d His voice was quiet, but the authority inherent there was absolute.</p><p>Godfrey stumbled to the chair and sat down, his eyes closing immediately.</p><p>\u201cIs that your example?\u201d Isidore asked.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation also could have been avoided had you paid attention. The third glass of wine was too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a matter of male pride. I believe this is probably Godfrey\u2019s first dinner in which he was offered sufficient wine to make himself ill. It is far better that he overindulge tonight and learn from it, than that he do so on a more public occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree with you that there must be a general in every marriage,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cThe commonly accepted idea of marriage,\u201d Simeon said, \u201cis that the man has to be that leader. I have seen a few successful marriages in which the reverse was true. One of the two people must be accepted as such.\u201d</p><p>Across the room, Godfrey was making a heavy breathing sound. She would rather assay her first seduction without a drunken thirteen-year-old in the corner.</p><p>But Simeon really meant it when he said that they would wait until the night of their wedding. He truly would walk away from her. She had to try something.</p><p>She leaned toward him so that the lush weight of her breasts hung forward. \u201cWould you tell the footman outside the door that Godfrey has fallen asleep?\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps Honeydew should escort him to his bed chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd clear away these dishes,\u201d Simeon said. He sounded as if she were a remote acquaintance, who had offered him a boiled sweet. She\u2019d heard that voice before. He had a way of growing even more calm, more distant. She\u2019d seen it before...</p><p>It meant he felt threatened.</p><p>Good.</p><p>She leaned back, thinking that her breasts had done their job. \u201cPlease,\u201d she added.</p><p>He rose, opened the door to the outside and had a brief word with the footman. A moment later Godfrey walked unsteadily from the room, looking rather greenish.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to cast up his accounts in the bushes,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>The little house drew around them again, sheltering, sweet, romantic. Then the door opened and Honeydew swept in with dishes of pear stewed in port. He was gone in a moment, leaving them with glasses of sparkling wine.</p><p>Isidore had been flirting for years. She let her eyelids droop and threw Simeon a sleepy glance from under her lashes.</p><p>He was busy cutting up his pear and didn\u2019t notice. She waited a moment but he seemed as concentrated on the pear as if he were boning a pheasant. Fine. She turned to her own pear, trying desperately to think of a seductive topic. Nothing came to mind, so she found herself saying the least romantic thing possible: \u201cWhen do you think that the water closets will be repaired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoneydew and I investigated the pipes today,\u201d Simeon said, looking up. \u201cThey are completely rotted. If you can believe it, the original piping was done in wood. Naturally the water rotted them through within the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father must have been one of the first to install a water closet at all,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThat was rather progressive of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears from the correspondence I found that he was offered the water closets for a pittance,\u201d Simeon said bluntly. \u201cHe was supposed to allow the fabricators to use his name and express his approval. I think they probably discarded this idea when he refused to pay that pittance, saying that the pipes didn\u2019t work sufficiently. After that, the pipes rotted and there was no one to fix them.\u201d</p><p>Isidore finished her bite. \u201cIt must be quite difficult to be in a position to judge one\u2019s parents as an adult,\u201d she offered. \u201cSince mine died when I was very young, I knew them only as parents, never as people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWere they good to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. They were Italian, you know, so they had a different idea of family life than do many English parents. There were nursemaids, of course, but both of my parents visited the nursery every day. I spent a great deal of time with my mother, in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when they died, you were sent here, to my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil my aunt took me away again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably even if your aunt had been busking at the side of the road, it would have been the right thing to do,\u201d he said, putting down his fork and knife.</p><p>\u201cThe wife of a future duke playing for pennies along with Mr. McGurdy?\u201d she said, laughing a bit.</p><p>\u201cMy mother has a difficult character,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cYour aunt was right. I had no right to criticize her earlier. It is no one\u2019s business how you spent your time with your aunt, and certainly not mine, given my lengthy absence.\u201d</p><p>Isidore was conscious of a warm glow under her breastbone. It wasn\u2019t a seductive glow, though, and some time later her so-called husband began making his way out of the cottage without taking even the smallest liberty. In fact, without a single flirtatious comment.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she said, when he had a hand on the door.</p> <p>He turned.</p><p>She walked toward him, not with her signature sleepy look, nor with a little smile of interest, none of the tricks she had used to reduce men to their knees in the past. Instead she just walked to him and looked up, assessing the strong line of his jaw, the slightly wild cut of his hair, the breadth of his shoulders. He looked like a man, an adult. A grown man.</p><p>It gave her a little pulse of anxiety, as if she\u2019d been playing with boys up until now. There was something different about the intensity and the fire inside Simeon.</p><p>\u201cWill you kiss me good-night, please?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s customary for married couples.\u201d</p> <p>She thought he would say they weren\u2019t married, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he just moved forward and lowered his head, kissed her.</p><p>It was over in a second. She had a fleeting sensation of firm lips, a tiny scent of something...him...male, slightly spicy. And he moved back.</p><p>She blinked at him, thinking that kissing wasn\u2019t what she expected; it wasn\u2019t as good.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d His voice was quiet, but the night was quiet too.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your first kiss, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was,\u201d she said. \u201cThough\u2014\u201d She caught the words back. Why had she waited, evaded so many lips, never allowed herself to be kissed? It was nothing. Nothing special.</p><p>But then he moved closer again. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said hastily, sensing that he meant to kiss her again.</p> <p>This time his arms came around her slowly, and she had time to see the planes of his face, the way he looked straight into her eyes, the way his body loomed over hers...This time when his lips touched hers, they didn\u2019t slide away immediately.</p><p>She had seen kissing. She knew that it was done with open mouths, that it made women cling to their lovers, as if their knees were failing them.</p><p>She knew that, all that, and yet\u2014</p><p>He kissed her hard this time, not a fleeting caress, but a command. His arms slipped past her, braced against the wall, and his body came against hers. She gasped at the strength of it, the heat, and then their mouths were open together. It was like an open flame that rushed through Isidore\u2019s body\u2014the taste of him, the feeling of it, the kiss, his body.</p><p>She shivered, made an inarticulate murmur, a noise, a cry. Their tongues met and sang together. Her mind reeled and she wound her arms around his neck. Gone were all her thoughts of seduction, of fragile English brides.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered into his mouth, her body against his. Her breasts didn\u2019t feel like large objects meant to attract men now. They were on fire, tingling from where they rubbed against his coat. He pulled her tighter, and another little moan came from her throat. He kissed her hard, pushing her against the wall. She wanted to open her eyes, but desire swamped her, betrayed her voice and her logical mind and her plans. She could only cling to him and kiss him back, her tongue touching his and retreating.</p><p>Growing bolder, responding to the muffled groan that seemed to come from his chest, not from his mouth.</p><p>Finally he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWas that your first kiss?\u201d she asked, when she could speak again.</p><p>He stood for a moment, the firelight cascading off the gleam of his hair. Half his face was in shadow.</p><p>Finally, he said quietly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she had wanted to hear. Of course he was experienced at kissing. How could he\u2014how could they have\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt was my second,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first was a moment or two ago, but I\u2019m not sure they belong in the same category.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone, the door closing on a swirl of evening air.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 1, 1784</p><p>The next morning Isidore rose to find a light rain falling. She had a bath, sat by the fire, and read Tales of the Nile while Lucille fussed with her clothing.</p><p>But it was no good. She didn\u2019t want to sit in her cottage while Simeon was off in the main house by himself. She didn\u2019t want to wait for him, like a docile little mouse waiting for the cat to pay a call, to find time to discuss the end of their marriage. Besides, their marriage wasn\u2019t over, even if he didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>A few seconds later she was shaking the rain from her plumed hat, and handing it to Honeydew. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he was saying. \u201cMay I serve you some tea?\u201d</p><p>Isidore shook her head. She was looking around the high entrance hall. It wasn\u2019t in terrible shape, though the marble was cracked, and the paneling on one door looked scuffed. \u201cWhat happened to this?\u201d she said, walking over to inspect it before she even off took her pelisse.</p><p>\u201cThe late duke\u2019s dog was a terrible scratcher,\u201d Honeydew said. She was getting to know him now, and that quiet tone implied severe disapproval.</p><p>\u201cWe need some foolscap,\u201d she told him, giving her dripping pelisse to a footman. \u201cAnd a quill. I shall make lists of what needs to be done, and I might as well start with the entry.\u201d</p><p>She began prowling around the walls, looking at the pictures, the paneling, and the moldings.</p><p>\u201cIf Your Grace will allow me to act as your secretary,\u201d Honeydew said in a tone mingled with astonishment and gratitude.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d she said. She had discovered a small painting next to the door leading to the drawing room. It was hanging askew and its frame was broken. But it was a lovely treatment of a dog with a pigeon. \u201cIs this the dog in question?\u201d</p><p>Honeydew turned from sending one of the footmen running for paper. \u201cExactly so, Your Grace. The former duke had his dog painted in a variety of poses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cWas the artist ever paid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Honeydew said, rather surprisingly.</p><p>Isidore nodded. \u201cIs the duke in his study?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is working. I\u2019m afraid that the maids discovered a great nest of papers in one of the cupboards in the master bedchamber,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cIt appears they include some bills in arrears.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the duke\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer Grace rarely makes an appearance before late morning,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cShe spends the morning in prayer.\u201d</p><p>Isidore tried to imagine Simeon\u2019s mother praying, failed, and walked into the largest sitting room.</p><p>\u201cThe Yellow Salon,\u201d Honeydew named it. In truth, the previously buttery upholstery had faded to a grayish-cream. But the room\u2019s proportions were beautiful. At one point, there had been an exquisite band of blue and gold plaster around the cornice at the top of the walls.</p> <p>\u201cNew drapes, obviously,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThis sofa looks quite good and merely needs reupholstering. I very much doubt that all this work could be done locally in a timely fashion; shall we ship the lot off to London? I seem to remember that the Duchess of Beaumont made use of Mr. George Seddon\u2019s workshop.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew beamed. \u201cI agree, Your Grace.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cIf I might suggest that we send payment along with the furniture. I\u2019m afraid that the duke has a reputation to overcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pay double,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI would like the furniture reupholstered as soon as possible.\u201d In fact, the more she thought about last night and that kiss...\u201cI believe I would like this house to be shining and habitable in ten days, Honeydew. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>The smile dropped from his face and he looked a bit winded. \u201cThat is hard to imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find that ready money does wonders. Do we have a cart for all this furniture?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cWe do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isidore smiled at him. \u201cI have absolute faith in you.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew pulled himself up and nodded. \u201cI shall do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put those yellow sofas and that large piece there on the list. Goodness, is that a harp?\u201d</p><p>Honeydew nodded.</p><p>\u201cMissing all its strings,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cWe\u2019d better make two lists. One set of furniture should go straight to London, with instructions that it be either repaired or reupholstered. The remainder can retire to the attics, the harp among them. We need a plaster-worker as well; the bones of the room are lovely but the walls need redoing. The criss-cross gold and blue around the top merely needs freshening.\u201d</p> <p>Honeydew scribbled at his list. \u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness this mirror isn\u2019t broken,\u201d she said, stopping before an eleven-foot-high mirror set into the paneling. \u201cWhose portrait is set at the top there, in the medallion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Grace,\u201d Honeydew said, \u201cas a young boy. The chandelier,\u201d he added, \u201cis only missing one strand of glass pearls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a note of it,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI am monstrously fond of the new embroidered chairs, Honeydew, and they would look lovely in this room...perhaps with cherry blossoms on a pale yellow background?\u201d</p><p>The door behind them opened suddenly and Isidore turned about. In the doorway stood the dowager duchess. She looked pinched and faded, and yet the same pugnacious light that Isidore remembered shone in her eyes.</p><p>Isidore immediately dropped into a curtsy that nearly had her sitting on the floor. She didn\u2019t raise her head from its respectful position for a good moment before murmuring, eyes still lowered, \u201cYour Grace, what an honor. I had not thought to disturb you at such an early hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoneydew,\u201d the duchess said, \u201cI\u2019m sure that you have much to do.\u201d</p><p>Isidore turned to Honeydew. \u201cIf you could arrange for the cart as we discussed, I shall rejoin you shortly.\u201d The dowager seated herself on one of the sofas, so Isidore followed.</p> <p>Her mother-in-law didn\u2019t bother with preliminaries. \u201cWe never could abide each other,\u201d she said grimly, \u201cbut need comes to want, and we have to work around that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am truly happy to see you in such good health, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>The older woman waved her hand irritably in the air. \u201cMy generation doesn\u2019t care so much for that sort of flummery. You don\u2019t give a damn about my health, but I imagine that you\u2019re as interested in my son\u2019s as I am. Have you spent some time with him?\u201d She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have. We dined last night with Godfrey.\u201d</p><p>The duchess\u2019s face softened. \u201cGodfrey is a good lad. My elder, on the other hand\u2014\u201d she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not of a generation to beat about the bush, so I\u2019ll tell you, he\u2019s unhinged. I thought at first that I might be able to keep it from you, long enough to head off an annulment, but I realized that talk of brain fever is impossible between a man and a wife. I would have known if my husband grew unhinged, and I expect you know as well.\u201d</p><p>Isidore cleared her throat. \u201cHe is certainly original in his thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mad. Cork-brained. He\u2019ll cause you many a humiliation if you stay in the marriage.\u201d</p><p>It was no more than Isidore herself had initially thought.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Simeon\u2019s mother continued, \u201che\u2019s a duke. That\u2019s a fact and no one can take that away from him, whether he looks like a common thief or not.\u201d She threw Isidore an icy look. \u201cYou\u2019re on the old side to catch another husband, may I point out? You\u2019ll never find one at the level of a duke. Your being Italian and all, you\u2019d be lucky to catch a baron.\u201d</p><p>Isidore didn\u2019t bother to answer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a duke and that makes you a duchess,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt isn\u2019t trivial to be a duchess. You\u2019ll be among the highest in the land. People may talk behind your back about your husband\u2019s proclivities, but they won\u2019t do so to your face. And who gives a fart what they say behind your back?\u201d</p><p>Isidore managed to close her mouth with an effort.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so mealy-mouthed!\u201d the duchess snapped at her. \u201cI\u2019ve never lost a moment\u2019s sleep thinking about what little people say behind my back. I advise you to do the same. You\u2019re not born to be a duchess, but we chose you carefully enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chose me due to the dowry my father offered,\u201d Isidore put in. She was starting to feel a rising wave of fury. How could a mother speak about her son in such withering terms? True, Simeon was unusual, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe promised you were a biddable girl,\u201d her mother-in-law said crushingly.</p><p>\u201cHe was mistaken,\u201d Isidore said, showing her teeth in an approximation of a smile.</p><p>\u201cI realized that the moment I saw you,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cOnly twelve years old, and as saucy as a lower housemaid. I thought then that it would fall apart before the wedding and likely it would have but for my son\u2019s refusal to return to England. Of course he was suffering from brain fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have brain fever,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cPut your gloves back on!\u201d the duchess barked. \u201cNo duchess would show her ungloved hands in public. I can see that making you into proper duchess material is going to be as hard as bundling my son into acceptable shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son is more than acceptable,\u201d Isidore said, placing her gloves on the table before her with some precision.</p><p>It was a signal of war. The duchess, who had up till now resembled an elderly bulldog, suddenly straightened and took on the air of a mastiff. \u201cI foresee the long lineage of the Cosways dragged into the dirt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isidore smiled kindly at her. \u201cI will do my very best to get the dirt out of this room, not to mention this house, which smells worse than most slums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA duchess does not lower herself to such inconsequential matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\u2014and I use the word advisedly\u2014your house looks like the tumble-down shack owned by an impoverished peasant. The house stinks like a privy, the furniture is falling apart, and the servants haven\u2019t been paid. I may not have been raised by a duke, but my father would have been ashamed to treat his dependents as you have routinely treated your staff.\u201d</p><p>She paused, but the duchess didn\u2019t seem ready to take up her side of the argument yet, so Isidore continued. \u201cMy father would also have been ashamed to allow the house of his forefathers to fall into such disrepair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is not in disrepair,\u201d the duchess said, her voice a growl. \u201cThere might be a piece of rackety furniture here and there that could use repair, but problems with the\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Isidore was just beginning. \u201cBroken windows,\u201d she said. \u201cWarped wood that will need to be replaced. The chimney in the west wing seems to have toppled in on itself, from what I could see. My father, Your Grace, would call it a disgrace!\u201d</p><p>Silence followed.</p><p>Her mother-in-law was red in the face and seemed to have blown up slightly, as a frog does before croaking. Isidore reached out and picked up her gloves. \u201cYou might be more comfortable retiring to your chambers,\u201d she said, her voice even. \u201cAll the furniture in the downstairs rooms will be removed in the next few hours and sent to London for refurbishing or replacement.\u201d</p><p>That goaded the duchess into speech. \u201cBy whose authority do you dare that action!\u201d she shouted.</p> <p>Isidore stood. \u201cBy my own.\u201d She pulled on her gloves, snapping them onto each finger. \u201cThat of the Duchess of Cosway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bankrupt the estate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. The Cosway estate is one of the richest in the kingdom, and even if it were not so, I inherited my father\u2019s entire estate. I, Your Grace, am likely the richest woman in this kingdom, barring their royal highnesses. Not to mention the fact that your son brought back a fortune in tiger rubies from Africa. If we wish to gild this entire house so that they can see the glow from London, we can afford to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the way of the world! The young waste the substance that the elderly worked so hard to build up, on fripperies, trivialities, gilded walls...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case,\u201d Isidore said briskly, \u201cthe young make a necessary outlay of funds to repair the neglect and damage by the uncaring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you call me uncaring!\u201d the duchess said, leaping to her feet with a great creaking of corsets. \u201cI may not have thought that the broken window was terribly important, and I certainly never prided myself on being one of the richest women in the kingdom, the way you do, but I cared for this estate. I love it. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She turned, very precisely, and walked from the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh...hell,\u201d Isidore said. Obviously she had bungled that. \u201cIt\u2019s my temper,\u201d she said out loud, staring down at her gloves.</p><p>The door opened again to Honeydew, ushering in a bevy of strong-looking men. \u201cIf Your Grace would help us select furniture for the cart, that would be most kind.\u201d</p><p>By the end of the morning, the downstairs had been emptied. Even the dining room table was gone. \u201cIt\u2019s scarred,\u201d Isidore told Honeydew. \u201cI love that black oak, but it needs work. And frankly, I would prefer a table with more graceful lines. I have a mind to order a complete dining room set by Georges Jacob. He created a beautiful set for Queen Marie Antoinette in her Petit Trianon.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew gulped. \u201cFrom France, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Isidore said. She was ticking off a mental list on her fingers. \u201cThe furniture is dispatched to Mr. Seddon\u2019s workshop. This afternoon I\u2019ll send to Signora Angelico about an appropriate person to sew new curtains, and another to Antoine-Joseph Peyre about the broken statuary in the ballroom.\u201d She paused because Honeydew looked confused. \u201cMonsieur Peyre did some work on my palazzo in Venice, and it so happens that he\u2019s in London. I\u2019m sure that he will help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPalazzo?\u201d Honeydew enquired.</p><p>Isidore smiled at him. \u201cIf only it were closer, I would have furniture shipped from there. Monsieur Peyre worked all my walls in Venice with delicious flowers, in the style that I most prefer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy next week?\u201d Honeydew said faintly.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t finish by then, of course.\u201d</p><p>She turned about as she heard the study door open: the study was the only room on the first floor that they had not yet stripped of its furnishings. Simeon walked out. His hair was standing on end and there were dark circles under his eyes. \u201cHoneydew,\u201d he said, apparently not even seeing her, \u201chave you ever heard of the Brothers Verbeckt?\u201d</p><p>Honeydew frowned.</p><p>\u201cThey are asking for a large sum and though the reference is rather obscure, they seem to be talking of hunting. I thought perhaps the author was German.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Verby, down in the village,\u201d Honeydew said, his face clearing. \u201cNow that\u2019s a pack of nonsense! For hunting, does he say? Verby used to go along with your father as a gun-cleaner now and then, and only when the duke had no one better to take with him. Brothers Verbeckt indeed!\u201d</p><p>Simeon turned to Isidore and bowed. \u201cForgive me, duchess; I didn\u2019t see you were there.\u201d</p><p>That was a lie. Isidore knew the moment his door opened. She could feel his presence even behind the door, as she made her lists. And the moment they were standing together in the same room, desire strung between them like an invisible thread.</p><p>But she smiled at him. He wanted to preserve the illusion of his life without desire, without fear. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drifted over her and even though she was rather dusty and tired, suddenly, under his gaze, she felt all curves and female beauty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard mysterious thumps,\u201d he said, recovering first. \u201cWhat on earth has been happening, Honeydew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer Grace has sent all the furniture to London,\u201d Honeydew said. He was no fool, and was backing toward the hallway. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, Your Graces, I must see to luncheon.\u201d He stopped. \u201cThe table!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll eat in the Dower House,\u201d Isidore said soothingly. \u201cHer Grace will undoubtedly wish a light luncheon in her chambers, just as she did last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the table?\u201d Simeon asked, once Honeydew disappeared. \u201cDid a leg fall off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI\u2019ve sent everything to London, just as Honeydew said. Wouldn\u2019t you like to see?\u201d</p><p>They walked into the dining room. Without furniture, and with the moldering curtains torn down, it was a wide, echoing room. Honeydew had sent maids in the moment the furniture was gone, and even the walls glistened.</p><p>\u201cThe house should be ready to receive guests in a few weeks at most,\u201d Isidore said, since Simeon seemed to be silenced by the total lack of furniture.</p><p>\u201cYou got rid of all the furniture?\u201d</p><p>There was a kind of controlled anger in his voice that made Isidore\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cI didn\u2019t get rid of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I got rid of some it. But everything that could be refurbished has been sent to London.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simeon walked to the door leading to the great sitting room and stopped. Isidore knew exactly what he was looking at: the empty, stained floor where there had been two threadbare Aubussons and clusters of furniture in various states of disrepair.</p><p>\u201cYou sent away all my furniture,\u201d Simeon stated. He ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>Isidore stared at his back. His shoulders seemed very tense. \u201cIt is presumably my furniture as well,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIf we remain married,\u201d he said. Then he whirled about. \u201cYou have no right to send away every stick of furniture in this house. People live here. I live here. You could have done me the nominal courtesy of asking my permission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour permission?\u201d Isidore echoed. \u201cYour permission for what? Would you have said that you wished to keep the rug that your father\u2019s incontinent dog chose as his private privy, or the one with a rip down the middle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mock me?\u201d</p><p>Surely there were women who would have cowered at this point. But Isidore had never cowered at anyone, including Simeon\u2019s mother, and she wasn\u2019t going to start now. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cMock where mockery is due, I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d he said violently, and broke off.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>And then, when he didn\u2019t answer: \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to characterize my heinous crime? That of sending the furniture out to be repaired so that this house is livable, if not hospitable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is my mother to eat dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Isidore opened her mouth\u2014and paused. \u201cIn the Dower House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll four of us, happily crowded in the corner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoneydew will find a larger table,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cCould you please consult with me before you embark on projects such as emptying out the house?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>He had himself under control again. Isidore almost sighed. There was something magnificent about Simeon in a rage. Not that she wished to court that condition, she told herself. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cInstantly. Every time. I\u2019ll ask you so many questions that you\u2019ll grow tired of the very sound of my voice.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a sardonic look, but at least his mouth relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth could have happened to this wall?\u201d he asked, wandering over to examine a gap in the paneling.</p><p>\u201cYour father kicked it,\u201d she said, answering his query.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father apparently kicked the paneling after a game of cards. The strength of his leg was such that he remained stuck with one foot in the wall and the other on the floor, until the footmen could extract him.\u201d</p><p>Simeon turned around and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIsidore, have I lost my mind? Is this normal behavior for an English family?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that. \u201cHow would I know? I\u2019m Italian, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI spent the entire morning going through a most unpleasant stack of letters. They are all dated from six to eight years ago, and not only did each of them ask for money, but each had been denied by my father.\u201d</p><p>He was a beautiful man: spare, large, wild-looking. Even his eyes were beautiful, filled with disappointment though they were.</p><p>He ran his hand through his hair again. \u201cAm I truly mad, Isidore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said promptly. \u201cI should tell you that I had an argument with your mother this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my mother\u2019s undoubted vehemence.\u201d He leaned against the wall next to her.</p><p>\u201cI lost my temper,\u201d Isidore said, meeting his eyes. \u201cI spoke in a most inappropriate manner. And I said things that I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat pretty much sums up my experience of England,\u201d he said, looking down at her.</p><p>Isidore suddenly felt as if her knees were weak. He was going to kiss her\u2014he was\u2014he did. His lips felt more familiar now. He licked her lips and she almost giggled, but then she put an arm around his neck and drew him close.</p><p>Thoughts fled as their bodies met. He was all hard muscle, and she melting softness. They both smelled of dust. But under the dust and faint smell of ink, she could smell the spicy cleanness that was Simeon. It made her tremble. It made her put both arms around his neck and hold on.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 1, 1784</p><p>That afternoon</p><p>Simeon was conscious of savage disappointment: in his father, every time he leafed through sheaves of rejected bills, in himself. He had returned from the Dower House the night before and retreated to the study until numbers swam before his eyes.</p><p>Yet his father wasn\u2019t the heart of his problem. She was. He could fix the house, and pay the bills. He couldn\u2019t fix what happened to him when he was around Isidore. He felt like a hunting animal seeing her, as if even the hairs on the back of his neck knew where she was in the room.</p><p>Finally, at this late date, he understood all the poetry of desire and lust that he had ignored before. Valamksepa used to recite the poetry of Rumi, a poet from 500 years ago; Simeon had exulted because he was free from the embarrassments described by the poet. And yet, Rumi was right: reason was powerless in the face of the lust he felt for Isidore. All he wanted to do was retreat to a bedchamber and\u2014and rut.</p><p>Like an animal.</p><p>Not like a principled, thoughtful human being, like the kind of man he had always believed himself to be.</p><p>Except he was starting to worry about that too.</p><p>Finally he put down his quill and realized exactly what he feared: by marrying Isidore, he would be giving up himself. He would be giving in to violent tempests of emotion. His house would be shaken by screaming fights between his mother and his wife. He would be unable to withstand her, because he lusted after her to the point of being unable to think.</p><p>He felt ill\u2014the kind of sick airy rush in his head that he used to feel when he and his men were being stalked by a tiger.</p><p>Danger...</p><p>His wife was equally worried. Isidore wanted to be a duchess. She had thought so before her husband appeared, and she thought so even more so now that Simeon turned out to be so knee-weakeningly appealing.</p><p>And yet life with him was going to be humiliating.</p><p>She could survive any amount of public embarrassment. He could go about London without a wig, and run through Hyde Park in a nappy. The problem was that he didn\u2019t really like her very much.</p><p>She could see it in the way he fought his attraction to her, in the veiled coolness of his eyes when she described the changes she planned for the house. Simply in the way he looked at her.</p><p>A husband who didn\u2019t like her. It wasn\u2019t what she expected, though she couldn\u2019t say that she ever gave it a thought. Women liked her. Men desired her. She admired some and tolerated most.</p><p>Isidore sat down on one of the few chairs left in the house. She probably merited the scorn she saw in Simeon\u2019s eyes. After all, she wasn\u2019t what he wanted.</p><p>But what could she do? How do you make a man like you? Like? What did husbands like about their wives? A sense of humor, a partnership\u2014</p><p>Partnership. She could help him more.</p><p>She leaped to her feet. He kept asking the butler questions about various bills. If there was one thing Isidore was good at, it was making inquiries.</p><p>\u201cHoneydew, I should like to visit the village,\u201d she said a few minutes later. \u201cIf you would have a bath drawn for me, I shall change my clothing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen would you like the carriage, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked down at her dusty skirts. \u201cIt will take me at least two hours to make myself presentable.\u201d</p><p>It actually took three, but when she climbed into the carriage, she felt fairly certain that she was perfectly attired: duchesslike, yet not too grand. She brought along Lucille and a footman carrying a thick purse. If there was one thing she was not going to do, it was order on credit.</p><p>The village consisted of six or seven establishments: baker, butcher, smithy, pub and a shop that seemed to sell everything from cloth to ceramic pitchers. Plus a church. She hesitated for a moment, thinking that the vicar was undoubtedly important, but what did she have to say to a vicar?</p> <p>Two seconds later she was inside the general shop. It was rather dark because the ceiling was hung with a maze of objects. A table was jumbled with fabric, ribbons, buttons, cooking implements, a butter churn.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Lucille whispered, \u201cwhat on earth are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>Just then a lean-faced man, with such pronounced hollows in his cheeks that they looked like small caves, came forward. He bowed deeply.</p><p>Isidore pulled off her gloves.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I would like to buy something.\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cA ribbon?\u201d</p><p>There was something just faintly, faintly insolent in his tone. As if a duchess would only want a pretty ribbon, like a small child, or perhaps as if a duchess could only afford a ribbon.</p><p>\u201cA bolt of woolen cloth,\u201d Isidore said, picking the largest and most useful thing she saw. She needed to buy something large, something that would give the shopkeeper confidence that the Duchy of Cosway was solvent.</p><p>\u201cA bolt of cloth,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>So he did know who she was. There was an odd sucking sound and the man\u2019s cheeks suddenly popped inward. Then he turned around, plucked up a bolt of russet wool and thumped it down before her. \u201cWill this do? It\u2019s eight shillings a yard. How many yards would you like? I accept only ready money in this shop.\u201d</p> <p>Not enough. Not nearly enough. \u201cI\u2019d like more,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cMore cloth?\u201d He sucked his cheeks in again, with an audible pop. \u201cI have blues, grays, greens, and more russet. How many yards would Your Grace need this morning?\u201d</p><p>He was mocking her. Isidore\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cA great deal,\u201d she said, giving him a blindingly cheerful smile. \u201cProbably every yard you have. I do like cloth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWool,\u201d he said, \u201cis a universal taste.\u201d He turned around and bawled, \u201cThe bolts!\u201d</p><p>Isidore took the purse from her footman. \u201cHow many houses are there in the village?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have five yards per household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few huts down by the river.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shall buy for twenty-seven households, then, which would be 135 yards, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d She opened her purse.</p><p>\u201cOver one thousand shillings,\u201d the storekeeper said, his voice a bit strangled.</p><p>\u201cOne thousand and eighty,\u201d Isidore said cheerfully. \u201cOr fifty-four pounds.\u201d She counted them out, then deliberately put a guinea on the counter. \u201cFor delivery to each house in the village.\u201d The shopkeeper almost smiled.</p><p>She put down another guinea, and his eyes widened. Another. They formed a small golden pile. Deliberately, she built it into an unsteady mountain.</p><p>There was an audible pop. No one made a sound; even the footman seemed to be holding his breath.</p><p>\u201cThere are twenty-seven houses,\u201d she said. \u201cI shall add an extra guinea, so that you might provide some thread and needles to go with the fabrics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the man said, his voice half strangled. \u201cThough there\u2019s no need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the Duchess of Cosway. I always pay for the value of the merchandise I buy, and naturally, for its delivery as well. There is nothing more valuable than your time, Mr....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Mopser, Your Grace, Harry Mopser.\u201d</p><p>Isidore held out her hand. \u201cMr. Mopser, it has been our pleasure to frequent your establishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBa, ba\u2014\u201d he said, but finally managed to say, \u201cYer Grace.\u201d</p><p>She swept from the store, hiding a smile. In the bakery, she ordered twenty-seven meat pies. In the church, having come up with something to say to the vicar after all, she promised a new steeple.</p><p>By the time she reached the smithy, Isidore felt like an ambassadress to a foreign country. The vicar had welcomed the idea of giving each household in the village a measure of wool with great enthusiasm; the baker had confided that she sent up a few pound cakes to Revels House weekly, in memory of the late duke\u2019s mother; Isidore promptly paid for five-years\u2019 worth of pound cakes.</p><p>The smithy had a low door and a pungent odor, like sulphur. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to buy here,\u201d Lucille protested.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll just greet the smith,\u201d Isidore said cheerfully.</p><p>Once inside the smithy, all she could see was a low ceiling, blackened beams, and the dim glow of the fire. Before she could say anything, her footman called, \u201cThe Duchess of Cosway.\u201d</p><p>There was a clatter and a man rose from the hearth. He didn\u2019t bow, or even smile. He just put his hands on his hips and stared at her, and it wasn\u2019t a nice look. He had a crooked nose and his eyes looked like the sunken coals of his own fire. \u201cThe new duchess, I suppose,\u201d he stated.</p><p>Isidore blinked.</p><p>\u201cA newly minted duchess,\u201d he drawled. \u201cFlanked by a footman, the better to protect you in case a starving villager manages to sling mud in your direction.\u201d</p><p>He had the air of someone of incredible strength and yet he was surprisingly gaunt. Behind her, Lucille made a little sound, as if she were a mouse scurrying away.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish you had some mud to hand?\u201d she asked, meeting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cA duchess who\u2019s not afraid of an insult...how peculiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d she said, putting out a hand as her footman took a menacing step forward. \u201cNo one is as impolite to each other as equals, in my experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they chide each other with talk of starving children, then? Of fields rotting at the stalk due to bad seed? Of betrayal and coarse unconcern at the hands of those who should take the greatest care?\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s heart was beating fast. This was the heart of the matter. She looked around and saw a three-legged stool, covered with dust. With no hesitation she walked over, sat down, and folded her hands. \u201cLucille, I\u2019ll thank you and John to wait for me in the carriage. I\u2019ll sit for a moment and talk to Mr....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPegg,\u201d the smith said. \u201cSilas Pegg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Your Grace,\u201d Lucille moaned, looking toward the door as if it was heaven\u2019s gate itself.</p><p>Isidore fixed her with a duchess stare and a moment later the smithy was empty.</p><p>\u201cYou may sit down,\u201d she said.</p><p>He just looked at her.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only sit amongst my equals.\u201d His teeth were very white. \u201cDuchess.\u201d</p><p>Isidore had the distinct impression that she had been deemed lower than an equal. \u201cPlease tell me about the children,\u201d she said, \u201cand the fields.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He curled his lip.</p><p>\u201cUnless you wish to be counted amongst those who should indicate concern and haven\u2019t bothered,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI heard that the young duke is paying overdue bills,\u201d Mr. Pegg said.</p><p>\u201cEvery bill,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cHe is paying every bill that the duchy owes.\u201d</p> <p>The smith grunted.</p><p>Isidore let the silence grow between them.</p><p>\u201cWe need a midwife and an apothecary,\u201d he said after a time. \u201cThe bridge over the river is cracked and dangerous, so the post stopped coming to the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA midwife?\u201d Isidore said. \u201cIs there a surgeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasterby, in the next village,\u201d the smith said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone who can afford him.\u201d He turned to the side and plucked a horseshoe from the fire with a pair of tongs. It glowed red and smelled like hell\u2019s own furnace, to Isidore. Then, as if she wasn\u2019t there, the smith placed it precisely on his anvil, picked up a hammer, swung it over his head and brought it down with a precise clanging sound.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a school?\u201d Isidore asked, timing herself between swings of the hammer.</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cA school? You must be joking.\u201d</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cSchools are at the behest of the duchy,\u201d he finally said, turning the horseshoe over with long tongs.</p><p>\u201cWas there ever a school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about a midwife?\u201d</p><p>His hammer must have come down slightly askew because the horseshoe suddenly whipped past her cheek and clanged against the wall of the cabin.</p><p>Isidore didn\u2019t turn around, just gazed steadily at the smith. He looked a bit white. He put down his hammer very precisely, picked up a stool, and sat down on it facing her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if a man kills a duchess?\u201d he said. Almost friendly.</p><p>Isidore let her eyes smile, but not her mouth. \u201cHanging,\u201d she offered.</p><p>He put his hands on his knees. \u201cThe old duke chose a neighboring smith to put up the standards on the bridge over the river, after I wouldn\u2019t work for him any longer. The man mixed sand with the iron to save money, thinking to charge the duke twice as much and perhaps end up with his expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he do it at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t accept the duke\u2019s custom, he\u2019d have you arrested for something. At least, that\u2019s what folks thought.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re not in jail,\u201d she said. \u201cHow astonishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was like a very small dog: all bark, no bite,\u201d Mr. Pegg said flatly. \u201cAfter I refused to do any more work for him, he never entered here again, but nothing the worse happened for that. Nothing that\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo midwife,\u201d he said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t stay because no one could pay her. I\u2019ve done all right because horses always need shoeing, and the baker\u2019s all right too, because people need bread. But almost all the other merchants are gone. People don\u2019t understand how much the great house matters, out here in the country. They stopped paying servants, you know, or paid them only once a year. No one could manage on half wages. The local people couldn\u2019t work there any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who is working at Revels House now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe desperate. Honeydew is a good sort, and he\u2019s kept out true criminals.\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded. \u201cThe bridge,\u201d she said. \u201cThe wages, the school, the apothecary, the post road. And the midwife?\u201d</p><p>His eyes went blank. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She looked around the smelly, dusty smithy again. There was a cot against the wall, with a gray blanket cast over it. This was no house. It was just a place to be. And yet it looked as if he lived here.</p><p>\u201cDid your wife lose a baby?\u201d Isidore asked.</p><p>\u201cThat depends on how you see it. She kept the baby with her, so I never saw the child.\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked at the dirt floor because there was too much pain in his eyes. But: \u201cSo the baby wasn\u2019t born?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t glance up, but his voice continued, rough with that sort of male anger that accompanies pain. \u201cJoan labored for two days. I found the surgeon from the next village, Pasterby, forced him to come. It was too late.\u201d Still not looking, she heard him get up and clump to the wall to fetch the horseshoe.</p><p>He put it down on the anvil and struck it with the hammer, a gentler, quieter blow than earlier. \u201cShe might have died, even with a midwife here.\u201d Another thump of the hammer. \u201cBut she died alone and in pain, while I was riding over to the next village. And for that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew you were coming,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThat you were trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor that I pissed on the duke\u2019s marble coffin,\u201d the smith said. He turned to her. \u201cAnd for that I almost killed his daughter-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to have a hysterical fit and scream your way out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m learning so much,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI\u2019ll send Honeydew to polish the family tomb directly.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence and then he made a strange barking sound. Isidore was trying to blink away an errant tear and didn\u2019t realize what the sound was, until she understood he was laughing. And laughing.</p><p>Isidore rose and brushed off her back of her pelisse. \u201cMr. Pegg, I need someone to help me.\u201d</p><p>He stopped laughing and looked at her. \u201cI suspect you would not be surprised to hear that I require all duchesses to pay beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vicar reports that he has many graves without stones, as people haven\u2019t been able to afford them. I told him that the Duke of Cosway would be righting the cemetery, and making sure that each grave has a proper memorial.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cMy Joan has a stone.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWill you help me make sure that everyone who was not as lucky as Joan gets a stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky?\u201d he said. And snorted.</p><p>\u201cLucky,\u201d she said. \u201cUnlucky in some ways, lucky in others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered. \u201cA philosophical duchess. That\u2019s just what this village needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhilosophical and rich,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>He got to the door before her and pushed it open. \u201cAs I said, Your Grace. Just what this village needs.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 2, 1784</p><p>The next day</p><p>The man from London had bulging eyes that reminded Simeon of a tree frog he\u2019d seen in Morocco. He had on a wine-red velvet waistcoat that must have belonged to a nobleman at some point. It strained over Mr. Merkin\u2019s impressive stomach.</p><p>\u201cYer Grace,\u201d he said, bowing as much as his stomach would allow.</p><p>\u201cI am very grateful for your assistance with this problem,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cSewers is my business,\u201d Mr. Merkin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who knows the inside of a sewer better than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really a sewer,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cMy father put in a water-pumping system\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSewer,\u201d Mr. Merkin said cheerfully. \u201cJust because it don\u2019t work so well doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a sewer. I can smell its perfume, so why doesn\u2019t your butler here show me the place and I\u2019ll do an assessment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simeon stood up. \u201cI shall accompany you myself. I am curious about the solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you on the hoof,\u201d Mr. Merkin said, taking a generous pinch of snuff as he led the way out of the room. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this over and again. It\u2019s meant to flow, and it ain\u2019t flowing. You could do dirt, but you han\u2019t done dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cHave to pipe it,\u201d Mr. Merkin said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I follow the question of dirt?\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>They arrived at the door to the first-floor water closet. Honeydew, with a look of fastidious agony, directed a footman to remove the felt blanket that had been tacked tightly to the wall so as to cover the entire door.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll be the heart of it,\u201d Mr. Merkin said. \u201cThe rest of the closets feed into the pit here. I\u2019ll send the men in. We\u2019ll have to clean it all out; you do realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hoped so,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cWe have to take it out through the front door,\u201d Mr. Merkin said. \u201cThere\u2019s them as has palpitations at that thought, but there\u2019s no other way to do it. The pipes are blocked; we need to clean it out right good and then pull all the pipes and replace them. They\u2019ll have fallen to bits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps we should simply\u2014\u201d</p><p>The footman pulled down the last corner of the green felt and opened the door; without thinking, Simeon fell back a pace. The smell reached out to greet them, as thick and loathsome as a London fog. It felt like something that had weight and mass. Perhaps even life.</p><p>Mr. Merkin walked forward as if he smelled nothing.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace need not follow,\u201d Honeydew said, with a note of conscious heroism in his voice. \u201cI will accompany Mr. Merkin and ascertain if he needs assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould it be that something died there?\u201d Simeon asked, feeling himself turn pale. \u201cI once came on a village ravaged by the plague and the odor is disconcertingly similar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways a possibility,\u201d Merkin called back. \u201cRats need air like anything else. If one fell in, it\u2019d be dead within minutes. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d there was the sound of wood shattering\u2014\u201cremoving the seat so I can see the size of it.\u201d He backed out a moment later and Simeon was oddly gratified to see that he was mopping his forehead with a red handkerchief. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad one, that is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you possibly clean the pit?\u201d Simeon asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, my men will do that. We\u2019ll set up a dumbwaiter and take it out in wheelbarrows. Your man said you wanted the best, and you\u2019ve got them. I brought the Dead Watch with me.\u201d</p><p>Simeon backed up as Honeydew closed the door to the water closet, with the air of someone shutting the door on a wild animal. \u201cWhat is the Dead Watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dead Watch,\u201d Merkin repeated. \u201cLondon\u2019s finest. You\u2019re paying them double, of course, but it\u2019s worth it. Penny wise, pound foolish, I always say. The lads will be down there in a thrice and clean it until it sparkles like a plate. You\u2019ll have to maintain it, of course, Yer Grace. No more of this foolishness. You\u2019ll need me to check your pipes every three months; fresh water twice a day. I can lay it all out with your butler here. If you love your sewer, it\u2019ll love you back.\u201d</p><p>Simeon could hear Honeydew making a sound like a rusty grate, which he thought indicated some reluctance to love the sewer. \u201cThe Dead Watch?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cThe part of the Watch that cleans up the dead,\u201d Merkin replied. \u201cThe floaters, in the river, of course. But there\u2019s them as get stuck in a house and no one finds them. There\u2019s the murders, of course. The Dead Watch doesn\u2019t do your ordinary killing. But a truly nasty one? They\u2019re the men for the job!\u201d</p><p>His cheerfulness made Simeon feel a bit ill.</p><p>\u201cI always use them for this sort of thing,\u201d Merkin continued. \u201cThey\u2019re down at the pub, waiting for me, Yer Grace, and if you\u2019ll excuse me, we\u2019ll start on the job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be putting a pipe down there first. I have to get the gas out, or me lads will keel over. No air. Then yer butler and I will be figuring out the way to get the muck out of the house with the least fuss. And I\u2019ll be asking yer Grace to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave? I can\u2019t leave, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d Mr. Merkin said. \u201cYou seem to be stomaching the smell all right now, but this is nothing. You\u2019ll have to be out of the house tomorrow morning and not come back til the day after, Yer Grace. And that goes for all the maids and everyone else as well. The butler can stay with me, and make sure that the silver stays in its place.\u201d</p><p>Simeon heard a little groan from Honeydew\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll open the house up and pipe all the gas out. It\u2019ll take a day and a night, maybe two days. We\u2019ll go down there, empty it out, and wash it. Then I\u2019ll replace the pipes, but that\u2019s a different matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go down in the hole yourself?\u201d Simeon asked, unable to imagine the gaudy Mr. Merkin making his way down into a pit.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Merkin said impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ve the Dead Watch for that. In the normal run of things I use a couple of mud larks. Now I need to take my leave, Yer Grace. If you\u2019d be out of the house by morning, I\u2019d be obliged. As you can imagine, the Watch may well be needed in the city any day, so I need to start.\u201d</p><p>He paused and hauled down his waistcoat so that it covered his stomach better. \u201cNow I\u2019ve one more thing to tell you, Yer Grace. The Dead Watch ain\u2019t my servants, and I can\u2019t speak for their behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worries you about them?\u201d Simeon asked.</p><p>\u201cThievery worries me. I know my mud larks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMud larks?\u201d Simeon interrupted.</p><p>\u201cLads who grow up in the mud of the Thames,\u201d Merkin said impatiently. \u201cI pick the best of the lot and my lads don\u2019t thieve. But the Dead Watch are pirates. They go where no one else in the city will go. They do the tasks that no one else will do. They think themselves as outside the law, see?\u201d</p><p>Honeydew made a groaning sound.</p><p>\u201cYou need them, Yer Grace, cause I ain\u2019t going to get anyone else down there to clean out that muck. They\u2019re the only ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if we paid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t enough money in the world. Besides, chances are if I sent one of my larks down there, the poor fool would die and then I\u2019d have to cope with a dead body on top of it all, if there ain\u2019t one down there already. That\u2019s a worrying smell you have down there, I don\u2019t mind telling you.\u201d He swung about and peered at Honeydew. \u201cAnyone missing from the household in the past few years? A housemaid run away without notice, that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>Honeydew drew himself upright. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. There\u2019s gas down there, understand? Not air. The Dead Watch, now, they have lungs made out of steel.

Otherwise they would have found the poor dead soul before he moldered away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Simeon assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move everything to the barn,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cAnd guard it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do it,\u201d Merkin said. \u201cThey\u2019re not really robbers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust thieves,\u201d Honeydew put in.</p><p>\u201cThey might pick up a thing here or there, something left before their eye, but as I say, Yer Grace, they\u2019re doing a job as no one else will do.\u201d He turned. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll forgive me, I\u2019ve got to make arrangements. Mr. Honeydew here showed me where the pipes come out on the hillside. We\u2019ll be pulling them from that direction, at least till they break in our hands, while the Dead Watch is doing their job.\u201d And with that, he left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay in the house, Honeydew. You can put the silver in my study. I\u2019m just turning the tide with my father\u2019s papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nice desk in the Dower House,\u201d Honeydew said soothingly. \u201cI\u2019ll have all your papers transferred there immediately. If Your Grace would excuse me, I have a number of arrangements to make. I don\u2019t trust those miscreants anywhere near the silver. It must be removed from the house. That and everything that could be fenced.\u201d</p><p>Simeon walked back into his study and sat down. He had left a complicated letter from Mr. Kinnaird open on his desk. He tried to return to its detailed description of the state of the townhouse on St. James Square. Water had broken through the roof and seeped into the attics; rats had made nests in the kitchen...</p> <p>The smell of the sewer seemed to cling to his skin. He sniffed his sleeve, but it was his imagination. Or\u2014</p><p>He stood up. He had had a bath two hours ago, but it was time for another.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 2, 1784</p><p>Isidore entered the house in the late afternoon to find servants scurrying this way and that, their arms full of ornaments and small statuary. Finally she discovered Honeydew, directing traffic. \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sewer will be cleaned,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cBy people from London who have requested that we vacate the house. The dowager duchess refuses to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cMaster Godfrey has been dispatched to spend a night or two with the vicar. The vicar is a Latin scholar, and Master Godfrey needs to refresh his skill since he will be going to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I speak to the duchess?\u201d Isidore asked, only belatedly thinking that it was an odd thing to ask a butler. But Honeydew was something more than a butler.</p><p>\u201cI believe that would be inadvisable,\u201d he said without blinking. \u201cIf Her Grace has decided not to leave her rooms, she will not leave her rooms. If you will forgive the presumption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cWhere might I find my husband, Honeydew? I want to speak to him about my trip to the village yesterday.\u201d She loved using that word, husband. It made her whole tenuous situation seem less so, though how the use of one word could do that, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cIn his chambers, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She paused.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s merely checking on some papers,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cYou may enter at will, Your Grace, and you won\u2019t disturb him. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d A footman struggled by with a tub filled with silver candlesticks. \u201cWe\u2019re removing everything for safekeeping. I must supervise\u2014\u201d And with a hurried bow, he left.</p><p>Isidore walked up the stairs, came to the door of the master bedchamber, and pushed open the door. Simeon wasn\u2019t working on papers.</p><p>He had his back to her. It was naked.</p><p>It was a beautiful back: strong and muscled, and that same golden toast color as his face. Isidore froze in the doorway. As she watched, he reached out for a ball of soap perched on a small table to his left. Water slid over his skin, chasing the hollows of muscles as he flexed, running his right hand up his left arm. Individual bubbles slid over his skin like small kisses.</p><p>The air smelled spicy and sweet. She\u2019d never smelled perfume on his skin, not that she\u2019d really had the opportunity to smell\u2014</p><p>He ducked his head forward and then raked his fingers through gleaming wet, clean hair. Isidore didn\u2019t breathe as he braced his hands on the sides of the tub and stood up.</p><p>His body wasn\u2019t at all like hers. She was all curves, the gift of her Italian mother. Depending on how tightly she laced her corset, her waist was small, and then her breasts and hips swelled above and below\u2014not gently, not in a slim, English style, but with a lush Latin bountifulness.</p><p>Nothing was lush about Simeon\u2019s body. It was all rippling muscles, even his bottom. As he stood, the last bubbles ran down his back, down his legs. His bottom was hollowed on the sides. Her fingers twitched and she suddenly realized that, in her imagination, she was tracing the bubbles, down over the muscles of his back that rippled as he reached for a towel. He bent forward...perhaps it was the running that gave him such large thighs? She\u2019d heard of men padding their pantaloons to give themselves bulk. Simeon had the muscles of a dock-worker.</p><p>He had one foot out of the bath now, and was drying off his second leg. She started to move soundlessly backwards.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d he commanded, not turning his head.</p><p>He must have noticed the door open, and probably thought she was a footman. She stepped back again and began to ease the door shut.</p><p>\u201cIsidore.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open.</p><p>Moving with his usual thoughtful control, he wrapped the towel around his waist and turned around. Isidore snapped her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to have disturbed your bath,\u201d she said, keeping her voice even. \u201cI wished to speak to you about your mother\u2019s refusal to leave the house.\u201d She swallowed. He didn\u2019t have a mat of hair on his chest. She could see the shape and size of each muscle, see the way the human body was designed to be.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was there?\u201d She forced herself to meet his eyes. Of course, they were utterly calm, unreadable.</p><p>\u201cYour scent,\u201d he said.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cYour soap has a very interesting odor.\u201d That was such a stupid thing to say. The words fell into the air between them. Obviously, this was a perfect opportunity to seduce Simeon.</p><p>\u201cCardamom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you found the soap in the East somewhere?\u201d She sounded like a fool, Isidore thought desperately.</p><p>\u201cIndia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a spice used in cooking as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d she managed.</p><p>The white towel settled a little lower on Simeon\u2019s hips and without thinking she looked toward the movement and then jerked her eyes back to his face. He was just looking at her with a pleasant inquiry, as if they were in the drawing room, and he\u2019d asked whether she would like a cup of tea.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seduce him. She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea how to go about it, and what seemed easy when she was in London wasn\u2019t easy at all. He didn\u2019t seem the least interested in the fact that she was in his bedchamber while he was nearly unclothed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides...</p><p>He was so large. Everything about him was big, from his shoulders to his feet.</p><p>She dropped a curtsy, taking refuge in formality. \u201cI beg you to forgive me for interrupting your bath,\u201d she said, backing up one step and then whirling so she could leave. She shut the door so fast that it slammed a bit, the sound reverberating down the corridor.</p><p>Inside the room, Simeon unclenched his teeth and then threw away the damned towel with a muffled curse. She hadn\u2019t seemed to notice the way it tented in the front, though she had certainly seen how close he was to utter loss of control. She had fled as if a horde of desert tribesmen had brandished their swords at her.</p> <p>He glanced down at his personal weapon and then dropped into a chair. Christ, this was a mess. He didn\u2019t dare touch himself for fear he would explode. He had been sitting in the bath, thinking of her: the way her hair gleamed like rumpled strands of black silk, waiting to be woven into the kind of garment a man could bury his face in, stroke his cheek, other parts of his body...</p><p>His blood had been raging through his body already when he heard that light knock and then, before he could gather his wits, the door opened and it was she. He knew instantly, of course. Who else in the household smelled of jasmine, like a poem in flowers? Even with the house reeking of sewage, he knew when she was near because her scent came to meet him.</p><p>But Isidore\u2019s real scent wasn\u2019t jasmine. Her scent was under the fresh, clear call of the flower, something that teased his senses more than any perfume, made him think deliriously of burying his face in her hair, of kissing her skin, licking her from head to foot.</p><p>Embarrassing. That\u2019s what it was.</p><p>She was like a firebrand, burning more brightly than any woman he\u2019d ever known. He could accept this marriage\u2014and spend his life circling around her, like a tribesman with a precious donkey, trying, trying to keep her from being stolen.</p> <p>Did he have any choice?</p><p>A man always has choices. If you tell yourself you have no choice, you lie...you lie in the worst possible manner: because almost always a man who tells himself that he has no choices has already made up his mind to the wrong choice. Valamksepa\u2019s voice sounded hateful in his ears, even as he recognized the truth of it. Of course, he had a choice. He knew that he could have the marriage annulled, just as the solicitor admitted, and damn the laws of England. He wasn\u2019t a duke for nothing. As the highest in the land, just under royalty, he could wield his money and power like a club and achieve what other men were unable to do.</p><p>But was that the right thing to do? Was it the ethical thing to do? Isidore would no longer be a duchess. But then, it rankled him to hear that she had ever introduced herself as Lady Del\u2019Fino. She was\u2014</p><p>He pulled himself back together, realizing that he was clenching his teeth. She was only nominally his. Nominally.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Mansfield Place, Number One</p> <p>London Seat of Lord Brody</p><p>March 2, 1784</p><p>It was Lord Brody\u2019s soir\u00e9e in honor of his nubile daughter\u2014a spotty little horror with frizzled hair\u2014and Jemma was wandering the various rooms, trying to look as if she were not searching for her husband.</p><p>Madame Berti\u00e8re hailed her. \u201cYour Grace, do come see who\u2019s just arrived from Paris. Of course, you two know each other so well.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s heart sank. It was the Marquise de Perthuis, one of her least favorite people in all of France. Jemma and the marquise had been viewed as great rivals in the French court, though Jemma was never quite sure what they were competing for. But their undoubted dislike for each other kept people like Madame Berti\u00e8re happily gossiping.</p><p>As always, the marquise was dressed in such a way that she took up more space than the Tower of London. Just to make a point, Jemma looked slowly, deliberately, up the wadded length of the marquise\u2019s wig, pausing on each of four stuffed birds. They were rather charming little birds, black and white, of course. The marquise wore only black and white.</p><p>Jemma sank into a deep curtsy. \u201cBut of course I am acquainted with the marquise,\u201d she said, her smile hitting a perfect register between indifference and recognition.</p><p>The marquise had the near expressionless countenance of a woman who understood face paint and used it with consummate skill. In fact, she would have been alluring except that her penchant for black and white drew attention to her costumes rather than her face. Those affectations, Jemma thought uncharitably, made her appear much older than her twenty-seven years.</p> <p>\u201cAh, the d\u00e9licieuse Duchess of Beaumont! How happy were all the ladies of the French court when you returned to England. As you know,\u201d she said, turning to Madame Berti\u00e8re, \u201cthe duchess provides such formidable competition for the gentlemen!\u201d</p><p>A nice hit, Jemma thought. She managed to praise me and yet note my adulterous tendencies. She unfurled her fan and smiled over the edge of it. \u201cWhat a delightful costume you are wearing, madame. I wish I had the courage to go against fashion the way you do. I\u2019m sure I would be sadly clumsy if my hips were quite as wide as yours, and yet you manage with such grace.\u201d</p><p>The marquise was far too sophisticated to stiffen; instead, she threw Jemma a sweet, roguish smile. \u201cAnd I adore those delicious little flowers on your gown, duchess. I can certainly understand why you keep your panniers so small...when a woman has been gifted with such an ample bosom, large panniers inevitably make her look like an hourglass. Or a haystack. Your skill in dressing is so admirable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to pay us a long visit?\u201d Jemma inquired.</p><p>\u201cAh, one travels to escape the ennui of life,\u201d sighed the marquise. \u201cIn truth, without your entertainments to enliven Paris, it is a tediously puritanical place.\u201d</p><p>Another hit, Jemma thought. Not as potent, though. There was something a little tired about the marquise, as if she had lost interest in the verbal fencing matches, the flares of witty comments, that had shaped her days in Versailles.</p><p>In fact, now that Jemma looked beyond her face powder, she saw that the marquise\u2019s cheeks were rather gaunt.</p><p>Jemma slipped her hand through the marquise\u2019s, an action she would never have taken in Versailles. She waved off Madame Berti\u00e8re. \u201cThe marquise and I will take a turn or two and allow everyone to admire us. \u2019Tis an act of great kindness on my part, given the marquise\u2019s elegance will so put mine in the shade.\u201d</p><p>Previously, the marquise would have laughed in a way that indicated her complete agreement. Now she said nothing. It was almost unnerving.</p><p>They walked through the crowd, lowering their chins at acquaintances. Jemma made her way unerringly toward the ladies\u2019 salon. They entered to find three chattering debutantes, who wisely fled. Jemma turned to the attending maid. \u201cI am feeling quite faint. Please stand outside the door and make certain that no one enters.\u201d</p><p>The maid whisked herself through the door.</p><p>The marquise sat down heavily, as if the weight of her enormous panniers dragged her to the ground. She had aged from the woman Jemma knew two years ago, the woman who snapped and laughed her way through the French court, grinding insouciant courtiers under her jeweled heels, making\u2014and destroying\u2014a lady\u2019s reputation with one mocking glance.</p><p>She had never been a nice person. But all the same, she had been a strong person.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Jemma said, sitting down opposite her, \u201care you quite all right, Madame la Marquise? You do not seem yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The marquise started to laugh, her response to everything. But it broke off, and the sound that emerged sounded like a violent hiccup instead. Jemma waited.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my husband?\u201d she finally asked. Her voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jemma replied. \u201cHe is not in London, to the best of my knowledge.\u201d She hesitated.</p><p>But the marquise intervened before she could think of a tactful question. \u201cHe left. He followed une femme to England. He said it would be a brief visit, some weeks. It has been eight months.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did hear such a rumor,\u201d Jemma said cautiously.</p><p>The marquise had a delicate lace handkerchief clutched in her hand. For a moment Jemma thought she was going to start tearing it apart, ripping it to shreds like a madwoman in a play. But no: she opened her hand and let it fall to the ground.</p><p>It lay on the floor, crumpled, and their eyes met over it. \u201cThat is how he treated me,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cLike a piece of dirty linen, to be thrown to the side after it has been soiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must find him. I must.\u201d There was some sort of suppressed rage about her that made Jemma twitch, and long to leave the room.</p> <p>\u201cDo you wish him to return to you?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014that salaud! Never. But I want to tell him to his face what sort of man he is. I want to tell his petite amie what sort of woman she is. I want\u2014I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jemma reached forward and put a hand on her arm. \u201cForgive me,\u201d she said gently, \u201cfor my impertinence. But what will the conversation change?\u201d</p><p>The marquise raised her head. \u201cHe left me.\u201d</p><p>Jemma suddenly remembered that the marquise was the daughter of a duke, and connected to French royalty. She looked, in that moment, like a queen whose subjects had inexplicably snuck away and crossed a border to another kingdom.</p><p>\u201cHe had no right to leave me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMen are prone to extreme foolishness,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cHe has humiliated me in front of the court. He has\u2014he has caused me great distress.\u201d</p><p>For the marquise, Jemma thought that was probably close to saying that her husband had beaten her in the open marketplace.</p><p>\u201cBut what do you hope to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepentence,\u201d the marquise said, \u201cis too much to ask. No one repents anymore. It is as out of fashion as fidelity. But he has degraded me, brought me to his level. He must\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>Jemma nodded. \u201cI faced the same problem, many years ago. My husband had made clear to me his utter lack of respect, his love for another woman. I lived in France for years as a result. It took me a great many years to understand that marriage lines do not control the heart.\u201d</p><p>The marquise\u2019s face twisted.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband was in love with someone else,\u201d Jemma repeated. \u201cThere was nothing I could say or do to change that circumstance. My advice, and I mean this seriously, is that you do not choose to follow him. Fashion a life of your own. I was not always happy in Paris, but I was often content.\u201d</p><p>The marquise snapped open her fan, but not before Jemma saw the glint of tears in her eyes. Jemma rose to her feet and held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cWe must return to the ball. It is too demoralizing for the men to discover that women are talking amongst themselves. Their fear of conspiracy moves them to overprize virtue in the female sex. They grow more conservative as a result.\u201d</p><p>The marquise chuckled. It wasn\u2019t the laughter that Jemma remembered, but it was a reasonable approximation.</p><p>Elijah was leaning casually against the wall just outside the door when they emerged. Jemma couldn\u2019t help it; a smile leapt from her heart to her lips. The marquise threw her a sour look. \u201cIt seems that men are not the only ones with ambitions to virtue,\u201d she said. \u201cBeware lest you grow conservative, duchess.\u201d</p><p>It was almost worthy of her former waspishness.</p><p>Elijah was bowing before the marquise, taking her hand to his lips. \u201cYou are as exquisite as ever,\u201d he said, using his politician\u2019s voice, the one that sounded as sincere as if he were prophesying rain while drops fell on his hat.</p><p>The marquise sauntered away. She looked back, over her shoulder, and caught Jemma\u2019s eye. There was something like envy\u2014or rage\u2014on her face.</p><p>\u201cDo not ever imagine yourself comfortable, duchess. A mistake I committed.\u201d</p><p>Then she turned with a swish of her skirts and disappeared into the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cDear me, what an uncomfortable woman she is!\u201d Elijah says. \u201cAll in white and black like that. She reminds me of a chess board.\u201d</p><p>Jemma closed her fan. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, though. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cVilliers is here. He asked me whether you and I had begun our third game in the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told him?\u201d She looked up at Elijah\u2019s face, at his stark cheekbones, deep eyes, tired intelligence.</p><p>\u201cI told him that I only wished I had you blindfolded and in bed,\u201d he said, looking down at her. It should have been a joke...</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a joke.</p><p>His eyes were serious.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d she said. It was hard even to force the air into her lungs to say that.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told him that I would prefer that he complete his game immediately, under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because if people suspect that I am having an affaire with him, they will not countenance our child as our own.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. But there seemed to be so much more going on in the conversation, so much that was unsaid. Jemma\u2019s heart was beating rapidly in her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d She cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to play that final game.\u201d</p><p>His face went utterly still. He stayed there for a moment, looking down at her. Then his utterly charming smile appeared and he bowed.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, my lady, I certainly will never urge the unpleasantness on you.\u201d</p><p>He was gone, Jemma staring after him.</p><p>\u201cThe game with Villiers,\u201d she clarified. But he was gone.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>The Dower House</p><p>March 2, 1784</p><p>Early evening</p><p>Simeon\u2019s papers had been transferred to the Dower House. He was seated at a small desk and stood up when Isidore entered, keeping one hand on the desk, a sheet of paper in his other hand.</p><p>Isidore sat down, trying very hard to forget that the last time she saw him, he was naked. \u201cAs you didn\u2019t join me for dinner last night, I had no chance to tell you that I went to the village. I bought one hundred and thirty-five yards of wool, and twenty-seven meat pies.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and put down the paper. \u201cDo we have a sudden need for meat pies? Or wool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are gifts from the duchy to the villagers, to mend relations. Everyone in the village will receive a meat pie and five yards of wool, courtesy of the duke and duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He looked down at the sheet before him. \u201cDid you go into Mopser\u2019s shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He sold me the wool.\u201d</p><p>Simeon\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cI have a letter from him demanding back payment for candles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine there must be many such letters. People apparently believed that your father would have them taken up by the magistrates if they failed to provide the duchy with his requests, even when he didn\u2019t pay,\u201d Isidore said cheerfully.

In order to use the number of candles that he says he sent to the house over the last five years, we\u2019d need seven to nine candles burning at all hours of the day or night in every room in this house.\u201d</p><p>Isidore bit her lip. \u201cBut the candelabra...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s calculating a rate of burn at about four hours, although most candles actually burn in approximately six,\u201d he said, folding his hands. \u201cHoneydew says that the candelabra haven\u2019t been lit for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMopser was probably trying to make up for other bills that your father didn\u2019t pay,\u201d Isidore pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOr he\u2019s a rascal taking advantage of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly don\u2019t think so,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cIn any event, I asked him to deliver five yards of wool to every house in the village. That\u2019s well over one hundred yards, given that we have twenty-seven dwellings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say twenty-seven?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIncluding the huts down by the river,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cThere are nineteen houses in the village,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cThirteen are occupied. There are indeed two hut-like structures by the river, but they are counted among the nineteen. He\u2019s a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone in the village has suffered horribly because of your father\u2019s peculiarities,\u201d Isidore protested. \u201cThey have learned to scramble and perhaps to prevaricate. The smith, Silas Pegg, told me that the bridge is extremely unsafe, as there is dust mixed with the steel. Pegg himself refused to fulfill your father\u2019s request due to previous unpaid bills, and so the smith in the next village did it, but only after he charged the duke twice as much to try to get his expenses...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>Simeon\u2019s was frowning so hard that his brows almost met in the middle. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that the smith in the next village sent in a false bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to!\u201d Isidore said. \u201cHe calculated that your father would pay at most fifty percent, and so if he made the bill for twice as much, he might end up with his expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the kind of thing that clearly drove my father into madness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMad\u2014\u201d Isidore stopped.</p><p>\u201cHe must have been mad,\u201d Simeon said, moving the papers about on his desk. Isidore\u2019s attention was caught for a moment by the beauty of his long fingers. He plucked out a sheet of paper. \u201cFrom a seamstress in the village, asking for remuneration for two christening gowns. Christening gowns. Never paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume the bill is thirteen years old, given your brother\u2019s age,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cA long illness,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that explains it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your father note why he refused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he didn\u2019t care for the gowns, and that she should take them back again. The note is undated, but my guess is that he rejected the gowns only after the christening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that Mopser could be charged with your father\u2019s madness, if we call it that.\u201d</p><p>Simeon\u2019s jaw set again, Isidore noticed. \u201cHe was plagued by false invoices. He felt that he was beset by criminals asking for money, and so, to some extent, he truly was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d He straightened the papers again. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can be done now, except pay these requests, fraudulent though they might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most important thing is that we establish ourselves as honorable,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThat we make it clear that we will pay our bills honestly and on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not convinced that giving money to a thief like Mopser is the way to reestablish that confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to fool you,\u201d Isidore pointed out. \u201cFrom what you describe today, you could enumerate every candle burned in the future.\u201d</p><p>His hands stilled. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound entirely complimentary.\u201d</p><p>Isidore got up and drifted around the corner of the desk. She reached out and drew a finger down his thick, unpowdered hair. She had to admit that it was enticing without powder. She was so used to men with little piles of white on their shoulders, with hair stiff with unguent, curled, or powdered. But Simeon\u2019s hair shone with health as it tumbled around his brow in disordered curls.</p><p>He looked up at her inquiringly and their eyes met. Her finger wandered from his hair to his strong forehead, down the bridge of his nose, to his lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to distract me?\u201d He sounded mildly interested.</p><p>Isidore promptly sat on his knee. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I am.\u201d She put her arms around his neck, but disconcertingly, he didn\u2019t embrace her back. In fact, there was a look in his eye that was not\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy so condemning?\u201d Isidore inquired. \u201cIs it forbidden to kiss one\u2019s wife, even if she might not be your wife for long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am attempting to see whether I discern a pattern,\u201d he said.</p><p>Isidore sighed inwardly. He smelled like plums, spicy and clean. If she stayed close enough to him, she couldn\u2019t even remember what the water closets smelled like. His lips were beautiful, so she reached up to touch them with her own.</p><p>He brushed her lips, only to firmly move her back.</p><p>Isidore was aware of a flare of hurt inside. Her eyes fell while she tried to think of a graceful way to clamber off his lap without looking as if she were offended.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d he growled. And then suddenly he kissed her. Really kissed her. She had just brushed her mouth with his, but he didn\u2019t bother with anything light and teasing. Simeon kissed the way he spoke: in a forward attack, in an utterly direct, heartbreakingly honest way. His kiss said, \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Their teeth bumped together, and he changed the angle of his neck, and suddenly his kiss was saying, \u201cI have you. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s head fell back and she clung to him, letting the touch of his mouth shimmer through her body like shards of fire. She pressed closer to him, knowing that what she was feeling was lust. Good, old-fashioned lust. Lust, she discovered, made her tremble and melt inside. It made her forget that he was showing signs of being as tight with money as his father.</p><p>Lust made her mind reel and the only thought that went fuzzily through her head was some sort of repetition of don\u2019t stop.</p><p>Of course, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cI spent all these years avoiding kisses because I was told they led to nothing good,\u201d she managed, pulling herself together. She kept her tone light, as if she wasn\u2019t struggling to keep her spine straight.</p><p>His eyes were fierce, like a preacher\u2019s eyes. She groaned and let her forehead fall onto his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor kissing me. You have a look about you as if you thought you\u2019d committed a sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But she thought he sounded unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever lose control?\u201d she asked, suddenly interested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>Even his responses were cautious and thought out.</p><p>\u201cDo you swear?\u201d she asked hopefully. \u201cTake the Lord\u2019s name in vain? Become blasphemous?\u201d</p><p>He thought about that.</p> <p>She thought about the fact he had to think it over, and decided to try to stop using her favorite epithet, bastardo. Though it reminded her of her mother, a good Catholic woman...</p><p>\u201cOn occasion,\u201d he decided.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of occasion are we talking about? Is this a lion-chasing-man occasion, or a hit-elbow-on-doorframe occasion?\u201d</p><p>There was a glimmer of a smile in his dark eyes and she thrilled to it like an Italian hearing an opera. \u201cLion-catches-man occasion.\u201d</p><p>She quirked up the corner of her mouth. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p> <p>Just like that, his eyes went serious again. \u201cIf you\u2019re prepared for all eventualities, there\u2019s no need to react with fear or anger to the unknown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there is no unknown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll never shout at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. I would be ashamed to shout at my wife. Or at an underling of any kind.\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s brows snapped together and her back straightened all by itself. \u201cAn underling of any kind\u2014one of those kinds being the spousal variety?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unusual about my position on marriage, Isidore,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not mean any lack of respect. From what I\u2019ve already learned of you, I think that you are better at managing people, better read, and more generous than I am. I would be honored to serve under you, were you the captain of a ship.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cBut I am worried.\u201d He seemed to be picking his words carefully. \u201cIt would not have been my choice to throw money in the direction of Mopser\u2019s store.\u201d</p><p>Isidore stood up and then said, \u201cIn addition to paying him for the wool, I also gave him twenty-seven guineas.\u201d</p><p>Simeon\u2019s mouth fell open for a moment. \u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave him twenty-seven guineas. For delivering the wool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you mean ha\u2019pennies, don\u2019t you? You gave him a\u2014you gave him twenty-seven guineas?\u201d</p><p>Being a great screamer herself, Isidore had never believed anyone who claimed never to shout. She whipped around. \u201cYou\u2019re howling at me,\u201d she pointed out, with some satisfaction.</p> <p>Simeon had surged out of his chair, but he caught himself. His voice calmed, but his eyes were searing with anger. \u201cDo you know how much money twenty-seven guineas is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never returned to claim me as your wife,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore I took over management of my estate when I turned nineteen.\u201d</p><p>Simeon stared at his wife. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d he said woodenly. This was a disaster. A total disaster. Isidore was like a walking version of a succubus, the kind of woman who twisted a man\u2019s resolution and manliness and turned him into porridge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not proud of me!\u201d she shouted at him. Suddenly she sounded much more Italian than she normally did.</p><p>He pulled his mind away. So what if her voice had a kind of husky tinge that made him quiver, like a dog hearing its master? That was it, exactly. She was going on about her dowry.</p><p>Simeon took a deep breath, centered himself, reminded himself that he was nothing more than a small pebble on the shores of eternity.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for not returning and taking care of your dowry myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my dowry!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re raising your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you! And it wasn\u2019t just my dowry. I inherited my parents\u2019 estate, you cretin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCretin?\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cCretino!\u201d she said. Clearly, she had completely lost control. There were inky black curls flying around her head, and she actually pointed a finger at him, as if she were his governess. \u201cJust what do you think I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dowry,\u201d he said, pulling his mind back on track.</p><p>\u201cThirteen vineyards,\u201d she said, walking a step toward him. \u201cA palazzo in Venice, on the Grand Canal, a house in the mountains outside Florence that my mother inherited from her grandfather, a Medici duke, and a house in Trieste that belonged to my great-grandmother on my father\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>Simeon opened his mouth, but she walked another step toward him. Her eyes were glowing with rage. \u201cIn all, I employ over two hundred underlings.\u201d Her voice was scathing. \u201cNone of them live in houses filled with the stink of excrement! None of my houses are surrounded by withered lands. None of my bills are unpaid! None of them!\u201d</p><p>The truth of it felt like a blow. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose bills should be paid as a gesture of good will, and because at this point you cannot ascertain who is swindling you and who is not. And let me remind you, Simeon, that your father is the swindler in question: it was he who ordered goods and services, and never paid for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never\u2014\u201d He stopped. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it in that light. I should have known that my mother was unable to run this estate. Had I paid more attention to my solicitors\u2019 letters, I probably would have discovered that my father had lost his mind.\u201d</p><p>The anger in her eyes turned to sympathy. He hated that. In fact, he hated her. He bowed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, I have an appointment.\u201d Then he turned and left, not waiting for her permission.</p><p>He headed straight outside. It was raining, but the air smelled sweet and clean. Birds were ignoring the rain and singing anyway. A footman tumbled through the door behind him, bleating something about his greatcoat. He ignored him and headed into the dilapidated gardens.</p><p>There was a scamper of feet behind him and he turned around, ready to snap a reprimand. Honeydew had to learn his place\u2014</p><p>But it was Isidore.</p><p>She was trotting down the path after him, holding an absurdly coquettish, pink, ruffled umbrella in the air. Her hair was still in disarray, and little ringlets bobbed on her shoulders as she ran toward him. He almost stepped off the path, behind a bush, but he stopped himself.</p><p>She skidded to a halt in front of him. He braced himself, but there was no sympathy in her eyes. Instead, she looked rather annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI think we have to make a rule,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His lips felt numb. He felt slightly unbalanced. He often felt like that around Isidore. \u201cWhat sort of rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo walking out and leaving a person in the midst of an argument.\u201d She tucked her arm into his and cocked her umbrella. Her face was shiny with rain. A drop ran down her cheek.</p><p>Simeon put a finger on the raindrop and brushed it away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect it was wonderful in Africa, away from here,\u201d she said.</p><p>Simeon sighed inwardly. From the sympathetic strain in Isidore\u2019s voice, she was clearly coming to understand the reasons that he fled to the East the moment he turned seventeen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t walk out in the rain,\u201d he said, all evidence to the contrary. \u201cI am practical, thoughtful, and controlled.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and it was terrifying how much he liked the sound.</p><p>\u201cI myself never walk in the rain, and particularly never sit down on wet benches,\u201d she said, plumping herself onto a wrought-iron bench shining with water. She laughed up at him and he sat down beside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The rain was merely sprinkling now, rolling down his neck in an unconvincing, yet cold, manner.</p><p>\u201cWhen my mother died,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cI was so afraid that I couldn\u2019t breathe correctly.\u201d</p><p>He stopped thinking about how cold his bottom felt and curled his hands around her fingers instead. They were small and warm.</p><p>\u201cI used to lie awake at night and think that my breath was filling the room, so there wouldn\u2019t be any air left for me to breathe.\u201d</p> <p>Simeon thought of saying the obvious, that her fear didn\u2019t make sense, but choked it back. Isidore was not a person who appreciated the obvious. \u201cWhen did that feeling go away?\u201d he asked instead.</p><p>\u201cI finally told my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was able to reassure you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She couldn\u2019t convince me that I wasn\u2019t right.\u201d He turned to see her smiling up at him, her lips soft and ruby-colored, like a flower on the banks of the Ganges River.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said hopelessly, falling into that longing state that gripped him around Isidore. She was right in her initial assessment of his sanity. He\u2019d waited too long to sleep with a woman, and now he\u2019d lost his wits.</p> <p>\u201cMy point is that I am not very good at changing my mind,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI am trying to tell you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get over it?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cWas that happening when you were brought here to live, to this house?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI really was a little crazed. I used to lie in bed and hold my breath, hoping to save enough so that I wouldn\u2019t die before morning.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her hand and put an arm around her. \u201cIsidore.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and put her head on his shoulder. He smelled flowers and that other thing: Essence of Isidore.</p><p>\u201cWhat did your aunt say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe told me to sing. She said that singing actually created air, that when you filled your lungs and let it out in song, the air in the room expanded.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me that the whole idea is deranged?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the end of her nose. It was a small, straight nose. A very beautiful nose. He was aware of a feeling in the back of his head that said that lust for a woman\u2019s nose was probably the beginning of a long list of absurdities. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She put her head back on his shoulder and he tightened his arm. \u201cI sang and sang. Your mother found it particularly difficult when I sang at the table. But you see, I had to sing because every time that I felt a tightening that meant there wasn\u2019t air enough in a room...\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cI know it\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never grieved for my father,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I really believed in his death until I came back here, and found the estate as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be very angry at him.\u201d She said it matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI am angry at myself,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously he was losing his mind, and I never came home to find out. Had I been in England, I would have realized. I would have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done anything, though,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI saw your father at the opera four years ago. He was perfectly sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo all appearances, perhaps,\u201d Simeon said, rather bitterly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in his own mind. What could you have said to him? Father, I think you\u2019re mad; why don\u2019t I pay the bills?\u201d</p><p>Simeon thought about that. Then he thought about how cold his bottom was and pulled Isidore to her feet. She twisted about to look at her backside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet,\u201d he said, and then shocked himself. He put a hand directly on her wet skirts. \u201cAnd cold.\u201d</p><p>She was wearing petticoats under her skirts, of course. And some sort of apparatus that kept her skirts billowing out at the sides. Her skirts were all wet, though, and they collapsed against her skin. He could feel a round, warm curve of flesh under his palm.</p><p>With a groan, he put both hands there and pulled him against her, taking her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d she said, startled, but he took the word away from her, kissed her until she was pressed against him, arms around his neck.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t move his hands. He didn\u2019t think he could. She kissed him and talked at the same time. He could hear little bits of words, here and there, his name, a phrase, a little moan. He tried nipping her lip and she pushed against him...she liked it.</p><p>Suddenly she put her lips around his tongue and sucked and his blood flared in his body. From some distance he heard the groan in his throat, and ignored it. He was intoxicated by the plump sweetness under his hands. His head was swimming and his blood was on fire. He could take her home now. He could take her to the bedchamber and throw her on the bed. She was his wife, his wife, his\u2014</p><p>The word beat sanity into him He forcibly uncurled his fingers and let her dress fall free. She murmured something and pulled him even closer. He waited for one heartbeat and then raised his head.</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes hazy with desire.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI waited too long.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cTo bed a woman,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>Her arms fell to her sides. A raindrop ran down her cheek. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>He answered her honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t feel sane when I\u2019m kissing you.\u201d She liked that. The bleak look went away and her dimple appeared, like a gift. He wanted to kiss it, but stopped himself.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that just makes you one of the family?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>He was caught watching her lips and didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was singing all over this house and half the night, I was cracked,\u201d she said, a smile teasing her lips. \u201cWhen your father was refusing to pay bills, he was cracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d he said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cGrief,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cGrief. She\u2019s not cracked, but she honored his memory as best she could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d There was something important there, but he couldn\u2019t think about it now, so he took her arm and turned back to the house. Raindrops were caught on her long eyelashes. He could see them shining like shattered diamonds. \u201cWhat did you sing?\u201d he asked, rather desperately. Of course he couldn\u2019t stop here in the path and lick her eyelashes. He was losing his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhatever came to me,\u201d Isidore said cheerfully. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very musical, you understand. I wouldn\u2019t want you to think that I added to the general charm of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it already smell?\u201d he asked, aghast.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Isidore said. \u201cNot at all. Didn\u2019t Honeydew say that the water closets were put in five years ago? This was eleven years ago. I remember that your mother was particularly vexed when I would sing a ballad about a forlorn lady who jumped from a cliff because she found herself with child. I learned it from my nanny at some point, but your mother considered it quite indelicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Simeon said, feeling slightly cheered.</p><p>\u201cYour mother did not feel that I was very ladylike. And I\u2019m not, Simeon. I still sing in the wrong places and at the wrong times. Even if you don\u2019t swear, I do. I take after my mother, and she was a passionate Italian woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Simeon knew he should probably take this moment to point out that she wouldn\u2019t want to be with a dried-up old stick like himself, that she would be happier with someone more passionate. But instead he said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your parents, Isidore.\u201d And he put his arm around her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t say anything, and they walked home through the rain. By the time they arrived at the cottage it had turned into a proper English downpour, the kind that slants sideways.</p><p>Honeydew met them at the door to the Dower House and said, \u201cThe silver has been removed, as have all small movables, the smaller pictures in the West Gallery, and the S\u00e8vres china.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you put them?\u201d Simeon asked, watching Isidore walk away from him. Her skirts were wet and clung to her legs in the back. Now that he knew what she felt like under his hands he would never be the same again.</p><p>\u201cThe west barn,\u201d Honeydew was saying. \u201cThe footmen will sleep there, of course. The maids have all been sent home for a few days. The cook will be in the village, as the bakery kitchen has been kindly opened for our use.\u201d</p> <p>Simeon dragged his eyes away as Isidore closed the bedchamber door. \u201cMy mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dowager duchess refuses to leave Revels House. She also refuses to allow her jewelry to be removed; nothing in her room has been touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with her, of course,\u201d Simeon said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI took the opportunity of sending all the furniture in the master bedchamber to London for refurbishing,\u201d Honeydew said smoothly. \u201cYou and the duchess must stop here in the Dower House. It will be rather intimate quarters, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Simeon looked sharply at Honeydew, but his face was impervious.</p> <p>\u201cSet up a bed in the sitting room,\u201d he said. \u201cI trust you can find me something of that nature, Honeydew?\u201d</p><p>He could tell the butler didn\u2019t like it, but Simeon merely left. It would be a sad day when he cowered before his own butler.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>March 3, 1784</p> <p>Jemma stared sightlessly into the glass above her dressing table. Then she pulled open the crumpled piece of foolscap and read it again.</p><p>It read precisely as it had a moment ago.</p><p>His Grace the Duke of Beaumont asked to be remembered to the duchess, and apologized for the fact that the note was written by his secretary, but he was unavailable today. And unfortunately tomorrow looked just as busy. With regrets, etc. Signed Mr. Cunningham, Elijah\u2019s secretary.</p><p>Elijah had never done that before, never actually written her through his secretary, when they were living in the same house. The note had been delivered, along with a letter from her sister-in-law and an invitation to dine from Lady Castlemaine, as if her husband were no more than another acquaintance.</p><p>He had withdrawn. Elijah had retreated back to his chambers in the Inns of Court.</p><p>Obviously he had misunderstood her.</p><p>Not seeing him was a torment. She\u2019d just come from breakfast, and Elijah wasn\u2019t there. And she had driven her maid to distraction, trying on two breakfast gowns before she chose just the right one, before she tripped into the room looking as fresh and elegant as she possibly could.</p><p>Only to be told by the butler that His Grace had eschewed breakfast. Jemma had pretended total indifference, naturally.</p> <p>Can there be anything more humiliating than living out one\u2019s life in front of servants who are both observant and intelligent? Sometimes Jemma felt as if she were acting in a play, and she seemed to have lost her ability to dissemble. Brigitte, her maid, surely suspected. Her butler, Fowle, quite likely.</p><p>It was humiliating to hanker after one\u2019s husband. To be dazzled by his eyes and his attention, until he suddenly withdrew it.</p><p>Perhaps Elijah has an appointment with his mistress, she told herself, just to test the pain of it. But she was no better at believing in mistresses now than she had been when they were first married. She would never, ever have thought Elijah had a mistress. She couldn\u2019t have imagined that he rose from her bed only to welcome the woman to his chambers at noon.</p><p>Even now...</p><p>Even now she couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>She stared unseeingly into her glass. Was it that she thought she was too beautiful to be scorned? The only person who had ever scorned her, so to speak, was her own husband. Perhaps the right way to put that was that the only person who had ever shown indifference was her husband.</p><p>For a moment, an image of Villiers flashed across her eyes. Her revenge was ready at hand. She needn\u2019t watch as her husband turned from her company to the House of Lords, with as much interest as if he had selected a game of billiards over one of macao. She could turn to Villiers. All of London would know within hours of their first public appearance together.</p><p>Elijah would be humiliated and it would serve him right.</p><p>But she knew even as she envisioned it that she couldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014do it. Villiers was no pawn; he was a man. A dangerous man: beautiful, witty and easy to love. That was where the danger lay, in the fact she could fall in love with him.</p><p>Then her marriage would truly be over.</p><p>Somehow, it had never been over in her mind, not even when she fled to France and Elijah didn\u2019t follow, nor the first time she found herself in bed with another man. Even when she tormented herself with remembering Elijah\u2019s declaration of love for his mistress.</p><p>He never said he loved her, Jemma, his wife. Surely that in itself was enough to end a marriage?</p><p>The invisible bonds had grown thin over the years that she lived in France without him. Attenuated by memory and her dalliances with other men.</p><p>But they never broke.</p><p>And all those memories were fresh to her now: of their wedding, when she hardly knew him, and yet her heart thrilled at the sight of him waiting for her in St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Of their wedding night, when she was so awkward and he thoughtful, if (she thought in retrospect) rather reserved. But of course he was in love with another woman. Still...</p><p>There was a habit of mind, a way of thinking and talking, that came from being married to someone. A sort of bone-deep intimacy that survives even blows such as their marriage had taken.</p><p>Love, it could be called.</p><p>Odd, fugitive, undeserved. She had done nothing to deserve his love, and she rather thought he hadn\u2019t given it. Sometimes she thought, recently, that she saw something tender in his eyes, almost longing, but...</p><p>But somehow she had poured out her love when they first married, and there was no taking it back, no matter how she tried.</p><p>And no matter how he rebuffed her.</p><p>Perhaps...perhaps she was making a mountain from a mouse. Elijah worked too hard. He always worked too hard; that was why he had fainted in the House of Lords last year. Overwork and lack of sleep.</p><p>Perhaps he needed to be reminded that life was not work. She could...</p><p>But the idea of going to his chambers in the Inns of Court made her physically ill. She could remember what his mistress\u2019s hair looked like, flowing over the edge of his desk. Surely he still had that desk. It was a large solid oak one, good for the weight of a sturdy woman.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been making a creaking sound as she entered, though he was surely thrusting with some strength...</p><p>It was all so far in the past, and yet close enough to touch.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go to his chambers. What if she did and there was some evidence of his current mistress, if he had one?</p><p>Or had he told her that he had no mistress these days?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even remember: such a crucial detail and it was gone.</p><p>Jemma rose to her feet; her letters fell to the carpet. She was not a woman, she told herself, to sit around bleating and wringing her hands. She was a person who\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Who went and got a man if she wished.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a mere lass anymore. If she wanted to see her husband, she would do so. And of course she would have his clerks properly announce her, so that in the remote chance he was entertaining a woman, he could bundle her out the back door.</p><p>She needed an excuse for paying a visit. In vain she tried to think of something important. Why would she stop by his office? Why would any wife? Only to announce an immediate change of plans. If one, for instance, had suddenly decided to leave London for a few days, and go to the country. She could go to their country house and check on the renovation of the North Wing.</p><p>Suddenly a letter on the floor caught her eye, and it came to her: she knew where she was going. Her sister-in-law, darling Roberta, had written her a letter full of laughing, rueful details about Roberta\u2019s father, who was marrying a woman he met at Bartholomew Fair. That might be bad enough, but the woman apparently earned her money by donning a fish tail and speaking in verse\u2014and Roberta\u2019s father was a marquess.</p> <p>Naturally she had to stop by Elijah\u2019s chambers and tell him that the Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury had lost his heart to a mermaid, and that she meant to pay Roberta a visit and see the mermaid in person. Perhaps she would force Elijah to take her to luncheon, or a ride in the park. She glanced out the window and saw it was drizzling.</p><p>A ride in the rain.</p><p>She, Jemma, was not leaving London without another kiss.</p><p>Sad, but true.</p><p>Her husband had kissed her twice in the last nine years, both recently. And she had kissed him once. Stupid beggar of a woman that she was, she treasured those kisses.</p> <p>There. It was settled. She would instruct Brigitte to pack for a short journey, and meanwhile she would go to Elijah\u2019s chambers. If he wasn\u2019t there, she would wait. And when he finally arrived, she would kiss him goodbye.</p><p>The smile on her lips had a spice of joy about it that made her nervous, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror.</p><p>When had all this happened?</p><p>When did...</p><p>She turned away. There was no accounting for the human heart, or so her mama had always said.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p> <p>The Dower House</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>It was still raining. Isidore sat at her window, watching rain slide off the thorns of the rose briar circling her window. She could live without being a duchess. It would prickle, if she were honest. True, she had thought of herself as a duchess for years, whether she called herself Lady Del\u2019Fino or no.</p><p>But what was a duchess, after all?</p><p>Just a title. Simeon was merely the only man for whom she\u2019d allowed herself to feel desire. There were likely hundreds of desirable men waiting for her to discover them. She could direct the solicitor to unravel the weave of their marriage lines, go to London, and begin flirting with every man she met.</p><p>She felt as sad as the raindrops.</p><p>When Lucille appeared, full of excitement about the dismantling of the house, she put on her clothes without saying more than a word. Why should she seduce Simeon as she had planned? Surely that would be the worst possible footing on which to start a marriage. Likely he would blame her thereafter, thinking her a Jezebel who lured him into a marriage he didn\u2019t want.</p><p>She rejected the delicious gown her maid suggested and pointed to a blue-black one, sprigged with blackberry vines. It was sedate; it was proper. She wore it to go to church.</p> <p>By the time she emerged from the bedchamber, Cosway was already seated at the desk in the sitting room, a stack of papers before him. Isidore felt a flash of irritation at him, for being so beautiful, so restrained, so not in love with her.</p><p>Not that it was his fault.</p><p>\u201cIf you will forgive me for my intrusion,\u201d he said, rising, \u201cI thought we might break our fast together. The Dead Watch apparently have entered the pit and cleaning has commenced. Honeydew asked that we serve ourselves, as he has the entire household staff guarding the silver, at least those who are not consigned to guard parts of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Isidore said, seating herself at the table before he could help her. \u201cAre we giving hardship pay to those assigned to the fumes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent suggestion.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a muffin and buttered it, very precisely. They could be friends. There was no reason for her to feel melancholic. A whole world of men lay before her. \u201cWhat work need you do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have left the most difficult letters for the end,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cDifficult in what sense? Are their requests unlikely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I took your advice and paid all those about which I had doubts.\u201d</p><p>She put down her muffin and felt her smile growing. \u201cThat was very generous of you, given your fear of being swindled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it out of generosity,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think I am particularly kind.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think what to say to that, so she took a bite of her muffin.</p><p>\u201cI like to keep what is mine,\u201d he continued.</p><p>I was yours, she thought, somewhat bitterly.</p><p>\u201cThese are letters that hint at other transgressions,\u201d Simeon stated.</p><p>\u201cOf what kind?\u201d Isidore asked interestedly.</p><p>Simeon rose, extracted a sheet of tinted note paper, and handed it to her. It was written in a sloping, elegant hand and still smelled faintly of roses. It wasn\u2019t long, though bitterness made the phrases pungent.</p><p>Isidore looked up. \u201cYour father\u2019s mistress, I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne? How many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are four such letters. Then there are five or six of a less imploring nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive or six! That\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least ten women,\u201d Simeon said flatly.</p><p>Isidore bit her lip. \u201cAs I understand it, it is a common practice. Ten may seem a great many, but your father was a man of many years, and he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ten letters are all dated within the last six years of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Isidore said, thinking frantically, \u201che certainly was a virile man.\u201d</p><p>Simeon\u2019s jaw tightened. Clearly he did not appreciate his father\u2019s virility.</p><p>\u201cAt least your mother doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Isidore said, looking for a bright side.</p><p>\u201cActually, she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he got up and fetched another piece of paper, handing it to her. This letter wasn\u2019t quite so bitter: it mournfully requested that the duke fulfill at least some of the promises he had made, for a small cottage, the writer noted, and a pension. At the very bottom, written in the duchess\u2019s spidery handwriting was a note indicating a payment of four hundred pounds.</p><p>\u201cFour hundred pounds!\u201d Isidore said. \u201cAt least she got her cottage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was so uncompromising and rage-filled that Isidore fell silent again. \u201cDid your father have a mistress?\u201d he asked, finally.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so. My mother...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould have killed him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou said that I was uncomfortably emotional, Simeon. I got it from my mother. She had a terrible temper, and occasionally she would erupt into rages and scream.\u201d She smiled, thinking of it.</p><p>Simeon looked appalled.</p><p>\u201cMy father would argue at first,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cand finally he would start laughing. Then she would laugh too, and it would be over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI feel as if I returned home to a family I never knew,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cI had no idea that my father swam in a sea of deceit, cheating everyone from the tradespeople to his intimates. I fear that debts of honor will be called in at any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he a gamester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. To this point, no one has approached me about gaming debts left unpaid. I didn\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be that no one really understands another person,\u201d Isidore offered.</p> <p>Simeon put down his knife and fork with sharp little clicks. \u201cI am a man of restraint and habit, Isidore. I do not like chaos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Isidore said, feeling her melancholy almost like a friend at this point.</p><p>\u201cI dislike\u2014I truly dislike\u2014this feeling that at any moment, unpleasant truths about my family may appear. I wasn\u2019t observant as a child and I noticed little beyond my parents\u2019 arguments. Even those I paid scant attention to. I was utterly riveted by my dreams of travel.\u201d</p><p>She had to smile at the idea of that. \u201cEver since you were little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left the country at the earliest possible age. My father thought I would be travelling for a year. I knew it would be far longer, though I didn\u2019t emphasize the point. Yet I would have come back if I\u2019d known the family was unraveling at the seams.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow you\u2019ve changed,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cYou used to long for adventure, and now you seem to want the quiet life you once despised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a thing as too much adventure,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cNear-Death-by-Privy is a good example of what adventure often looks like, up close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you pay the outstanding bills, you won\u2019t be buffeted by chaos.\u201d It had to be said, so she said it. \u201cI have been thinking about your reluctance to marry me, Simeon, and I think your initial instinct was right. I am not the proper wife for you. The solicitor made it clear that we could end the marriage, and I think we should.\u201d</p><p>He had picked up his knife but he put it down again, very precisely. He didn\u2019t seem inclined to speak, so she continued. \u201cYou will be much happier with someone like yourself, someone restrained and organized. I am not very restrained, Simeon. And you haven\u2019t even seen my worst side. I would make you uncomfortable in the long run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begin to question my concept of marriage,\u201d he said, but his voice was wooden.</p><p>\u201cI know I would,\u201d Isidore said, pushing away her plate. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned into friends, don\u2019t you think? Perhaps because we are both people without experience. But you called lust a transitory emotion, and I\u2019m certain that you\u2019re right. Previously, I never allowed myself to feel anything of that nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather that I had felt lust and had restrained myself? Not that it matters,\u201d she answered herself. \u201cI think you will be much more comfortable with someone as composed as yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like a personal secretary,\u201d Simeon observed.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Isidore said, warming to the task. \u201cWe\u2019ll find you someone sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDocile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s such an unattractive word. Perhaps not docile, but you would be more comfortable perhaps with someone more biddable. I am not biddable, Simeon. Not in the least. I have made my own way for too many years. I never really realized it before, but I fear I have become a virago.\u201d</p><p>He gasped, but she saw the amusement in his eyes. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh as you like,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019re grateful I\u2019m saying this, and don\u2019t pretend that you\u2019re not. As I said, we\u2019ll find you a charming English girl to whom restraint and prudence are second nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d she repeated, losing track of the conversation.</p><p>He looked at her thoughtfully. \u201cMy mother learned my father\u2019s lessons so well that she maintained his deranged method of paying bills for years after his death. The only hint of rebellion I can find is that she paid his mistress so generously. He would have hated that. But that in itself indicates a certain lack of passion, don\u2019t you think? I find it hard to believe that she was not aware of the existence of all these women.\u201d</p><p>Isidore really didn\u2019t know what to think of Simeon\u2019s mother. \u201cYou don\u2019t like passion,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIt is uncomfortable. Your mother likely feels the same way. After all, if one\u2019s husband is determined to stray, what can one do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do? If I took a mistress?\u201d</p><p>Isidore didn\u2019t even need to think about that. \u201cI\u2019d kill you,\u201d she told him, smiling to soften it a little. \u201cSo you see, Simeon, I would be a very uncomfortable wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to have a mistress, or mistresses,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very admirable of you. I\u2019m sure your wife will be much happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel queasy at the idea of you choosing my bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Isidore said brightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to intrude in any fashion.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence, so she added, \u201cI shall naturally be looking for my own spouse so I wouldn\u2019t have to time to search out the proper damsel for you. We both must manage the task on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you mind not being a duchess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said airily. \u201cTitles are not very important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not feel that way after more reflection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that proves to be the case, I shall simply set my cap at a duke,\u201d Isidore pointed out. \u201cThe Duke of Villiers is surprisingly attractive. He and I accompanied my friend Harriet to Lord Strange\u2019s house party. I had no idea that Villiers was so witty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is not you, Isidore, but myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that before,\u201d Isidore pointed out, feeling irritated. \u201cI entirely understand that you find me unrestful. I accept it; in fact, as I\u2019ve just said, I\u2019ve come to agree with you. After all, what if I wanted a husband who would show passionate interest in me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were impenetrable. \u201cYes, what then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want a spouse who will be always calm and ordered,\u201d she told him. \u201cMy father cared deeply about my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never would have taken a mistress, not because he was afraid that she would scream at him, but because they were a pair. They faced the world together. Even\u2014\u201d her throat was tight a moment, but she said it anyway\u2014\u201ceven though I couldn\u2019t bear it, I was glad they died together. I simply couldn\u2019t imagine one without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have thought so,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did fight. Sometimes my mother won, and sometimes my father won. On balance, I think my mother won more often. I remember finding them kissing. And I remember my mother sending me to the nursery, and pulling father off for a nap as well.\u201d</p><p>Simeon\u2019s mouth curled in a smile.</p><p>\u201cI thought for years after that that all grown-ups slept in the afternoon.

In a queer way I\u2019m grateful that you didn\u2019t come home promptly when I was sixteen. I\u2019d been telling myself that I just wanted an acceptable marriage. But now I understand that I was settling for whomever emerged from the desert because I didn\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d</p><p>She stood up and walked a quick step to the mantelpiece, turned and looked at him. \u201cI have to thank you, Simeon. I never thought I had any choice, so I didn\u2019t allow myself to think about what I wanted in a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d He had stood as soon as she had. His voice sounded a bit queer, rather stifled, so she peered at him. But he looked exactly the same: passionless, calm Simeon. At least he was polite enough not to break into celebration at her announcement.</p> <p>\u201cI want to be liked,\u201d she told him, feeling more cheerful by the moment. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to fall in love. Oh, and I want to be courted. Many men have tried, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt.\u201d His face did look a bit cross.</p><p>\u201cFlowers and such,\u201d Isidore told him. \u201cEven jewels, sometimes, if they didn\u2019t yet realize what sort of person I am. I\u2019d like a marriage in which\u2014\u201d She stopped. \u201cDo you suppose it\u2019s too much to hope that my husband will listen to my opinion all of the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cThen most of the time. And I\u2019d like all the passion that you don\u2019t want. I don\u2019t wish for a calm and contained life. I\u2019d rather have some adventure.\u201d In fact, Isidiore felt quite cheerful even thinking about it.</p> <p>Suddenly he was standing just before her. He moved like some sort of predator, but then he didn\u2019t seem to know what he wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cSimeon?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t kiss her, even though her knees weakened at the look in his eyes. \u201cI just want you to know that I like you, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think what to answer.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Number Four, Gray\u2019s Inn</p> <p>The Duke of Beaumont\u2019s offices</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>That afternoon</p><p>Jemma arrived at Elijah\u2019s offices in the Inns of Court feeling reasonably certain that she looked exquisite. That is to say, she was as certain as a woman could be who had just spent three hours putting on a gown of amber silk embroidered with sprigs of white flowers. Her shoes were trimmed with dark gold braid and finished with a jeweled buckle. She wore her hair up and lightly powdered, with jewels that matched her shoes.</p><p>Elijah likely wouldn\u2019t note the details, but a woman feels more confidence when she is perfectly attired from head to toe.</p><p>When Jemma had visited Elijah\u2019s offices for the first time, just after their marriage began, it was the middle of the day and the offices had been empty. She had strolled through a series of rooms noting the dark wood paneling and serious portraits of plump men, until she wandered into Elijah\u2019s inner sanctum. This afternoon, the scene was utterly different. She pushed open the door to Elijah\u2019s outer chamber to find it crowded with men shouting at each other.</p><p>There was a brief silence as they twisted their necks to look at her, and then the noise erupted again. But she noticed a nervous clerk scuttle into the inner offices after a glance at her, so she stayed where she was.</p><p>Before her were two worthy London merchants, or so she would guess from their clothing, arguing with a third man, surely a government official, about what they termed a \u201cnest of pestilence.\u201d Jemma hadn\u2019t figured out where the nest might be located before Elijah\u2019s private secretary appeared, looking harassed.</p> <p>Mr. Cunningham wove his way through the knots of gentlemen and burst into an apologetic speech the moment he arrived at her side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right,\u201d Jemma told him. \u201cI am finding it interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday, Your Grace,\u201d he told her, leading her toward the door from which he had emerged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that Wednesdays are rather chaotic. Well, as are Tuesdays. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll other days,\u201d Jemma filled in. \u201cWho are all these gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetitioners,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you may know, the East India Company has a great many men in its employ whose only business is to inform members of Parliament just what the company would like to have done. There are always more than a few of those in His Grace\u2019s offices, hoping for a word. Lately there have been a great many people offering various solutions to the current wave of depredatory robberies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read about them,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cbut what on earth does Beaumont have to offer to the poor robbed people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not the victims we bother about,\u201d Mr. Cunningham told her. \u201cIt\u2019s how to cope with the criminals once they\u2019re caught that\u2019s on the government\u2019s mind at the moment. We used to banish them all to the colonies, but the American war stopped that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the rat-catcher suddenly left town. There\u2019s no one to cope with the rats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried settling them in West Africa, and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said, weaving his way through a second room just as teeming with gentlemen, if not more so. \u201cWe have a great number imprisoned in the hulks, decommissioned warships moored in the Thames, if you can believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect they attempt to escape daily.\u201d They entered a third room filled with chattering petitioners. \u201cMr. Cunningham, is there a better time to visit my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, it\u2019s like this from dawn to dusk,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGoodness. I haven\u2019t visited in years, but I had no idea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDue to the fact that he is favored by Mr. Pitt, but also respected by Mr. Fox, His Grace finds himself in the unenviable position of brokering compromises.\u201d</p><p>Finally they reached a room in which resided only a number of weedy-looking men scratching busily at sheets of foolscap. \u201cIf you will step this way, Your Grace,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said, \u201cthe duke will be happy to greet you in his private chamber.\u201d</p><p>Jemma stepped through the door; Mr. Cunningham melted away behind her.</p><p>Elijah\u2019s office was beautifully appointed, with a rococo fireplace of just the sort that she most admired, and a lovely group of chairs clustered before it. He was already on his feet, out from behind his desk, and moving toward her. But her heart sank when she saw the look of cool reserve in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sorry to bother you when you have so many people clamoring for your time.\u201d She could hear a faint roar of voices through the closed door.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Elijah said, guiding her to a small sofa.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cCherry twill? Very nice.\u201d It looked precisely like the chairs that graced her salon in Paris.</p><p>\u201cI admired them in your house,\u201d he said simply. And then: \u201cThey made me think of you.\u201d</p><p>Jemma didn\u2019t know how to take that. Did she really want her husband to remember her due to a pair of chairs? He sat down opposite her, rather than beside her.</p><p>\u201cI received an amusing letter from Roberta, saying that her father is marrying his mermaid,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t resist the idea of paying her a visit and meeting the mermaid myself. I thought to leave this afternoon or at the latest, tomorrow morning, so I wanted to let you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was very kind of you to tell me yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cA mermaid. I should like to meet a mermaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hoped to see you this morning.\u201d That was too blunt, but the sentence just jumped from her mouth.</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy,\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cWe have been married too long to lie to each other, Elijah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have thought that the longer a marriage survived, the more the untruths accumulate.\u201d</p><p>Jemma hated the fact that her heart lurched at the very sight of his smile. \u201cI would prefer the opposite. I thought your note might have resulted from a misunderstanding about my last words to you.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, he was a master of the art of silence.</p><p>\u201cI told you that I did not wish to play the last game in my match with the Duke of Villiers.\u201d She held her breath.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change, and she dropped her eyes to her gloved hands. Fool that she was, she\u2019d probably created the situation out of thin air. Look at all the petitioners he dealt with. He could not come home because he was busy. She was a fool. Her heart beat in tune with her self-recriminations.</p> <p>He cleared his throat. \u201cMay I sit next to you, duchess?\u201d</p><p>Jemma could feel a smile curling her lips. It was the gentleness of his tone. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, rather breathlessly, adding: \u201cDuke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you indicated a wish to discard our last game,\u201d he said, seating himself next to her.</p><p>She pulled off her gloves and then reached up to touch his cheekbone. \u201cYou look tired again, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot our last game?\u201d he said, showing the polite persistence that likely got him to the top of the government.</p><p>\u201cVilliers\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cI intend to relinquish the match to Villiers without playing the third game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t take that well.\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed. \u201cPity for your rival?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold has always been unlucky in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall play him other games,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not blindfolded. And not in bed.\u201d</p><p>His lips barely touched hers, just brushed her mouth, but the very touch made Jemma shiver. It wasn\u2019t the sensuality of it, but the affection that was heart-breaking. There had been so much anger between them.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave London as well. Pitt has called a meeting in his country house, since Parliament is in Easter Recess for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>The regret in his eyes was deep and unfeigned. \u201cHow long?\u201d she asked, wondering if it were possible for married couples to feel as excited as new lovers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him that I must return for the king\u2019s f\u00eate on the twenty-sixth,\u201d he said, kissing her again. But it wasn\u2019t the kiss she wanted, so she wound an arm around his arm and brought him down to her. He smelled like Elijah. He tasted...oh he tasted like complexity and power and something that seemed awfully suggestive of\u2014</p> <p>But that thought was gone in the way his lips moved over hers, powerfully, commandingly. There was such a potent sense of homecoming that Jemma felt tears prick her eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t touch her in any way. Her hands didn\u2019t stray over his shoulders or disrupt his wig. They only touched in that most intimate, most silent of fashions.</p><p>They were still kissing when a hard rap sounded at the door and Mr. Cunningham poked his head in. Jemma saw utter surprise cross his face. Of course, Mr. Cunningham was probably more acquainted with the crumbling state of her marriage than she was.</p><p>But Elijah didn\u2019t even turn around. \u201cWhat is it, Ransom?\u201d he said. He kept looking down at her, smiling an odd little lopsided smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been another breakout from the convict ship moored in the Thames near the Blackfriars Bridge,\u201d Cunningham said, whisking himself back out the door.</p><p>\u201cI told them it was a damn fool idea to house people in the hulks,\u201d Elijah said.</p><p>\u201cHousing criminals on warships? Or the part about the Thames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know about that? You\u2019re a constant surprise to me, Jemma.\u201d And he bent his head again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gone by the time you come home,\u201d she said, some time later. She was breathless and happy and frightened, all at once.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t let you leave,\u201d he said.</p><p>To Jemma\u2019s mind, it seemed as if the muffled uproar in the outside chambers was growing louder by the moment.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll want me to address Lords about what to do,\u201d he murmured, cupping her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always\u2014\u201d he brushed his lips over hers\u2014\u201csaid that the use of warships\u201d\u2014another kiss\u2014\u201cwas an outrageous mistake.\u201d</p><p>The noise outside rose to something of a crescendo, and Jemma, pulling herself free, stood up. But she couldn\u2019t bear to leave just yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Being Elijah, he took her question seriously. \u201cMost of the convicts are unemployed veterans of our various wars. Unable to find work, they turn to robbery and worse. The warships make terrible prisons: the men spend most of their time trying to escape. And one in four dies during his first three years there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nests of pestilence,\u201d Jemma said with a little gasp, \u201cI heard men talking about them in the outer chamber.\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou are a good man,\u201d Jemma said, straightening his cravat.</p><p>He caught her hands, turned her right one over and kissed her palm. \u201cNot always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s most important,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI begin to think the opposite. It could be that you are most important, Jemma. To me.\u201d He held her hands for a moment, and then let them go. \u201cI shall come directly to the king\u2019s yacht on the twenty-sixth, Jemma. And I shall look for you.\u201d</p><p>Jemma never really understood the description of a singing heart until that moment, but as she threaded her way out of the crowded chambers, every man arguing over issues of clemency to convicts, deportation to foreign lands, banishment, execution, hanging...She couldn\u2019t stop the foolish smile on her lips.</p><p>Or the song in the general vicinity of her breast.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>The Dower House</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>Isidore did not want to have an intimate meal with Simeon. It was too heart-wrenching. After having thought of him as her husband for so many years, some parts of her couldn\u2019t stop thinking of him that way. Mostly, if she were strictly honest about it, her body.</p><p>She only had to see him to want to kiss him. If they ate together, just the two of them, she might embarrass herself somehow.</p><p>They had spent the afternoon working through the final stack of papers. They had an argument over one of the letters. It talked of love, rather than money. That made it worse, to Isidore\u2019s mind, and she thought that the woman deserved more than the standard four-hundred-pound gift they had agreed upon.</p><p>\u201cShe may be in no need of funds,\u201d Simeon pointed out. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t mention his promises, unlike the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she knows he is married. He is a duke, and she addressed the letter to him. Why would she write if she didn\u2019t need funds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isidore took the letter back. \u201cShe does address him by his first name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asks him to visit her. She says she misses him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poor mother,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>Simeon blinked. \u201cI was just thinking that it was nice to find that my father didn\u2019t wheedle his way into this woman\u2019s bed with financial promises and then disappear. She doesn\u2019t sound angry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, just lonely. Your father may have acted honorably toward her. Perhaps this mistress is in comfortable circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s a rich widow,\u201d Simeon said. There was something longing in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAs am I.\u201d And that was the end of that.</p><p>All afternoon, as the light coming into the room turned from pale yellow to gold, it played in his hair. She was developing a foolish love of unpowdered hair. The light made Simeon\u2019s hair look as if there were streaks of near blue among the curls. When he pushed it back with his hands, one ringlet always fell back over his brow.</p> <p>She kept shifting uneasily, aware that her body was sending her all sorts of treacherous signals, signals that didn\u2019t agree with her newfound resolution to find a man who would court her.</p><p>Because for all Simeon was polite enough to say he liked her, that wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>She wanted to be loved.</p><p>After all the years in which she\u2019d schooled herself into cheerfully accepting whatever type of man her duke turned out to be, she\u2019d discovered that if she had the choice, she would like to be loved with a deep passion. The kind she had seen in her father\u2019s eyes when he bent to kiss her mother.</p><p>Why had she never before realized how important love was?</p><p>The last thing she wanted was to be betrayed by an unruly lust for unpowdered hair into some sort of indiscretion with Simeon, something that would turn their marriage into a fait accompli.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>After hours of sorting though the late duke\u2019s delinquencies, Isidore felt as if she were going as mad as her former father-in-law. \u201cI think your mother must be suffocating in that house,\u201d she announced. \u201cI shall see if I can tempt her into joining us for supper.\u201d</p><p>Simeon looked up, obviously startled. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d she conceded. \u201cYou might clear away those letters, just in case she agrees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has been adamant in her refusal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right that she should be in a house full of fumes.\u201d Isidore stood up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll lend my voice as well, if you will allow me to finish this note and clear away any letters that might distress my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be successful on my own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be shocked, but that\u2019s a commentary on my mother\u2019s stubbornness, not on your persuasive skills. But I\u2019d prefer to accompany you, given the fumes.\u201d</p><p>Isidore went outside to wait for him, but after five minutes, she was too restless to wait. She wouldn\u2019t be felled by the smell. Her house in Venice had persistent odor problems, emanating from the canals, and she had never succumbed to the vapors.</p><p>She entered the house through the ballroom and was immediately met by the stench. There was a racket in the main hallway, and she cautiously opened the door. A man was trundling a wheelbarrow past her. Isidore\u2019s eyes fell to the barrow, and then she wished they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see her, so she slipped up the stairs. If anything, the smell was actually stronger as she climbed the stairs. Her knock on the dowager\u2019s door was met with something resembling a bark. \u201cYour Grace?\u201d she called. \u201cIt is the duchess. Would you open the door?\u201d</p><p>A moment later the dowager did open the door, the better to glower at Isidore.</p><p>Isidore fell into a deep curtsy. \u201cDid the duke not leave a footman to guard you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fool began to vomit,\u201d the dowager said irritably. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing here? The stench is enough to make any person vomit, not merely the lower orders. You must leave at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to ask you to join us in the Dower House,\u201d Isidore said. Truly, she did feel a bit faint at the odor. \u201cSupper is being sent from the village. You can\u2019t possibly eat here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that I could eat.\u201d</p><p>Isidore realized that the dowager was distinctly white, with patches of rouge standing out like poppies on her cheeks. \u201cYour Grace, I insist that you accompany me out of this house. You are faint from lack of air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am faint from the stench,\u201d the dowager said. But she put out a hand to the back of a chair. \u201cI thought I would\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isidore took her arm. \u201cYou may return to your chambers as soon as they are habitable,\u201d she said coaxingly.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t treat me like a child!\u201d the dowager snapped, but she did take a step toward the door. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go nowhere without my jewels. No one understands my attachment to them.\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll take them with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was working on letters,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cI must have them as well. I must finish my correspondence.\u201d</p><p>Isidore glanced over at the table stacked high with sheets of stationery. \u201cWe can\u2019t carry those. Is this your jewelry box?\u201d She picked up an exquisite little box, rosewood with silver hinges.</p><p>\u201cOne of them,\u201d the dowager said. \u201cThe other is there.\u201d She nodded toward a much larger box, made of leather and trimmed with faded velvet.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Isidore said a moment later. \u201cIt is heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall carry the smaller one,\u201d the dowager announced. \u201cGive it to me. I suppose all the footmen have fled the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the barn,\u201d Isidore explained.</p><p>\u201cStuff and nonsense,\u201d the dowager said, taking the rosewood box. She opened the door of her room and the smell came to meet them, like a blow. The dowager fell back.</p><p>\u201cSteady,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cYour Grace, why don\u2019t I fetch your son? Footmen could carry you outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am tired of being old,\u201d the dowager stated. \u201cI shall leave this room under my own two feet.\u201d</p><p>They started down the stairs. When they reached the bottom, the hallway held a couple of men so filthy that Isidore had never seen the like. Dirt was caked on their legs and splattered on their shirts. Their faces were partially covered with red kerchiefs, but their hair and skin was caked with excrement.</p><p>The one closest to the bottom stair grinned, his teeth startling white against the kerchief covering his nose.</p><p>The dowager made a strange gulping noise, and her grip on Isidore\u2019s arm weakened. \u201cYour Grace!\u201d Isidore said sharply, pulling her mother-in-law off the final stair.</p><p>The dowager opened her mouth, like a fish out of water. \u201cThis is\u2014this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but we must continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear, oh dear, ladies as is seeing what they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d a cheerful voice said.</p><p>Isidore looked up and met the eyes of a third man, who had just emerged from the water closet. She knew in an instant that this particular member of the Dead Watch was an utter rogue, due to the peculiar flatness of his eyes, and the way he was smiling without smiling. \u201cJack Bartlebee, top of the Dead Watch,\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnd you two must be duchesses. I\u2019ve a tenderness for the nobility. Really I do. When the king passes in his carriage of a Sunday, I always bobs me knee. Don\u2019t I, lads?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat you do, Jack,\u201d one chimed in.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t it a shame, yer duchess, but Mr. Honeybutt went down the hillside to deal with a little problem with the pipes. We\u2019ll have to help you.\u201d</p><p>The closest man held out his hands, caked with brown.</p><p>The dowager made a choking sound and clutched her jewelry box.</p> <p>\u201cTush, tush,\u201d Bartlebee said. \u201cYou\u2019re affronting the ladies, Wiglet. You was always too forward in your approach. Ladies like the gentle word, the sweet tongue, ain\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cif you would move to the side, I would be grateful to take my mother-in-law into the open. She faints for lack of air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Bartlebee said genially. \u201cOf course I will. I\u2019ll take that wee little box that the lady is holding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d the dowager said, her voice a strangely airy version of her normal peremptory tone. \u201cI can\u2019t have you touch my\u2014\u201d</p><p>All three of them had their hands stretched out. Isidore took a step to the side, dragging the dowager with her. She could leave through the ballroom, rather than out the front door. The men were enjoying causing fear. Their faces were alight with some sort of strange pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cHow dare you terrify an old woman!\u201d she shouted at them, suddenly furious. \u201cYou\u2019ve frightened her!\u201d</p><p>Bartlebee just laughed at her, and even his eyes, those horrible flat eyes, looked amused. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable lesson she\u2019s learning. Duchesses shit as well as everyone else. And once you\u2019ve been in the shit as much as we have, you learn that the color of the stuff is the same, ain\u2019t it, lads?\u201d</p><p>There was a chorus of agreement.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s cut the sauce,\u201d Bartlebee said suddenly. \u201cWe\u2019re only halfway through these privies, duchess. You wouldn\u2019t want us to leave the job undone, would you? Because no one else is going down into that pit. No one in England. So we\u2019d like a little present to keep us going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Isidore stated. \u201cYou\u2019ve been well paid.\u201d</p><p>The dowager was utterly silent, staring at the men with horrified eyes.</p> <p>\u201cThe young lady don\u2019t even look frightened,\u201d Bartlebee said, turning to his men. \u201cThat\u2019s unusual, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not frightened,\u201d Isidore spat. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted by your lack of kindness. Have you no grandmother yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a grandmother?\u201d Bartlebee asked, interestedly. He moved closer to the dowager, who cowered away with a stifled little moan. \u201cOh, I see. It must be the wrinkles, am I right, Wiglet? The more wrinkled you are, the older you are? I\u2019ve heard of that. Course, we on the Dead Watch don\u2019t generally live to collect all that many wrinkles, so we don\u2019t bother. We don\u2019t have families in the regular way of things.\u201d</p><p>They all guffawed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me for not pitying you,\u201d Isidore snapped. \u201cIf you have no families, it\u2019s due to your criminal tendencies. Doubtless, no woman will have anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless, doubtless,\u201d Bartlebee said. \u201cBut just to make you feel better, miss, I will tell you that Wiglet here married Betsy as does behind the livery stables on Pond Street. Now there, does that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked at Wiglet. He had no teeth and a leer.</p><p>\u201cDid I express any sorrow over your lonely condition?\u201d Isidore asked, politely enough. \u201cIf I did, I assure you it was an error.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough of this charmin\u2019 banter,\u201d Bartlebee said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a jewelry box, since you was daft enough to bring it into the shit, if you\u2019ll pardon my plain speaking. And just as payment for this delightful little chat, we\u2019ll be having the large box, not the smaller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duke will have you all thrown into jail,\u201d the dowager half screamed. Her fingers were digging into Isidore\u2019s arm like small talons.</p><p>\u201cThat he won\u2019t,\u201d Bartlebee said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to reassure you there. Where the Dead Watch go, nobody sees. That makes us above the law, as they\u2019ll be happy to tell you in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is above the law!\u201d Isidore snapped. If she could just keep the conversation going. Simeon would finish his letter. Honeydew would return. She took another cautious step to the side, dragging the dowager with her. She almost had her back to the ballroom door.</p><p>\u201cNow if I murdered someone,\u201d Bartlebee said, with that horrible mirthless grin of his, \u201cI reckon you\u2019d be right. A parish constable might knock on my door, if he could find it, of course. It\u2019s such a temptation sometimes. All you\u2019d have to do was tip someone into a pit, and they\u2019d fall into a permanent sleep due to a sad, sad accident. Ain\u2019t it a temptation, lads?\u201d</p><p>Only Wiglet answered: \u201cAy!\u201d Bartlebee was grinning, but his other man didn\u2019t look as comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou should all be ashamed of yourselves,\u201d Isidore said, schooling her voice to a clear, high severity. \u201cWe\u2019re paying you a fair and honest wage for the work you\u2019re doing. And how do you repay us? By frightening an old woman half to death.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, the dowager groaned and sank against Isidore\u2019s shoulder, though Isidore noticed that her mother-in-law kept tight hold of her jewelry box. Now the door was directly behind her.</p><p>Bartlebee stepped smartly forward, and she realized that she was going to have to give up the jewelry box, that all the jewels in the world weren\u2019t worth one touch from his finger. She couldn\u2019t turn around to open the door without letting go of the dowager, or letting go of the box.</p><p>Just then she heard a voice behind her, like a thread of sound. \u201cIsidore.\u201d</p><p>It was Simeon. The door at her back started to ease open. Bartlebee was reaching toward her, grinning; any moment he would see the opening door.</p><p>Without hesitation, Isidore shrieked \u201cNow!\u201d Then she lifted the box she held and dashed it to the ground at her feet. With an ear-splitting crack, it opened and jewels skidded across the floor.</p><p>The door behind her whipped back and Simeon leapt forward. He landed between his mother and the men, standing in the midst of a pile of dusty-looking necklaces.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, gentlemen?\u201d Simeon asked. His voice was as calm as if he were conversing with Honeydew.</p><p>Isidore\u2019s heart skipped a beat when she saw that Bartlebee was utterly unafraid. And his men stopped looking abashed as their eyes brightened at the prospect of a fight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the duke himself!\u201d Bartlebee said, delighted. \u201cSee, gents, he\u2019ll know about the law of the land. He\u2019ll know that we\u2019re doing a loathsome job, and all we\u2019re asking for is a bit of a treat. And as we just told the duchess here, we might not be able to finish the job if we\u2019re not given something to lighten our labor.\u201d He suddenly kicked Wiglet, who was on his knees, scrabbling amongst the jewels. \u201cHist now! There\u2019s no need to act undignified-like!\u201d</p><p>It all happened so fast that Isidore couldn\u2019t follow it. One moment Simeon was standing perfectly still before her, and the next moment his foot connected with Wiglet\u2019s jaw. He whirled, and Bartlebee\u2019s head snapped back. He whirled once more, and kicked the third man in the jaw.</p><p>He turned to his mother. \u201cI do apologize, Your Grace,\u201d he said, his voice as tranquil as ever. \u201cI was reluctant to use my fists given their lack of cleanliness. I hope my delayed arrival didn\u2019t cause you any undue alarm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All three men were on the ground. Wiglet and the other were struggling into a sitting position, but Bartlebee just lay sprawled on the marble, mouth open and eyes closed. Unconscious, he didn\u2019t look nearly as menacing. His jaw was narrow and his teeth jutted up like white turnips overgrowing their planting.</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cI do believe that Mr. Bartlebee may have suffered neck damage. It\u2019s always a possibility with Eastern arts of defense.\u201d He prodded Bartlebee with his foot and the man groaned but didn\u2019t move. \u201cHe seems to be alive,\u201d Simeon said, turning to the two men climbing to their feet. \u201cAs I believe he himself said, it\u2019s so easy to kill people. I always have to remind myself not to strike too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to make a note of it,\u201d Isidore said, keeping laughter and triumph out of her voice with an effort. Then she readjusted her hold on the dowager, who was still sagging against her, and skewered Wiglet and his compatriot with her glare. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky the duke didn\u2019t lame you for life after the way you frightened his mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBartlebee will be dazed for a time,\u201d Simeon told them. His tone was quiet, not at all triumphant. \u201cI suggest you leave him here and finish the task you have at hand.\u201d</p> <p>Wiglet hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNeed I repeat myself?\u201d Simeon\u2019s voice was utterly calm, but Wiglet quailed as if he\u2019d leveled a weapon at them.</p><p>He swallowed and then opened his hand. A dusky ruby rolled onto the ground and bounced once, rolling to a rest next to Bartlebee\u2019s elbow.</p><p>\u201cAre you second in command?\u201d Simeon asked.</p><p>\u201cYeth,\u201d Wiglet said. His lip was already swollen to twice normal size.</p> <p>\u201cRight then, get on with it. You\u2019ll know in an hour or two whether your commander will ever walk again. I do hope that there\u2019ll be no further reason for me to feel concern about my safety, or the safety of my wife, my mother, or my possessions.\u201d</p><p>Wiglet backed away quickly. \u201cNever, Yer Grace,\u201d he gobbled. \u201cNot in the least. I mean, never.\u201d He and the other man stepped through the door into the water closet, presumably throwing themselves down the hole in their fervor to get away from Simeon.</p><p>The dowager pulled herself to a standing position. \u201cMy jewels!\u201d she said. \u201cOn the floor with those filthy, ravening beasts. I shall never feel the same about them, never!\u201d</p><p>Simeon bent down to pick up the stones.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d she shrieked, her voice suddenly strong. \u201cThat\u2019s a job for a servant, as I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace!\u201d Isidore said, \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Simeon dropped the ruby into the cracked box on the floor and straightened. \u201cWould you prefer that we leave the rest for Honeydew to collect, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer never to have been born,\u201d his mother said on a gasping breath. \u201cYou\u2014you have humiliated me one too many times. One too many times!\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cYour father would have taken those ruffians out with a blow to the jaw, like any respectable Englishman,\u201d the dowager said. But her voice cracked on a sob. \u201cYou\u2014my son\u2014with his feet\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isidore met Simeon\u2019s eyes over his mother\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go outside now, Your Grace,\u201d she said, lifting the remaining jewelry box from the dowager\u2019s arms. \u201cFollow me, if you please.\u201d</p><p>They left Simeon there, the marble around his feet littered with tarnished jewels, in settings popular a half century ago. Isidore turned around once, but he was staring at the ground.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p> <p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>The Duke of Villiers handed his cloak to Fowle, the Beaumonts\u2019 butler, pausing at the news that Jemma was out, but that the duke was in.</p><p>He and Elijah had to talk.</p><p>It had been years since they had spoken properly, although his valet Finchley babbled of how Elijah saved Villiers\u2019s life when he was in a fever. Since Villiers had no memory of that, he could hardly savor the reunion.</p><p>The truth was that Villiers was currently doing his best to seduce Elijah\u2019s wife, and yet apparently he owed him gratitude for the said life-saving.</p><p>What was all that between old friends?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll announce myself,\u201d he told Fowle. As he entered the library, he saw Elijah\u2019s profile around the side of a high-backed chair. He seemed to have closed his eyes. Villiers loathed naps. But then Elijah spent his adult life saving the world, or at least the English parts of it, while he himself concentrated on frivolities like chess.</p><p>As always when he observed differences between his life and another man\u2019s, he paused to consider whether he would prefer to order his world on Elijah\u2019s model.</p><p>No. He had no wish to take up his seat in the House of Lords. In fact, he had a positive revulsion to the idea.</p><p>Villiers walked noiselessly across the wine-colored, flowered carpet. It was as glorious as one of his own coats. He rounded the chair.</p><p>Elijah was indeed asleep.</p><p>Or not asleep.</p><p>There was something odd about the immobility of his face, about the way his body was slumped in the corner of the chair.</p><p>\u201cDuke,\u201d Villiers said sharply, bending over. Could Elijah have fainted? His face was rather white. \u201cElijah!\u201d</p><p>His eyelashes were dark against his face. He had been beautiful even back when they were both clumsy puppies and Elijah was the only person in the world that Villiers loved. Villiers himself had had a big nose, and uncontrollable hair that wouldn\u2019t stay tied back properly, nor yet fit under a wig. Then Elijah had the white-blond curls of an angel, and the perfect profile of a young Gabriel.</p><p>Villiers reached out, touched Elijah\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Shook Elijah.</p><p>Shook him again.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>The last thing that the dowager said to Isidore before she left for her sister\u2019s estate was that she wanted every jewel cleaned before they were returned to her.</p><p>\u201cHe gave them to me every time,\u201d she said to Isidore. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shall. After all, you have married a Cosway. I never liked those necklaces, but they remind me of my husband.\u201d She had the smaller box, the older one with silver hinges, beside her on the carriage seat. \u201cThese were my mother\u2019s. I don\u2019t mind if you keep some of the others; after all, you\u2019re married to the duke. But these I shall keep and give to my sister\u2019s children. You may inform my son so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duke is bathing,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cCould you please wait until he is able to bid you goodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I shall stay at a neighbor\u2019s and be at my sister\u2019s estate by tomorrow at dusk. You can tell him where I\u2019ve gone. He\u2019s no son of mine, I\u2019m convinced of that.\u201d</p><p>Isidore frowned.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a fool,\u201d the dowager said, in her cracked, breathy way. \u201cHe\u2019s my blood, God knows it to be so. And Godfrey as well. But Godfrey is off to Eton, and I\u2019m tired of all this. I did my best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a good wife, a proper wife. I never questioned the women. The jewels were given to me from guilt, you know. At least he felt that.\u201d She looked at Isidore accusingly. \u201cThat was something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be in this house full of memories, and letters I haven\u2019t answered, and the stupid, stupid things he did.\u201d Her voice was savage. \u201cThat stink\u2014it\u2019s the stink of stupidity.\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy sister, the Dowager Countess of Douglass, keeps an old-fashioned house, perhaps, but it\u2019s the sort that I\u2019m comfortable with.

I can\u2019t be here and pretend that I don\u2019t care when traditions are violated, and stupid, stupid men do just as they wish. He runs about the country naked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot precisely,\u201d Isidore managed.</p><p>\u201cThey live to humiliate us. Over and over. My husband never trotted about in diapers. But when I think of it now, he might as well have been naked. You may leave now.\u201d She waved her hand.</p><p>Isidore backed out of the carriage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out,\u201d the dowager said. Her gaze was not unkind. \u201cSend my things after me once the maids are able to enter that wretched house. I\u2019ll write Godfrey with my consolations and instructions for his future welfare. You\u2019ll have to cope with the duke\u2019s unkempt ways and his foreignness. God knows I tried but he was never mine. Not really mine.\u201d</p><p>Isidore curtsied, the deep, respectful curtsy that one gives to a deposed queen.</p> <p>The queen didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>It was as if the world froze for a moment.

Then his eyes slipped to Villiers and he smiled. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Villiers stumbled backwards, feeling for a chair, and fell into it. \u201cChrist and damnation.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s smile faded.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Villiers said. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d</p><p>And, when there was no answer: \u201cElijah!\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t used first names with each other since they were both fifteen, sixteen...whenever that was that they quarreled over a lass and never spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cI collapsed,\u201d Elijah said bluntly. \u201cI must have fainted. It\u2019s my heart. I\u2019m thirty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four?\u201d Villiers shook his head. \u201cThirty-four? What\u2019s that, a terminal date for hearts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father died at thirty-four,\u201d Elijah said, putting his head back on the chair and looking up at the ceiling. \u201cHis heart failed him. I had hopes of surpassing his span, but I have, increasingly, these small episodes. I see no reason to fool myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet,\u201d he said, that beautiful half-smile of his quirking the corner of his mouth. He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to say about it all, Leo.\u201d</p><p>Villiers hated being called Leopold. He hated being anything other than Villiers, and he never was, to anyone other than Elijah. The very sound of the name made him feel unbalanced, as if nearly twenty years had vanished.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept that,\u201d he said. The words felt harsh in his throat. \u201cHave you seen a doctor?\u201d</p><p>Elijah shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blacked out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to seduce your wife and you never said a word.\u201d</p><p>Elijah smiled at that. \u201cWhat difference would it make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the world,\u201d Villiers said. His voice grated in his own ears so he got up and walked to the side of the room and stared unseeingly out the window.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why it should. You and I have always had disagreements over women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe barmaid,\u201d Villiers said, making a vain attempt to get hold of himself and yet keep the conversation going.</p><p>\u201cYou chided me with it when you were in the grip of fever. You told me that I had the barmaid, the dog, and Jemma. I couldn\u2019t make you understand that the dog was long dead. But I could certainly understand why you\u2019d like to take Jemma.\u201d</p><p>Villiers turned around. Elijah was still seated, looking at him with that patient, courteous curiosity that was a hallmark of his dealings in Parliament. \u201cDamn it, aren\u2019t you angry?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause you allowed my old dog to die while you saved my life?\u201d Elijah raised an eyebrow. \u201cI was angry when I was sixteen and foolish. I\u2019m sorry I retaliated by stealing your barmaid away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that. Aren\u2019t you angry about your heart failing?\u201d</p><p>Elijah fell silent.</p><p>Finally Villiers said, \u201cI am sorry that your dog died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was all I had, and all that really mattered to me.\u201d</p><p>Villiers moved sharply, then forced himself to be still.</p><p>\u201cExcept for you, of course.\u201d Elijah raised his eyes. \u201cYou were my dearest friend, and I stole your mistress and pushed you away because you were ungracious enough to save my life in a river, and not manage to save that of my dog as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were both fools,\u201d Villiers muttered.</p><p>\u201cThere were few things that I treasured in life, and I threw away one. Then I sated myself with government and flurries of power, and I threw away my wife. It seems a remarkable waste of years; I certainly agree in your judgment of my foolishness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go near Jemma again. It wasn\u2019t for revenge; truly, it wasn\u2019t. It was just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Jemma,\u201d Elijah said simply.</p><p>\u201cYes. Does she know that you\u2019re ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! And she mustn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no fairness in life,\u201d Elijah said, his voice heavy. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone whether she has time to grieve and fear for it, or not. I want the time I have left with her without grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Villiers cursed himself for ever trying to entice Jemma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m winning, you know.\u201d Elijah\u2019s smile was a beautiful thing. It had helped him triumph during many a difficult battle in Parliament, that smile. It had won the heart of a prickly, ugly young duke by the name of Villiers, back when they were both nine years old. \u201cShe\u2019s planning to concede the remaining game in your match when she sees you next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are winning,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been very slow, very tactical,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI wasted so much time in my life. I\u2019ve planned this like a campaign, the most important campaign of my life. And you played a part, Leo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed formidable opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cYou provided it.\u201d</p><p>Villiers sat down opposite Elijah again. \u201cYou must tell her. How often do you have these spells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, once a week or so. More frequently of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much time you have?\u201d</p><p>Elijah shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have an open field.

She was a fool. Simeon may not love her, but he was the man she had. And she could not allow him to be in this fetid, empty house by himself. He could learn to love her. She thought of the way he whirled and struck, and knew the feeling in her heart for what it was. She was halfway to being hopelessly in love with him, for all the same reasons that drove his mother to despise him: for his strength, for his uniqueness, for the Simeon-ness of him.</p><p>Simeon rose from the desk when she entered. \u201cYou entered Revels House without my permission,\u201d he stated, by way of greeting. \u201cI asked you to wait for me because I knew those men posed a danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were accompanying me in order to add your voice to my entreaty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought that my participation would be a disadvantage,\u201d he said. His jaw was set, his shoulders rigid.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI commanded you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize commands,\u201d she stated, making sure that he knew exactly what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to frighten you by mentioning the Dead Watch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t frighten easily.\u201d But she didn\u2019t feel like squabbling, so she said, \u201cSimeon, I just want to say that you were magnificent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is very kind of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your mother was flustered by the shock, the horror of all that had happened,\u201d Isidore said, galloping on without any encouragement from his expression.</p><p>\u201cShe was horrified by my exhibition of foreign skills,\u201d he said. But his voice was dry, and not wounded.</p><p>\u201cI thought the way you whirled and struck was amazing.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes, and she could read them, if no one else could. \u201cShe\u2019ll never like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is her weakness and her loss,\u201d Isidore said firmly. \u201cAs Honeydew may have informed you, she left to stay with her sister. I think she will be much happier for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoneydew does not believe she is ever coming back. She asked for all her things, including the furniture in her bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will be happy to send it along,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThat will save it a trip to London, though it may fall apart on the journey, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you entered my aunt\u2019s house, you might think you\u2019d stepped back two hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case your mother\u2019s furniture will feel right at home.\u201d Isidore drifted closer. Yes, she deserved love and courtship. But sometimes a woman had to take what she could get, especially if it came in a muscled, beautiful, and entirely desirable package.</p><p>\u201cDoubtless.\u201d</p><p>Isidore took a deep breath, remembering Jemma\u2019s various lessons regarding men. Then she reached down and pulled off one of her slippers. Simeon watched as she dropped it on the floor. She pulled off another and placed it precisely next to the first.</p><p>\u201cIsidore?\u201d he asked. Naturally, his voice held the kind of mild curiosity with which one might inquire if the vicar was staying for supper.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She pulled up her skirts and snagged one stocking from its garter. It flowed to the ground and pooled at her ankle. She put out a toe and the stocking rolled off of its own accord. She thought that Simeon\u2019s eyes looked less calm, so she made an event of the second stocking.</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d Simeon repeated. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndressing myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoneydew will likely enter at any moment.\u201d</p><p>Isidore pulled up her skirts and undid the little ties that held her panniers around her waist. They collapsed silently to the floor and she stepped out of them. \u201cYou had better send him away,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be embarrassed by your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be my wife,\u201d he said, but his voice had a husky undertone.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said agreeably. She was wrestling with her petticoat now. \u201cI deserve better than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserve to be courted.\u201d Her petticoat fell and she kicked her way out of it. \u201cWith flowers, jewels, and poetry written specially for the occasion. I deserve to be adored. Someone should be kneeling at my feet.\u201d She looked pointedly at Simeon, but he showed no signs of abasing himself, so she began unlacing her bodice.</p><p>\u201cI deserve,\u201d she finished, \u201cto be loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. Still he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Inside, Isidore felt as if a drop of ice water was running down her back. He wasn\u2019t panting at her feet the way Jemma had promised. Perhaps he thought her thighs were too plump, but men liked plump thighs, didn\u2019t they?</p><p>He just stood there, saying nothing although she had finished unlacing her bodice. She could back silently into the bedroom, pretending that none of this had happened, or she could drop her gown. She looked at Simeon again. He could have been carved out of wood.</p><p>Like a flash flood, Isidore felt a wave of red coming over her face. Her bodice was open all down the front, though of course her breasts didn\u2019t show due to her chemise. That was one saving grace.</p><p>A second later she had fled into the bedchamber and closed the door. She tripped on the threshold and fell to her knees with a hard thump. A sob was rising in her throat but she cut it off. She would pretend that nothing happened. Nothing. She just happened to partially undress before him, and if he heard even a whisper of a sob, then he would feel sorry for her and\u2014</p><p>Though she hadn\u2019t heard the sound of footsteps, he spoke just outside the door. \u201cIsidore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, thankful that her voice didn\u2019t tremble. She knelt on the hard wood, her hands shaking, holding her bodice together.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m not available at the moment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you available?\u201d</p><p>A flash of rage had her off her knees. \u201cWhy? What did you think I was available for?\u201d</p><p>There was silence. He was a gentleman. It wasn\u2019t his fault that she had listened to Jemma and thought that all men were at the mercy of their loins. Obviously, she had the remarkable bad luck to be married to the one man who was in control of his body. Wonderful.</p><p>Though, of course, it was likely that men controlled their bodies best when they didn\u2019t feel true desire. A tear slipped over her clenched fists.</p> <p>\u201cIsidore, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThis was all a misunderstanding, and may we please just forget it ever happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cJust go away, please.\u201d</p><p>There was a muffled thump. But it wasn\u2019t the door. He was probably leaving. Isidore sat down on the bed, her back to the door. He could go to blazes, for all she cared. Any number of men in London would look faint when she took off a glove, never mind dropping a petticoat.</p> <p>\u201cIsidore, will you open the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d she shouted back, losing her temper. \u201cWill you leave me alone? Haven\u2019t you embarrassed me enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much revenge do you intend to take?\u201d</p><p>What a stupid question. \u201cYou are quite safe. Now if you would just please leave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I took my clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m quite naked. And while it\u2019s not very chilly today, there is a good likelihood that Honeydew will enter at any moment.\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s hands fell from her mouth. Being Simeon, he sounded entirely practical. \u201cI think I hear voices on the garden path,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Isidore said, but her voice was weak. She was consumed by a blaze of curiosity. \u201cYou\u2019re really naked? Naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never stood naked in a sitting room before,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, enjoy it,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence while she thought about the fact that Simeon was out there without clothes. He had taken his clothing off?</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cHoneydew is walking toward the Dower House. I can see him through the window.\u201d</p><p>She threw the bedchamber door open, grabbed his arm, and jerked him forward.</p> <p>There he was.</p><p>Afternoon sun was slanting onto the wide planks, stained dark with years. At first Isidore just saw his feet. They looked just as large and male as they had after his bath. He dropped the clothing he held on the floor.</p><p>Her own toes curled. Of course she should meet his eyes. She should look higher than his knees. But\u2014</p><p>She was staring at his thighs when they suddenly moved in her direction. \u201cI suggest,\u201d came a voice somewhere above her ear, a rather strained voice, she thought, \u201cthat we retire to your bed.\u201d</p><p>His voice had no semblance of control. It was rough like velvet and his eyes were half closed, but not slumbering. It was as if the beast inside him had woken up. \u201cI never meant to embarrass you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled, a bit tightly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, listen to me, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes. Truly, it was rather fascinating\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhen things happen quickly, as when you took off your clothes, I can\u2019t think what to say. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI want you. Desperately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He was making her feel embarrassed now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good at talking.\u201d When he moved it was so sudden that she didn\u2019t even know what was happening until she felt the bedcover at her back, and he reared over her, gently pulling her bodice apart.</p><p>It occurred to her that she was supposed to squeal with fright but instead she arched her back so that he could pull off her sleeves. The muscles in his shoulder bunched as he gently untied her chemise and pulled it over her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do next?\u201d she asked. He seemed to know. He lowered his long body on top of her, balanced on his elbows.</p><p>Isidore gulped. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was kissing her, deep boneless kisses, the kind that made her wind her arms around his neck, and pull his body down onto hers.</p><p>Her hands slid down his back and onto his bottom, curved over warm muscles, slipped between his legs. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d His voice was pained. He arched his back. \u201cOh God, Isidore, that feels so good.\u201d</p><p>She started laughing and his mouth came down on hers with desperation. And then he pressed against her. It was extremely odd. Like a door opening, Isidore thought. First there was only herself, and then somehow there was room enough for him as well.</p><p>He made a rough sound, low in his throat and pressed deeper. Isidore waited for the pain that was supposed to come, but nothing happened.</p><p>Well, that was good.</p><p>He pulled back and then thrust forward again.</p><p>It felt good. It did. Well, perhaps it didn\u2019t feel that good. There was a little pulling feeling that she didn\u2019t care for all that much. Isidore tried to push away that disloyal thought. He was supposed to do whatever, and she could just do what she wished. And what she wished was to touch him.</p><p>Stroking his back felt like nothing she\u2019d experienced before. It was all rippling muscle, ridges and curves that moved under her fingers as he\u2014</p><p>He did that thrusting thing.</p><p>The truth was, she didn\u2019t really care for it all that much.</p><p>But he did. That was the wonderful thing about it\u2014there wasn\u2019t an ounce of composure about Simeon now, nothing of the controlled man. His face was alive with pleasure. She ran her hands over his cheekbones and he thrust forward so hard that she actually gasped and raised her knees.</p><p>Which felt better, for some reason.</p><p>He made another sound in his throat, as if he were dying, and that made her smile. \u201cIsidore,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you\u2014are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t control myself much longer.\u201d His voice sound dark and anguished.</p><p>No wonder women love bedroom activities. \u201cThat\u2019s just as it ought to be,\u201d she cooed. Every time she moved, he gasped, so she arched her back again. It felt better that way for her as well. If she moved, he lost control. Which was exactly what she wanted, Isidore thought. He pulled back and gripped her hips so hard that it was going to leave bruises, pulled her up and toward him. He was definitely out of control.</p><p>Simeon\u2019s head was roaring, his body rejoicing in a rhythm that he felt as if he\u2019d known for years. It was like a glorious race. It was pure physical joy. Isidore\u2019s body was soft, warm, wet\u2014</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait much longer. And yet it was like seeing the finish line and not wanting to reach it. He didn\u2019t want to come.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want\u2014</p><p>Pleasure was roaring in his legs, and Isidore was meeting him now, raising her hips in a way that made him want to bite her on the collarbone, act like a rampaging beast.</p><p>His vision was almost black by the time he let himself go, wild and fierce. He thrust forward, dimly hearing the bed frame pound the cottage wall, dimly sensing Isidore\u2019s little laugh, dimly\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was outside himself. The smell of Isidore and her curvy little body, her laugh, the sound of her voice, the way she touched him without fear and without shame, took him to another place.</p><p>He threw his head back and roared like a man who was never quiet, like a lion claiming his mate.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>The Dower House</p> <p>March 3, 1784</p><p>Simeon came back into his body very slowly. Valamksepa used to talk about a noncorporeal experience that fasting monks experienced. Simeon never thought it sounded like an appealing prospect, but he might have to rethink that na\u00efve supposition.</p><p>He was covered with sweat, panting as if he\u2019d had a long run, and happier than he\u2019d been in years. Isidore had her eyes closed, so he drank her in: the slightly exotic tilt of her eyes, her little nose, her creamy skin. She was exquisite. She was his. She was impulsive and infuriating and all too emotional, but she was his fate.</p><p>There are exquisite aspects to surrendering to one\u2019s fate.</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt, Isidore?\u201d he asked, suddenly remembering that she too had been a virgin, and rolling off her body.</p> <p>She opened her eyes. \u201cNo, not at all. Did it hurt for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but no one says that it ought to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not terribly uncomfortable,\u201d she said, coming up on her elbows and peering down her body.</p><p>He followed her eyes. She had the most curvy, creamy body that he could have imagined.</p><p>\u201cNo blood,\u201d she said relievedly, flopping back down again. \u201cA few bruises on my hips. So what did you think?\u201d</p><p>Simeon had never been very good at explaining things. How could he explain a rush of pleasure so acute that it felt as if his skin were alive, as if he knew her body as well as his own, as if he was seeing the world in color after being blind?</p> <p>\u201cI liked it,\u201d Isidore continued.</p><p>That was good. Simeon lay back because if he didn\u2019t stop looking at her, he would leap on top of her again. His rod stirred at the thought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something I would want to do every day,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut from what I hear, people don\u2019t do it all that often anyway.\u201d</p><p>Simeon turned his head.</p><p>She was looking at him, rather shyly. \u201cDo you mind that we consummated our marriage, Simeon?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sound as if Isidore had fallen out of herself while making love to him. In fact, now he thought about it...</p><p>Not that he knew much about women\u2019s bodies. He\u2019d always avoided salacious campfire talk. She didn\u2019t experience great pleasure.</p><p>That was entirely unacceptable.</p> <p>Likely she wouldn\u2019t wish to try making love again for a time. That too was unacceptable. He made a plan and implemented it, all in one second.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t very good,\u201d he said, propping himself up on an elbow, ignoring her question.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWe weren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to work on it. You shouldn\u2019t like to be a failure, would you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond as impulsively as he hoped. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cNor you either. What were you expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said, though he wasn\u2019t actually sure there could be anything more than what he\u2019d experienced. \u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re beginners,\u201d he added hastily.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that could be true,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cWhat do you think we did wrong? How did it feel for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort,\u201d he said, realizing that was true. \u201cSurely it should take longer than a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re\u2014\u201d She waved her hand.</p><p>\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s odd is that we were so intimate,\u201d Simeon said, realizing he really meant it. \u201cWe joined our bodies together, and yet I don\u2019t truly understand your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you understand it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, reaching out delicately, \u201chow does it feel to have breasts?\u201d</p><p>She started laughing, a delicious low gust of laughter. \u201cHow does it feel? Simeon, do you think that you\u2019re a normal man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like a logical question to me. I don\u2019t have anything of that nature standing out from my chest. Are you aware of them all the time? Do you know they\u2019re there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that your knees are there all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I use them. But those don\u2019t have any use. That is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they have use,\u201d she said, sitting up. \u201cI just don\u2019t have a baby to use them yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you nurse your own children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother nursed me,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cItalian gentlewomen nurse their own children. My mother believed that babies are less likely to survive if they\u2019re given to a wet nurse.\u201d</p><p>Simeon didn\u2019t want to talk about babies. \u201cI just thought,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthat women\u2019s breasts felt good. For example...\u201d He reached out his hand, realizing with a certain remote part of his brain that his fingers were trembling, and cupped the sweet heaviness of her breast. \u201cWhat does that feel like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goodness, it\u2019s strange to think that you can just touch me like that. No one touches me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m your husband now. In truth and in law.\u201d He let his thumb wander in a little caress.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does this feel?\u201d He rubbed his thumb over her nipple.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><p>He did it again. \u201cIsidore?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth but no words emerged. \u201cI have heard that women find this quite pleasant as well,\u201d Simeon said, feeling more cheerful. He bent his head and put his lips to her breast.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cSimeon, you\u2019re not a child and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips closed around her nipple. Children had nothing to do with the way desire coursed through his legs, through his heart.</p><p>Her hand fell from his shoulder onto the bed, boneless. He started suckling her, and her head fell back. Harder, and a muffled little sound hung in the air. His body was rigid, throbbing. But he was in control.</p><p>He pulled back. \u201cSee?\u201d he said, talking around the tightness in his throat, the groan that wanted to come out. \u201cWe\u2019re not there.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. They were a little dazed, sweet, unfocused.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d There was a tremor in her voice.</p><p>Simeon forced himself to roll away, sit up casually. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about each other\u2019s bodies,\u201d he said over his shoulder. If he looked at her any longer, he\u2019d leap on top of her. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice?\u201d Isidore\u2019s voice was husky and a little irritated. He loved it.</p><p>\u201cTonight, perhaps.\u201d He pulled on his shirt, still not looking. \u201cIf we feel like it.\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden motion and she was sitting up. But the next thing she said was a mile from the husky nymph he was imagining.</p><p>\u201cSimeon!\u201d A shrew would be proud of that squeal. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>He swung around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She was staring down at her legs. \u201cYou\u2014you peed on me!\u201d She swallowed. \u201cIn me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny blood?\u201d He bent over and peered interestedly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not blood.\u201d She hastily wiped off her leg, and jumped off the bed. A second later she had her chemise over her head. He\u2019d ripped it, so it fell open in the front, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pee. Didn\u2019t anyone tell you about bedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt forgot to mention this charming detail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little fluid, carrying my part of a baby.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her legs, now decently covered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you tonight,\u201d he said, pulling on his trousers.</p><p>\u201cShow me what?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHow my body works.\u201d</p> <p>In the back of his mind, he was thinking about the way she touched his body. Even now her eyes seemed to be drawn to his body, so he slowed his fingers, pulled his trousers up the curve of his arse slower than he needed to.</p><p>\u201cI can demonstrate without making love,\u201d he said casually, meeting her eyes when she finally looked up again. \u201cSince you didn\u2019t find it entirely pleasurable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did you,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll improve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he said, throwing his coat over his shoulder.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>The Dower House</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>Tonight? What did he mean by that? Isidore wasn\u2019t at all sure that she wanted to repeat bedding so soon. She felt slightly tender. And she felt odd. Disappointed, which was stupid. Besides, Godfrey was returning from his stay at the vicar\u2019s, which meant that there couldn\u2019t be any marital intimacy. Godfrey would be sleeping in the sitting room of Dower House. She didn\u2019t want anyone in Revels House until the Dead Watch were safely back in London.</p><p>She wandered out for a walk. It was the kind of day that pretends spring has come, even though it hasn\u2019t. The air smelled sweet, and the sun was shining. A blackthorn tree in the garden had already bloomed and was scattering seeds everywhere, like a child feeding birds in a dizzying circle.</p><p>Simeon would be a quite good husband. He was thoughtful and caring. His rueful little smile made her feel meltingly affectionate. He was so lovable when he wasn\u2019t in control, when he admitted that he wasn\u2019t sure what to do next. This afternoon was a perfect example. And he had admitted himself that the whole matrimonial experience wasn\u2019t quite all it could be. In fact, he was devastatingly attractive when he\u2014</p><p>She stopped. It would be easy to love a man who admitted his faults, who threw off his clothes when he realized that he\u2019d embarrassed her. When Simeon was spontaneous, he was irresistible.</p><p>Yet when she was spontaneous, it drove him to distraction. He shouted\u2014and then he kissed. In short, he lost control.</p> <p>\u201cGodfrey will be staying in the Dower House, of course,\u201d she told Honeydew on her return. \u201cI am convinced the air is unclean in the main house and he is a growing boy. Besides, we emptied his room of furniture,\u201d she added. \u201cHe can sleep in the sitting room.\u201d</p><p>Honeydew didn\u2019t react by so much as a twitch to the news that, apparently, the duke would be sleeping with his wife. Likely Simeon\u2019s eyes would narrow a bit when he heard how she was rearranging his life, but the Middle Way would stop him from making too much of an outcry.</p><p>Pah! That\u2019s what her father would have said. Take the left way, or the right way. The upper way, the lower way...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help grinning, thinking of his body. The lower way was likely something that no proper English gentleman would take. Yet even thinking about his body made her legs prickle and her breath feel short.</p><p>When he arched over her, his eyes grew smoky and dark. They looked almost anguished.</p><p>She started wondering again what he meant by showing her how his body worked. Worked? She knew how it worked. That part grew stiff.</p><p>His body was long and lean, like a man who could run twenty miles to save his beloved. Like a man who fought off ruffians without even dirtying his hands.</p><p>Yes, she would quite like to know how his body worked. The thought made her smile.</p><p>It was precisely the smile that irritated Simeon during supper. Isidore kept looking at him in a certain way, and before he could stop it, his blood would flare through his body and he would start shaking. Just a little, but still\u2014shaking.</p><p>Shaking!</p><p>The thought of the Middle Way came into his head and he actually pushed it away. It seemed irrelevant when he was with Isidore, with that bubbling joy in her eyes and the way her hair curled so sweetly, and the impudent little way she would glance at him...</p><p>He liked to think that every time she smiled that way, she was thinking about him. Intimately.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t right to contemplate control. Not when Isidore was thinking about something else.</p><p>Besides, it was taking all his control to keep a calm conversation going through dinner. Isidore wasn\u2019t wearing anything like the provocative gown that she wore the last time the three of them dined together. And he himself had put on breeches rather than his inappropriate trousers. The stockings didn\u2019t seem to bother him so much this time, probably a sign that he was turning into a proper Englishman. But no proper Englishman would be ravished by lust, the way he was. The only thing he wanted was Isidore, warm and sweet under him.</p><p>Honeydew poured lemonade for Godfrey. No wine, even though he threw Simeon an imploring glance.</p><p>Simeon found himself grinding his teeth.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t Godfrey have been housed in the barn? Did Isidore have to be so kind to his little brother? He had\u2014</p><p>He had plans for this evening.</p><p>He shifted in his seat. Surely this was just what Valamksepa talked about. Lust as a poison in the blood, a wild, insurgent storm carrying reason before it. He had no reason. He just wanted her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the Middle Way. God knows what kind of way it was. A bad way. He drank his wine and brooded about her breasts. The whole Middle Way concept ignored the fact that a man\u2019s blood went on fire around his wife.</p><p>And Isidore was his wife.</p><p>Surely...</p><p>No.</p><p>At the end of supper he rose, ready to go somewhere. He seemed to have no bed, so he would presumably be housed in the barn with Honeydew.</p><p>But then it became clear that Isidore had different ideas. The meal was over, and before he knew exactly what was happening, she was in front of him, like a little whirlwind of silk and the sweet smell of her skin, saying this, saying that. She put everyone in their place, ordered Honeydew around in the sweetest of ways, directed Godfrey into his bed and he, it seemed, was to accompany her on a stroll through the gardens.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely night,\u201d she said, smiling up at him. \u201cThe moon is out.\u201d</p><p>She had long eyelashes that curled upward so delicately that they distracted him. \u201cHmmm,\u201d he said, unable to formulate even a simple sentence.</p><p>A moment later they were strolling down a path. It was actually quite warm in an early spring sort of way.</p><p>\u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d Isidore asked. Her voice was bubbling, like a child at a party.</p><p>\u201cFor a walk?\u201d he suggested. His mind felt like marmalade. All he wanted to do was drag her behind a tree and cup his hands around her bottom. How could he have made love to her and not spent an hour on each breast? It felt as if those lost moments were mocking him now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something in her expression dimmed a little and he wrenched his mind away from her bodice. Cleared his throat. \u201cShall we visit the summer house?\u201d he asked, desperately.</p><p>\u201cA summer house! You have one?\u201d</p><p>He would do anything for that smile. The certainty of his vulnerability was so dangerous that he just walked beside her, silent as the grave. They walked toward the bottom of the formal gardens. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a folly than a true summer house,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>They rounded a last turn.</p> <p>\u201cAs you see.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be a ruin,\u201d he told her, deciding honesty was the best policy. \u201cAlthough I understand that ruins are becoming quite fashionable.\u201d He cocked his head and tried to see it through her eyes. A romantic heap of stone, supposedly a disintegrating medieval castle? Or what he saw: another of his father\u2019s imprudent failures, a building that was to be a proper summer house of stone, fallen to pieces after the builders were left unpaid?</p><p>Isidore walked ahead of him. She wasn\u2019t wearing panniers tonight, and her gown followed the curves of her own delectable hips.</p><p>\u201cHave you been inside?\u201d she said, turning and looking at him. He could barely focus on what she was saying over the roaring in his blood. She was his, and he had to have her, to own her, to touch her, to kiss her, to...</p> <p>She leaned back against the fragment of a stone wall and smiled at him. Was that an invitation? Who gave a damn?</p><p>With a muttered curse, he strode forward and picked her up, as smoothly as if he carried damsels on a regular basis. \u201cThe grass might be wet,\u201d he said, hearing the roughness of his own voice.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but she wasn\u2019t struggling to get away. She just nestled there in his arms, a curvy perfumed bundle. He rounded the building and headed straight for the broken arch. Where the courtyard was supposed to be...</p><p>Yes. Tiles gleamed faintly in the moonlight. Fallen walls protected them from view...not that anyone was out wandering his gardens at this hour of night.</p><p>He put her down and stripped off his coat. He still couldn\u2019t meet her eyes. She would be horrified if she knew what he was like, how mad in lust he was, mad enough to howl at the moon, to pounce on her like an animal.</p><p>\u201cSimeon?\u201d she asked. Her voice didn\u2019t sound frightened. It was husky and caught a little on his name. There was something about it that made his groin clench. And then she combed her fingers through her hair, almost shyly, and he broke, lunged at her and yanked her against him. If he\u2019d thought, he might have considered a gentleman\u2019s kiss, a sweet meeting of mouths that would tempt her into opening her lips...</p> <p>He ravaged her, took what he wanted, took her sweetness and the taste of her, the smell of her, the way her body swayed under his fingers when he kissed her, the way she murmured something, or perhaps moaned.</p><p>But in the back of his mind a voice was shouting for attention. He couldn\u2019t just\u2014he couldn\u2019t just do what\u2014</p><p>She was moaning, she was, just a little sound in the back of her throat but it was enough to make him mad. Surely he could just put her down\u2014</p><p>Gently, of course.</p><p>On the ground? Cold and damp?</p><p>His bad angel spoke up again, telling him that his coat was as good as a blanket. For a moment he managed to look down at Isidore with a modicum of logic.</p><p>Her eyes were dazed and she had her hand wrapped in his hair. She looked like a woman in the grip of desire. She would...</p><p>No.</p> <p>His good angel screamed so loud that even his most diabolic self shuddered. \u201cI promised,\u201d he said, and had to stop for a moment. She licked his lip, and it sent a stab of desire to his loins that could only be responded to in like manner. He had his hands around her again, lifting her slightly so that she fit snugly against him.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you how my body works,\u201d he said, pushing her away.</p><p>Isidore\u2019s mouth was slightly puffy, bruised. Her eyes were like shadowed wells. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, drifting toward him. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s just kiss.\u201d</p><p>He had to take charge. He had to be in control. He stepped back and ripped his shirt over his head.</p><p>There was an audible gasp and then a giggle. He risked looking at her.</p><p>\u201cSimeon! You\u2019re taking your clothing off\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and pulled off a boot, and the other boot. The stones felt cold under his stocking feet.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly see you!\u201d she protested. \u201cThe moon isn\u2019t that bright and\u2014\u201d Her eyes were large and shining. She could see him well enough. He could see every shadow and curve on her, every inch of skin he wanted to kiss and lick...</p><p>He pulled down his breeches, paused for a moment and pulled off his stockings as well. If you\u2019re going to be naked in the garden, you might as well be naked.</p><p>Then, finally, he met her eyes.</p><p>Her hair was tumbling around her shoulders, falling around her face in a way that made her look shy and retiring, like the girl he thought he wanted. Back when he didn\u2019t know anything. Isidore might look shy, but it was a trick of the moonlight; her eyes were ranging all over his body, pausing here and there, sticking at his midsection until he almost started to grin, but he stopped. Waited.</p><p>She needed to know him in order to want him, he had decided.</p><p>\u201cYou have so many muscles,\u201d she said finally. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I run.\u201d</p><p>She came closer until she was a fraction of an inch from his skin. It was incredibly erotic, standing there naked before her in the moonlight. She reached out a finger and touched his chest. Her touch burned and he had to clench his fists to stop himself from reaching out to her. She rocked back on her heels and he felt her touch leave him.</p><p>\u201cSo how does your body work?\u201d she whispered. But she wasn\u2019t looking in the right place any longer.</p><p>His erection was standing out from his body, straining in her direction. He wrapped his fingers around himself. Her eyes flickered, darkened he thought, though it was hard to tell in the moonlight. \u201cThis is designed for your body,\u201d he said. \u201cMan and woman are designed to fit together.\u201d He let his hand fall away.</p><p>Of course she was no timid miss. She wrapped her fingers around him and his head fell back. He caught a groan back at the last moment. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not hairy,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t have very much chest hair, do you, Simeon?\u201d</p><p>She loosed her grip and then just as he was about to answer, swept her fingers down the length of him. The words died and he couldn\u2019t stop the muffled sound in his throat. She liked that; he saw a gleam in her eyes.</p><p>And that was what he wanted, wasn\u2019t it? Wasn\u2019t it? Because she was experimenting now, holding him close, sliding\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he managed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, tightening her hand, sliding...And her other hand, it was\u2014</p><p>Fire raced up his thighs. He put his hands on her wrists and pulled them from his body, holding them for a moment before he let them drop.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She pouted and her lips were so plumply alluring that he forgot his plan and pulled her into his arms. She gasped and then fit herself to him perfectly, like parts of a piano coming together to make music. Like a violin reunited with its bow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said. His voice was guttural and not calm. Not soothing. Not in control. He didn\u2019t even care. She put her lips against his chest and gave him a little kiss, and another. The touch of her lips burned. He couldn\u2019t remember what the next phase of the plan was. But that part of his brain was still beating out the same reproach: gentlemen don\u2019t make love to their ladies out-of-doors. It\u2019s not proper. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not calm and collected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d he said, his voice catching because her hair against his cheek was as soft as spun silk and he just wanted to eat her.

But he couldn\u2019t join her in a game of Shakespearean quotes, not when his body was on fire.

Oh God, Isidore, if you keep doing that I am going to come.\u201d He leaned into the pillar at his back. The marble was chilly and gave him some sanity.</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d she breathed, swaying closer to him. Her hand was trapped between the silk of her skirts and the rough hair of his belly. But he didn\u2019t want to frighten her, to have her disgusted.</p><p>He pushed her back. \u201cJust watch, this time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were huge, excited. He managed to pull his thoughts back from his groin. \u201cIn order for us to be successful between the sheets, we have to understand what makes the other person feel pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She opened her lips but said nothing. Still, there was something in her eyes that made him keep going. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll ask you to show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you find pleasurable,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cMy body isn\u2019t nearly as interesting as yours, but there are points that\u2014\u201d He put a thumb over his own nipple. \u201cThis isn\u2019t as beautiful nor useful, but it feels pleasure.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth curled in a little smile that affected him much more than his own touch on his body. He moved his hand down, deliberately, slowly, wrapped his fingers around his length. Slid his hand. Took his pleasure from the way she shifted back and forth, as if she was feeling heat between her legs, as if she were remembering the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIt looks larger than it did earlier,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His body moved instinctively toward her, passionate to establish a rhythm that would satisfy and daze her, drive her to the pleasure he had felt.</p><p>\u201cSo when you lose control, what happens?\u201d</p><p>The question hung on the air. He cleared his throat. \u201cI eject fluid that contains my contribution to a future child.\u201d And: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe it as losing control.\u201d He let his hand fall away from his body.</p><p>She put her hand on him, and he instantly shuddered. The fire touched his spine, raced down his legs like a premonition of the future. \u201cIf I keep doing this\u2014\u201d she demonstrated\u2014\u201cwouldn\u2019t you lose control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But it was a gasp.</p><p>\u201cBecause you never lose control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d he drew in a breath\u2014\u201can accurate description.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dandled him, stroked him, fired him. \u201cAre you sure that I couldn\u2019t make you lose control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could give me the greatest pleasure,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I will give to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, lopsided, let her hand fall. \u201cWhat else feels good?\u201d He blinked. \u201cOnly those two parts of your body? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She was smiling again. \u201cCan I show you now what pleasures me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night and this place are too dark and cold for a lady,\u201d he said, pulling his shirt over his head. His body was thrumming to a rhythm of its own, madness flaring in his blood.</p><p>\u201cI thought our bed, perhaps...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Godfrey is in the sitting room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall have to be quiet,\u201d she said, turning to walk out of the courtyard. The moonlight caught her hair, turned it to darkened spun silver, precious liquid light chiseling the curve of her cheek, the plumpness of her bottom lip, the wry wit in her eye.</p><p>He was just pulling on his boots when she paused.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s a good thing that all of this doesn\u2019t mean losing control, Simeon, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause while I might be worried that I would make some sort of untoward noise and wake young Godfrey, I would never have to worry about you.\u201d</p><p>He followed her. Years in the desert had taught him a number of survival lessons.</p><p>One of them was never to ignore a gauntlet thrown at your very feet.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>The Dower House</p><p>March 3, 1784</p><p>Honeydew greeted them in the entryway to the Dower House, as if disheveled dukes were all in a day\u2019s work. \u201cYour Graces,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you would be so kind as to keep your voices down, the young master is asleep.\u201d</p><p>Isidore took off her wet pelisse and handed it to him. \u201cMy goodness, Honeydew,\u201d she said, \u201cyou must take yourself to your bed. It\u2019s begun raining again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere appears to be some small chance of flooding,\u201d Honeydew said.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cWe\u2019re on a hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bridge leading to the village,\u201d Honeydew clarified. \u201cI took the liberty of sending your lady\u2019s maid to temporary lodgings in the village; if the bridge went out, we\u2019d have to house everyone in the barn and Miss Lucille would not be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you staying in the village as well?\u201d Simeon asked.</p><p>\u201cI shall retire to the barn again tonight, Your Grace. We need to keep an eye on the silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man,\u201d Simeon said briefly. \u201cWe won\u2019t keep you.\u201d He closed the door behind his butler, thinking that Honeydew was a man he\u2019d always want at his back, whether on a camel or in an English country house. He was loyal and honest, through and through.</p><p>Isidore had vanished. Simeon poked his head into the sitting room. The fire was burning low, so he threw on a couple more logs and walked over to look at his brother. Godfrey was lying flat on his back. In the blurry firelight he looked unnervingly like their father. He even snored like their father.</p><p>Simeon listened to the noise for a few seconds and then began to grin.</p><p>The little bedchamber wasn\u2019t directly off the great room; there was a small passageway, almost a hallway leading to it.</p><p>He paused for a moment, wondering if husbands knocked at their wives\u2019 bedchambers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isidore heard him outside the door and her heart leapt so high it felt as if it were in her throat. What on earth was he doing? He wouldn\u2019t go to the barn with Honeydew, would he?</p><p>Would he?</p><p>She looked down at herself, reclining on the bed. \u201cCome in!\u201d she called.</p><p>The door opened and she saw him in the doorway. She gave him a moment, looking down at herself, trying to see her body through his eyes. She was plump in the right places, she thought, and sleek in others. She\u2019d lit candles, and the reflection of small flames darted over her skin, making her look like a marble statue, the naughty Roman kind. Her hair tumbled around her shoulders, and Isidore had arranged it so that one of her breasts showed and the other didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou may come in,\u201d she said, feeling a nervous giggle in the back of her throat.</p><p>He closed the door with great precision and then put his hands to his coat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn to learn about my body.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the bed. \u201cMay I sit with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He looked so large that he made her feel dizzy. He sat down in a chair and crossed his legs. The look on Simeon\u2019s face made him look younger than she\u2019d ever seen him. There was devilment in those eyes. You couldn\u2019t look like that when you were buried in a smelly old house, surrounded by bills.</p><p>\u201cI want you to pay very close attention to this lesson,\u201d she told him, propping herself up on one elbow.</p><p>He had to wrench his eyes away from her breasts, but he finally looked up. \u201cI do. I mean, I am.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help grinning. She sat up all the way. \u201cThese are my breasts.\u201d She actually never touched them very much. But his eyes made her bold. She let her hands curve around her breasts, sweet and firm, the way she would like to be touched. \u201cThis afternoon...\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>His eyes were wide and clear. \u201cNot right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands are very strong. I had bruises on my hips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d The look of desire disappeared from his eyes and he stopped looking at her breasts.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant!\u201d she said hastily. \u201cI liked it, but...I would like this even more.\u201d She smiled at him and, just like that, all the desire came back into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me if I\u2019m ever holding you too hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I need to practice.\u201d Without even seeming to move, he was sitting at her side. But he didn\u2019t touch her, just watched her hands, still holding her breasts.</p><p>Isidore felt a flush and she dropped her hands to the bed. \u201cSo lovely,\u201d he murmured. He reached out with just one fingertip and ran it over the curve of her breast. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d The finger trailed over pale pink, touched her nipple and she jumped.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop looking at his face. He was beautiful, not for a man, just beautiful. His eyes were fringed with thick lashes, still a little spiky from being in the rain. His cheeks were lean and he had the chin of a man who would always protect you, never leave you.</p> <p>She murmured something that even she couldn\u2019t hear and leaned into him so that his hand, his large callused hand, curled around her breast. His palm came hard against her nipple and made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cDoes that feel good?\u201d he asked. His voice had changed. It was deeper. Not tired or strained, the way it sounded when he was talking to Honeydew about the drains, or his mother about anything at all.</p><p>She nodded. He did something else with his thumb and she flinched back.</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, but I feel...\u201d She looked down. \u201cThey feel as if they\u2019re just too sensitive. It feels good, but then it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut first it feels good?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, loving the way his eyes were dark with desire, carefully thinking at the same time, watching her, learning. \u201cSo this is the time to learn about my body,\u201d she said almost chattily.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a man before you, but I\u2019ve thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you thought about, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be kissed, not just here.\u201d She put a finger to her lips, waited until his eyes followed her finger. \u201cBut here.\u201d She touched her shoulder, her neck, the curve of her breast, the side of her waist, the inside of her thigh. \u201cEverywhere,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>That was laughter in his eyes. It made her almost embarrassed\u2014except that embarrassment made her feel obstinate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be kissed everywhere,\u201d she repeated. Why not? It was beyond scandalous. But she was three-and-twenty, and she\u2019d heard stories. The stories about what men did\u2014sometimes, with some women.</p><p>She\u2019d always thought that those stories sounded like heaven.</p><p>From the smile curling Simeon\u2019s lips, he didn\u2019t think it was a terrible proposition.</p><p>\u201cGently,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Isidore blinked.</p><p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cNot very much.\u201d He flinched. \u201cBut you knew that,\u201d she said, puzzled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t enjoy it either. Remember, you told me that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in particular didn\u2019t you like?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI think I\u2019d prefer kisses to some touches. Your hands are very strong.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cKisses. Anything else you\u2019d like to show me?\u201d His eyes moved over her slowly, like a caress, and Isidore suddenly felt naked. Which she was. His finger slid down the pale skin of her stomach and paused, pulling out a little ringlet of hair. \u201cWhat about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very delicate area,\u201d Isidore managed. She felt as if she were getting a fever. His leg, clothed in fine woolen breeches, brushed against the naked skin of her leg; it was unbearably erotic. She reached out and wound her hands into his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my hair unpowdered,\u201d Simeon said, as if he were promising something.</p><p>But it was thick and silky under her fingers, strong as he was. It didn\u2019t smell like violet powder, but like that indefinable smell of clean male. \u201cI like it now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His mouth lowered to hers but hovered without touching her lips. That finger was still\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she whispered. The fever was spiking, focusing between her legs in an embarrassing way.</p><p>\u201cKissing,\u201d he said calmly, looking straight at her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it as pre-kissing.\u201d</p><p>Isidore couldn\u2019t even think, not with that finger touching her so sweetly. It was completely unlike the way he gripped her the previous night...She anchored her fingers in his hair and pulled his mouth to hers. \u201cKiss me!\u201d</p><p>He kissed her deep and soft, and at the same time, his fingers just kept wandering, kissing in their own way, a kind of finger kisses that made her shiver and feel a singing heat down her legs. He pulled his mouth free and licked her lip; to her embarrassment, Isidore\u2019s head fell back and a hoarse little sound came from her throat.</p><p>\u201cDoes that feel good?\u201d he whispered. He was kissing her jaw, and gave a little nip to her ear lobe, but frankly, Isidore wasn\u2019t paying much attention. It was what he was doing with his hand that was making her hips rise into the air and little moans fly from her mouth. Dimly she was aware that he was kissing all the parts that she had indicated. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t care anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She only realized that he\u2019d stopped kissing when his hand stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. Simeon didn\u2019t say that sort of endearment to her. Nor did he smile like that, a kind of wide, joyful smile like a child in a playground.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gripping me very tightly,\u201d he said, sparks of mischief in his eyes. \u201cI might have bruises on my arms.\u201d He moved his fingers again and she arched backward with a gasp.</p> <p>She showed her teeth in a warning. \u201cSimeon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough pre-kisses,\u201d he muttered. Before she knew what was happening, there was a warm wet tongue where one finger had been, and still his hand was there, filling her, making her shake all over until she finally dug her fingers into his arms and threw back her head and screamed.</p><p>Thirty seconds later she remembered where she was. \u201cGodfrey!\u201d</p><p>Simeon cocked an ear. \u201cStill snoring,\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>She fell backwards.</p> <p>\u201cNo thanks to you,\u201d Simeon added.</p><p>\u201cOh...my,\u201d Isidore said. Her body was slowly coming back to earth. The pleasure felt as if it were still trembling in her toes, singing in her fingertips.</p><p>Simeon stood up and started taking off his clothes. He was as methodical as she would have expected. He neatly aligned his boots by the wall. He took off his neckcloth and hung it over a chair.</p><p>If Isidore hadn\u2019t been feeling a kind of outrageous, limp pleasure, she would almost have been annoyed. But then she kept looking at his front, and she couldn\u2019t get annoyed. He wanted her, yet there was a part of Simeon that resisted chaos so strongly that he couldn\u2019t rip off his clothes and fall on her like a ravening wolf.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t strung as tightly as a drum. His eyes were glowing with a combination of controlled power and pure lust. Her body stopped being quite so limp and a prickling awareness overtook her.</p><p>Naked now, Simeon bent over to place his carefully folded breeches on the old rocking chair. The line of his flank gleamed golden in the firelight.</p> <p>So what if he were an example of control and methodical thinking? He was gorgeous, and he was hers.</p><p>She rolled over on her side and propped up her head with one hand, checking to make sure that her breasts were not flopping inelegantly. They looked quite delectable and round, thank goodness.</p><p>He stopped and put a log on the fire.</p><p>She bit back a smile. He was afraid. Making love didn\u2019t suit Simeon\u2019s wish to be in control. To be in charge. In fact, she would guess that the parts of it that she most enjoyed, he most disliked.</p><p>What she wanted was to see that look on his face again, the one which surrendered to the moment, to the pleasure, to her.</p><p>Simeon straightened from the fire, turned and started to sit down next to her, probably intending, gentlemanlike, to ask her what she would prefer. Or something like that.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Isidore said, putting her hand over his mouth before he could speak. She was getting feverish again. She pulled him and pushed him until he was lying flat on the bed. Of course, he was too much of a gentleman to resist, though she could see he didn\u2019t really like it. Simeon wanted to be in control. He felt too vulnerable, lying on his back.</p><p>She smiled at him, a sweet, dangerous smile. He was just where she wanted him. Then she reached out to touch him. He was hard, like a marble statue, but burning hot. Smooth and erotic. Made to stroke. He didn\u2019t move while she explored him, soothed him, coaxed him.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t even make a sound until her hand closed around him again and she made an experimental move\u2014</p><p>And then he uttered an odd strangled noise that made her head jerk back. But she knew, she knew that it wasn\u2019t pain, and her fingers curled even tighter.</p><p>Then she started all those pre-kisses he had perfected, using two hands instead of one. And she followed them directly with real kisses, dusting his golden skin with the press of her lips. When she reached his nipples, he surged up under her. She looked up to find his eyes wide, full of passion, with no thought of control or order. It was hard to smile and kiss at the same time, but the taste of his skin calmed her giddy pleasure, brought on another kind of wildness. She tasted him, bit him, sipping his skin and his smell. Of course he didn\u2019t scream, the way she did. But his breath came quickly, forcefully, especially the lower she went on his body.</p><p>And lower she went.</p><p>He tasted like soap, and felt soft and hard at once. He said \u201cNo, Isidore,\u201d seeming to wake up, so she put her lips around him.</p><p>He fell back then, surrendered, gave in. She played with him, teased him, loved him, until he suddenly surged from beneath her and flipped her over.</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d he growled. There wasn\u2019t a bit of control in his eyes, or his hands, or the way he was holding her hard, at the hips. She arched toward him, loving it. He lowered his head to her breast and she started to whimper, almost to scream, except he was\u2014</p><p>It felt different this time. She felt softer, welcoming, wetter. The largeness that had felt intrusive earlier felt delicious. She gasped and instinctively tightened around him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me to stop,\u201d he said, and the catch in his voice filled her with joy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she cried. \u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He thrust forward, and again, again, again, until she started to give little screams every time. His eyes flared and he smothered her pants with the taste and the shape of his mouth. She thought he was going to stop, but he didn\u2019t, he kept going, and going. Every stroke made the fire burn higher until she was breathing as hard as he was, moving with his body as if they were one.</p><p>Finally she tore her mouth away from his and flew free, shuddering against him, crying out and as if Simeon had waited for her, he surged forward, desperate, violent, free...</p><p>Then they sank together back onto the bed. It was different, it was all different. They were two bodies, and yet one body.</p><p>He rolled them to their sides. She slid her arm around him, still trembling a little, and didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>When a man like Simeon lost every vestige of restraint, it wasn\u2019t ladylike to show exuberance.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>The Dower House</p><p>March 4, 1784</p><p>The next evening</p><p>\u201cYou see, Princess Ayabdar is an extraordinary woman. She is the granddaughter both of the empress and of Ras Michael. And she married Powussen, the Governor of Begemder. I had the privilege of spending quite a good deal of time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Isidore asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was appointed a royal magician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI demonstrated that I could break through three shields with a mere tallow candle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?</p><p>\u201cI loaded my gun with powder and a farthing candle and it went through three leather shields. And I had a magic weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy virginity.\u201d He laughed at the look on her face.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were saving it just for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginity is a very useful thing. The fact that I was a virgin, attested to by my men, and more seriously, by a court magician who read it in my palm, meant that I was allowed to converse with the princess.\u201d</p><p>Isidore snorted. \u201cHow many other virgins did she have speaking to her?\u201d</p><p>Simeon leaned over and nipped her lip. \u201cI was the only one.

It was becoming embarrassing to be a virgin wife at twenty-three. You can\u2019t imagine how many men thought that was a tragedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was starting to think that I\u2019d never make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were days when I thought I couldn\u2019t bear it any longer,\u201d he confessed. \u201cInstead of a lion, some poor woman would find me leaping out at her from behind a bush.\u201d</p><p>Isidore started giggling. \u201cBut it turned you into a magician. Did you think about bedding this princess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t not think about it,\u201d he said, a little smile curling his lips. \u201cShe is so utterly brilliant: she can speak five or six languages, and quote Hindu poetry for hours.\u201d</p><p>Isidore decided she didn\u2019t like the princess. \u201cHindu? But she\u2019s Abyssinian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has sent men to India to bring poetry back, which she translates, preserving it for the pleasure of her people and their culture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmirable,\u201d Isidore said. She forced herself to relax. The princess was back there in the sand somewhere, living in a hut. She could afford to be generous.</p><p>\u201cAnd her palace,\u201d Simeon said dreamily. \u201cYou can hardly imagine, Isidore. It\u2019s made entirely of pink marble, and it looks over the banks of a huge rain plain. Sometimes the plain fills with white flowers, thousands and thousands of them. If there\u2019s rain, the plain forms a great blue mirror to the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds lovely,\u201d Isidore said, despite herself.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met a woman more intelligent. We argued for hours. She managed to change my mind about several ideas.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, to Simeon, changing his mind was practically an unheard-of experience. Isidore sighed and changed the subject. \u201cI am curved in all the places where you are straight,\u201d she said, caressing the line of Simeon\u2019s hip. Their arms brushed for a moment as he reached out to touch her as well.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop touching you,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking of you. The idea of returning to Revels House is inconceivable.\u201d</p><p>Isidore laughed and rolled on her back. \u201cNow that the odor is gone I feel much more inclined to consider the possibility. But meanwhile...\u201d</p><p>He accepted her invitation, of course.</p><p>It was an hour later. The sheets were rumpled, and Isidore was sweaty in places she\u2019d never considered before, like the backs of her knees. If she lay absolutely still, she could feel tiny quivers in the sweetest parts of her body. She felt like the air did after her aunt put down her violin, as if it were still singing, but in silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose it\u2019s like this for everyone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe poets sing of it,\u201d Simeon said lazily. He was lying on his back, one hand over his head, the other on her hip. \u201cThere\u2019s an ancient Sufi poet named Rumi...he spoke of desire as a sickness bringing joy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut this pleasure,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cIf it always feels this pleasurable, why don\u2019t people do it all the time?\u201d</p><p>Simeon stretched. \u201cI think we waited so long that we were like volcanoes waiting to explode. I know that sometimes bedding can be very, very unpleasant,\u201d Simeon said, turning over to face her. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky, you and I. Sometimes people just don\u2019t fit, as I understand it. There can be discomfort. Or one person might not find the other attractive.\u201d His sleepy smile said that wasn\u2019t a problem for him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a problem for Isidore either. Sometimes it felt as if her heart opened up when they made love. Love...</p><p>\u201cBut do you think it feels like this if the people aren\u2019t married?\u201d she asked, unable to bring the word love to her lips. Did she love him?</p><p>He laughed at that and she wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cYou are asking whether a wedding certificate increases pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid of me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Yet she felt somewhere deep inside her that he was missing the point. Though she wasn\u2019t sure what the point was.</p><p>\u201cWe do need to talk seriously, Isidore,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to have a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA plan for our marriage. Neither of us is precisely what the other envisioned as a spouse. We\u2019ll simply have to try to change. As much as we can. That way we won\u2019t find ourselves at odds. So if I hadn\u2019t been me, if you were able to pick any man in the ton, what kind of person would you like him to be?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cRed-haired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust we be serious?\u201d she moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s far into the middle of the night. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can sleep late in the morning. No one will dare wake us. It\u2019s important, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull herself together. \u201cSeriously? What sort of man would I have chosen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose the more proper question is how would he have differed from me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cI\u2019m not a fool. I\u2019m the man you\u2019ve got and I just made you very happy. I\u2019m not going to feel insulted if you wish I wore a cravat more frequently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that you mention it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not a wig,\u201d he said, alarmed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I could tolerate a wig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a little powder for important occasions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as going to Court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than going to Court. Balls in London. Places where your head would be the only unpowdered one in the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not a wig. I cannot wear those little rolls of snails over my ears. But I can powder. What else, Isidore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you look a bit more respectable?\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cYou are mine, which means that not all the ladies get to enjoy the image of you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d he said with a slow smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather they didn\u2019t have quite such a chance to see your legs in those short trousers of yours.\u201d</p><p>He looked alarmed. \u201cI can\u2019t stop running, Isidore. It\u2019s part of who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps in longer trousers?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really think of anything,\u201d Isidore said. The most delicious languor was stealing over her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told you my wishes for marriage yet.\u201d</p><p>Sleep was like a gorgeous warm blanket, hovering at the edge of her vision. \u201cUm...\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d Isidore struggled to wake up enough to remember what she just said.</p><p>\u201cYou said, whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmph.\u201d</p><p>Simeon pulled himself to a seated position. \u201cI had a great deal of time over the past years to analyze marriage. That\u2019s really why I thought we should probably annul our marriage, Isidore: we don\u2019t suit the pattern of successful spouses.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t?

According to English law, I am one of your possessions, just like a cow or a privy house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see? You don\u2019t really accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can hardly change the entire system of government in England. I\u2019ve always known that once you came home I would have a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cI have to know you respect my opinions, that you\u2019ll obey me without a moment\u2019s thought. Otherwise our marriage will never work.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat if you said, pour that cup of coffee over my hand\u2014and it was burning hot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I want coffee poured over my hand?\u201d He had a typically male, confused look on his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an illustration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPour it,\u201d he said decisively. \u201cIf I say such a thing, it means I\u2019ve lost my mind and returned to my second infancy. You\u2019ll have to teach me the way we teach children, by example.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhat if you command me to do something that I consider truly foolish? What if there is an obviously better way to handle the given situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She resisted the temptation to say, Because you\u2019re not God Almighty! And said, \u201cLet\u2019s just pretend that the situation arose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I make mistakes,\u201d he said, surprising her. \u201cThere was a time when I bought a vast number of red and green flowered beads to trade. I thought they were far more beautiful than the small sky-blue ones that the merchant in Jidda told me to buy. I thought he was trying to trick me. Once we had hauled those beads far into the deserts of Abyssinia, they were rejected by everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth did you bring beads with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were much easier than carrying food or water,\u201d he explained. \u201cI always carried a quantity of beads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney is local to a given district. But the female desire for beautiful things...universal.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cSo where are my sky-blue beads?\u201d she said, giggling.</p><p>He rolled over on top of her. \u201cSo will you listen to me if there\u2019s a dangerous situation?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cNot if you\u2019re choosing the wrong kind of beads. But I don\u2019t mind obeying you if you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to be the capo, to put it in Italian, or our marriage will be like a failed expedition. It will fall apart.\u201d</p><p>Isidore stopped herself from rolling her eyes. It was as if Simeon was haunted by the memory of wild beasts jumping at him. It might take a few years, but he would come to learn that the English countryside held no dangers she could think of. \u201cIn cases of danger...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we had a signal between us, and when I included the signal in something I said, then you obeyed me without a second thought?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAs long as you didn\u2019t abuse your privilege.\u201d</p><p>He was braced over her, on his elbows, his lips deliciously close to hers. Who could have thought that a large male body lying on top of hers could feel so good, against all reason?</p><p>He leaned down and brushed his lips with hers. \u201cIf I say, now, Isidore, you have to obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say now a hundred times a day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou would know the difference if I really meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanger,\u201d she prompted him. \u201cDanger, remember? I might not be listening all that closely to your tone of voice.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little wiggle to remind him about the other things he was getting with this marriage along with a bad-tempered Italian wife. Sure enough, his eyes glazed a little.</p><p>\u201cHow about something in a foreign language?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>His face cleared. \u201cIf I say, As your Baalomaal, Isidore, then you obey me without question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does Baalomaal mean?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>He leaned down again, a wicked smile in his eyes. \u201cAs the Lord of your Bedchamber, Isidore, I command that you kiss me now.\u201d</p><p>She drew his head down to hers. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d she said, as demurely as any husband could wish.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p><p>The Cricket and Song Inn</p><p>West of London</p><p>March 4, 1784</p><p>Jemma, the Duchess of Beaumont, allowed herself to be handed out of the carriage only to discover that there was an acre of mud covering the inn yard. She halted on the bottom step of her carriage and surveyed her groomsmen, trying to estimate their general strength. Unfortunately, the two standing at her carriage door looked suspiciously weedy. The last thing she wanted was to be dropped into the muck.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d came a drawling voice.</p><p>She jerked up her head to find that the only other carriage drawn up in the yard had just flung open its door, revealing the Duke of Villiers.</p><p>\u201cVilliers!\u201d she cried, \u201cDo tell me that you have a husky footman who can get me into that inn. I\u2019m feeling extreme trepidation, as I\u2019m sure my poor groomsmen are as well.\u201d</p><p>He stepped down into the mud as if it didn\u2019t exist. He was dressed exquisitely, of course. His cloak was a ruby red so dark that it seemed nearly black. Its capes lay over his shoulders with the sleek elegance that comes from the very finest wool.</p><p>Jemma couldn\u2019t help smiling at him. Villiers was so dramatic, and yet now that she had come to know him, his elegance and drama seemed to fade in relation to the rest of him. He walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t expect me to put down my cloak,\u201d he said in his usual drawl. \u201cI\u2019ve worn this only once, and I am inestimably fond of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cI expect you to lend me a strapping footman, Villiers! I must needs get to that inn. I\u2019ve been on the road for hours and I\u2019m famished. I set out yesterday from London, if you can believe it. We lost a wheel, and I had to spend the night a mere hour from the city.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arms. \u201cCome, then.\u201d</p><p>Jemma froze. \u201cYou\u2019re convalescing.\u201d</p><p>He scooped her off the step as if she were no more than a girl of five. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better. Of course, it could be that I\u2019ve miscalculated my abilities.\u201d His steps slowed. \u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She shrieked as his hands suddenly gave a little and she dipped toward the ground. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right then,\u201d he said. There was a dark strain of laughter in his tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re evil,\u201d she accused him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not the first to tell me so,\u201d he said comfortably, putting her down within the door of the inn.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jemma said, shaking out her skirts. \u201cI do thank you, Villiers. Naturally I would have preferred to walk on that cloak of yours, but I\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA sensible notion. Life is, alas, full of compromises.\u201d</p><p>Jemma felt a bit strange about the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cYour Graces,\u201d the innkeeper was gobbling, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I have no private rooms at the moment. The south chimney has collapsed.\u201d</p><p>Villiers turned his cold eyes on the innkeeper and a moment later it transpired that the public room had no other customers, and the innkeeper would take it upon himself to keep out any who might appear.</p><p>\u201cUntil the duchess has had some tea,\u201d Villiers said gently.</p><p>Jemma felt so oddly unbalanced that she found herself chattering as they walked into the room, telling him that she was on her way to pay a visit to his one-time fianc\u00e9e. \u201cRoberta\u2019s father, the Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury, is marrying a mermaid he met at a public fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy joy at the dissolution of that engagement deepens by the moment,\u201d Villiers said languidly. \u201cDoes the mermaid come with piscine accoutrements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI believe she straps on a tail and speaks in verse for a few shillings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what one wants in a mother-in-law. Yes, I truly made a lucky escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like some tea, please,\u201d Jemma told the innkeeper. \u201cAnd something to eat as well, if you would be so kind.\u201d She had a strange uncertainty in her stomach, and it was always best to eat in those circumstances. \u201cHow odd that we should meet at the same inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off to pay the Duke of Cosway a visit, as I told you I would,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>The innkeeper put down a tea tray and she busied herself with pouring. It was rather awkward to find herself in an inn with Villiers. Why, it was almost like an assignation, though of course it wasn\u2019t. Would Elijah believe that, though?</p><p>It was entirely surprising how strongly she wanted to believe that Elijah would not think it an assignation. An affaire.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you and I have both been summoned to the side of errant people of our rank may be tedious,\u201d Villiers pointed out, \u201cbut entirely unsurprising. To whom could they turn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnyone,\u201d Jemma said, wishing that she had paid no attention to that letter from Roberta.</p><p>There was a great commotion in the innyard. \u201cThe innkeeper said that he would keep this room\u2014\u201d Jemma began, but before she could finish the sentence the door swept open. She looked up to find the Marquise de Perthuis, dressed in a black travelling gown badly splashed with mud at the hem.</p><p>\u201cWhat a remarkable pleasure,\u201d the marquise said, strolling forward. \u201cMy carriage has been stuck in the mud for an hour, and I was feeling miserably tedious. What a delight, an absolute delight, it is to find you here, my darling duchess!\u201d</p><p>Jemma ground her teeth and swept into a curtsy that was just a shade on the disrespectful side.</p><p>\u201cAlong with the Duke of Villiers,\u201d the marquise trilled. \u201cWhat extraordinary luck to find that we are all stranded at the same time.\u201d</p><p>The worst thing Jemma could do would be to emphasize the truth of that account. No one would believe that she and Villiers had found themselves at the same inn by mere happenstance. So with a nicely calculated twist of indifference, she said, \u201cNot so strange, after all. After all, we are surely all going to the same event?\u201d</p><p>The marquise\u2019s face stilled. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, but now her smile had a drop of ice to it.</p><p>Jemma paused just long enough to indicate a touch of embarrassment that the marquise was without an invitation. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, of course,\u201d she said, just hastily enough. \u201cI\u2019m quite certain now I think of it that the ceremony was to be a very small one. Didn\u2019t the Duke of Cosway say as much to you, Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo small as to be infinitesimal,\u201d Villiers drawled, which was really quite wrong of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat ceremony is in question?\u201d the marquise said, accepting a cup of tea. She had lost the delighted glow she had when she walked in and found them together, and Jemma\u2019s stomach relaxed. It was better for the marquise to feel unpopular, than for her to be overjoyed by the discovery of Jemma\u2019s supposed affaire with Villiers.</p><p>\u201cOh, a wedding,\u201d Villiers sighed. \u201cCosway\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>The marquise knit her brow. \u201cDear me. I am so ignorant about the English...who is this Cosway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it was Henry VIII who elevated the Earl of Cosway to the rank of duke, did he not?\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>Jemma never paid any attention to that sort of thing. \u201cThe current Cosway was wed by proxy. He has now returned from years travelling abroad and plans to re-consecrate the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me, how peculiar,\u201d the marquise observed. \u201cIn my experience men are so very willing to break the marital bonds, rather than renew them.\u201d</p><p>There was something bleak in her eyes. \u201cWhom are you visiting, Madame la Marquise?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>The marquise fiddled with her sugar spoon, and Jemma wished she hadn\u2019t asked. Then she shrugged, a little, helpless shrug. \u201cI am the fool everyone thinks I am,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cI heard that perhaps my Henri is to be found in Lincolnshire and I travel there to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Marquis de Perthuis?\u201d Villiers said. \u201cIn Lincolnshire...the wilds of the British countryside? Surely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps no,\u201d the marquise said, putting another spoonful of sugar in her cup, although it was already, by Jemma\u2019s reckoning, sickeningly sweet. \u201cI cannot sit about London and be pitied.\u201d Her voice was calm but her eyes weren\u2019t.</p><p>Villiers met Jemma\u2019s eyes over the tea tray and she read in his the pity she felt. In Villiers\u2019s eyes! Was that possible? The duke was known for his cruel indifference.</p><p>The marquise stirred and stirred her thickened brew of tea, as the three of them sat in silence and stared at her spoon. Then she raised her head and looked to Jemma. \u201cWould you do it again?\u201d she asked. \u201cYour marriage, if I remember correctly, was arranged for you. If you were given the choice, would you marry your duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jemma said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re a fool in love,\u201d the marquise said bitterly. \u201cAs was I. They say\u2014\u201d her voice was savage\u2014\u201cthat it\u2019s better to have loved once and lost, than never loved at all. They are wrong.

The marriage was arranged in his youth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I have children, I shall establish all their marriages at an early age,\u201d the marquise said, still stirring. \u201cI shall choose their spouses on the basis of ethical worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so sure that Cosway is not in love, Villiers?\u201d Jemma put in. \u201cI had a letter from his wife-to-be that suggested otherwise, if one read between the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this wife?\u201d the marquise asked. \u201cHas she ever travelled to France?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe lived in Paris for some years. Lady Del\u2019Fino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d The tea stirred faster. \u201cHenri took some pleasure in her company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs does every man,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYet Isidore has waited patiently for her duke to return from his excursions about various continents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never heard otherwise,\u201d the marquise allowed.</p><p>\u201cCosway is not in love,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cIn fact, I believe there may be a question about whether he will go through with the wedding.\u201d The marquise put down her spoon, and sadness fled her eyes immediately. \u201cThe marriage is, of course, unconsummated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d the marquise breathed.</p><p>\u201cThough I tell you this in the strictest confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>Villiers leaned toward the marquise. \u201cI really mean that, Louise.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked in surprise, but Louise\u2014the marquise\u2014merely rapped him on the hand with her spoon. \u201cI beg you to tell me the details, Villiers. I am quite languishing for something interesting to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d Villiers said, sitting back. \u201cYou must practice putting your husband out of your mind, my dear marquise.\u201d</p> <p>My dear marquise? Louise? Jemma couldn\u2019t remember ever hearing a shred of gossip to do with the Marquise de Perthuis and the Duke of Villiers.</p><p>The marquise started giggling. \u201cDo you know what I thought when I entered the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only the duchess would grant me an indiscretion,\u201d Villiers said with a comic emphasis. But there was something serious in his voice, and the marquise\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThe dear Marquise de Perthuis is my second cousin twice removed,\u201d Villiers said, turning to Jemma. \u201cWe were thrown together on more than one occasion as children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly children,\u201d the marquise said, shrugging. \u201cInfants more like. My mother never let me near him after I reached a certain age.\u201d She smiled, and Jemma realized that she was likely quite beautiful when happy.</p><p>\u201cBase rumors,\u201d Villiers said tranquilly. \u201cMay I trouble you to pour me another cup of tea, duchess?\u2019</p><p>\u201cRumors!\u201d the marquise said, chortling. \u201cSince we are so very intimate, my dears...you were rumored to have a by-blow at the tender age of eighteen, Villiers. It cannot be so many years ago that you have quite forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRank gossip,\u201d Villier replied.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when you had this child?\u201d Jemma asked curiously. It fascinated her, the way men sprinkled illegitimate children around the countryside.</p> <p>\u201cSomething over two-and-twenty. A distasteful subject, and redolent of my many youthful stupidities,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cPlease, may we speak of other subjects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cYou can tell me why the Duke of Cosway wishes to dissolve his marriage. After all, Lady Del\u2019Fino is quite lovely. I cannot conceive of the man who would not wish to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that Isidore wishes to marry Cosway either,\u201d Jemma said, feeling that she should defend her side of the conundrum. \u201cHe picked up some disagreeable habits while living abroad.\u201d</p><p>The marquise wrinkled her nose. \u201cDid he lose the inclination to bathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he trots around the countryside in a pair of short trousers,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cand no stockings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he display himself for a reason?\u201d the marquise enquired.</p><p>\u201cI believe he considers himself to be taking something of a constitutional,\u201d Jemma explained.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to seeing it,\u201d Villiers put in.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate, Cosway is being a fool. Of course he must consummate his marriage,\u201d Jemma said. Her tea was cold and she put her cup down untouched.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Villiers replied. \u201cIf he feels no touch of partiality for the lady\u2014and he has suggested to me that he does not\u2014then it would be better for both of them if they seized the opportunity to dissolve their union, such as it is.\u201d</p><p>The marquise opened her mouth to say something and thought better of it.</p><p>\u201cHe has no right to talk of love and such foolishnesses,\u201d Jemma said, rather more vehemently than she intended. \u201cHe agreed to marry her years ago. She waited for him and very kindly did not create a scandal. He has no right to back out of the agreement now. None!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would not be the most honorable thing to do,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cBut honor is not always the best criterion by which to judge a lifetime\u2019s worth of happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does not honor his wife,\u201d the marquise interjected, \u201cthe marriage will not be a happy one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps marriage is not meant to be a happy state,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWhen did we all become so foolishly emotional, so childish in our thinking? Cosway has an obligation to marry Isidore and follow through with his promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not as if Lady Del\u2019Fino will lack for a spouse,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cShe is both beautiful and rich. She will not be left at the wayside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is hardly the point,\u201d Jemma snapped. \u201cWill she be a duchess? Will she regain the years that she spent waiting for him to return from his explorations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree absolutely,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cAn arranged marriage, in which neither member feels an embarrassing excess of emotion, is a thing of beauty. Never will Cosway feel anxiety about her whereabouts. Or vice versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were in love with Henri, Louise,\u201d Villiers said, going on the attack. \u201cI remember your wedding, and you were every inch the enchanted\u2014and enchanting\u2014bride. Would you tell Cosway that he has no right to that joy?\u201d</p><p>Jemma met Louise\u2019s eyes over the table in perfect agreement. Never having married, Villiers had no idea what he was talking about. \u201cWe must wait until Villiers marries,\u201d Jemma said to the marquise, ignoring his na\u00efve question entirely.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the marquise replied, her smile widening. \u201cA perfect revenge! Perhaps there will be someone at Cosway\u2019s wedding, if it takes place. My cousin will fall helplessly in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, alack, she must wait for me,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>Jemma raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI just remembered an appointment in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow peculiar of you, Villiers,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou remembered this appointment just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is afraid,\u201d the marquise said, stirring her tea. \u201cAfraid he\u2019ll be overcome by sentiment during this touching reconsecration and end up married himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that it would take more than an idle threat to frighten the duke,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cDo tell, Villiers.

And Villiers found that intolerable. It was foolishly emotional, and yet he was helpless to dismiss the feeling. Elijah would not die alone, not as long as his oldest friend could prevent it.</p><p>\u201cNothing earth-shaking,\u201d he said, putting his spoon precisely by his cup. \u201cNothing more than a game of chess promised to your husband, m\u2019dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Elijah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning back to London and ignoring the missive sent to you by the Duke of Cosway for fear of missing a game of chess with my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I have known Beaumont nearly all the years of my life, and Cosway a mere dozen or so. I had no idea that you too were travelling and that Beaumont is alone. It behooves me to keep my appointments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because the two of you were estranged for so long?\u201d Jemma asked. She turned to the marquise. \u201cI think it is hardly a secret; my husband and Villiers were boyhood friends and then fell out over some foolishness when they were striplings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a dog,\u201d Villiers explained.</p> <p>\u201cExactly! The stupidity of men never ceases to amaze me,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAt any rate, they have only recently mended their fences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Villiers drawled, \u201cI should hate to insult him in any fashion. Such a touchy fellow, your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah? Nonsense! I don\u2019t believe this tarradiddle, Villiers, not for a moment. There must be something else...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers remembered the sudden appointment after my question about his children,\u201d the marquise said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing there to make me return to London,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAlthough...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cOut with it! What of those poor misbegotten children of yours, Villiers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promised a young woman who nursed me during my illness that I would take a more fatherly role than merely pay for their maintenance,\u201d Villiers said, offering up the story as bait to distract Jemma.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cShe must have been a Puritan. What on earth did she expect you to do? Raise them yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d Villiers said, taking a final sip of his tea, \u201cthat she meant just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ill-bred notion,\u201d the marquise said flatly. \u201cWere you to take your bastards under your own roof, Villiers, you would have the greatest difficulty fixing an alliance with a respectable woman.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with a little smile in his eyes. \u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re challenging him,\u201d Jemma said, laughing a bit. \u201cDo go ahead, Villiers. Start your own orphanage and then announce your candidacy for marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose of the highest blood can be remarkably vulgar,\u201d the marquise said, in a tone that suggested she was thinking of her own spouse.</p><p>\u201cI suppose my vulgarity is evidenced by the existence of the children themselves,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cBut I am giving serious thought to the question. An excessive regard for public opinion is not congenial to my sense of self.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturally the children must be well cared for,\u201d the marquise said. \u201cIf they were not, it would be morally reprehensible on your part. But I see no duty that requires you to admit children of a base union to your own household.\u201d</p><p>Villiers merely smiled.</p><p>\u201cI must be on my way,\u201d the marquise said, coming to her feet. \u201cI hope to make at least four hours in my journey before evening.\u201d</p><p>They parted at the door, the innkeeper having cleverly placed wooden rondels as stepping stones to the three carriages.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for my boots,\u201d Villiers said. He waited until the marquise was climbing into her carriage, and then leaned close to Jemma. \u201cAnd I am sorry about that wooden pathway for other reasons as well.\u201d</p><p>His breath stirred the hair at her ear and he saw her turn faintly pink.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d she said, turning away. \u201cDo give my best to Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI shall.\u201d</p><p>He watched her all the way to her carriage door, but she didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 5, 1784</p><p>The house\u2019s lack of odor was almost miraculous. Simeon walked through the front door taking deep breaths, and even opened the door to the downstairs water closet. The pit didn\u2019t smell.</p><p>\u201cAre the Dead Watch gone?\u201d Simeon asked Mr. Merkin, who was pointing out the sparkling nature of said pit. \u201cI gather that Mr. Bartlebee is walking again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a lesson to him,\u201d Mr. Merkin said. As he would tell his wife later, it was none of his business how a duke of the realm protects his own property. \u201cNow I\u2019ve made a very pleasant discovery, Yer Grace.\u201d</p><p>Simeon raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThe way your river runs down there,\u201d Mr. Merkin explained, \u201cI believe that we can simply divert a portion of it to flow continuously through the central pit. Revels House will have a drainage system like no other! Nary an odor, even on the rainiest of days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will the flow emerge?\u201d Simeon asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll dig a pit on the far side of the hill. In ten years, that will be the most fertile land in the duchy,\u201d Mr. Merkin said, pulling down his waistcoat. \u201cWe\u2019re replacing the rotten pipes with the very best, but I know that you and the duchess are of one mind on this, Yer Grace. Spare no expense, the duchess said to me. It may take a bit of an outlay, but this house will be odiferously pure!\u201d</p><p>An odd phrasing, but Simeon understood exactly what he meant.</p><p>Honeydew walked into the study with a stack of Simeon\u2019s papers, a footman at his heels with more papers. But Simeon froze on the threshold. The room had no furniture other than half-filled bookshelves. Honeydew was arranging stacks of bills and letters in neat piles on the empty shelves.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my books?\u201d he said, hearing the sharpness in his own voice. \u201cWhere is my father\u2019s desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duchess had me send the desk straight to London the day you moved to the Dower House,\u201d Honeydew said. \u201cWe are expecting all the furniture back in a matter of days. The duchess was quite right, and an offer of double payment in ready money has effected miracles.\u201d</p><p>Simeon digested that. \u201cThe books? Have they gone to London as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the ones which were falling to pieces,\u201d Honeydew said. He pointed to the ceiling. Simeon looked up and saw a dingy stain that stretched from one corner over approximately a third of the room. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that when the water closet pipes leaked, they inundated the study, causing the rot of a number of books. On the duchess\u2019s instructions\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simeon cut him off. \u201cI see.\u201d He felt that familiar swell of anger against his father. Some of those books were among the first books printed in England. He remembered an edition of John Donne\u2019s poems signed by the poet himself...likely merely a moldering heap of pages now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe duchess believes that the books can be restored,\u201d Honeydew said. The consolation in his tone just made Simeon more irritated.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>A footman appeared with the small desk from the Dower House and placed it precisely in the middle of the echoing study. Honeydew immediately lifted a pile of papers from the bookshelf and moved it to the desk. \u201cThere, Your Grace,\u201d he said soothingly. \u201cPeters will fetch a chair and you\u2019ll be as comfortable as can be. At least that odor\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>The demise of the odor had obviously made Honeydew giddy with pleasure.</p> <p>When the chair appeared, Simeon took a seat and began looking over the letters delivered the previous day. Four new bills had arrived, for various expenses incurred by the duchy in the last ten years, along with a letter from another woman who had apparently been promised riches by his father in exchange for access to her bed.</p><p>Why did his father bother making huge promises to women, promises he obviously never meant to keep? There was something pitiful about the pattern of it. Invariably his father swore that he had fallen in love at first sight. Then he promised to support his \u201cbeloved\u201d for the rest of her life, generally offering a small cottage as well as a cash payment. After, one must assume, enjoying himself, he would return home, thereafter ignoring all future communication.</p><p>It didn\u2019t sit well with Simeon. The truth of it soured in his stomach and made him...irritable.</p><p>Honeydew appeared at the door. \u201cMr. Pegg would like to see you, Your Grace. Mr. Pegg is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cI already directed that he should be paid for his smithy work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is here about the cemetery,\u201d Honeydew said. He advanced somewhat into the room, lowering his voice. \u201cHer Grace seems to have effected a somewhat miraculous transformation in Mr. Pegg. He\u2019s acting as the mayor of the village. The kitchen staff reported last night that on discovering that Mr. Mopser had been charging double to villagers living by the river, Pegg stormed into the shop and forced a promise that the practice would stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow him in,\u201d Simeon said.</p><p>Pegg looked sand-beaten, like a man who\u2019d been driving a camel caravan for far too long. But his back was straight, and the spark in his eye was honest. Simeon got up and came around the table. Isidore was obviously a good judge of character.</p><p>He felt less magnanimous toward his wife by a quarter of an hour later. Some repairs Pegg itemized for the village were acceptable: a widow needed a new roof, the church needed a new privy, etc. The village green was to be opened for use by the villagers, and six fowl provided to each cottage. Likewise, villagers were to be allowed to hunt rabbits and small fowl in the duke\u2019s forest, without risking arrest from the gamekeeper. Not that there was a gamekeeper; his father dismissed him several years ago.</p><p>But two hundred pounds to refurbish the cemetery? And another two hundred pounds to be given to Henry Wissner, thatcher, as a fee for accepting Martin Smith as an apprentice? Three hundreds pounds for John Phillipson and Christopher Sumerall to oversee the construction of a new spire for the village church?</p><p>He and Pegg argued a bit, jostling back and forth over the steeple and the cemetery. At the end of another half hour they were both satisfied. Admittedly, Isidore had chosen well. Pegg cared for the village and its people. He would keep Mopser\u2019s conniving nature under control. Simeon just wished that Isidore had consulted with him beforehand. Not that he would have disagreed with her, but...</p> <p>It was perhaps unfortunate that the next visitor Honeydew ushered into the study was another stranger. \u201cMonsieur Antoine-Joseph Peyre,\u201d Honeydew announced.</p><p>Simeon had perfected a sympathetic smile, meant to defuse the frustration of those presenting bills older than their children. But Monsieur Peyre did not present himself with the abject mien of the duchy\u2019s many creditors. He bowed with the poise of a man who enjoyed perfect self-confidence. He was attired in a coat of flaring orange, adorned with large buttons and embroidered with fleur-de-lis in silver thread. On straightening up, he pulled a small scent flacon from his pocket and sniffed loudly.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Peyre,\u201d Simeon said, bowing. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d</p><p>Peyre lowered his eyes from the frieze-work surrounding the study and said, \u201cThe question, Your Grace, is not how you can help me, but how I can help you!\u201d Without further ado, he began to stroll about the room, his open perfume bottle trailing a potent scent of flowers.</p><p>Simeon waited, suppressing a grin. Monsieur Peyre resembled nothing so much as a bright orange rooster, proud of his plumage and certain that his crowing alone made the sun rise. He felt rather less amused when it transpired that Peyre had arrived with nine plaster-workers in tow and fully expected to be working in Revels House for at least ten days, if not longer.</p><p>\u201cIt depends, of course, on how elaborate you would like the walls,\u201d Peyre said airily. \u201cIn the duchess\u2019s abode in Venice, the formal rooms are covered with a perfect fantasy of gilded plants, blossoms, and the like. It is\u2014\u201d he kissed his fingertips\u2014\u201cexquisite! But here we are in the English countryside, and one does not feel the same exuberance, the same delightful sparkle. I think perhaps a more classical look might suit. I see this room with pale panels...\u201d</p><p>While Monsieur Peyre rattled on, Simeon brooded about Isidore summoning plaster-workers to redo his house without mentioning the fact to him.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Peyre announced, \u201cI do not find an objectionable smell here.\u201d</p> <p>Simeon turned around to find that Peyre was recorking his little flacon of perfume. The bottle was surrounded by an absurdly elaborate golden cage worked with enamel flowers.</p><p>\u201cThe water closets have been repaired,\u201d Simeon explained.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess\u2019s missive warned me to be prepared for an odor,\u201d Peyre said with a shudder. \u201cI contemplated refusing her invitation. But\u2014\u201d he opened his eyes very wide\u2014\u201cwho can refuse Her Grace anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Simeon said. Then he heard an echo of his mother\u2019s sour tone in that word and softened it with a smile. \u201cPlease continue as you see fit, Monsieur Peyre. We have the utmost trust in your judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Monsieur Peyre said. \u201cNaturally!\u201d But he was pleased.</p><p>He left in a cloud of perfume, and Simeon turned to sit down at his desk, paused, and looked through the window at the garden. He had left Isidore in the Dower House. A good proponent of the Middle Way would surrender his anger, perhaps running an extra mile or two. He would center himself in the universe, remember that anger is a force for evil and that the waters of the ages washed against the pebbles of eternity.</p><p>Simeon strode out the door and into the ballroom. Monsieur Peyre was in the center of a cluster of men, pointing to the frieze-work at the top of the room. He caught just a word or two, in French. The place would probably end up looking like Versailles, he thought.</p><p>He left through the ballroom door and headed for the Dower House. He would merely request that his wife consult with him before making large decisions to do with the house. Of course, he would remain civil. He would avoid anything akin to an argument.</p><p>Those predictions might have come true, if Simeon hadn\u2019t been so angry. \u201cThe problem,\u201d he said painstakingly, \u201cis that you never think before you act.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent away all our furniture, never thinking where my mother would eat her nightly meal. You bought bolts of cloth from the village thief and paid him a small fortune to deliver them. You anointed a bad-tempered smith as the mayor. You nearly instigated a robbery and assault on my mother because you couldn\u2019t wait five minutes for me to finish my letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are irresponsible and heedless in your actions toward others,\u201d he said steadily. \u201cYou are used to getting your way in all things\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo are you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, you have constantly forced my hand.\u201d She looked a bit white, and more than a bit angry, he noticed dispassionately. \u201cI dislike having a wife who has no respect for my opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a different matter,\u201d she said, cutting across his voice like a knife across butter. \u201cYou may disparage me for acting as you see it, without foresight. It may be simply that I think faster than you do. After all, my bolts of cloth managed to salvage relations with the village. My anointing of a mayor assuaged a man who hated your father due to the deaths of his wife and baby.\u201d</p><p>Simeon narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no medical help in this village,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I need not detail the reasons for the village\u2019s impoverishment. The smith drove to the next town to beg for help from the surgeon; by the time he returned, his pregnant wife was dead. You may think that my methods are unorthodox, but they are effective.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to make those decisions,\u201d Simeon said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cAnd your wife has what role in your life?\u201d Her face was now utterly white, and Simeon knew that he was seeing Isidore at her most furious.</p><p>His wife had always been an illusory, shadowy creature, the docile sweetheart whom his mother had created in letters, the lass who sat in the corner of the room weaving lace as delicate as moonbeams. That maiden wouldn\u2019t want to make decisions. She chose to sit in the corner of the room and be as fascinating as dirt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI do. You want your wife to be nothing more than a child who listens without question to your every word. In fact, I think it would be better if your wife didn\u2019t even speak your language. I can\u2019t imagine why you didn\u2019t marry some foreign lady you encountered in Abyssinia, perhaps the princess you told me about.\u201d</p><p>He felt his face freeze, just for a second, but Isidore was smarter than any woman he\u2019d met, smarter by far than the princess, for all that lady\u2019s ability with languages. She actually laughed. \u201cYou did! You thought about marrying a woman who didn\u2019t even speak your language. That\u2019s just perfect. She could sit in the corner translating poems, while you rampaged about making all sorts of asinine decisions. Luckily she would never question you because she wouldn\u2019t even understand what you were doing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think that I make asinine decisions?\u201d he enquired.</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cHave I put you in harm\u2019s way?\u201d he said mildly. \u201cTaken the furniture out from underneath you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me into some sort of silenced African princess, and you\u2019re asking me if I think you make asinine decisions?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was clear. Simeon thought he\u2019d heard enough. His jaw tightened, but before he could say a word, she took a deep breath. \u201cThis marriage will never work. Never.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth again, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cI thought if I could help you, that you would grow to like having me as a partner,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a fool I was! It matters to me to be with a man who respects my opinions, who actually wants to be with me, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simeon met her eyes. \u201cI do like you, Isidore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I really wish I believed you. Alternatively, I wish that it didn\u2019t matter to me. But it does. Somewhere in these last ten years we spent apart when we should have been married, I kept thinking about whether I\u2019d like you, but I never considered you not liking me, who I am. I suppose it was vanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She went on without even hearing him. \u201cIt\u2019s probably my fault. Maybe I would have been more docile when I was sixteen. But it\u2019s too late now. I can\u2019t stop being a person just because you want a wife who doesn\u2019t speak English.\u201d She whipped around. \u201cWhat stopped your marriage to the princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was promised to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection,\u201d she said scathingly, \u201cyou were married to me. But that\u2019s all right. As the solicitor so obligingly told us, we can have this marriage dissolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t. We\u2019ve consummated it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not pregnant,\u201d she said, through clenched teeth. \u201cNot pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He almost asked how she knew and the words died in his throat. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one need ever know that I foolishly\u2014impulsively as you would no doubt characterize it\u2014took off my clothes before you, inspiring an ill-advised intimacy. My next husband will be understanding, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour next\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be married to me, Simeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was destined never to finish a sentence around her. Her eyes were as fierce as those of a trapped animal. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to earn love by giving up my ability to make decisions that determine how I live.\u201d</p><p>What could he say to that?</p><p>Her lip curled. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman out there for you. I would say that youth should be a prerequisite for you. Perhaps your mother can find you someone, rather than making up stories about me. I\u2019ll leave tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn London, I\u2019ll inform the solicitor that we\u2019re going ahead with the annulment, on whatever grounds he feels will be the most timely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a need to be so hasty?\u201d Simeon said, feeling peculiarly sick.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m twenty-three,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cMost brides are sixteen, Simeon. Sixteen. I\u2019m twenty-three. You\u2019ll forgive me if I make haste.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm. \u201cYou must be insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhy I didn\u2019t annul this marriage years ago is beyond my understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to act as if I\u2019m a desert princess you can scream at.\u201d Isidore jerked her arm out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no you and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think so last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one of us knew anything about bedding until recently,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that we learned to be together and share reasonable pleasure, but let\u2019s not pretend that it was unique, shall we? Likely the next time will be even better.\u201d</p><p>Next time? Next time? There was a howl in Simeon\u2019s soul that would terrify Isidore if she knew. He felt his teeth baring, like some sort of wild animal. She had no bloody idea what they shared. None.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so quick to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you don\u2019t like the way you feel about me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lip curled. \u201cI don\u2019t. You\u2019re right. I want to admire my husband.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. She had the tongue of an Italian fishwife, but her eyes were saying something else. \u201cYou\u2019re singing,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>The note broke off.</p><p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. You love me.\u201d The certainty of it was in his heart.</p><p>When she finally spoke, her voice was gentle. \u201cYou probably thought that the princess loved you too, didn\u2019t you, Simeon?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her, having forgotten what princess they were talking about.</p><p>\u201cSome men are just like that,\u201d she said, almost to herself, her voice lilting as if she were singing, a sad little song in a minor key. \u201cThey think everyone loves them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd sometimes a woman thinks that no one could love her,\u201d he said, catching her again as she was about to slip through the door.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t allowed any men to know me,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He said it, and knew it was true.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t act as if she heard. \u201cI\u2019ll be in London,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the solicitor to write you directly, Simeon.\u201d Then she brushed off his hand as if he were no more than a passerby and left the room.</p><p>He stood there for a long time, thinking about a little girl who had just lost her parents and sang instead of weeping. And a grown woman who didn\u2019t believe he loved her, and sang while she spoke. But never wept.</p><p>She would understand once she got to London. She would see what they had together.</p> <p>As for Isidore, she retired into the Dower House\u2019s bedchamber and indulged in an angry fit of tears. Why did Simeon have to have those dusky brown eyes, which were too damn beautiful for a man? Somehow it was even more of an affront that he had decided to dress like an English gentleman that morning. It made it harder to think about him as an object of ridicule, a man who trotted around the countryside dressed in short trousers, talking about the Middle Way.</p><p>It made it harder to scorn him, when he bowed with such easy and impersonal formality, held her gloved hand for just the right amount of time, as if he\u2019d never told her to throw away her gloves.</p><p>He was in control again. Hatred of that fueled Isidore all the way to London the next day, all the way to Jemma\u2019s house.</p><p>Where she discovered a houseful of servants, but no Jemma.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>Gore House, Kensington</p><p>London, seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>March 8, 1784</p> <p>Isidore spent the two days before Jemma returned unsuccessfully attempting not to think about her marriage. Or, to be more exact, the lack thereof.</p><p>\u201cSimeon doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d she told Jemma, once she finally came home. \u201cWell, he may be right. That is, he likes things to be calm and ordered. And I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t take directions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake directions?\u201d Jemma said, sounding rather stunned. \u201cWhat sort of directions? And what do you mean, he doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wishes I were someone else,\u201d Isidore said, looking about for her handkerchief. \u201cYou see, he had the idea that his wife would be sweet and docile.\u201d</p><p>Jemma snorted.</p><p>\u201cHis mother wrote him bundles of letters describing me as some sort of virtuous seamstress, even though I had left her household years before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies are never helpful in a marriage,\u201d Jemma observed.</p><p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d Isidore said, wiping away a tear. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t my lie. At any rate, I\u2019ve been a terrible shock to him. I make decisions quite quickly, you know, and I don\u2019t always think beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are darling, if impulsive,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to put it. I think Simeon\u2019s assessment is more harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fool,\u201d Jemma said, interrupting. \u201cBut darling, you\u2019re going to have to forgive him for that sort of foolishness. It\u2019s endemic in the gender.\u201d</p><p>Isidore pressed her lips together. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hurt your feelings,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>Tears fell on Isidore\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been so stupidly foolish, Jemma, and I think I fell in love with him. But he doesn\u2019t even like me, I mean, the kind of person I am. And I just can\u2019t take that. I feel so hurt.\u201d</p><p>Jemma wound an arm around her. \u201cQuite rightly, darling. I like you and love you too, and so does every sane person in Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I want to\u2014you know\u2014I feel as if I\u2019m having to seduce him. You can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like, Jemma. It\u2019s so humiliating!\u201d Her voice trailed into a sob.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he doesn\u2019t approach you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The fi-first time was because I took off my clothing in front of him.\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was your fault! You told me that men don\u2019t\u2014well\u2014I can\u2019t remember, anyway, you were absolutely right. I took off my clothes, and he couldn\u2019t resist me but then he wasn\u2019t happy about it afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he was, but then he wasn\u2019t. The second time, his brother was staying in the Dower House, so I asked Simeon to go for a walk with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you took off your clothing again?\u201d Jemma sounded fascinated.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I made it quite clear...I mean, I had to ask him to go for a walk!\u201d</p><p>Jemma was tapping her lips with one finger. \u201cVery unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really ever want to make love to me, but I forced his hand. And now he says that I\u2019m impulsive and I don\u2019t obey him. I really think he\u2019d be happier with someone far more docile,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cHe would. And he doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me again that he doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d Jemma said hastily. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it for a moment. It sounds to me as if he lost his temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Simeon never loses his temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even when workmen attacked his mother and myself. He didn\u2019t show a bit of passion. He was absolutely calm, and he simply knocked out two of them and kicked down the third and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>Isidore twisted her handkerchief. \u201cAnd then he said it was all my fault because I hadn\u2019t waited for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very unpleasant. It sounds to me as if the duke needs to lose his temper, so that he descends from his sanctimonious heights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he never will,\u201d Isidore said dispiritedly. \u201cWhy, I expect that I could kiss another man directly in front of him, and he would just watch me in that unemotional way he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see that,\u201d Jemma said. And then, thoughtfully: \u201cI truly would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you kiss another man in front of your husband\u2014that same husband who thinks that bedding is all a matter of the body and not the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d probably just turn away. And that would\u2014\u201d Isidore sniffed.</p><p>But Jemma\u2019s eyes were shining. \u201cIt will be good for you too. I think you\u2019re letting that husband of yours get away with far too much. He\u2019s making you feel small, and less than your wonderful self. He needs a lesson.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isidore raised her eyes. \u201cYou think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Jemma said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a matter of one beckoning glance and you\u2019ll have all the gentlemen you want on their knees before you.\u201d</p><p>Isidore sniffed again. \u201cThen why isn\u2019t my own husband that way, Jemma? I\u2019ve tried kissing him, and putting my arms around him like the most frightful hussy, and he just pushes me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jemma admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve never encountered anyone precisely like your husband, Isidore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I should be glad he\u2019s unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be much easier if he weren\u2019t,\u201d Jemma pointed out. \u201cI prefer the lapdog model of husband myself.\u201d</p><p>Isidore managed to smile at her. \u201cThe kind of husband you have, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I had one of them. Just that they were enormously appealing.\u201d Jemma\u2019s smile was a rueful acknowledgment that her husband, Elijah, had never come at her whistle.</p><p>\u201cLady Farthingward is having a ridotto tonight,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou can bask in adoration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Simeon won\u2019t be here to see me get kissed. He bid me goodbye, in the politest of fashions. It\u2019s been two days and he hasn\u2019t come to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not tonight,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut soon. It won\u2019t take him long to think through your final conversation, Isidore. He\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Simeon didn\u2019t come to London that night. Nor the night after, nor the night after.</p><p>A whole week had passed.</p><p>Fine, Isidore told herself. It was fine. She wanted a man who would care about her. Simeon said he loved her, but she started to doubt her memory. Had he said he loved her? Was it a fevered creation of her brain?</p><p>Probably. Because if he loved her, he wouldn\u2019t have let her go. He would lie awake the way she did, thinking about the way he smiled, or the way his brow furrowed when looking at one of his father\u2019s absurd letters. He would wake damp with sweat, the sheets twisted around his legs, having dreamt that she was caressing him.</p> <p>She longed with an ache that seemed not in the heart but in the bones, for something she couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>For a husband.</p><p>For wasn\u2019t that what she always wanted from him? To be a husband. To come back from Africa, bed her, love her, acknowledge her.</p><p>After another week she set her jaw and started looking at men in earnest. There were men, lots of them. All of England seemed to know that her marriage was to be annulled, thanks to the dowager duchess\u2019s vivid descriptions of her son\u2019s brain fever. Isidore hardened her heart against worrying about what Simeon thought about his mother\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>He had made his own bed, as the dowager had said. He must lie in it. Alone. Of course, he was likely happy, practicing the Middle Way, organizing the household...</p><p>Another week passed. He was never coming. Jemma finally admitted that she must have been wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault,\u201d Isidore said helplessly. The nights of lying awake had clarified things. \u201cHe really can\u2019t help being a person who hates disorder. I think it must be because he sensed what his father was like, even as a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he not, given the stench of the sewer?\u201d Jemma said. She had taken a sharp dislike to the entire family. \u201cHis mother is extremely common, given those letters she is writing.\u201d The dowager had not been sparing in her description of Simeon\u2019s fighting skills. \u201cHis father was a complete rotter and cracked to boot. And he is\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Isidore said swiftly. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sat down on the bed. \u201cMarriage is an enviable state,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will enjoy it, the next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought so for years,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cHow long will this annulment take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe solicitor says that since His Majesty himself has taken an interest, it should take only a month or so. He already met with the Archbishop of Canterbury, given the king\u2019s request for prompt action. Lady Pewter annulled her marriage in a month once her husband started dressing in women\u2019s clothing on the open street. The solicitor sent a note that he will like to visit tomorrow. I expect he has news on that front.\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded. \u201cIs Cosway aware that matters are moving so quickly?\u201d</p><p>It was all so humiliating. \u201cI expect so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Isidore could feel her body drooping, like a plant without water. Which was foolish, foolish, foolish. \u201cI feel like taking to my bed and never getting out,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>They sat in silence for a while.</p><p>\u201cIt smells,\u201d Jemma said, finally. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the water closets, Isidore. I mean your husband. There\u2019s something off here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I don\u2019t understand?\u201d Isidore said. \u201cHe said that he loved me. He said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have believed him,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cMen never say that sort of thing unless they mean it. They have rigid defenses prohibiting displays of emotion.\u201d She was smiling. \u201cHe is just being a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a fool,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he wants. Well, I expect he knows just what he wants, but he\u2019s afraid to reach out and take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimeon is not afraid of anything,\u201d Isidore said, almost sadly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Isidore snorted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you because his mother is an old cow who is telling all of England that he\u2019s crazy. And his father was even worse, with all his mistresses, and irresponsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he come back, all those years, when his mother was writing him letters describing the paragon waiting for him at home?\u201d Jemma pounced.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was looking for the source of the Nile,\u201d Isidore offered.</p><p>\u201cNonsense! Years passed. He could have nipped back here, snatched you up and taken you back to die of a Nile fever. He could have come back here, annulled the marriage, and returned to paddle around the river some more. He never came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that,\u201d Isidore said, thinking that Jemma could be awfully dictatorial at times.</p><p>\u201cI think that he\u2019s afraid to own you. To own anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t own me,\u201d Isidore said, with dignity. \u201cI am a human being, not a heifer.\u201d</p><p>Jemma waved her hand. \u201cThink like a man, Isidore. Think like a man! I expect he never really wanted the paragon. You saved him from the tiresomeness of perfection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too much,\u201d Isidore said glumly.</p><p>\u201cI think you may have been just a wee bit overbearing,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cMen like to conquer, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid,\u201d Isidore said, feeling tears prick her eyes. \u201cIf I understand you, you\u2019re saying that he\u2019s throwing me away like yesterday\u2019s tart simply because he finds me too overbearing. I\u2014I\u2014\u201d She meant to say that she deserved better, but she forgot the sentence and floundered into tears instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe needs to take charge. That\u2019s why he tried to redo the wedding. That\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t come to London, because it would mean following your whistle. He\u2019s no lap dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Isidore said, sniffing.</p><p>Jemma was smiling. \u201cWe have to make him understand what he might lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I found that my husband had a mistress, I packed up my bags and fled.\u201d</p><p>Isidore narrowed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d kill him first and then flee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always an option, of course,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cBut with the wisdom of hindsight, I think I should have just given Elijah a taste of his own medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have taken a mistress? Or a\u2014what would the word be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lover. I have decided in the years since that perhaps had I flaunted a lover before Elijah in the early days of our marriage he might have cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Isidore bit her lip. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem logical, Jemma, though I wish it were true. If the only concern your husband had was to do with his heir, I really don\u2019t see how three years one way or the other would change things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know much more about men than I did. I was his, when we lived together in London and were first married. Three years later, he\u2019d practically forgotten about me. Men do that. If you allow Simeon to return to Abyssinia and start rootling around looking for another river basin, he\u2019ll forget you.\u201d</p><p>Isidore felt tears welling up in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want that,\u201d Jemma said gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so awful!\u201d Isidore said, drawing a ragged breath. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI fell in love with Elijah, who didn\u2019t show any interest in returning the favor. It took me forever to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I never will,\u201d Isidore said shakily. \u201cIt\u2019s the most ridiculous thing in the world. It\u2019s just that I love the way he\u2019s taken on the house, and doesn\u2019t even blame his rather hateful mother, or his father, who was a positive criminal! I know he didn\u2019t like the way I dashed into things, but I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect he\u2019s madly in love with you,\u201d Jemma said consolingly. \u201cWho could not be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t let him return to Africa,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to marry anyone else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t,\u201d Jemma said. Against all reason, she was smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ll arrange it so that he comes to his senses. Do you know that when people are knocked silly by a blow, sometimes a second injury puts them back into a sane mind? That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Simeon hit on the head,\u201d Isidore said, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t hit him,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just do something to throw him out of his complacent frame of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of what,\u201d Jemma said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of whom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Revels House</p><p>March 26, 1784</p><p>Early in the morning</p><p>The Duke of Villiers paused before entering the house. If the truth be told, he was remarkably fastidious. Sometimes he embarrassed himself by his dislike of bodily functions. Other men seemed to love sweating and generally rolling around in their own muck. He did not, and a sewer was perfectly emblematic of the sort of bodily process he would prefer to be invisible and certainly inoffensive.</p><p>But the butler was waiting, so Villiers climbed the stairs with a sigh. How he had become such a slave to his acquaintances, he didn\u2019t know. Though he had the idea that Elijah would correct him and say, slave to his friends. One cautious sniff within the hallway, and Villiers felt more cheerful.</p><p>He turned from handing his cloak to the butler. \u201cI heard tales that Revels House had been conquered by a terrible odor,\u201d he told the butler.</p><p>The man beamed. \u201cNo longer, Your Grace. If I might show you into the Yellow Salon, the duke will join you shortly, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Villiers no sooner entered the salon than he stopped short, staring at the rug stretched at his feet. It blazed up at him, an extraordinary dancing pattern of cherry red and deep crimson that covered the entire floor. Stags bounded in incredible detail around the border. \u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are only two or three such in the world, as I understand it,\u201d the butler told him. \u201cHis Grace bought it from a Mongolian king. It is knotted in wool and silk, with gold and silver threads.\u201d</p><p>Villiers had an enormous estate, but he thought he might be treading on something of comparable value. It made him feel almost queasy to walk on it.</p><p>Cosway stamped right over the carpet when he entered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have written you that letter,\u201d he said without further greeting. \u201cI\u2019ve called a halt to my marriage ceremony.\u201d He looked tired. Disheveled, but not nearly as extraordinarily odd as his mother\u2019s letters had promised.</p><p>\u201cSo what got you into breeches?\u201d Villiers asked, skirting the question of marriage. \u201cAccording to various reports, you were shocking the countryside in your trousers.\u201d</p><p>Cosway shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth the amount of anxiety it seemed to cause my acquaintances. Not to mention my household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo powder,\u201d Villiers observed. \u201cBut breeches, and a decent waistcoat. We\u2019ll make a duke of you yet.\u201d</p><p>Cosway smiled faintly. \u201cI even have a valet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you be ready to leave for London in an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an hour,\u201d Villiers said agreeably. \u201cYou might want to tell your valet to begin packing.\u201d</p><p>Cosway\u2019s smile grew. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight the king holds a party on board the royal yacht, the Peregrine, which has been moored in the Thames, just outside the Tower of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Cosway said. \u201cI hope you enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Villiers dropped into a chair, taking a moment to deliberately rearrange himself. Then he said, as casually as possible: \u201cThe king has interested himself personally in the dissolution of your marriage on the grounds of your insanity, and has ordered the matter expedited both in Parliament and with the church. The duchess\u2014that would be, your duchess\u2014has been invited tonight. It is my distinct impression that the king will personally grant her a dissolution of her marriage.\u201d</p><p>It was a blow. Villiers could see that. Then Cosway\u2019s jaw set and his back straightened.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe deserves to choose her own husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already being courted by every fortune hunter on three continents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I expect that is the case.\u201d Cosway sat down and crossed his legs as if they were discussing tomorrow\u2019s weather.</p><p>Another man might have believed Cosway\u2019s uncaring voice. But somehow Villiers had learned to recognize the signs of anguish, even buried deep in a man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAh well,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d let you know. I must say, I\u2019m glad to hear that you\u2019re so uninterested.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>There was just a shade of suspicion in Cosway\u2019s tone, but Villiers was too good an actor to start laughing. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever mentioned it to you, but I have a number of illegitimate children,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cosway\u2019s eyebrows flew up. \u201cDo you find that inconvenient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Villiers said feelingly, \u201cbut I am beginning to. You see, I have decided to gather these children into my own household.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the number is?\u201d Cosway asked.</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d Villiers sighed. \u201cI can hardly believe it myself. The sins of youth become the burden of old age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly old,\u201d Cosway objected. \u201cWhat are you, thirty? I suppose you could sprout a full dozen if you put your mind to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAnd my soul is much older, I assure you. At any rate, six illegitimate children do pose something of a problem for my matrimonial prospects, as you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Cosway snorted. \u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014\u201d He broke off.</p> <p>Villiers watched with satisfaction as the truth dawned.</p><p>\u201cI need to find them a mother,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWomen of my own rank are unlikely to take me, under the circumstances. But a divorced woman? And Isidore is very delectable.\u201d He said it gently, but apparently not gently enough.</p><p>He could have sworn that Cosway didn\u2019t even move, but the next moment there was a strong hand around his throat. \u201cShe is no mother for your misbegotten brats,\u201d Cosway snarled. The tight thread of rage in his voice would have made Villiers smile, but he had a suspicion he might die for it. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d He threw Villiers backwards. The chair nearly tilted and went over, but held.</p><p>Villiers delicately felt his throat. Jemma would owe him for this one. Friendship was one thing; physical assault was not as appealing. He coughed. Cosway didn\u2019t seem to be impressed, so he coughed again, harder.</p><p>Cosway was still standing over him, staring. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he said, turning and throwing himself down into a chair. \u201cYou lied to me. Bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Villiers asked cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t intend to marry Isidore, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if it drives you to assail me, no.\u201d</p><p>Cosway\u2019s face was as foul as any pirate captain Villiers had had the good luck not to meet. \u201cI\u2019d probably rip your guts out at the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cWhat happened to all that Middle Way business that you regaled me with when we were on board ship together? Aren\u2019t you a calm pebble on the shores of eternity any more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Isidore,\u201d Cosway said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cWomen,\u201d Villiers sighed. He got up and rang the bell.</p><p>The butler appeared immediately. \u201cMay I bring some refreshments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wet cloth for my throat,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAnd tell the duke\u2019s valet that we\u2019re leaving for London within the hour. We\u2019ll be on the royal yacht tonight and the valet needs to pack accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Cosway said behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just rediscovering your manhood,\u201d Villiers said soothingly. \u201cAll that pebble business wasn\u2019t good for you. The question is, how are you going to win her back without getting yourself thrown in the Tower for murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she wants to pick her husband,\u201d Cosway said. \u201cShe wants to be wooed. Flowers. Poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJewels,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cSkip the flowers; they just die. Do you have any jewelry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiger rubies. I just had them transferred from Hoare\u2019s bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Isidore is not really interested in that sort of thing,\u201d Cosway said, slumping back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lapdog,\u201d Cosway said. \u201cSomeone who will allow her to make all the decisions and believe everything she says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll adjust,\u201d Villiers said, getting up and wandering over to examine the wall paneling. \u201cYou have some lovely frieze work here, Cosway. Was this original to the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Isidore brought someone in, but she left before seeing what he did.\u201d</p><p>Villiers turned around. \u201cHere\u2019s my advice, for what it\u2019s worth. There\u2019s been nothing romantic about your marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. She went off to London to have it annulled and you didn\u2019t even bother to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a damned dog to follow at her heels!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou\u2019re more of a pirate.\u201d</p><p>Cosway narrowed his eyes. \u201cA\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man who slashes his way to his lady\u2019s side,\u201d Villiers said, almost dreamily. \u201cBeating all the odds, including causing grave bodily harm to those highest in the realm (for which he could be hung, mind you), he makes his way to his chosen bride and slings her over his shoulder, heading for the freedom of the open\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it,\u201d Cosway said, cutting him off. \u201cI suppose you write melodramas on the sly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I ought to?\u201d Villiers said, widening his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you think I have talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Cosway said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you were one of the best fencers in Europe, I\u2019d wonder about your manhood, Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Villiers shook down the lace at his wrists. \u201cI\u2019ve only lost one duel. And that was to a man in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you see,\u201d he continued gently, \u201cI have a great respect for the condition. I would put myself in danger from such a man only under the strongest persuasion.\u201d</p><p>He could see Cosway thinking, accepting it, learning to live with it. He even smiled, a moment later. \u201cSo who forced you to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma, Duchess of Beaumont,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cNow we must leave. It will take me at least three hours to prepare for the king\u2019s festivities tonight.\u201d He eyed Cosway. \u201cDepending on the skill of your valet, it should take you at least four.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p><p>The Peregrine</p><p>Yacht to His Royal Highness, George III</p><p>March 26, 1784</p><p>Isidore knew it was a silent, defiant gesture. Her solicitor assured her that the king himself intended to speak to her that very evening about the dissolution of her marriage; she chose to wear the dress in which she first met her husband. She had a strong feeling that the majority of men on the royal yacht would not react to her presence by querying whether her taste ran to the unorthodox.</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d Jemma said, coming up behind her. \u201cYou look astonishing, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something of a debutante ball for me,\u201d Isidore said, smiling at her in the mirror. \u201cI intend to impress all available men with my attributes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo debutante could wear that gown,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cgiven your meager bodice and less-than-meager curves. The design is so beautiful: I love the blue watered silk petticoat underneath the silver. Gorgeous! Especially with the diamonds sewn all over it...You look like a fairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think of fairies as small green creatures with transparent wings,\u201d Isidore said dubiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA fairy queen,\u201d Jemma amended. \u201cOne look at you and mortals lose their wits, forever wandering in the depths of the forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are rather odd, Jemma, do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept that about myself. And I\u2019m not the one with diamonds pasted everywhere from her bottom to her heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make it clear to everyone that I\u2019m\u2014it is ridiculous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone knows how much you\u2019re worth, darling,\u201d Jemma said soothingly. \u201cI like the glittering look. It\u2019s a public service. You\u2019ll reflect the candlelight so no one falls overboard. You know, last time the king had a gathering on his yacht, Lord Piddle tripped over his own feet and somersaulted into the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he come back up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cHe floated like a cork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I fell overboard,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cI would sink like a stone. These diamonds are quite small but put together, they\u2019re quite heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you sit in a throne to receive the admiring hoards.\u201d</p> <p>Isidore bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cVilliers went to fetch him,\u201d Jemma said, guessing exactly what she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Villiers can\u2019t convince him?\u201d Isidore said, fear welling up in her heart. \u201cWhat if Simeon is perfectly happy without me, and has decided I\u2019m just too much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll auction your dress in the marketplace and you can buy yourself a new husband.\u201d</p><p>By ten in the evening, Isidore was beginning to accept that even the Duke of Villiers couldn\u2019t work miracles. King George III had come and gone, giving his assurance that the bill of divorce her solicitor had submitted would be approved speedily. It should have warmed Isidore\u2019s heart to realize that even a happily married monarch found her bosom appealing, but it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Simeon come? She stood up listlessly and put her hand into the hand of some gentleman. She couldn\u2019t even remember his name. There had been so many suitors that she\u2019d taken to describing them to Jemma by their clothes. This one wore a turquoise coat with green buttons. Not a good combination. She managed to find a smile for him.</p> <p>Turquoise Coat bowed with a great deal of unnecessary hand flourishing, and they eased their way onto the crowded floor. The yacht was ample for a boat, but the king had been lavish with his invitations and there were (in Isidore\u2019s opinion) far too many people onboard. Her panniers kept knocking against those of other ladies, necessitating a constant flow of apologies. What\u2019s more, the gentle rocking motion of the river made dancing all the more difficult, especially when dressed in perilously delicate heels and a cumbersome gown.</p><p>She was just twitching her hem out from under the clumsy feet of one of the royal dukes when there was a sudden thump and the entire yacht bounded in the water, as if a giant\u2019s hand had thrown it in the air an inch or two.</p><p>The duke frowned as though her gown were to blame and lumbered off to the deck, followed by most of the dancers.</p><p>\u201cPeculiar,\u201d her partner remarked. \u201cI wonder what that was about. I suppose we could go look at the water.\u201d The musicians produced one screeching discord, and then settled back to finish the measure.</p><p>Some people continued to dance, though most had drifted through the doors that opened onto the deck. She could hear a few shouts from outside. Jemma appeared at her shoulder, her eyes sparkling. \u201cI think another boat has hit us,\u201d she cried over the noise. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Beaumont!\u201d And she was gone.</p><p>Turquoise Coat started a running complaint. Drunken river boat captains presented a hazard to everyone on the river...Isidore had a headache, and it wasn\u2019t getting any better listening to prognostications about the rightful punishment that would be meted out to the drunken captain who struck the king\u2019s own yacht.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, my lord,\u201d she said, \u201cI must retire to the lady\u2019s salon for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt if that is entirely safe,\u201d Turquoise Coat said. \u201cWhat if the boat has suffered some damage? We should make our way outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf the boat were damaged, we would be listing,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI do hear some shouting and such.\u201d</p><p>Isidore slipped her hand out of his arm. \u201cIt has been a pleasure, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He said something, and she turned about. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lord,\u201d he snapped, looking distinctly put upon.</p><p>She turned away without answering, which made her feel guilty all the way back across the now empty ballroom floor. The boat was still rocking from side to side. Her guess would be that it had burst free of its moorings and was drifting in the Thames. Which meant that it would strike one or the other bank in a matter of five minutes. Hardly anything to worry about.</p><p>At any rate, she didn\u2019t see any reason to join the crowds on deck, where doubtless her gown would be trod on and she might even fall overboard, given the fact that the heels of her diamond-encrusted shoes had proved to be far too high for comfort. She teetered across the polished floor and finally made her way into the ladies\u2019 salon.</p><p>The maids had deserted their posts, naturally. She sat down on a chaise-longue and stared at the opposite wall.</p><p>She loved him, and she\u2019d lost him. She\u2019d lost him by being a peremptory dragon. \u201cArrogant,\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cFool.\u201d She\u2019d dropped her handkerchief somewhere so she resorted to pulling up her jewel-encrusted skirts and wiping her eyes on her chemise.</p><p>\u201cLost your way?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard the door open. She hadn\u2019t heard any footsteps, or sensed eyes watching her. She hadn\u2019t planned anything to say, which was almost the worst of it.</p><p>He looked like any other duke of the realm, dressed in a gorgeous coat of dark blue satin, embroidered with pomegranates.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your coat,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to Villiers.\u201d He didn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a duke,\u201d she said, sniffing a little.</p><p>Being Simeon, he didn\u2019t bother with flummery about clothing. \u201cYou are free to choose a husband, or so they tell me,\u201d he stated.</p><p>She swallowed. Her heart was beating so fast that she could hear it in her ears. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could offer myself as part of the horde that Villiers assures me is sniffing about you.\u201d</p><p>A tiny tendril of hope sprang up in her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing breeches. I\u2019m sure that was one of my requirements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd powder,\u201d he said, \u201cfor meeting royalty. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offering myself.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach twisted on a great wave of nausea and shame. \u201cI see,\u201d she said faintly. He was looking at her closely so she couldn\u2019t, she couldn\u2019t cry. She mustn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSurely that doesn\u2019t surprise you,\u201d he said, moving into the room and closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cThis is the ladies\u2019 salon,\u201d she said. Her voice cracked, which was stupid. She was swamped by a feeling of bewilderment, like a child who just lost both parents in one moment. She had believed him when he said he loved her. Her eyes blurred and she had to bite her lip hard. She turned away from him. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to leave,\u201d she said, forcing the words out of her throat. \u201cJemma will be wondering where I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t answer, so finally she turned back. Simeon was busy jamming a gilt chair between the closed door and the dressing table.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offering for your hand,\u201d he said, walking over and towering above her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to emphasize your decision!\u201d she snapped. \u201cI fully understand your reluctance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you, Isidore? Do you really?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cOf course I understand. I gave you scant courtesy when I made those decisions about the house, for which you were justly angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offering for your hand, Isidore, because I\u2019m taking it.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a tame dog to follow you to London and paw at your skirts. I want you,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cBecause I love you, and you love me. And damn it, you\u2019re going to be the very devil to live with. But you\u2019re my devil, and I can\u2019t let anyone else have you, and I can\u2019t imagine life without you.\u201d</p><p>Isidore took one sobbing, song-filled breath. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I didn\u2019t love you enough to stay with you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you tested me by taking off to London and expecting me to follow.\u201d</p><p>She lurched to her feet like an ungainly adolescent, literally throwing herself into his arms. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said, her voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t follow you because it meant I was your inferior.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never thought that!\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t accept the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou rule my heart, Isidore, and there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201d</p><p>She took his face in her hands. \u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her so hard that her hands slipped around his neck. He kissed her so sweetly that her heart was never the same. And he kissed her so fiercely that she knew that a lion had voluntarily walked into the circle of her arms. Isidore Del\u2019Fino, Duchess of Cosway, never forgot that last lesson.</p><p>His hands were roaming. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said breathlessly, thinking of all the people on deck\u2014and he did it anyway. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she gasped a few minutes later\u2014but he already was.</p><p>Her bodice was designed to cover her breasts, no matter the circumstances, but it gave way before Simeon\u2019s determination. The breath caught in Isidore\u2019s throat when she saw his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said. His voice was hoarse and his hands hovered above her, as if he were afraid to touch her. \u201cRipe and delicate and as beautiful as a rose.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t have time for poetry. So Isidore caught him by the hair and said, \u201cSimeon.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her, his eyes dark as a moonless night. \u201cKiss me,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he asked, a glimmer of laughter in those wicked eyes of his. He dropped a polite little kiss on her nipple.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d he inquired, giving her a tiny lick.</p><p>Her hips bucked, but it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cSimeon.\u201d</p><p>So he laughed and suckled her, shaping her other breast with a rough hand. All thought of possible interruptions flew from her head.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t many minutes later that Simeon found himself on his knees before Isidore. Her skirts were thrown up and she was lying back on the chaise-longue, making the sort of moans that only a woman in a very, very pleasurable state might make.</p><p>She was so beautiful. Her hair had toppled out of its coiffure of elaborate curls and puffs, and fell about her shoulders. Her lips were a deeper red than any ruby; her skin was peaches and cream. She tasted like nectar, but the true aphrodisiac was the look in her eyes.</p><p>He drew his fingers down over creamy flesh and began sweetly circling a bit lower. She trembled and then begged, finally propping herself up on her elbows and scowling at him, which was just what he wanted.</p><p>He loved her scowl. So he dipped his head and gave her exactly what she wanted, drove her to the very edge of abandonment, kissed her until cries tumbled from her lips like a song...and pulled back.</p><p>Sure enough, he got the scowl back. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me addled,\u201d Isidore said, catching her breath.</p><p>He soothed her with his fingers until she writhed under his touch. \u201cI\u2019m just making sure that you know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimeon,\u201d she breathed. \u201cMy husband.\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment he heard a dim banging noise behind him. He ignored it, concentrating on giving Isidore exactly what she wanted. Sending his beloved toppling into the kind of chaotic bliss that poets dream of. Except\u2014</p><p>It was more than a distant annoyance. There was a chaotic shouting and crashing from the boat deck. And then the pounding was on their very door. \u201cCome out!\u201d a voice called out, high and alarmed. \u201cThe prison ship, the hulk, hit the yacht and prisoners\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Simeon said sharply, lifting his head. One had to expect that at some point the king\u2019s servants would desire entrance and he meant to deny them. But this sounded more serious.</p><p>\u201cHe said something about prisoners,\u201d Isidore said, her breath catching in a little pant. \u201cA prison ship. Simeon...don\u2019t stop, please don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>But his entire body had gone on alert in the time it took for her to say the sentence. \u201cUp,\u201d he commanded, jerking down her skirts as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Isidore stood up, but her legs were wobbly and she clung to his arm.</p><p>\u201cOne of the prison boats moored in the Thames must have struck this yacht. Or we struck it.\u201d He wrenched on his breeches.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Isidore stood for a moment, trying to catch her breath. \u201cI suppose we\u2019d better leave then.\u201d She found one of her shoes and turned it right side up.</p><p>\u201cCan you run in those?\u201d Simeon was listening at the door.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave them.\u201d He tossed Villiers\u2019s beautiful coat into the corner.</p><p>\u201cBut the diamonds\u2014\u201d Isidore looked about swiftly, and then flung her shoes under the sofa. She could always retrieve them later.</p><p>Simeon pulled the chair out of the way. \u201cI think from the noise the prisoners have escaped and are getting onto the yacht,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t that chair protect us?\u201d Isidore asked longingly, running her hands up his chest.</p><p>\u201cNot if they fire the vessel.\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cI can\u2019t swim in this gown, Simeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that conversation we had, back when I was afraid of crises and you told me there weren\u2019t any in England?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help it; she was so delicious that he had to kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my bally- something,\u201d Isidore said a moment later, looking a great deal less frightened. \u201cJust tell me what to do, capo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going overboard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here, with you in that gown. And we need to get off as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded and put her hand in his. He pulled the door open cautiously and looked out. There was no one in the ballroom. But with the door open, the sound from the deck swelled. There was screaming and the unmistakable sound of swords clashing. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting,\u201d Isidore breathed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe king\u2019s own guard is likely here. Not to mention parish constables, the Watch, and guards from the prison ship.\u201d But he didn\u2019t really give a damn about that. The only thing he cared about was the most precious bundle of his entire life, her hand trustingly clasped in his. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Simeon said fiercely.</p><p>The smile she gave him blinded him. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>They walked silently into the ballroom, keeping to the edge of the wall, heading to the doors on the other side of the room, away from the deck. Once through the door, Simeon made his way swiftly through the corridors until he came to the staircase at the very end of the yacht.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go up here,\u201d he said in her ear. \u201cWe have to go straight over the railing, Isidore. If they see you, they\u2019ll fight to the death to have you.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. He wrapped his hands around her and gave her one last, fierce kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go off the railing to the left and distract them. I doubt they can swim, and at any rate, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll bother. But they\u2019ll certainly come to the railing on that side.\u201d His voice was just a thread of sound. \u201cStay behind this door and count to twenty. Then run through the door and over the railing to the right without pausing to think or listen. Promise?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>He eased open the door and launched himself through it. Isidore began to count. Don\u2019t listen, she told herself. You said you wouldn\u2019t listen. You just count to twenty, and then run. That\u2019s all\u2014</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. Ears were made for listening. She heard Simeon\u2019s footsteps and a splash and then shouts. Happy shouts in rough accents. With a leaden feeling of terror, she realized that Simeon had dived overboard but that a ruffian already in the water had grabbed him instantly.</p> <p>She crept to the door and peered through it. A few ragged men were hanging over the railing, then a head appeared and they were hauling up Simeon, dripping and furious. They had his arms behind his back.</p><p>The prisoner who\u2019d caught Simeon climbed over the railing. \u201cKicked me right good, he did,\u201d the man said, adding a word that Isidore had never heard before. \u201cI\u2019ll have my own back for that.\u201d And before Isidore could draw a breath he pulled back his arm and socked Simeon in the cheek. Simeon fell backward against the deck, pinned by the two men holding his arms.</p><p>Isidore almost screamed, but stopped herself. Simeon didn\u2019t deign to say a word in response to the blow. He just looked deliberately from face to face, studying the five men clustered around him.</p><p>\u201cHere, what you doing then?\u201d one of the prisoners said, obviously uncomfortable that Simeon didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>\u201cMemorizing your faces,\u201d he said. The rage so potent in his voice made Isidore shiver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just give him two black eyes, why don\u2019t I?\u201d the man snarled. \u201cThat\u2019ll stop him.\u201d</p> <p>Isidore\u2019s stomach lurched. She couldn\u2019t stay here, hidden, while they beat Simeon. She had to startle them enough so that they would drop his arms, because then he could knock them all out with his kick. Soundlessly, she crept back down the stairs. She needed a weapon. Unfortunately, the king\u2019s yacht didn\u2019t seem to have any weapons. She couldn\u2019t even find a heavy candlestick.</p><p>Suddenly, she had an idea, and flew back into the ladies\u2019 salon, retrieving her diamond slippers. These should get their attention. She ran up the stairs again, breathing hard, and found that not much had changed.</p><p>The same two ruffians were clutching Simeon\u2019s arms, though thankfully he didn\u2019t seem to have taken any more blows. From what she could understand, they were going to bargain his life for their freedom.</p><p>She waited for the right moment, eased open the door, and tossed out the diamond shoe.</p><p>It somersaulted in the light of the torches illuminating the deck and landed just in front of the group. For a moment they all stared at it, as if a bird of paradise had landed on the deck. The shoe glistened with jewels.</p><p>Then, with a muffled shout, all five men dove for it.</p><p>Simeon kicked the man closest to him so hard that the convict flew back against the wall of the yacht. In a swift, swirling circle he sent the other four spinning to the deck, one after another. Isidore wrenched open the door and flew at Simeon. His muscled arms closed around her and he threw himself backward, overboard.</p><p>They struck the water with such force that Simeon\u2019s arms spun away from Isidore\u2019s waist. Icy water closed over her face and her heavy skirts pulled her down into the acid-tasting water as effectively as if she had stones in her pockets.</p> <p>Something brushed her face and she thought of waterlogged corpses rescued by the Dead Watch. Frantically, she beat her arms, trying to rise to the surface, but she couldn\u2019t counteract the plummeting weight of all those diamonds.</p><p>Then, like a benediction, like a prayer, Simeon\u2019s strong arms closed around her and he pulled her upward with a strong, smooth stroke. Isidore broke the surface, choking and gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he said, holding her up. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, sweetheart. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave her a hard, swift kiss. \u201cI want you out of the river.\u201d And without another word he began towing her through the water as if she were no heavier than a babe. Isidore had just enough time to be confusedly grateful for Simeon\u2019s passion for running and the strength it gave him. (Turquoise Coat would have left her to sink or, rather, he would have plummeted down right next to her.)</p><p>Then they were at the shore, where a hundred helping hands reached out to them. Simeon was up in a flash, turning around to pull Isidore up the bank. Her skirts seemed ten times heavier than they had been, and the weight of water and jewels made the silk of her overskirts stretch past her feet, tripping her. Finally Simeon just bent down, picked her up in his arms and walked up the slope.</p><p>Everyone on the bank was screaming and howling \u201cHurrah!\u201d The noise was deafening. Isidore felt a sudden breeze, took one appalled glance down, and realized that the diamond-encrusted cloth of her bodice had given up its battle with gravity and had fallen below her nipples. She looked up, horrified, and met Simeon\u2019s eyes. He was laughing.</p><p>A second later they were on the bankside, and Simeon wrapped a coat tightly around her. \u201cI can\u2019t let all of London know what they\u2019re missing,\u201d he said into her ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, Simeon,\u201d she said, hiccupping, half-crying. \u201cHe struck you, Simeon. He struck you and I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did stop him,\u201d Simeon said. \u201cI might have died, but for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we were in the water,\u201d Isidore said with another hiccup, \u201cand I was going down, and all I could think of was the Dead Watch and how they would gloat when they were sent to find my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, his arms tightening around her. \u201cI would never allow that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever let them be the ones to rescue my body, Simeon,\u201d she said. \u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to drown. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She put her head against his chest and listened to the strong beat of his heart. They were safe. Tears slid slowly down her cheeks.</p><p>He said something she couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see how lucky we are, Isidore?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, a little damply. Her heart was still pounding with fear, even now she was in the warm circle of his arms.</p><p>He pulled back and cupped her face in his hands. \u201cWe\u2019re like your parents, sweetheart. If one of us is going to be lost, both of us will go. I would never, ever stop searching for you if our boat overturned.\u201d</p><p>Then he was kissing her, the kind of possessive, loving kiss that she\u2019d seen her father give her mother a hundred times. Tears welled out of her eyes, and Isidore wound her arms around Simeon\u2019s neck and held on as tightly as she could, even as her tears made him a little wetter than he already was.</p><p>It sounded as if the cheers grew even louder when he lowered his head to hers again...but maybe that was just her imagination.</p> <p>Two minutes later, Simeon picked her up again and carried her through the crowd, regardless of her wet, heavy dress trailing behind them. Isidore hadn\u2019t paid much attention to what was happening around her, but when the groomsmen closed the carriage door behind them and Simeon deposited her on a seat, she looked about. She was placed in the most luxurious carriage she had ever ridden in, upholstered in red velvet with gold coronets sprinkled everywhere. The horses started and she could hardly feel the motion, so sweetly was the coach designed and calibrated.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked, half laughing.</p><p>Simeon was wrestling off his wet shirt and didn\u2019t look up. \u201cThe Duke of Buckingham\u2019s carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA royal carriage,\u201d she said, watching him under her eyelashes. Her breath felt hot in her chest. Surely he couldn\u2019t mean to...</p><p>He did mean precisely that.</p> <p>Because a second later Simeon was tenderly peeling her drenched bodice down to her waist. There were red marks on her skin left by the diamonds as she struck the surface of the water. He kissed every little bruise, moving down her body like a man who knew exactly where those kisses were most needed.</p><p>And though Isidore had never imagined such a thing was possible\u2014making love in a carriage, let alone a prince\u2019s carriage!\u2014she found herself laying back on red velvet upholstery as her husband deftly woke her body into the same trembling, vibrating state she had experienced on the yacht.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered at some point, and lost her train of thought when a wave of pleasure swept her into a place where words were impossible.</p><p>And when he thrust into her, she plummeted into a state where she could do nothing but sob for the pure pleasure of it.</p><p>Simeon\u2019s body begged him to follow her, but instead he chose to make love to Isidore slowly. It was only by kissing her, by stroking her, by stroking in her, that he could tell her in a way that scorched the truth into both their hearts.</p><p>Finally, he couldn\u2019t keep to his slow rhythm. He began pumping hard and fast, keeping his eyes open so he could see the way she strained to meet him, the way she gasped and cried out, the sheer beauty of her eyes and mouth.</p> <p>The carriage rocked as it rounded a corner, and the sensation just increased their pleasure. \u201cSimeon,\u201d Isidore gasped, \u201cwe must be nearly home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them not to open the door,\u201d he said, but he could feel his control slipping away.</p><p>\u201cSimeon!\u201d Isidore cried, pulling his body even deeper inside her own, forcing him to throw away the remnants of his control and surrender to something wilder and more beautiful. Something that left Isidore crying ( just a little), and Simeon\u2019s eyes misty ( just a little).</p><p>In the moments that followed, broken only by their whispered endearments, he realized something his heart already knew. They were partners. She would always make impulsive decisions and he would make slow, reasoned ones. He would always be a little terrified that she would look at him with the scorn he saw in his mother\u2019s eyes. And she would always be a little terrified that he would look at her and not love her enough.</p><p>In short, they were made for each other.</p><p>He thought of eloquent things he should say, all the tenderness and passion and hope in his chest, and distilled it to one sentence. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. And kissed him.</p><p>\u201cWhither thou goest,\u201d he said to her, in a voice so quiet that she could hardly hear it over the clattering wheels. \u201cThere will I go too.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Forty-two</p><p>St. James\u2019s Palace</p><p>London</p><p>April 10, 1784</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until two weeks afterward that Isidore understood the whole of what happened. She hadn\u2019t realized that most of London saw their daring escape, and Simeon\u2019s rescue of her. Nor that the King himself watched Simeon carry her from the water and kiss her afterwards, and then swore that he would never listen to another solicitor bleating on about one of his noblemen being mad, let alone annul a marriage on those grounds.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand that by knocking out the ringleaders of the prisoners\u2019 rebellion, Simeon had enabled the king\u2019s guards to trounce the uprising. And she certainly didn\u2019t envision her husband being summoned to St. James\u2019s Palace for a public proclamation of the nation\u2019s gratitude, during which the Duke of Cosway declared that any success was the result of working together with his duchess.</p><p>It was the ball following the king\u2019s declaration, and Isidore hadn\u2019t seen her husband for at least an hour. She kept glancing over her dancing partners\u2019 shoulders, wondering where he might be. She had developed a horror of the silver gown, and so Lucille had carefully removed all the diamonds\u2014the ones that weren\u2019t left behind in the mud of the Thames\u2014and sewn them onto a presentation gown.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t chosen to wear that tonight; in fact, she thought it might be a long time before she chose to wear diamonds again. Her gown was a pale rose-colored velvet with Chantilly lace, and she wore it with a fortune in tiger rubies.</p><p>Her former suitors were out in force. Most of them hadn\u2019t lost hope that she would find herself disaffected with Simeon. Even if she weren\u2019t planning to annul her marriage, they hoped that she might turn to one of them by way of consoling herself for her husband\u2019s eccentricities. They smiled, capered and bowed...She felt overwhelmed by their florid scent, by the way they \u201caccidentally\u201d brushed her chest, by the way their teeth showed when they smiled.</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d decided that a man should smile gravely, smell faintly like cardamom soap, and touch her breasts only in the privacy of the marital bedchamber.</p><p>The nature of marriage is such that a woman no sooner formulates rules of this nature...than they are broken.</p><p>The Earl of Bisselbate was just bowing before her, flourishing his hand as if he were a peasant sowing seeds (Isidore thought uncharitably), when suddenly another hand touched her shoulder. She jumped and turned. Simeon. She smiled up at him, not even noticing that the earl had straightened and was expectantly holding out his hand to lead her into the dance.</p><p>\u201cSimeon,\u201d she breathed. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king had a private request,\u201d he said, smiling down at her. \u201cIt seems the queen has taken a liking to tiger rubies.\u201d</p><p>The earl cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cDo forgive me,\u201d Isidore said, turning reluctantly back to her escort. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your Baalomaal,\u201d Simeon said...His voice was low and meant for only her ears.</p><p>Without a second\u2019s thought, Isidore sank backwards, throwing a hand to her brow, knowing that Simeon would catch her, feeling his arms go around her. \u201cOh!\u201d she cried. \u201cI feel so faint! It must be the heat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simeon was laughing silently. He carried her swiftly through the chattering nobles, out the door and down one of the myriad corridors of St. James\u2019s Palace.</p><p>Isidore lay her head against his chest, loving the strong beat of his heart, not bothering to ask what the danger was. Simeon was with her. All would be well.</p><p>A few moments later he whisked her through a door. It was a velvety dark space. He put her on her feet.</p><p>\u201cSimeon?\u201d she asked. It felt as if they were in a very small room. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA closet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s room to lie down...in case you felt like it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but he fell to his knees, and pulled up her skirts. She put her hands on his powerful shoulders, bracing herself against the intoxicating little kisses that were burning a path up her legs.</p><p>\u201cBut, Simeon,\u201d she gasped, feeling her knees weaken, knowing that in a moment she\u2019d be lying on the floor of a broom closet in the king\u2019s own palace. \u201cI thought you would use that word baalomaal only in moments of great danger.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t choose to answer until her breath was coming quickly and she was leaning against the wall, uttering broken little moans. Then he stood up, stripped off his coat, and put it on the floor. It was a magnificent coat, worked by Villiers\u2019s own embroiderer, black roses on deep brown...It was also soft and made an excellent improvised bed.</p><p>A moment later Simeon was kissing his wife\u2019s inner thigh again, and Isidore was having trouble keeping her mind on the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cThere was danger,\u201d he said, but only when she wasn\u2019t sure what he was talking about anymore.</p><p>He waited until her breath was coming and going in unsteady little pants, and he was poised above her in the velvety darkness, feeling her twist up against him, begging, pleading...</p><p>Then he entered her in one swift stroke, savoring the exquisite beauty of sharing her body, her breath, her love. \u201cBecause I love you,\u201d he said, his voice rough, the voice of a man who was come to understand that control is only worth having if it\u2019s worth throwing away\u2014at certain moments.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she breathed, arching toward him, urging him on.</p><p>\u201cIt was a matter of some danger,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He could feel her giggle. \u201cHmmm.\u201d</p> <p>The time for talking was over but he had to say it first. \u201cThose men were in danger, Isidore. In grave danger. It makes me ache just to look at you. It makes me enraged to see other men look at you, let alone touch you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were sliding over his rear, inflaming him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said fiercely, taking her mouth in a kiss as possessive as he felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she said, kissing him back. \u201cAnd you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>An Epilogue</p><p>in Two Parts</p><p>Part One</p><p>The Bishop\u2019s Study</p> <p>Canterbury Cathedral</p><p>A month or so later</p><p>The Archbishop of Canterbury had to admit that the rules surrounding the reconsecration of a marriage were vague, even to him. It was hardly his fault; no one ever requested the ceremony. He spent a great deal of his time putting together couples whom he knew perfectly well were not bound for matrimonial bliss.</p><p>Now this couple probably would be blissful. Or perhaps it was better to say that they were blissful.</p><p>They had said their vows, holding tightly to each other\u2019s hands. They\u2019d said \u201cI do,\u201d with commendably loud voices.</p><p>But even so they didn\u2019t seem to want to stop vowing things to each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love you,\u201d the groom said. \u201cYou\u2019re the ballast to my soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to be less impulsive,\u201d she was saying. The bishop knew what that meant. His mother had been impulsive. He sighed and wondered if they were ever leaving.</p><p>\u201cI adore you just as you are,\u201d the groom whispered.</p><p>Oh really.</p><p>Kissing again.</p><p>He poured himself another glass of sherry. It was going to be a long evening.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Part Two</p><p>Revels House</p><p>A year or so later</p><p>There was a baby crying. Simeon staggered to his feet, shocked out of the sleep of the truly exhausted. Isidore lay next to him, not even stirring. He spared a lopsided smile for his wife, loving her tangled curls and long eyelashes, the arm flung over her head, even the dark circles under her eyes.</p><p>He made it to the door, banged a knee on the bedside table, and swallowed a curse. Life seemed more chaotic all the time, and his ability to remain calm in the eye of a storm wasn\u2019t any stronger. As he opened the door, the nanny was already halfway down the corridor. \u201cHere\u2019s Lucia,\u201d she said, handing over a warm little bundle.</p><p>A small red face ringed in soft black curls looked up at him for one moment, registered that he wasn\u2019t the milk-providing parent, and erupted back into a howl. There was no telling Lucia that she was a pebble on the shores of eternity. She was a living, breathing, adorable source of chaos, and he loved her so much that it felt as if his heart were beating outside his body.</p><p>\u201cHush, sweetie,\u201d Simeon said to her, running a finger down her passionate little nose. \u201cMama\u2019s sleeping...won\u2019t you let mama sleep for just another moment or two?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with her mother\u2019s huge, almond-shaped eyes. But she knew exactly who she was in life, and exactly what she could command. She was the lady of the bedchamber, and the sitting room, and the whole of Revels House, so she opened her mouth again to make that quite clear, just in case her papa mistook the situation.</p><p>He kissed her, and gave her a last cuddle, and handed her over to her mother. Who didn\u2019t bother with endearments, just propped herself up against the headboard and tucked Lucia exactly where she wanted to be. Simeon just lay back down when he cocked an ear, sighed, and swung his legs off the bed again.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a terrible night,\u201d Isidore offered sleepily. \u201cI think we had at least three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d he said, trying to sound grumpier than he felt.</p><p>\u201cDante,\u201d the nurse said cheerfully, handing him over. \u201cAnd Pietro, but he\u2019s still half asleep and won\u2019t mind waiting for a moment or two.\u201d</p><p>Simeon walked back into his bedchamber, his arms full of the reasons why he had given up an attempt to remain calm. He kissed little Dante (the smallest of the three) on the nose, and handed him over.</p><p>Then he sat down holding Pietro, who opened his eyes and blinked about a little before deciding to try out his newest, most precious accomplishment.</p><p>A smile.</p><p>That was the problem with living in a clean tent on the banks of the Ganges River. There were no gummy smiles, no warm little bundles, no beautiful, impetuous wives, no responsibilities...</p><p>No life. Real life.</p><p>In other words, no love. </p> </body></html>"]
