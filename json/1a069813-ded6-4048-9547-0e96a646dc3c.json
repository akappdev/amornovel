At last. Finally, I will end this. His jaw clenched and his skin pulled tight. With tension. With relief. Determined, he jumped from the cloud he stood upon, falling quickly...wind whipping through his hair...</p><p>When he neared ground, he allowed his wings, long and feathered and golden, to unfold from his back and catch in the current, slowing his progress.He was a soldier for the One True Deity. One of the Elite Seven, created before time itself. With as many millennia as he\u2019d lived, he\u2019d come to learn that each of the Elite Seven had one temptation. One potential downfall. Like Eve with her apple. When they found this...thing, this abomination, they happily destroyed it before it could destroy them.</p><p>Lysander had finally found his.</p> <p>Bianka Skyhawk.</p><p>She was the daughter of a Harpy and a phoenix shape-shifter. She was a thief, a liar and a killer who found joy in the vilest of tasks. Worse, the blood of Lucifer\u2014his greatest enemy and the sire of most demon hordes\u2014flowed through her veins. Which meant Bianka was his enemy.</p><p>He lived to destroy his enemies.</p><p>However, he could only act against them when they broke a heavenly law. For demons, that involved escaping their fiery prison to walk the earth. For Bianka, who had never been condemned to hell, that would have to involve something else. What, he didn\u2019t know. All he knew was that he\u2019d never experienced what mortals referred to as \u201cdesire.\u201d</p><p>Until Bianka.</p> <p>And he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her for the first time several weeks ago, long black hair flowing down her back, amber eyes bright and lips bloodred. Watching her, unable to turn away, a single question had drifted through his mind: Was her pearl-like skin as soft as it appeared?</p><p>Forget desire. He\u2019d never wondered such a thing about anyone before. He\u2019d never cared. But the question was becoming an obsession, discovering the truth a need. And it had to end. Now. This day.</p><p>He landed just in front of her, but she couldn\u2019t see him. No one could. He existed on another plane, invisible to mortal and immortal alike. He could scream, and she would not hear him. He could walk through her, and she would not feel him. For that matter, she would not smell or sense him in any way.</p><p>Until it was too late.</p><p>He could have formed a fiery sword from air and cleaved her head from her body, but didn\u2019t. As he\u2019d already realized and accepted, he could not kill her. Yet. But he could not allow her to roam unfettered, tempting him, a plague to his good sense, either. Which meant he would have to settle for imprisoning her in his home in the sky.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t have to be a terrible ordeal for him, however. He could use their time together to show her the right way to live. And the right way was, of course, his way. What\u2019s more, if she did not conform, if she did finally commit that unpardonable sin, he would be there, at last able to rid himself of her influence.</p><p>Do it. Take her.</p><p>He reached out. But just before he could wrap his arms around her and fly her away, he realized she was no longer alone. He scowled, his arms falling to his sides. He did not want a witness to his deeds.</p><p>\u201cBest day ever,\u201d Bianka shouted skyward, splaying her arms and twirling. Two champagne bottles were clutched in her hands and those bottles flew from her grip, slamming into the ice-mountains of Alaska surrounding her. She stopped, swayed, laughed. \u201cOopsie.\u201d</p><p>His scowl deepened. A perfect opportunity lost, he realized. Clearly, she was intoxicated. She wouldn\u2019t have fought him. Would have assumed he was a hallucination or that they were playing a game. Having watched her these past few weeks, he knew how much she liked to play games.</p><p>\u201cWaster,\u201d her sister, the intruder, grumbled. Though they were twins, Bianka and Kaia looked nothing alike. Kaia had red hair and gray eyes flecked with gold. She was shorter than Bianka, her beauty more delicate. \u201cI had to stalk a collector for days\u2014days!\u2014to steal that. Seriously. You just busted Dom P\u00e9rignon White Gold Jeroboam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d Mist wafted from Bianka\u2019s mouth. \u201cThey sell Boone\u2019s Farm in town.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, a sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s only acceptable if you also steal me some cheese tots. I used to highjack them from Sabin every day, and now that we\u2019ve left Budapest, I\u2019m in withdrawal.\u201d</p> <p>Lysander tried to pay attention to the conversation, he really did. But being this close to Bianka was, as always, ruining his concentration. Only her skin was similar to her sister\u2019s, reflecting all the colors of a newly sprung rainbow. So why didn\u2019t he wonder if Kaia\u2019s skin was as soft as it appeared?</p><p>Because she is not your temptation. You know this.</p><p>There, atop a peak of Devil\u2019s Thumb, he watched as Bianka plopped to her bottom. Frigid mist continued to waft around her, making her look as if she were part of a dream. Or an angel\u2019s nightmare.</p><p>\u201cBut you know,\u201d Kaia added, \u201cstealing Boone\u2019s Farm in town doesn\u2019t help me now. I\u2019m only partially buzzed and was hoping to be totally and completely smashed by the time the sun set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be thanking me, then. You got smashed last night. And the night before. And the night before that.\u201d</p><p>Kaia shrugged. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your life is in a rut. You steal liquor, climb a mountain while drinking and dive off when drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then yours is in a rut, too, since you\u2019ve been with me each of those nights.\u201d The redhead frowned. \u201cStill. Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe we need a change.\u201d She gazed around the majestic summit. \u201cSo what new and exciting thing do you want to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplain. Can you believe Gwennie is getting married?\u201d Bianka asked. \u201cAnd to Sabin, keeper of the demon of Doubt, of all people. Or demons. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Gwennie. Gwendolyn. Their youngest sister.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s weird.\u201d A still-frowning Kaia eased down beside her. \u201cWould you rather be a bridesmaid or be hit by a bus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bus. No question. That, I\u2019d recover from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Bianka did not like weddings? Odd. Most females craved them. Still. No need for the bus, Lysander wanted to tell her. You will not be attending your sister\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cSo which of us will be her maid of honor, do you think?\u201d Kaia asked.</p><p>\u201cNot it,\u201d Bianka said, just as Kaia opened her mouth to say the same.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>Bianka laughed with genuine amusement. \u201cYour duties shouldn\u2019t be too bad. Gwennie\u2019s the nicest of the Skyhawks, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice when she\u2019s not protecting Sabin, that is.\u201d Kaia shuddered. \u201cI swear, threaten the man with a little bodily harm, and she\u2019s ready to claw your eyes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink we\u2019ll ever fall in love like that?\u201d As curious as Bianka sounded, there was also a hint of sadness in her voice.</p><p>Why sadness? Did she want to fall in love? Or was she thinking of a particular man she yearned for? Lysander had not yet seen her interact with a male she desired.</p><p>Kaia waved a deceptively delicate hand through the air. \u201cWe\u2019ve been alive for centuries without falling. Clearly, it\u2019s just not meant to be. But I, for one, am glad about that. Men become a liability when you try and make them permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d was the reply. \u201cBut a fun liability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And I haven\u2019t had fun in a long time,\u201d Kaia said with a pout.</p><p>\u201cMe, either. Except with myself, but I don\u2019t suppose that counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does the way I do it.\u201d</p><p>They shared another laugh.</p><p>Fun. Sex, Lysander realized, now having no trouble keeping up with their conversation. They were discussing sex. Something he\u2019d never tried. Not even with himself. He\u2019d never wanted to try, either. Still didn\u2019t. Not even with Bianka and her amazing (soft?) skin.</p><p>As long as he\u2019d been alive\u2014a span of time far greater than their few hundred years\u2014he\u2019d seen many humans caught up in the act. It looked...messy. As un-fun as something could be. Yet humans betrayed their friends and family to do it. They even willingly, happily gave up hard-earned money in exchange for it. When not taking part themselves, they became obsessed with it, watching others do it on a television or computer screen.</p><p>\u201cWe should have nailed one of the Lords when we were in Buda,\u201d Kaia said thoughtfully. \u201cParis is hawt.\u201d</p><p>She could only be referring to the Lords of the Underworld. Immortal warriors possessed by the demons once locked inside Pandora\u2019s box. As Lysander had observed them throughout the centuries, ensuring they obeyed heavenly laws\u2014since their demons had escaped hell before those laws were enacted, no one having thought escape possible, they had not been killed but thrust into that box first, and the Lords second\u2014he knew that Paris was host to Promiscuity, forced to bed a new person every day or weaken and die.</p><p>\u201cParis is hot, yes, but I liked Amun.\u201d Bianka stretched to her back, mist again whipping around her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak, which makes him the perfect man in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Amun, the host of the demon of Secrets. So. Bianka liked him, did she? Lysander pictured the warrior. Tall, though Lysander was taller. Muscled, though Lysander was more so. Dark where Lysander was light. He was actually relieved to know the Harpy preferred a different type of male than himself.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t change her fate, but it did lessen Lysander\u2019s burden. He hadn\u2019t been sure what he would have done if she\u2019d asked him to touch her. That she wouldn\u2019t was most definitely a relief.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aeron?\u201d Kaia asked. \u201cAll those tattoos...\u201d A moan slipped from her as she shivered. \u201cI could trace every single one of them with my tongue.\u201d</p><p>Aeron, host of Wrath. One of only two Lords with wings, Aeron\u2019s were black and gossamer. He had tattoos all over his body, and looked every inch the demon he was. What\u2019s more, he had recently broken a spiritual covenant. Therefore, Aeron would be dead before the upcoming nuptials.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s charge, Olivia, had been ordered to slay the warrior. So far she had resisted the decree. The girl was too softhearted for her own good. Eventually, though, she would do her duty. Otherwise, she would be kicked to earth, immortal no longer, and that was not a fate Lysander would allow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of all the angels he\u2019d trained, she was by far his favorite. As gentle as she was, a man couldn\u2019t help but want to make her happy. She was trustworthy, loyal and all that was pure; she was the type of female who should have tempted him. A female he might have been able to accept in a romantic way. Wild Bianka...no. Never.</p><p>\u201cHowever will I choose between my two favorite Lords, B?\u201d Another sigh returned Lysander\u2019s focus to the Harpies.</p><p>Bianka rolled her eyes. \u201cJust sample them both. Not like you haven\u2019t enjoyed a twofer before.\u201d</p> <p>Kaia laughed, though the amusement didn\u2019t quite reach her voice. Like Bianka, there was a twinge of sadness to the sound. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Lysander\u2019s mouth curled in mild distaste. Two different partners in one day. Or at the same time. Had Bianka done that, too? Probably.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Kaia asked. \u201cYou gonna hook up with Amun at the wedding?\u201d</p><p>There was a long, heavy pause. Then Bianka shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Probably.\u201d</p><p>He should leave and return when she was alone. The more he learned about her, the more he disliked her. Soon he would simply snatch her up, no matter who watched, revealing his presence, his intentions, just to save this world from her dark influence.</p> <p>He flapped his wings once, twice, lifting into the air.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want more than anything else in the world?\u201d she asked, rolling to her side and facing her sister. Facing Lysander directly, as well. Her eyes were wide, amber irises luminous. Beams of sunlight seemed to soak into that glorious skin, and he found himself pausing.</p><p>Kaia stretched out beside her. \u201cTo co-host Good Morning America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m stumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Bianka nibbled on her bottom lip. Opened her mouth. Closed her mouth. Scowled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but you can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p> <p>The redhead pretended to twist a lock over her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, K. Tell anyone, and I\u2019ll deny it then hunt you down and chop off your head.\u201d</p><p>Would she truly? Lysander wondered. Again, probably. He could not imagine hurting his Olivia, whom he loved like a sister. Maybe because she was not one of the Elite Seven, but was a joy-bringer, the weakest of the angels.</p><p>There were three angelic factions. The Elite Seven, the warriors and the joy-bringers. Their status was reflected in both their different duties and the color of their wings. Each of the Seven possessed golden wings, like his own. Warriors possessed white wings merely threaded with gold, and the joy-bringers\u2019 white wings bore no gold at all.</p><p>Olivia had been a joy-bringer all the centuries of her existence. Something she was quite happy with. That was why everyone, including Olivia, had experienced such shock when golden down had begun to grow in her feathers.</p><p>Not Lysander, however. He\u2019d petitioned the Angelic Council, and they\u2019d agreed. It had needed to be done. She was too fascinated by the demon-possessed warrior Aeron. Too...infatuated. Ridding her of such an attraction was imperative. As he well knew.</p><p>His hand clenched into a fist. He blamed himself for Olivia\u2019s circumstances. He had sent her to watch the Lords. To study them. He should have gone himself, but he\u2019d hoped to avoid Bianka.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t just lie there. Tell me what you want to do more than anything else in the world,\u201d Kaia exclaimed, once again drawing his attention.</p> <p>Bianka uttered another sigh. \u201cI want to sleep with a man.\u201d</p><p>Kaia\u2019s brow scrunched in confusion. \u201cUh, hello. Wasn\u2019t that what we were just discussing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dummy. I mean, I want to sleep. As in, conk out. As in, snore my ass off.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence as Kaia absorbed the announcement. \u201cWhat! That\u2019s forbidden. Stupid. Dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Harpies lived by two rules, he knew. They could only eat what they stole or earned, and they could not sleep in the presence of another. The first was because of a curse on all Harpy-kind, and the second because Harpies were suspicious and untrusting by nature.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s head tilted to the side as he found himself imagining holding Bianka in his arms as she drifted into slumber. That fall of dark curls would tumble over his arm and chest. Her warmth would seep into his body. Her leg would rub over his.</p><p>He could never allow it, of course, but that didn\u2019t diminish the power of the vision. To hold her, protect her, comfort her would be...nice.</p><p>Would her skin be as soft as it appeared?</p><p>His teeth ground together. There was that ridiculous question again. I do not care. It does not matter.</p><p>\u201cForget I said anything,\u201d Bianka grumbled, once more flopping to her back and staring up at the bright sky.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Your words are singed into my ears. Do you know what happened to our ancestors when they were stupid enough to fall asl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay. Yes.\u201d She pushed to her feet. The faux fur coat she wore was bloodred, same as her lips, and a vivid contrast to the white ice around her. Her boots were black and climbed to her knees. She wore skintight pants, also black. She looked wicked and beautiful.</p><p>Would her skin be as soft as it appeared?</p><p>Before he realized what he was doing, he was standing in front of her, reaching out, fingers tingling. What are you doing? Stop! He froze. Backed several steps away.</p><p>Sweet heaven. How close he\u2019d come to giving in to the temptation of her.</p><p>He could not wait any longer. Could not wait until she was alone. He had to act now. His reaction to her was growing stronger. Any more, and he would touch her. And if he liked touching her, he might want to do more. That was how temptation worked. You gave in to one thing, then yearned for another. And another. Soon, you were lost.</p><p>\u201cEnough heavy talk. Let\u2019s get back to our boring routine and jump,\u201d Bianka said, stalking to the edge of the peak. \u201cYou know the rules. Girl who breaks the least amount of bones wins. If you die, you lose. For, like, ever.\u201d She gazed down.</p><p>So did Lysander. There were crests and dips along the way, ice bounders with sharp, deadly ridges and thousands of feet of air. Such a jump would have killed a mortal, no question. The Harpy merely joked about the possibility, as if it were of no consequence. Did she think herself invulnerable?</p><p>Kaia lumbered to her feet and swayed from the liquor still pouring through her. \u201cFine, but don\u2019t think this is the last of our conversation about sleeping habits and stupid girls who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bianka dove.</p><p>Lysander expected the action, but was still surprised by it. He followed her down. She spread her arms, closed her eyes, grinning foolishly. That grin...affected him. Clearly she reveled in the freedom of soaring. Something he often did, as well. But she would not have the end she desired.</p><p>Seconds before she slammed into a boulder, Lysander allowed himself to materialize in her plane. He grabbed her, arms catching under hers, wings unfolding, slowing them. Her legs slapped against him, jarring him, but he didn\u2019t release his hold.</p><p>A gasp escaped her, and her eyelids popped open. When she spotted him, amber eyes clashing with the dark of his, that gasp became a growl.</p><p>Most would have asked who he was or demanded he go away. Not Bianka.</p><p>\u201cBig mistake, Stranger Danger,\u201d she snapped. \u201cOne you\u2019ll pay for.\u201d</p><p>As many battles as he\u2019d fought over the years and as many opponents as he\u2019d slain, he didn\u2019t have to see to know she had just unsheathed a blade from a hidden slit in her coat. And he didn\u2019t have to be a psychic to know she meant to stab him.</p><p>\u201cIt is you who made the mistake, Harpy. But do not worry. I have every intention of rectifying that.\u201d Before she could ensure that her weapon met its intended target, he whisked her into another plane, into his home\u2014where she would stay. Forever.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>BIANKA SKYHAWK GAPED at her new surroundings. One moment she\u2019d been tumbling toward an icy valley, intent on escaping her sister\u2019s line of questioning, as well as winning their break-the-least-amount-of-bones game, and the next she\u2019d been in the arms of a gorgeous blond. Which wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. She\u2019d tried to stab him, and he\u2019d blocked her. Freaking blocked her. No one should be able to block a Harpy\u2019s deathblow.</p><p>Now she was standing inside a cloud-slash-palace. A palace that was bigger than any home she\u2019d ever seen. A palace that was warm and sweetly scented, with an almost tangible sense of peace wafting through the air.The walls were wisps of white and smoke, and as she watched, murals formed, seemingly alive, winged creatures, both angelic and demonic, soaring through a morning sky. They reminded her of Danika\u2019s paintings. Danika\u2014the All-Seeing Eye who watched both heaven and hell. The floors, though comprised of that same ethereal substance, allowing a view of the land and people below, were somehow solid.</p><p>Angelic. Cloud. Heaven? Dread flooded her as she spun to face the male who had grabbed her. \u201cAngelic\u201d described him perfectly. From the top of his pale head to the strength in that leanly muscled, sun-kissed body, to the golden wings stretching from his back. Even the white robe that fell to his ankles and the sandals wrapped around his feet gave him a saintly aura.</p><p>Was he an angel, then? Her heart skipped a beat. He wasn\u2019t human, that was for sure. No human male could ever hope to compare to such blinding perfection. But damn, those eyes...they were dark and hard and almost, well, empty.</p><p>His eyes don\u2019t matter. Angels were demon assassins, and she was as close to a demon as a girl could get. After all, her great-grandfather was Lucifer himself. Lucifer, who had spent a year on earth unfettered, pillaging and raping. Only a few females had conceived, but those that had soon gave birth to the first of the Harpies.</p><p>Unsure of what to do, Bianka strode around her blond; he remained in place, even when she was at his back, as if he had nothing to fear from her. Maybe he didn\u2019t. Obviously he had powers. One, he\u2019d blocked her\u2014she just couldn\u2019t get over that fact\u2014and two, he\u2019d somehow removed her coat and all her weapons without touching her.</p><p>\u201cAre you an angel?\u201d she asked when she was once again in front of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation. As if his heritage wasn\u2019t something to be ashamed of.</p><p>Poor guy, she thought with a shudder. Clearly he had no idea the crappy hand he\u2019d been dealt. If she had to choose between being an angel and a dog, she\u2019d choose the dog. They, at least, were respectable.</p><p>She\u2019d never been this close to an angel before. Seen one, yes. Or rather, seen what she\u2019d thought was an angel but had later learned was a demon in disguise. Either way, she hadn\u2019t liked the guy, her youngest sister\u2019s father. He considered himself a god and everyone else beneath him.</p> <p>\u201cDid you bring me here to kill me?\u201d she asked. Not that he\u2019d have any luck. He would find that she was not an easy target. Many immortals had tried to finish her off over the years, but none had succeeded. Obviously.</p><p>He sighed, warm breath trekking over her cheeks. She had accidentally-on-purpose closed some of the distance between them; he smelled of the icecaps she so loved. Fresh and crisp with just a hint of earthy spice.</p><p>When he realized that only a whisper separated them, his lips, too full for a man but somehow perfect for him, pressed into a mulish line. Though she didn\u2019t see him move, he was suddenly a few more inches away from her. Huh. Interesting. Had he increased the distance on purpose?</p><p>Curious, she stepped toward him.</p><p>He backed away.</p> <p>He had. Why? Was he scared of her?</p><p>Just to be contrary, as she often was, she stepped toward him again. Again, he stepped away. So. The big, bad angel didn\u2019t want to be within striking distance. She almost grinned.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she prompted. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did not bring you here to kill you.\u201d His voice was rich, sultry, a sin all its own. And yet, there was a layer of absolute truth to it, and she suspected she would have believed anything he said. As if whatever he said was simply fated, meant to be. Unchangeable. \u201cI want you to emulate my life. I want you to learn from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d What would he do if she touched him? The tiny gossamer wings on her own back fluttered at the thought. Her T-shirt was designed especially for her kind, the material loose to keep from pinning those wings as she jolted into super-speed. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t answer. Let\u2019s make out first.\u201d A lie, but he didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he said, his patience clearly waning. \u201cThis is not a game. Do not make me bind you to my bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOhh, now that I like. Sounds kinky.\u201d She darted around him, running her fingertips over his cheek, his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re as soft as a baby.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath, stiffened. \u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut better equipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka!\u201d</p><p>She patted his butt. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will cease that immediately!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d She laughed, the amused, carefree sound echoing between them.</p><p>Scowling, he reached out and latched on to her upper arm. There wasn\u2019t time to evade him; shockingly, he was faster than she was. He jerked her in front of him, and dark, narrowed eyes stared down at her.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be no touching. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Her gaze flicked to his hand, still clutching her arm. \u201cAt the moment, you\u2019re the one touching me.\u201d</p><p>Like hers, his gaze fell to where they were connected. He licked his lips, and his grip tightened just the way she liked. Then he released her as if she were on fire and once again increased the distance between them.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d His tone was hard and flat.</p><p>What was the problem? He should be begging to touch her. She was a desirable Harpy, damn it. Her body was a work of art and her face total perfection. But for his benefit, she said, \u201cYeah, I understand. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll obey.\u201d Her skin tingled, craving the return of his. Bad girl. Bad, bad girl. He\u2019s a stupid angel and therefore not an appropriate plaything.</p><p>A moment passed as he absorbed her words. \u201cAre you not frightened of me?\u201d His wings folded into his back, arcing over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, raising a brow and doing her best to appear unaffected. \u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Well, then, he\u2019d have to somehow grow the fiery claws of her father\u2019s people. That was the only thing that scared her. Having been scratched as a child, having felt the acid-burn of fire spread through her entire body, having spent days writhing in agonizing, seemingly endless pain, she would do anything to avoid such an experience again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m still not. And now you\u2019re starting to bore me.\u201d She anchored her hands on her hips, glaring up at him. \u201cI asked you a question but you never answered it. Why do you want me to be like you? So much so, that you brought me into heaven, of all places?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below one of his eyes. \u201cBecause I am good and you are evil.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh escaped her. He frowned, and her laughter increased until tears were running from her eyes. When she quieted, she said, \u201cGood job. You staved off the boredom.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cI was not teasing you. I mean to keep you here forever and train you to be sinless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, how\u2014oops, sorry. I mean, golly, how adorable are you? \u2018I mean to keep you here forever and train you,\u2019\u201d she said in her best impersonation of him. There was no reason to fight about her eventual escape. She\u2019d prove him wrong just as soon as she decided to leave. Right now, she was too intrigued. With her surroundings, she assured herself, and not the angel. Heaven was not a place she\u2019d ever thought to visit.</p><p>His chin lifted a notch, but his eyes remained expressionless. \u201cI am serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. But you\u2019ll find that you can\u2019t keep me anywhere I don\u2019t want to be. And me? Without sin? Funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p><p>His confidence might have unnerved her had she been less confident in her own abilities. As a Harpy, she could lift a semi as if it were no more significant than a pebble, could move faster than the human eye could see and had no problem slaying an unwelcome host.</p><p>\u201cBe honest,\u201d she said. \u201cYou saw me and wanted a piece, right?\u201d</p><p>For the briefest of moments, horror blanketed his face. \u201cNo,\u201d he croaked out, then cleared his throat and said more smoothly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Insulting bastard. Why such horror at the thought of being with her? She was the one who should be horrified. He was clearly a do-gooder, more so than she\u2019d realized. I am good and you are evil, he\u2019d said. Ugh.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me again why you want to change me. Didn\u2019t anyone ever tell you that you shouldn\u2019t mess with perfection?\u201d</p><p>That muscle started ticking below his eye again. \u201cYou are a menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, dude.\u201d She liked to steal\u2014so what. She could kill without blinking\u2014again, so what. It wasn\u2019t like she worked for the IRS or anything. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister, Kaia? She\u2019s as much a menace as I am, I\u2019m sure. So why don\u2019t you want to change her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is still in Alaska, wondering if you are buried inside an ice cave. And you are my only project at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Project? Bastard. But she did like the thought of Kaia searching high and low but finding no sign of her, almost like they were playing a game of Hide and Seek. Bianka would totally, finally win.</p><p>\u201cYou appear...excited,\u201d he said, head tilting to the side. \u201cWhy? Does her concern not disturb you?\u201d</p><p>Yep. A certified do-gooder. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be here long.\u201d She peeked over his shoulder; more of that wisping white greeted her. \u201cGot anything to drink here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Slowly the corners of her lips lifted. \u201cI guess that means you like to go naked. Awesome.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks reddened. \u201cEnough. You are trying to bait me and I do not like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have brought me here.\u201d Hey, wait a minute. He\u2019d never really told her why he\u2019d chosen her as his project, she realized. \u201cBe honest. Do you need my help with something?\u201d After all, she, like many of her fellow Harpies, was a mercenary, paid to find and retrieve. Her motto: if it\u2019s unethical and illegal and you\u2019ve got the cash, I\u2019m your girl! \u201cI mean, I know you didn\u2019t just bring me here to save the world from my naughty influence. Otherwise, millions of other people would be here with me.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his massive chest.</p><p>She sighed. Knowing men as she did, she knew he was done answering that type of question. Oh, well. She could have convinced him otherwise by annoying him until he caved, but she didn\u2019t want to put the work in.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do for fun around here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI destroy demons.\u201d</p><p>Like you, she finished for him. But he\u2019d already said he had no intention of killing her, and she believed him\u2014how could she not? That voice...\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to hurt me, you don\u2019t want to touch me, but you do want me to live here forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be an idiot to refuse such an offer.\u201d That she sounded sincere was a miracle. \u201cWe\u2019ll pretend to be married and spend the nights locked in each other\u2019s arms, kissing and touching, our bodies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just stop.\u201d And, drumroll please, that muscle began ticking under his eye again.</p><p>This time, there was no fighting her grin. It spread wide and proud. That tic was a sign of anger, surely. But what would it take to make that anger actually seep into his irises? What would it take to break even a fraction of his iron control?</p><p>\u201cShow me around,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to live here, I need to know where my walk-in closet is.\u201d During the tour, she could accidentally-on-purpose brush against him. Over and over again. \u201cDo we have cable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I cannot give you a tour. I have duties. Important duties.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, you do. My pleasure. That should be priority one.\u201d</p><p>Teeth grinding together, he turned on his heel and strode away. \u201cYou will find it difficult to get into trouble here, so I suggest you do not even try.\u201d His voice echoed behind him.</p><p>Please. She could get into trouble with nothing but a toothpick and a spoon. \u201cIf you leave, I\u2019ll rearrange everything.\u201d Not that there was any furniture to be seen.</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get bored and take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>It was a response, at least. \u201cSo you\u2019re seriously going to leave me? Just like that?\u201d She snapped her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Another response, though he didn\u2019t stop walking.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about that bed you were going to chain me to? Where is it?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh, back to silence.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell me your name,\u201d she called, irritated despite herself. How could he abandon her like that? He should hunger for more of her. \u201cWell? I deserve to know the name of the man I\u2019ll be cursing.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he stopped. Still, a long while passed in silence and she thought he meant to ignore her. Again. Then he said, \u201cMy name is Lysander,\u201d and stepped from the cloud, disappearing from view.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>LYSANDER WATCHED AS TWO newly recruited warrior angels\u2014angels under his training and command\u2014finally subdued a demonic minion that had dug its way free from hell. The creature was scaled from head to hoof and little horns protruded from its shoulders and back. Its eyes were bright red, like crystallized blood.</p> <p>The fight had lasted half an hour, and both angels were now bleeding, panting. Demons were notorious for their biting and scratching.Lysander should have been able to critique the men and tell them what they had done wrong. That way, they would do a better job next time. But as they\u2019d struggled with the fiend, his mind had drifted to Bianka. What was she doing? Was she resigned to her fate yet? He\u2019d given her several days alone to calm and accept.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d one of his trainees asked. Beacon was his name.</p><p>\u201cYou letsss me go, you letsss me go,\u201d the demon said pleadingly, its forked tongue giving it a lisp. \u201cI behave. I return. Ssswear.\u201d</p><p>Lies. As a minion, it was a servant to a demon High Lord\u2014just as there were three factions of angels, there were three factions of demons. High Lords held the most power, followed by Lords, who were followed by the lowest of them all, minions. Despite this one\u2019s lack of status, it could cause untold damage among humans. Not only because it was evil, but also because it was a minion of Strife and took its nourishment from the trouble it caused others.</p><p>By the time Lysander had sensed its presence on earth, it had already broken up two marriages and convinced one teenager to start smoking and another to kill himself.</p><p>\u201cExecute it,\u201d Lysander commanded. \u201cIt knew the consequences of breaking a heavenly law, yet it chose to escape from hell anyway.\u201d</p><p>The minion began to struggle again. \u201cYou going to lisssten to him when you obviousssly ssstronger and better than him? He make you do all hard work. He do nothing hissself. Lazy, if you asssk me. Kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not ask you,\u201d Lysander said.</p> <p>Both angels raised their hands and fiery swords appeared.</p><p>\u201cPleassse,\u201d the demon screeched. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t do thisss.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t hesitate. They struck.</p><p>The scaled head rolled, yet the angels did not dematerialize their swords. They kept the tips poised on the motionless body until it caught flame. When nothing but ash remained, they looked to Lysander for instruction.</p><p>\u201cExcellent job.\u201d He nodded in satisfaction. \u201cYou have improved since your last killing, and I am proud of you. But you will train with Raphael until further notice,\u201d he said. Raphael was strong, intelligent and one of the best trackers in the heavens.</p><p>Raphael would not be distracted by a Harpy he had no hopes of possessing.</p><p>Possessing? Lysander\u2019s jaw clenched tightly. He was not some vile demon. He possessed nothing. Ever. And when he finished with Bianka, she would be glad of that. There would be no more games, no more racing around him, caressing him and laughing. The clenching in his jaw stopped, but his shoulders sagged. In disappointment? Couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Perhaps he needed a few days to calm and accept.</p><p>HE\u2019D LEFT HER ALONE for a week, the sun rising and setting beyond the clouds. And each day, Bianka grew madder\u2014and madder. And madder. Worse, she grew weaker. Harpies could only eat what they stole (or earned, but there was no way to earn a single morsel here). And no, that wasn\u2019t a rule she could overlook. It was a curse. A godly curse her people had endured for centuries. Reviled as Harpies were, the gods had banded together and decreed that no Harpy could enjoy a meal freely given or one they had prepared themselves. If they did, they sickened terribly. The gods\u2019 hope? Destruction.</p><p>Instead, they\u2019d merely ensured Harpies learned how to steal from birth. To survive, even an angel would sin.Lysander would learn that firsthand. She would make sure of it. Bastard.</p><p>Had he planned this to torture her?</p><p>In this palace, Bianka had only to speak of something and it would materialize before her. An apple\u2014bright and red and juicy. Baked turkey\u2014succulent and plump. But she couldn\u2019t eat them, and it was killing her. Liter\u2014fucking\u2014ally.</p><p>At first, Bianka had tried to escape. Several times. Unlike Lysander the Cruel, she couldn\u2019t jump from the clouds. The floor expanded wherever she stepped and remained as hard as marble. All she could do was move from ethereal room to ethereal room, watching the murals play out battle scenes. Once she\u2019d thought she\u2019d even spied Lysander.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d said, \u201cRock,\u201d and a nice-size stone had appeared in her hand. She\u2019d chucked it at him, but the stupid thing had fallen to earth rather than hit him.</p><p>Where was he? What was he doing? Did he mean to kill her like this, despite his earlier denial? Slowly and painfully? At least the hunger pains had finally left her. Now she was merely consumed by a sensation of trembling emptiness.</p><p>She wanted to stab him the moment she saw him. Then set him on fire. Then scatter his ashes in a pasture where lots of animals roamed. He deserved to be smothered by several nice steaming piles. Of course, if he waited much longer, she would be the one burned and scattered. She couldn\u2019t even drink a glass of water.</p><p>Besides, fighting him wasn\u2019t the way to punish him. That, she\u2019d realized the first day here. He didn\u2019t like to be touched. Therefore, touching him was the way to punish him. And touch him she would. Anywhere, everywhere. Until he begged her to stop. No. Until he begged her to continue.</p><p>She would make him like it, and then take it away.</p><p>If she lasted.</p><p>Right now, she could barely hold herself up. In fact, why was she even trying?</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d she muttered weakly, and a large four-poster appeared just in front of her. She hadn\u2019t slept since she\u2019d gotten here. Usually she crashed in trees, but she wouldn\u2019t have had the strength to climb one even if the cloud had been filled with them. She collapsed on the plush mattress, velvet coverlet soft against her skin. Sleep. She\u2019d sleep for a little while.</p><p>FINALLY LYSANDER COULD STAND it no more. Nine days. He\u2019d lasted nine days. Nine days of thinking about the female constantly, wondering what she was doing, what she was thinking. If her skin was as soft as it looked.</p><p>He could tolerate it no longer. He would check on her, that was all, and see for himself how\u2014and what\u2014she was doing. Then he would leave her again. Until he got himself under control. Until he stopped thinking about her. Stopped wanting to be near her. Her training had to begin sometime.His wings glided up and down as he soared to his cloud. His heartbeat was a bit...odd. Faster than normal, even bumping against his ribs. Also, his blood was like fire in his veins. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong. Angels only sickened when they were infected with demon poison, and as Lysander had not been bitten by a demon\u2014had not even fought one in weeks\u2014he knew that was not the problem.</p><p>Blame could probably be laid at Bianka\u2019s door, he thought with a scowl.</p><p>First thing he noticed upon entering was the food littering the floor. From fruits to meats to bags of chips. All were uneaten, even unopened.</p><p>Scowl melting into a frown, he folded his wings into his back and stalked forward. He found Bianka inside one of the rooms, lying atop a bed. She wore the same clothing she\u2019d been clad in when he\u2019d first taken her\u2014red shirt, tights that molded to her perfect curves\u2014but had discarded her boots. Her hair was tangled around her, and her skin worryingly pale. There was no sparkle to it, no pearl-like gleam. Bruises now formed half-moons under her eyes.</p><p>Part of him had expected to find her fuming\u2014and out for his head. The other part of him had hoped to find her compliant. Not once had he thought to find her like this.</p><p>She thrashed, the covers bunched around her. His frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cHamburger,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>A juicy burger appeared on the floor a few inches from the bed, all the extras\u2014lettuce, tomato slices, pickles and cheese\u2014decorating the edges of the plate. The manifestation didn\u2019t surprise him. That was the beauty of these angelic homes. Whatever was desired\u2014within reason, of course\u2014was provided.</p><p>All this food, and she hadn\u2019t taken a single bite. Why would she request\u2014It wasn\u2019t stolen, he realized, and for the first time in his endless existence, he was angry with himself. And scared. For her. He hated the emotion, but there it was. She hadn\u2019t eaten in these last nine days because she couldn\u2019t. She was truly starving to death.</p><p>Though he wanted her out of his head, out of his life, he hadn\u2019t wanted her to suffer. Yet suffer she had. Unbearably. Now she was too weak to steal anything. And if he force-fed her, she would vomit, hurting more than she already was. Suddenly he wanted to roar.</p><p>\u201cBlade,\u201d he said, and within a single blink, a sharp-tipped blade rested in his hand. He stalked to the side of the bed. He was trembling.</p><p>\u201cFries. Chocolate shake.\u201d Her voice was soft, barely audible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lysander slashed one of his wrists. Blood instantly spilled from the wound, and he stretched out his arm, forcing each drop to fall into her mouth. Blood was not food for Harpies; it was medicine. Therefore her body could accept it. He\u2019d never freely given his blood to another living being and wasn\u2019t sure he liked the thought of something of his flowing inside this woman\u2019s veins. In fact, the thought actually caused his heartbeat to start slamming against his ribs again. But there was no other way.</p><p>At first, she didn\u2019t act as if she noticed. Then her tongue emerged, licking at the liquid before it could reach her lips. Then her eyes opened, amber irises bright, and she grabbed on to his arm, jerking it to her mouth. Her sharp teeth sank into his skin as she sucked.</p><p>Another odd sensation, he thought. Having a woman drink from him. There was heat and wetness and a sting, yet it was not unpleasant. It actually lanced a pang of...something unnameable straight to his stomach and between his legs.</p> <p>\u201cDrink all you need,\u201d he told her. His body would not run out. Every drop was replaced the moment it left him.</p><p>Her gaze narrowed on him. The more she swallowed, the more fury he saw banked there. Soon her fingers were tightening around his wrist, her nails cutting deep. If she expected some sort of reaction from him, she would not get it. He\u2019d been alive too long and endured far too many injuries to be affected by something so minor. Except for that pang between his legs...What was that?</p><p>Finally, though, she released him. He wasn\u2019t sure if that gladdened him or filled him with disappointment.</p><p>Gladdened, of course, he told himself.</p><p>A trickle of red flowed from the corner of her mouth, and she licked it away. The sight of that pink tongue caused another lance to shoot through him.</p> <p>Definitely disap\u2014uh, gladdened.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she growled through her panting. \u201cYou sick, torturing bastard.\u201d</p><p>He moved out of striking distance. Not to protect himself, but to protect her. If she were to attack him, he would have to subdue her. And if he subdued her, he might hurt her. And accidentally brush against her. Blood...heating...</p><p>\u201cIt was never my intent to harm you,\u201d he said. And now, even his voice was trembling. Odd.</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes what you did okay?\u201d She jerked to a sitting position, all that dark hair spilling around her shoulders. The pearl-like sheen was slowly returning to her skin. \u201cYou left me here, unable to eat. Dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Was that skin as soft as it looked? He gulped. \u201cAnd I am sorry.\u201d Her anger should have overjoyed him. As he\u2019d hoped, she would no longer laugh up at him, her face lit with the force of her amusement. She would no longer race around him, petting him. Yes, he should have been overjoyed. Instead, the disappointment he\u2019d just denied experiencing raced through him. Disappointment mixed with shame.</p> <p>She was more a temptation than he had realized.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d she gasped out. \u201cYou know that I can only consume what I steal or earn and yet you failed to make arrangements for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, hating himself for the first time in his existence.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, you left me here. With no way home.\u201d</p><p>His nod was stiff. \u201cI have since made restitution by saving your life. But as I said, I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, you\u2019re sorry,\u201d she said, throwing up her arms. \u201cThat makes everything better. That makes almost dying acceptable.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his reply. She kicked her legs over the bed and stood. Her skin was at full glow now. \u201cNow you listen up. First, you\u2019re going to find a way to feed me. Then, you\u2019re going to tell me how to get off this stupid cloud. Otherwise I will make your life a hell you\u2019ve never experienced before. Actually, I will anyway. That way, you\u2019ll never forget what happens when you mess with a Harpy.\u201d</p><p>He believed her. Already she affected him more than anyone else ever had. That was hell enough. Proof: his mouth was actually watering to taste her, his hands itching to touch her. Rather than reveal these new developments, however, he said, \u201cYou are powerless here. How would you hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPowerless?\u201d She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d One step, two, she approached him.</p> <p>He held his ground. He would not retreat. Not this time. Assert your authority. \u201cYou cannot leave unless I allow it. The cloud belongs to me and places my will above yours. Therefore, there is no exit for you. You would be wise to curry my favor.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, paused. \u201cSo you still mean to keep me here forever? Even though I have a wedding to attend?\u201d She sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhen did I ever give you the impression that I meant otherwise? Besides, I heard you tell your sister you didn\u2019t want to go to that wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said I didn\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid. But I love my baby sis, so I\u2019ll do it. With a smile.\u201d Bianka ran her tongue over her straight, white teeth. \u201cBut let\u2019s talk about you. You like to eavesdrop, huh? That sounds a little demonic for a goody-goody angel.\u201d</p><p>Over the years he\u2019d been called far worse than demonic. The goody-goody, though...Was that how she saw him? Rather than as the righteous soldier he was? \u201cIn war, I do what I must to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight.\u201d Her eyes narrowed as she crossed her arms over her middle. Stubbornness radiated from her. \u201cWe were at war before I even met you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d A war he would win. But what would he do if he failed to set her on the right path? He would have to destroy her, of course, but for him to legally be allowed to destroy her, he reminded himself, she would first have to commit an unpardonable sin. Though she\u2019d lived a long time, she had never crossed that line. Which meant she would have to be encouraged to do so. But how? Here, away from civilization\u2014both mortal and immortal\u2014she couldn\u2019t free a demon from hell. She couldn\u2019t slay an angel. Besides him, but that would never happen. He was stronger than she was.</p><p>She could blaspheme, he supposed, but he would never\u2014never!\u2014encourage someone to do that, no matter the reason. Not even to save himself.</p><p>The only other possibility was for her to convince an angel to fall. As she was his temptation, and as he was the only angel of her acquaintance, he was the only one she could convince. And he wouldn\u2019t. Again, not for any reason. He loved his life, his Deity, and was proud of his work and all he had accomplished.</p><p>Perhaps he would simply leave Bianka here, alone for the rest of eternity. That way, she could live but would be unable to cause trouble. He would visit her every few weeks\u2014perhaps months\u2014but never remain long enough for her to corrupt him.</p><p>A sudden blow to the cheek sent his head whipping to the side. He frowned, straightened and rubbed the now-stinging spot. Bianka was exactly as she\u2019d been before, standing in front of him. Only now she was smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou hit me,\u201d he said, his astonishment clear.</p><p>\u201cHow sweet of you to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d To be honest, he should not have been surprised. Harpies were as violent by nature as their inhuman counterparts the demons. Why couldn\u2019t she have looked like a demon, though? Why did she have to be so lovely? \u201cI saved you, gave you my blood. I even explained why you could not leave, just as you asked. I did not have to do any of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I really need to repeat your crimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d They were not crimes! But perhaps it was best to change the subject. \u201cAllow me to feed you,\u201d he said. He walked to the plate holding the hamburger and picked it up. The scent of spiced meat wafted to his nose, and his mouth curled in distaste.</p><p>Though he didn\u2019t want to, though his stomach rolled, he took a bite. He wanted to gag, but managed to swallow. Normally he only ate fruits, nuts and vegetables. \u201cThis,\u201d he said with much disgust, \u201cis mine.\u201d Careful not to touch her, he placed the food in her hands. \u201cYou are not to eat it.\u201d</p><p>By staking the verbal claim, the meal did indeed become his. He watched understanding light her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, cool.\u201d She didn\u2019t hesitate to rip into the burger, every crumb gone in seconds. Next he sipped the chocolate shake. The sugar was almost obscene in his mouth, and he did gag. \u201cMine,\u201d he repeated faintly, giving it to her, as well. \u201cBut next time, please request a healthier meal.\u201d</p><p>She flipped him off as she gulped back the ice cream. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He bypassed the French fries. No way was he going to defile his body with one of those greasy abominations. He found an apple, a pear, but had to request a stalk of broccoli himself. After claiming them, he took a bite of each and handed them over. Much better.</p><p>Bianka devoured them. Well, except for the broccoli. That, she threw at him. \u201cI\u2019m a carnivore, moron.\u201d</p><p>She hardly had to remind him when the unpleasant taste of the burger lingered on his tongue. Still, he chose to overlook her mockery. \u201cAll of the food produced in this home is mine. Mine and mine alone. You are to leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great if I were actually staying,\u201d she muttered while stuffing the fries in her mouth.</p><p>He sighed. She would accept her fate soon enough. She would have to.</p><p>The more she ate, the more radiant her skin became. Magnificent, he thought, reaching out before he could stop himself.</p><p>She grabbed his fingers and twisted just before contact. \u201cNope. I don\u2019t like you, so you don\u2019t get to handle the goods.\u201d</p><p>He experienced a sharp pain, but merely blinked over at her. \u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said stiffly. Thank the One True Deity she\u2019d stopped him. No telling what he would have done to her had he actually touched her. Behaved like a slobbering human? He shuddered.</p><p>She shrugged and released him. \u201cNow for my second order. Let me go home.\u201d As she spoke, she assumed a battle stance. Legs braced apart, hands fisted at her sides.</p><p>He mirrored her movements, refusing to admit, even to himself, that her bravery heated his traitorous blood another degree. \u201cYou cannot hurt me, Harpy. Fighting me would be pointless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly her lips curled into a devilish grin. \u201cWho said I was going to try and hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Before Lysander could blink, she closed the distance between them and pressed against him, arms winding around his neck and tugging his head down. Their lips met and her tongue thrust into his mouth. Automatically, he stiffened. He had seen humans kiss more times than he could count, but he\u2019d never longed to try the act for himself.</p><p>Like sex, it seemed messy\u2014in every way imaginable\u2014and unnecessary. But as her tongue rolled against his, as her hands caressed a path down his spine, his body warmed\u2014far more than it had when he\u2019d simply thought of being here with her\u2014and the tingle he\u2019d noticed earlier bloomed once more. Only this time, that tingle grew and spread. Like the shaft between his legs. Rising...thickening...</p> <p>He\u2019d wanted to taste her and now he was. She was delicious, like the apple she\u2019d just eaten, only sweeter, headier, like his favorite wine. He should make her stop. This was too much. But the wetness of her mouth wasn\u2019t messy in the least. It was electrifying.</p><p>More, a little voice said in his head.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she rasped, as if he\u2019d spoken aloud.</p><p>When she rubbed her lower body against his, every sensation intensified. His hands fisted at his sides. He couldn\u2019t touch her. Shouldn\u2019t touch her. Should stop this as she\u2019d stopped him, as he\u2019d already tried to convince himself.</p><p>A moan escaped her. Her fingers tangled in his hair. His scalp, an area he\u2019d never considered sensitive before, ached, soaking up every bit of attention. And when she rubbed against him again, he almost moaned.</p> <p>Her hands fell to his chest and a fingertip brushed one of his nipples. He did moan; he did grab her. His fingers gripped her hips, holding her still even though he wanted to force her to rub against him some more. The lack of motion didn\u2019t slow her kiss. She continued to dance their tongues together, leisurely, as if she could drink from him forever. And wanted to.</p><p>He should stop this, he told himself yet again.</p><p>Yes. Yes, he would. He tried to push her tongue out of his mouth. The pressure created another sensation, this one new and stronger than any other. His entire body felt aflame. He started pushing at her tongue for an entirely different reason, twining them together, tasting her again, licking her, sucking her.</p><p>\u201cMmm, yeah. That\u2019s the way,\u201d she praised.</p><p>Her voice was a drug, luring him in deeper, making him crave more. More, more, more. The temptation was too much, and he had to\u2014</p><p>Temptation.</p> <p>The word echoed through his mind, a sword sharp enough to cut bone. She was a temptation. She was his temptation. And he was allowing her to lead him astray.</p><p>He wrenched away from her, and his arms fell to his sides, heavy as boulders. He was panting, sweating, things he had not done even in the midst of battle. Angry as he was\u2014at her, at himself\u2014his gaze drank in the sight of her. Her skin was flushed, glowing more than ever. Her lips were red and swollen. And he had caused that reaction. Sparks of pride took him by surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou should not have done that,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Slowly she grinned. \u201cWell, you should have stopped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, that grin growing.</p><p>His teeth ground together. \u201cDo not do it again.\u201d</p><p>One of her brows arched in smug challenge. \u201cKeep me here against my will, and I\u2019ll do that and more. Much, much more. In fact...\u201d She ripped her shirt over her head and tossed it aside, revealing breasts covered by pink lace.</p> <p>Breathing became impossible.</p><p>\u201cWant to touch them?\u201d she asked huskily, cupping them with her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll let you. I won\u2019t even make you beg.\u201d</p><p>Holy...Lord. They were lovely. Plump and mouthwatering. Lickable. And if he did lick them, would they taste as her mouth had? Like that heady wine? Blood...heating...again...</p><p>He didn\u2019t care what kind of coward his next action made him. It was either jump from the cloud or replace her hands with his own.</p><p>He jumped.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>LYSANDER LEFT BIANKA alone for another week\u2014bastard!\u2014but she didn\u2019t mind. Not this time. She had plenty to keep her occupied. Like her plan to drive him utterly insane with lust. So insane he\u2019d regret bringing her here. Regret keeping her here. Regret even being alive.</p><p>That, or fall so in love with her that he yearned to grant her every desire. If that was the case\u2014and it was a total possibility since she was insanely hot\u2014she would convince him to take her home, and then she would finally get to stab him in the heart.Perfect. Easy. With her breasts, it was almost too easy, really.</p><p>To set the stage for his downfall, she decorated his home like a bordello. Red velvet lounges now waited next to every door\u2014just in case he was too overcome with desire for her to make it to one of the beds now perched in every corner. Naked portraits\u2014of her\u2014hung on the misty walls. A decorating style she\u2019d picked up from her friend Anya, who just happened to be the goddess of Anarchy.</p><p>As Lysander had promised, Bianka had only to speak what she wanted\u2014within reason\u2014to receive it. Apparently furniture and pretty pictures were within reason. She chuckled. She could hardly wait to see him again. To finally begin.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Not just because of her (magnificent) breasts and hotness\u2014hey, no reason to act as if she didn\u2019t know\u2014but because he had no experience. She had been his first kiss; she knew it beyond any doubt. He\u2019d been stiff at first, unsure. Hesitant. At no point had he known what to do with his hands.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t stopped her from enjoying herself, however. His taste...decadent. Sinful. Like crisp, clean skies mixed with turbulent night storms. And his body, oh, his body. Utter perfection with hard muscles she\u2019d wanted to squeeze. And lick. She wasn\u2019t picky.</p><p>His hair was so silky she could have run her fingers through it forever. His cock had been so long and thick she could have rubbed herself to orgasm. His skin was so warm and smooth she could have pressed against him and slept, just as she\u2019d dreamed about doing before she\u2019d met him. Even though sleeping with a man was a dangerous crime her race never committed.</p><p>Stupid girl! The angel wasn\u2019t to be trusted, especially since he clearly had nefarious plans for her\u2014though he still refused to tell her exactly what those plans were. Teaching her to act like him had to be a misdirection of the truth. It was just too silly to contemplate. But his plans didn\u2019t matter, she supposed, since he would soon be at her mercy. Not that she had any.</p><p>Bianka strode to the closet she\u2019d created and flipped through the lingerie hanging there. Blue, red, black. Lace, leather, satin. Several costumes: naughty nurse, corrupt policewoman, devil, angel. Which should she choose today?</p><p>He already thought her evil. Perhaps she should wear the see-through white lace. Like a horny virgin bride. Oh, yes. That was the one. She laughed as she dressed.</p><p>\u201cMirror, please,\u201d she said, and a full-length mirror appeared in front of her. The gown fell to her ankles, but there was a slit between her legs. A slit that stopped at the apex of her thighs. Too bad she wasn\u2019t wearing any panties.</p><p>Spaghetti straps held the material in place on her shoulders and dipped into a deep vee between her breasts. Her nipples, pink and hard, played peek-a-boo with the swooping make-me-a-woman pattern.</p><p>She left her hair loose, flowing like black velvet down her back. Her gold eyes sparkled, flecks of gray finally evident, like in Kaia\u2019s. Her cheeks were flushed like a rose, her skin devoid of the makeup she usually wore to dull its shimmer.</p><p>Bianka traced her fingertips along her collarbone and chuckled again. She\u2019d summoned a shower and washed off every trace of that makeup. If Lysander had found himself attracted to her before\u2014and he had, the size of his hard-on was proof of that\u2014he would be unable to resist her now. She was nothing short of radiant.</p><p>A Harpy\u2019s skin was like a weapon. A sensual weapon. Its jewel-like sheen drew men in, made them slobbering, drooling fools. Touching it became all they could think about, all they lived for.</p><p>That got old after a while, though, which was why she\u2019d begun wearing full body makeup. For Lysander, though, she would make an exception. He deserved what he got. After all, he wasn\u2019t just making Bianka suffer. He was making her sisters suffer. Maybe.</p><p>Was Kaia still looking for her? Still worried or perhaps thinking this was a game as Bianka had first supposed? Had Kaia called their other sisters and were the girls now searching the world over for a sign of her, as they\u2019d done when Gwennie went missing? Probably not, she thought with a sigh. They knew her, knew her strength and her determination. If they suspected she\u2019d been taken, they would have confidence in her ability to free herself. Still.</p><p>Lysander was an ass.</p><p>And most likely a virgin. Eager, excited, she rubbed her hands together. Most men kissed the women they bedded. And if she had been his first kiss, well, it stood to reason he\u2019d never bedded anyone. Her eagerness faded a bit. But that begged the question, why hadn\u2019t he bedded anyone?</p><p>Was he a young immortal? Had he not found anyone he desired? Did angels not often experience sexual need? She didn\u2019t know much about them. Fine, she didn\u2019t know anything about them. Did they consider sex wrong? Maybe. That would explain why he hadn\u2019t wanted to touch her, too.</p><p>Okay, so it made more sense that he simply hadn\u2019t experienced sexual need before.</p><p>He\u2019d definitely experienced it during their kiss, though. She went back to rubbing her hands together.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing? Or better yet, not wearing?\u201d</p><p>Heart skidding to a stop, Bianka whipped around. As if her thoughts had summoned him, Lysander stood in the room\u2019s doorway. Mist enveloped him and for a moment she feared he was nothing more than a fantasy.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>In her fantasies, he would not be angry. He would be overcome with desire. So...he was here, and he was real. And he was peering at her breasts in open-mouthed astonishment.</p><p>Astonishment was better than anger. She almost grinned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d she asked, smoothing her palms over her hips. Let the games begin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Like it, she finished for him. With the amount of truth that always layered his voice, he probably couldn\u2019t utter a single lie.</p> <p>\u201cYour skin...it\u2019s different. I mean, I saw the pearlesque tones before, but now...it\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d She twirled, her gown dancing at her ankles. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d His tongue traced his teeth as the anger she\u2019d first suspected glazed his features. \u201cCover her,\u201d he barked.</p><p>A moment later, a white robe draped her from shoulders to feet.</p><p>She scowled. \u201cReturn my teddy.\u201d The robe disappeared, leaving her in the white lace. \u201cTry that again,\u201d she told him, \u201cand I\u2019ll just walk around naked. You know, like I am in the portraits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPortraits?\u201d Brow furrowing, he gazed about the room. When he spotted one of the pictures of her, sans clothing, reclining against a giant silver boulder, he hissed in a breath.</p><p>Exactly the reaction she\u2019d been hoping for. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I turned this quaint little cloud into a love nest so I\u2019d feel more at home. And again, if you remove anything, my redesign will be a thousand times worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do to me?\u201d he growled, facing her. His eyes were narrowed, his lips thinned, his teeth bared.</p><p>She fluttered her lashes at him, all innocence. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>It was a warning, she knew, but she didn\u2019t heed it. \u201cI think it\u2019s my turn to ask the questions. So where do you go when you leave me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is not your concern.\u201d</p><p>Was he panting a little? \u201cLet\u2019s see if I can make it my concern, shall we?\u201d She sauntered to the bed and eased onto the edge. Naughty, shameless girl that she was, she spread her legs, giving him the peek of a lifetime. \u201cFor every question you answer, I\u2019ll put something on,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>He spun, but not before she saw the shock and desire that played over his harshly gorgeous face. \u201cI do my duty. Watch the gates to hell. Hunt and kill demons that have escaped. Deliver punishment to those in need. Guard humans. Now cover yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say what item of clothing I\u2019d don, now did I?\u201d She gave herself a once-over. \u201cOne shoe, please. White leather, high heel, open toe. Ties up the calf.\u201d The shoe materialized on her foot, and she laughed. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA trickster,\u201d Lysander muttered. \u201cI should have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I trick you? Did you ask for specifics? No, because you were secretly hoping I wouldn\u2019t cover myself at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not true,\u201d he said, but for once, she did not hear that layer of honesty in his voice. Interesting. When he lied, or perhaps when he was unsure about what he was saying, his tone was as normal as hers.</p><p>That meant she would always know when he lied. Did things get any better than that?</p> <p>This was going to be even easier than she\u2019d anticipated. \u201cNext question. Do you think about me while you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Thick, heavy.</p><p>Wait. She could hear him breathing. In, out, harsh, shallow. He was panting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cBut since you really didn\u2019t answer, I don\u2019t have to add the other shoe.\u201d</p><p>Again, he didn\u2019t reply. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t leave, either.</p><p>\u201cOnward and upward. Are angels allowed to dally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they rarely want to,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>So she\u2019d been right. He didn\u2019t have firsthand knowledge of desire. What he was now feeling had to be confusing him, then. Was that why he\u2019d brought her here? Because he\u2019d seen her and wanted her, but hadn\u2019t known how to handle what he was feeling? The thought was almost...flattering. In a stalkerish kind of way, of course. That didn\u2019t change her plans, however. She would seduce him\u2014and then she would slice his heart in two. A symbolic gesture, really. An inside joke between them. Well, for herself. He might not get it.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t deny that she liked the idea of being his first. None of the women after her would compare, of course, and that\u2014Hey, wait. Once he tasted the bliss of the flesh, he would want more. Bianka would have escaped him and stabbed him\u2014and he would have recovered because he was an immortal\u2014by then. He could go to any other female he desired.</p><p>He would kiss and touch that female.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d she snapped back. Her hands were clenched, her nails cutting her palms. He could be with anyone; it wouldn\u2019t bother her. They were enemies. Someone else could deal with his Neanderthal tendencies. But gods, she might just kill the next woman who warmed his bed out of spite. Not jealousy.</p><p>\u201cI answered one of your questions. You must add a garment to your body. Panties would be nice.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019d like the other shoe to appear, please.\u201d A moment later, her other foot was covered. \u201cBack to business. Did you return so that I\u2019d kiss you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I wanted to taste you again. I wanted to touch you again. Maybe let you touch me this time. I\u2019ve been aching since you left me. Had to bring myself to climax twice just to cool the fever. But don\u2019t worry, I imagined it was you. I imagined stripping you, licking you, sucking you into my mouth. Mmm, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he croaked out, spinning to face her. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>His eyes, which she\u2019d once thought were black and emotionless, were now bright as a morning sky, his pupils blown with the intensity of his desire. But rather than stalk to her, grab her and smash his body into hers, he held out his hand, fingers splayed. A fiery sword formed from the air, yellow-gold flames flickering all around it.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he commanded again. \u201cI do not want to hurt you, but I will if you persist with this foolishness.\u201d</p><p>That layer of truth had returned to his voice.</p><p>Far from intimidating her, his forcefulness excited her. I thought you didn\u2019t like his Neanderthal tendencies.</p><p>Oh, shut up.</p><p>Bianka leaned back, resting her weight against her elbows. \u201cDoes Lysandy like to play rough? Should I be wearing black leather? Or is this a game of bad cop, naughty criminal? Should I strip for my body-cavity search?\u201d</p><p>He stalked to the edge of the bed, his thick legs encasing her smaller ones, pressing her knees together. He was hard as a rock, his robe jutting forward. Those golden flames still flickering around the sword both highlighted his face and cast shadows, giving him a menacing aura.</p><p>Just then, he was both angel and demon. A mix of good and evil. Savior and executioner.</p><p>Her wings fluttered frantically, readying for battle\u2014even as her skin tingled for pleasure. She could be across the room before he moved even a fraction of an inch. Still. She had trouble catching her breath; it was like ice in her lungs. And yet her blood was hot as his sword. This mix of emotions was odd.</p><p>\u201cYou are worse than I anticipated,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>If this progressed the way she hoped, he would be very happy about that one day. But she said, \u201cThen let me go. You\u2019ll never have to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that will purge you from my mind? That will stop the wondering and the craving? No, it will only make them worse. You will give yourself to others, kiss them the way you kissed me, rub against them the way you rubbed against me, and I will want to kill them when they will have done nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>What a confession! And she\u2019d thought her blood hot before...\u201cThen take me,\u201d she suggested huskily. She traced her tongue over her lips, slow and measured. His gaze followed. \u201cIt\u2019ll feel sooo good, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd discover if you are as soft and wet as you appear? Spend the rest of eternity in bed with you, a slave to my body? No, that, too, will only make my cravings worse.\u201d</p><p>Oh, angel. You shouldn\u2019t have admitted that. A slave to his body? If that was his fear, he more than craved her. He was falling. Hard. And now that she knew how much he wanted her...he was as good as hers. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d she said, swirling a fingertip around her navel, \u201ckill me with pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He stopped breathing.</p><p>She sat up, closing the rest of the distance between them. Still he didn\u2019t strike. She flattened her palms on his chest. His nipples were as beaded as hers. He closed his eyes, as if the sight of her, looking up at him through the thick shield of her lashes, was too much to bear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you in on a little secret,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m softer and wetter than I appear.\u201d</p><p>Was that a moan?</p><p>And if so, had it come from him? Or her? Touching him like this was affecting her, too. All this strength at her fingertips was heady. Knowing this gorgeous warrior wanted her\u2014her, and no other\u2014was even headier. But knowing she was the very first to tempt him, and so strongly, was the ultimate aphrodisiac.</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d Oh, yes. A moan.</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019d like, we can just lie next to each other.\u201d Said the spider to the fly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to touch. We don\u2019t have to kiss. We\u2019ll lie there and think about all the things we dislike about each other and maybe build up an immunity. Maybe we\u2019ll stop wanting to touch and to kiss.\u201d</p><p>Never had she told such a blatant lie, and she\u2019d told some big ones over the centuries. Part of her expected him to call her on it. The other part of her expected him to grasp on to the silly suggestion like a lifeline. Use it as an excuse to finally take what he wanted. Because if he did this, simply lay next to her, one temptation would lead to another. He wouldn\u2019t be thinking about the things he disliked about her\u2014he would be thinking about the things he could be doing to her body. He would feel her heat, smell her arousal. He\u2019d want\u2014need\u2014more from her. And she\u2019d be right there, ready and willing to give it to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fisted his robe and gently tugged him toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try, don\u2019t you think? Anything\u2019s worth a try to make this madness stop.\u201d</p><p>When they were nose to nose, his breath trickling over her face, his gaze fastened on her lips, she began to ease backward. He followed, offering no resistance.</p><p>\u201cWant to know one of the things I dislike about you?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cYou know, to help get us started.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, as if he were too entranced to speak.</p><p>She decided to push a little faster than anticipated. He already seemed ready for more. \u201cThat you\u2019re not on top of me.\u201d Just a little more persuasion, and that would be remedied. Just a little...\u201cHow amazing would it feel to be that close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d an unfamiliar female voice suddenly called. \u201cAre you here?\u201d</p><p>Who the hell? Bianka scowled.</p><p>Lysander straightened, jerking away from her as if she had just sprouted horns. He stepped back, disengaging from her completely. But he was trembling, and not from anger.</p> <p>\u201cIgnore her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have important business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d the woman called again.</p><p>Damn her, whoever she was!</p><p>His expression cleared, melted to steel. \u201cNot another word from you,\u201d he barked, backing away. \u201cYou tried to lure me into bed with you. I don\u2019t think you meant to make me dislike you at all. I think you meant to\u2014\u201d A low snarl erupted from his throat. \u201cYou are not to try such a thing with me again. If you do, I will finally cleave your head from your body.\u201d</p><p>Well, this battle was clearly over. Not one to give up, however, she tried a different strategy. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to leave again? Coward! Well, go ahead. Leave me helpless and bored. But you know what? When I\u2019m bored, bad things happen. And next time you come back here, I just might throw myself at you. My hands will be all over you. You won\u2019t be able to pry me off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d the girl called again.</p> <p>He ground his teeth. \u201cReturn to your cloud,\u201d he threw over his shoulder. \u201cI will meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He was going to meet another girl? At her cloud? Alone, private? Oh, hell, no. Bianka hadn\u2019t worked him into a frenzy so that someone else could reap the reward.</p><p>Before she could inform him of that, however, he said, \u201cGive Bianka whatever she wants.\u201d Talking to his own cloud, apparently. \u201cAnything but escape and more of those...outfits.\u201d His gaze intensified on her. \u201cThat should stave off the boredom. But I only agree to this on the condition that you vow to keep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Anything she wanted? She didn\u2019t allow herself to grin, the girl forgotten in the face of this victory. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so it is,\u201d he said, then spun and stalked from the room. His wings expanded in a rush, and he disappeared before she could follow. But then, there was no need to follow him. Not now.</p><p>He had no idea that he\u2019d just ensured his own downfall. Whatever she wants, he\u2019d said. She laughed. She didn\u2019t need to touch him or wear lingerie to win their next battle. She just needed his return.</p><p>Because then, he would become her prisoner.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>HE\u2019D ALMOST GIVEN IN.</p><p>Lysander could not believe how quickly he\u2019d almost given in to Bianka. One sultry glance from her, one invitation, and he\u2019d forgotten his purpose. It was shameful. And yet, it was not shame that he felt. It was more of that strange disappointment\u2014disappointment that he\u2019d been interrupted!Standing before Bianka, breathing in her wicked scent, feeling the heat of her body, all he\u2019d been able to recall was the decadent taste of her. He\u2019d wanted more. Wanted to finally touch her skin. Skin that had glowed with health, reflecting all those rainbow shards. She\u2019d wanted that, too, he was sure of it. The more aroused she\u2019d become, the brighter those colors had glowed.</p><p>Unless that was a trick? What did he truly know of women and desire?</p><p>She was worse than a demon, he thought. She\u2019d known exactly how to entrance him. Those naked photos had nearly dropped him to his knees. Never had he seen anything so lovely. Her breasts, high and plump. Her stomach, flat. Her navel, perfectly dipped. Her thighs, firm and smooth. Then, being asked to lie beside her and think of what he disliked about her...both had been temptations, and both had been irresistible.</p><p>He\u2019d known his resolve was crumbling and had wanted to rebuild it. And how better to rebuild than to ponder all the things he disliked about the woman? But if he had lain next to her, he would not have thought of what he disliked\u2014things he couldn\u2019t seem to recall then or now. He might have even thought about what he liked about her.</p><p>She was brilliant. She\u2019d had him.</p><p>He\u2019d never desired a demon. Had never secretly liked bad behavior. Yet Bianka excited him in a way he could not have predicted. So, what did he like most about her at the moment? That she was willing to do anything, say anything, to tempt him. He liked that she had no inhibitions. He liked that she gazed up at him with longing in those beautiful eyes.</p><p>How would she look at him if he actually kissed her again? Kissed more than her mouth? How would she look at him if he actually touched her? Caressed that skin? He suddenly found himself wanting to watch mortals and immortals alike more intently, gauging their reactions to each other. Man and woman, desire to desire.</p><p>Just the thought of doing so caused his body to react the way it had done with Bianka. Hardening, tightening. Burning, craving. His eyes widened. That, too, had never happened before. He was letting her win, he realized, even though there was distance between them. He was letting his one temptation destroy him, bit by bit.</p><p>Something had to be done about Bianka, since his current plan was clearly failing.</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d</p><p>His charge\u2019s voice drew him from his dark musings. \u201cYes, sweet?\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s head tilted to the side, her burnished curls bouncing. They stood inside her cloud, flowers of every kind scattered across the floor, on the walls, even dripping from the ceiling.</p><p>Her eyes, as blue as the sky, regarded him intently. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been listening to me, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. Truth had always been his most cherished companion. That would not change now. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are forgiven,\u201d she said with a grin as sweet as her flowers.</p><p>With her, it was that easy. Always. No matter how big or small the crime, Olivia couldn\u2019t hold a grudge. Perhaps that was why she was so treasured among their people. Everyone loved her.</p><p>What would other angels think of Bianka?</p><p>No doubt they would be horrified by her. He was horrified.</p><p>I thought you were not going to lie? Even to yourself. He scowled. Unlike the forgiving Olivia, he suspected Bianka would hold a grudge for a lifetime\u2014and somehow take that grudge beyond the grave.</p><p>For some reason, his scowl faded and his lips twitched at the thought. Why would that amuse him? Grudges were born of anger, and anger was an ugly thing. Except, perhaps, on Bianka. Would she erupt with the same amount of unrelenting passion she brought to the bedroom? Probably. Would she want to be kissed from her anger, as well?</p><p>The thought of kissing her until she was happy again did not delight him.</p><p>Usually he dealt with other people\u2019s anger the way he dealt with everything else. With total unconcern. It was not his job to make people feel a certain way. They were responsible for their own emotions, just as he was responsible for his. Not that he experienced many. Over the years, he\u2019d simply seen too much to be bothered. Until Bianka.</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s voice once more jerked him from his mind. His hands fisted. He\u2019d locked Bianka away, yet she was still managing to change him. Oh, yes. His current plan was failing.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he have desired someone like sweet Olivia? It would have made his endless life much easier. As he\u2019d told Bianka, desire wasn\u2019t forbidden, but not many of their kind ever experienced it. Those that did only wanted other angels and often wed their chosen partner. Except in storybooks, he had never heard of an angel pairing with a different race\u2014much less a demon.</p><p>\u201c\u2014you go again,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>He blinked, hands fisting all the tighter. \u201cAgain, I apologize. I will be more diligent the rest of our conversation.\u201d He would make sure of it.</p><p>She offered him another grin, though this one lacked her usual ease. \u201cI only asked what was bothering you.\u201d She folded her wings around herself and plucked at the feathers, carefully avoiding the strands of gold. \u201cYou\u2019re so unlike yourself.\u201d</p><p>That made two of them. Something was troubling her; sadness had never layered her voice before, yet now it did. Determined to help her, he summoned two chairs, one for him and one for her, and they sat across from each other. Her robe plumed around her as she released her wings and twined her fingers together in her lap. Leaning forward, he rested his weight on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cLet us talk about you first. How goes your mission?\u201d he asked. Only that could be the cause. Olivia found joy in all things. That\u2019s why she was so good at her job. Or rather, her former job. Because of him, she was now something she didn\u2019t want to be. A warrior angel. But it was for the best, and he did not regret the decision to change her station. Like him, she\u2019d become too fascinated with someone she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Better to end that now, before the fascination ruined her.</p><p>She licked her lips and looked away from him. \u201cThat\u2019s actually what I wanted to speak with you about.\u201d A tremor shook her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do it, Lysander.\u201d The words emerged as a tortured whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can kill Aeron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, though he knew what she would say. But unlike Bianka, Aeron had broken a heavenly law, so there could be no locking him away and leading him to a righteous path.</p><p>If Olivia failed to destroy the demon-possessed male, another angel would be tasked with doing so\u2014and Olivia would be punished for her refusal. She would be cast out of the heavens, her immortality stripped, her wings ripped from her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t hurt anyone since his blood-curse was removed,\u201d she said, and he heard the underlying beseeching.</p><p>\u201cHe helped one of Lucifer\u2019s minions escape hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Legion. And yes, Aeron did that. But he ensures the little demon stays away from most humans. Those she does interact with, she treats with kindness. Well, her version of kindness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that Aeron helped the creature escape.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s shoulders sagged, though she in no way appeared defeated. Determination gleamed in her eyes. \u201cI know. But he\u2019s so...nice.\u201d</p><p>Lysander barked out a laugh. He just couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cWe are speaking of a Lord of the Underworld, yes? The one whose entire body is tattooed with violent, bloody images no less? That is the male you call nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of the etchings are violent,\u201d she mumbled, offended for some reason. \u201cTwo are butterflies.\u201d</p><p>For her to have found the butterflies amid the skeletal faces decorating the man\u2019s body meant she\u2019d studied him intently. Lysander sighed. \u201cHave you...felt anything for him?\u201d Physically?</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, but rosy color bloomed on her cheeks.</p><p>She had, then. \u201cNever mind.\u201d He scrubbed a hand down his suddenly tired face. \u201cDo you like your home, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>She blanched at that, as if she knew the direction he was headed. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like your wings? Do you like your lack of pain, no matter the injury sustained? Do you like the robe you wear? A robe that cleans itself and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied softly. She gazed down at her hands. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that you will lose all of that and more if you fail to do your duty.\u201d The words were harsh, meant for himself as much as for her.</p> <p>Tears sprang into her eyes. \u201cI just hoped you could convince the council to rescind their order to execute him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not even try.\u201d Honest, he reminded himself. He had to be honest. Which he preferred. Or had. \u201cRules are put into place for a reason, whether we agree with those reasons or not. I have been around a long time, have seen the world\u2014ours, theirs\u2014plunged into darkness and chaos. And do you know what? That darkness and chaos always sprang from one broken rule. Just one. Because when one is broken, another soon follows. Then another. It becomes a vicious cycle.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed as she absorbed his words. Then she sighed, nodded. \u201cVery well.\u201d Words of acceptance uttered in a tone that was anything but.</p><p>\u201cYou will do your duty?\u201d What he was really asking: Will you slay Aeron, keeper of Wrath, whether you want to or not? Lysander wasn\u2019t asking more of her than he had done himself. He wasn\u2019t asking what he wouldn\u2019t do himself.</p><p>Another nod. One of those tears slid down her cheek.</p><p>He reached out and captured the glistening drop with the tip of his finger. \u201cYour compassion is admirable, but it will destroy you if you allow it so much power over you.\u201d</p><p>She waved the prediction away. Perhaps because she did not believe it, or perhaps because she believed it but had no plans to change and therefore didn\u2019t want to discuss it anymore. \u201cSo who was the woman in your home? The one in the portraits?\u201d</p><p>He...blushed? Yes, that was the heat spreading over his cheeks. \u201cMy...\u201d How should he explain Bianka? How could he, without lying?</p> <p>\u201cLover?\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>His cheeks flushed with more of that heat. \u201cNo.\u201d Maybe. No! \u201cShe is my captive.\u201d There. Truthful without giving away any details. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, standing. If she could end a subject, so could he. \u201cI must return to her before she causes any more trouble.\u201d He must deal with her. Once and for all.</p><p>OLIVIA REMAINED IN PLACE long after Lysander left. Had that blushing, uncertain, distracted man truly been her mentor? She\u2019d known him for centuries, and he\u2019d always been unflappable. Even in the heat of battle.</p><p>The woman was responsible, she was sure. Lysander had never kept one in his cloud before. Did he feel for her what Olivia felt for Aeron?Aeron.</p><p>Just thinking his name sent a shiver down her spine, filling her with a need to see him. And just like that, she was on her feet, her wings outstretched.</p><p>\u201cI wish to leave,\u201d she said, and the floor softened, turning to mist. Down she fell, wings flapping gracefully. She was careful to avoid eye contact with the other angels flying through the sky as she headed into Budapest. They knew her destination; they even knew what she did there.</p><p>Some watched her with pity, some with concern\u2014as Lysander had. Some watched her with antipathy. By avoiding their gazes, she ensured no one would stop her and try and talk sense into her. She ensured she wouldn\u2019t have to lie. Something she hated to do. Lies tasted disgustingly bitter.</p><p>Long ago, during her training, Lysander had commanded her to tell a lie. She would never forget the vile flood of acid in her mouth the moment she\u2019d obeyed. Never again did she wish to experience such a thing. But to be with Aeron...maybe.</p><p>His dark, menacing fortress was perched high on a mountain and finally came into view. Her heart rate increased exponentially. Because she existed on another plane, she was able to drift through the stone walls as if they were not even there. Soon she was standing inside Aeron\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He was polishing a gun. His little demon friend, Legion, the one he\u2019d helped escape from hell, was darting and writhing around him, a pink boa twirling with her.</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d the creature beseeched.</p><p>That was dancing? That kind of heaving was what humans did as they were dying.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ve got to patrol the town tonight, searching for Hunters.\u201d</p><p>Hunters, sworn enemy of the Lords. They hoped to find Pandora\u2019s box and draw the demons out of the immortal warriors, killing each man. The Lords, in turn, hoped to find Pandora\u2019s box and destroy it\u2014the same way they hoped to destroy the Hunters.</p><p>\u201cMe hate Huntersss,\u201d Legion said, \u201cbut we needsss practice for Doubtie\u2019sss wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be dancing at Sabin\u2019s wedding, therefore practice isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Legion stilled, frowned. \u201cBut we dance at the wedding. Like a couple.\u201d Her thin lips curved downward. Was she...pouting? \u201cPleassse. We ssstill got time to practice. Dark not come for hoursss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I finish cleaning my weapons, I have to run an errand for Paris.\u201d Paris, Olivia knew, was keeper of Promiscuity and had to bed a new woman every day or he would weaken and die. But Paris was depressed and not taking proper care of himself, so Aeron, who felt responsible for the warrior, procured females for him. \u201cWe\u2019ll dance another time, I promise.\u201d Aeron didn\u2019t glance up from his task. \u201cBut we\u2019ll do it here, in the privacy of my room.\u201d</p><p>I want to dance with him, too, Olivia thought. What was it like, pressing your body against someone else\u2019s? Someone strong and hot and sinfully beautiful?</p><p>\u201cBut, Aeron...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart. I do these things because they\u2019re necessary to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Olivia tucked her wings into her back. Aeron needed to take time for himself. He was always on the go, fighting Hunters, traveling the world in search of Pandora\u2019s box and aiding his friends. As much as she watched him, she knew he rarely rested and never did anything simply for the joy of it.</p><p>She reached out, meaning to ghost a hand through Aeron\u2019s hair. But suddenly the scaled, fanged creature screeched, \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d clearly sensing Olivia\u2019s presence. In a blink, Legion was gone.</p><p>Stiffening, Aeron growled low in his throat. \u201cI told you not to return.\u201d</p><p>Though he couldn\u2019t see Olivia, he, too, always seemed to know when she arrived. And he hated her for scaring his friend away. But she couldn\u2019t help it. Angels were demon assassins and the minion must sense the menace in her.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, but he couldn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>He returned the clip to his weapon and set it beside his bed. Scowling, he stood. His violet eyes narrowed as he searched the bedroom for any hint of her. Sadly, it was a hint he would never find.</p><p>Olivia studied him. His hair was cropped to his scalp, dark little spikes barely visible. He was so tall he dwarfed her, his shoulders so wide they could have enveloped her. With the tattoos decorating his skin, he was the fiercest creature she\u2019d ever beheld. Maybe that was why he drew her so intensely. He was passion and danger, willing to do anything to save the ones he loved.</p><p>Most immortals put their own needs above everyone else\u2019s. Aeron put everyone else\u2019s above his own. That he did so never failed to shock her. And she was supposed to destroy him? She was supposed to end his life?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told you\u2019re an angel,\u201d he said.</p><p>How had he known what\u2014the demon, she realized. Legion might not be able to see her, either, but as she\u2019d already realized, the little demon knew danger when she encountered it. Plus, whenever Legion left him, she returned to hell. Fiery walls that could no longer confine her but could welcome her any time she wished. Olivia\u2019s lack of success had to be a great source of amusement to that region\u2019s inhabitants.</p><p>\u201cIf you are an angel, you should know that won\u2019t stop me from cutting you down if you dare try and harm Legion.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he was thinking of another\u2019s welfare rather than his own. He didn\u2019t know that Olivia didn\u2019t need to bother with Legion. That once Aeron was dead, Legion\u2019s bond to him would wither and she would again be chained to hell.</p><p>Olivia closed the distance between them, her steps tentative. She stopped only when she was a whisper away. His nostrils flared as if he knew what she\u2019d done, but he didn\u2019t move. Wishful thinking on her part, she knew. Unless she fell, he would never see her, never smell her, never hear her.</p><p>She reached up and cupped his jaw with her hands. How she wished she could feel him. Unlike Lysander, who was of the Elite, she could not materialize into this plane. Only her weapon would. A weapon she would forge from air, its heavenly flames far hotter than those in hell. A weapon that would remove Aeron\u2019s head from his body in a mere blink of time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m told you\u2019re female,\u201d he added, his tone hard, harsh. As always. \u201cBut that won\u2019t stop me from cutting you down, either. Because, and here\u2019s something you need to know, when I want something, I don\u2019t let anything stand in the way of my getting it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shivered, but not for the reasons Aeron probably hoped. Such determination...</p><p>I should leave before I aggravate him even more. With a sigh, she spread her wings and leapt, out of the fortress and into the sky.</p> <p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cYOU, CLOUD, BELONG TO ME,\u201d Bianka said. That was not an attempt to escape, nor another sexy outfit, therefore it was acceptable. \u201cLysander gave you to me, so as long as I don\u2019t touch him, I get what I want. And I want you. I want you to obey me, not him. Therefore, you have to heed my commands rather than his. If I tell you to do something and he tells you not to, you still have to do it. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>And oh, baby, this was going to be fun.The more she thought about it, the happier she was that she couldn\u2019t touch Lysander again. Really. Seducing\u2014or rather, trying to seduce\u2014him had been a mistake. She\u2019d basically ended up seducing herself. His heat...his scent...his strength...Give. Me. More.</p><p>Now, all she could think about was getting his weight back on top of her. About how she wanted to teach him where she liked to be touched. Once he\u2019d gotten the hang of kissing, he\u2019d teased and tantalized her mouth with the skill of a master. It would be the same with lovemaking.</p><p>She would lick each and every one of his muscles. She would hear him moan over and over again as he licked her.</p> <p>How could she want those things from her enemy? How could she forget, even for a moment, how he\u2019d locked her away? Maybe because he was a challenge. A sexy, tempting, frustrating challenge.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, though. She was done playing the role of sweet, horny prisoner. She still couldn\u2019t kill him; she\u2019d be stuck here for eternity. Which meant she\u2019d have to make him want to get rid of her. And now, as master of this cloud, she would have no problem doing so.</p><p>She could hardly wait to begin. If he stuck to past behavior, he\u2019d be gone for a week. He\u2019d return to \u201ccheck on\u201d her. Operation Cry Like A Baby could begin. Tomorrow she\u2019d plan the specifics and set the stage. A few ideas were already percolating. Like tying him to a chair in front of a stripper pole. Like enforcing Naked Tuesdays.</p><p>Chuckling, she propped herself against the bed\u2019s headboard, yawned and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hold a bowl of Lysander\u2019s grapes,\u201d she said, and felt a cool porcelain bowl instantly press atop her stomach. Without opening her eyes, she popped one of the fruits into her mouth, chewed. Gods, she was tired. She hadn\u2019t rested properly since she\u2019d gotten here\u2014or even before.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. There were no trees to climb, no leaves to hide in. And even if she summoned one, Lysander could easily find her if he returned early\u2014</p> <p>Wait. No. No, he wouldn\u2019t. Not if she summoned hundreds of them. And if he dismissed all the trees, she would fall, which would awaken her. He would not be able to take her unaware.</p><p>Chuckling again, Bianka pried her eyelids apart. She polished off the grapes, scooted from the bed and stood. \u201cReplace the furniture with trees. Hundreds of big, thick, green trees.\u201d</p><p>In the snap of her fingers, the cloud resembled a forest. Ivy twined around stumps and dew dripped from leaves. Flowers of every color bloomed, petals floating from them and dancing to the ground. She gaped at the beauty. Nothing on earth compared.</p><p>If only her sisters could see this.</p><p>Her sisters. Winning a game or not, she missed them more with every second that passed. Lysander would pay for that, too.</p><p>She yawned again. When she attempted to climb the nearest oak, her lingerie snagged on the bark. She straightened, scowled\u2014reminded once again of the way her dark angel had stalked to her, leaned into her, hot breath trekking over her skin.</p><p>\u201cI want to wear a camo tank and army fatigues.\u201d The moment she was dressed, she scaled to the highest bough, fluttering wings giving her speed and agility, and reclined on a fat branch, peering up into a lovely star-sprinkled sky. \u201cI\u2019d like a bottle of Lysander\u2019s wine, please.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were clutching a flagon of dry red a second later. She would have preferred a cheap white, but whatever. Hard times called for sacrifices, and she drained the bottle in record time.</p> <p>Just as she summoned a second, she heard Lysander shout, \u201cBianka!\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. Either she\u2019d been up here longer than she\u2019d thought or she was hallucinating.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she have imagined a Lord of the Underworld? she wondered disgustedly. Oh, oh. How cool would it be if Lysander oil-wrestled a Lord? They\u2019d be wearing loincloths, of course, and smiles. But nothing else.</p><p>And she could totally have that! This was her cloud, after all. She and Lysander were now playing by her rules. And, because she was in charge, he couldn\u2019t rescind his command that she be obeyed without her permission.</p><p>At least, she prayed that was the way this would work.</p><p>\u201cRemove the trees,\u201d she heard him snap.</p><p>She waited, unable to breathe, but the trees remained. He couldn\u2019t! Grinning, she jolted upright and clapped. She\u2019d been right, then. This cloud belonged to her.</p><p>\u201cRemove. The. Trees.\u201d</p><p>Again, they remained.</p><p>\u201cBianka!\u201d he snarled. \u201cShow yourself.\u201d</p><p>Anticipation flooded her as she jumped down. A quick scan of her surroundings revealed that he wasn\u2019t nearby. \u201cTake me to him.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and found herself standing in front of him. He\u2019d been shoving his way through the foliage and when he spotted her, he stopped. He clutched that sword of fire.</p><p>She backed away, remaining out of reach. No touching. She wouldn\u2019t forget. \u201cThat for me?\u201d she asked, motioning to the weapon with a tilt of her chin. She\u2019d never been so excited in her life and even the sight of that weapon didn\u2019t dampen the emotion.</p><p>A vein bulged in his temples.</p><p>She\u2019d take that for a yes. \u201cNaughty boy.\u201d He\u2019d come to kill her, she thought, swaying a little. That was something else to punish him for. \u201cYou\u2019re back early.\u201d</p><p>His gaze raked her newest outfit, his pupils dilated and his nostrils flared. His mouth, however, curled in distaste. \u201cAnd you are drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you accuse me of such a thing!\u201d She tried for a harsh expression, but ruined it when she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just tipsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to my cloud?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, the picture of stubborn male. \u201cWhy won\u2019t the trees disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re wrong. This is no longer your cloud. Second, the trees will only leave if I tell them to leave. Which I am. Leave, pretty trees, leave.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cOh my gods. I said leave to a tree. I\u2019m a poet and I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Instantly, there was nothing surrounding her and Lysander but glorious white mist. \u201cThird, you\u2019re not going anywhere without my permission. Did you hear that, cloud? He stays. Fourth, you\u2019re wearing too many clothes. I want you in a loincloth, minus the weapon.\u201d</p><p>His sword was suddenly gone. His eyes widened as his robe disappeared and a flesh-colored loincloth appeared. Bianka tried not to gape. And she\u2019d thought the forest gorgeous. Wow. Just...wow. His body was a work of art. He possessed more muscles than she\u2019d realized. His biceps were perfectly proportioned. Rope after rope lined his stomach. And his thighs were ridged, his skin sun-kissed.</p><p>\u201cThis cloud is mine, and I demand the return of my robe.\u201d His voice was so low, so harsh, it scraped against her eardrums.</p><p>The sweet sound of victory, she thought. He remained exactly as she\u2019d requested. Laughing, she twirled, arms splayed wide. \u201cIsn\u2019t this fabulous?\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward her, menace in every step.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d She danced out of reach. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. I want you in a large tub of oil.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, he was trapped inside a tub. Clear oil rose to his calves, and he stared down in horror.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like having your will overlooked?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>His gaze lifted, met hers, narrowed. \u201cI will not fight you in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly man. Of course you won\u2019t. You\u2019ll fight...\u201d She tapped her chin with a fingernail. \u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s see. Amun? No. He won\u2019t speak and I\u2019d like to hear some cursing. Strider? As keeper of Defeat, he\u2019d ensure you lost to prevent himself from feeling pain, but that would be an intense battle and I\u2019m just wanting something to amuse me. You know, something light and sexy. I mean, since I can\u2019t touch you, I want a Lord to do it for me.\u201d</p><p>Lysander popped his jaw. \u201cDo not do this, Bianka. You will not like the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just sad,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here two weeks, but you don\u2019t know me at all. Of course I\u2019ll like the consequences.\u201d Torin, keeper of Disease? Watching him fight Torin would be fun, \u2019cause then he\u2019d catch that black plague. Or would he? Could angels get sick? She sighed. \u201cParis will have to do, I guess. He\u2019s handsy, so that works in my favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloud, place Paris, keeper of Promiscuity, into the tub with Lysander.\u201d</p><p>When Paris appeared a moment later, she clapped. Paris was tall and just as muscled as Lysander. Only he had black hair streaked with brown and gold, his eyes were electric blue and his face perfect enough to make her weep from its beauty. Too bad he didn\u2019t stir her body the way Lysander did. Making out with him in front of the angel would have been fun.</p><p>\u201cBianka?\u201d Paris looked from her to the angel, the angel to her. \u201cWhere am I? Is this some ambrosia-induced hallucination? What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, you\u2019re overdressed. You should only be wearing a loincloth like Lysander.\u201d</p><p>His T-shirt and jeans were instantly replaced with said loincloth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Best. Day. Ever. \u201cParis, I\u2019d like you to meet Lysander, the angel who abducted me and has been holding me prisoner up here in heaven.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Paris morphed from confusion to fury. \u201cReturn my weapons and I\u2019ll kill him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a sweetie,\u201d she said, flattening a hand over her heart. \u201cWhy is it we haven\u2019t slept together yet?\u201d</p> <p>Lysander snarled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked him, all innocence. \u201cHe wants to save me. You want to subjugate me for the rest of my long life. But anyway, let me finish the introductions. Lysander, I\u2019d like you to meet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is. Promiscuity.\u201d Disgust layered Lysander\u2019s voice. \u201cHe must bed a new woman every day or he weakens.\u201d</p><p>Another grin lifted the corners of her lips, this one smug. \u201cActually, he can bed men, too. His demon\u2019s not picky. I do hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind while you guys are rubbing up against each other.\u201d</p><p>Lysander took a menacing step toward her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Paris demanded again, glowering now. Bianka knew he was picky even if his demon wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? Lysander gave me control of his home, so now I get whatever I want and I want you guys to wrestle. And when you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll find Kaia and tell her what\u2019s happened, that I\u2019m trapped with a stubborn angel and can\u2019t leave. Well, I can\u2019t leave until he gets so sick of me he allows the cloud to release me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr until I kill you,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOr until Paris kills you. But I hope you guys will play nice for a little while, at least. Do you have any idea how sexy you both are right now? And if you want to kiss or something while rolling around, don\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Bianka,\u201d Paris began, beginning to look uncomfortable. \u201cKaia\u2019s in Budapest. She\u2019s helping Gwen with the wedding, and thinks you\u2019re hiding to get out of your maid of honor duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not maid of honor, damn it!\u201d But at least Kaia wasn\u2019t worried. The bitch, she thought with affection.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what she says. Anyway, I don\u2019t mind fighting another dude to amuse you, but seriously, he\u2019s an angel. I need to return to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d She held out her hands. \u201cA bowl of Lysander\u2019s popcorn, please.\u201d The bowl appeared, the scent of butter wafting to her nose. \u201cNow then. Let\u2019s get this party started. Ding, ding,\u201d she said, and settled down to watch the battle.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>LYSANDER COULD NOT BELIEVE what he was being forced to do. He was angry, horrified and, yes, contrite. Hadn\u2019t he done something similar to Bianka? Granted, he hadn\u2019t stripped her down. Hadn\u2019t pitted her against another female.</p><p>There was the tightening in his groin again.What was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cI will set you free,\u201d he told Bianka. And sweet Holy Deity, she looked beautiful. More tempting than when she\u2019d worn that little bit of nothing. Now she wore a green and black tank that bared her golden arms. Were those arms as soft as they appeared? Don\u2019t think like that. Her shirt stopped just above her navel, making his mouth water, his tongue yearn to dip inside. What did I just say? Don\u2019t think like that. Her pants were the same dark shades and hung low on her hips.</p><p>He\u2019d come here to fight her, to finally force her hand, and judging by that outfit, she\u2019d been ready for combat. That...excited him. Not because their bodies would have been in close proximity\u2014really\u2014and not because he could have finally gotten his hands on her\u2014again, really\u2014but because, if she injured him, he would have the right to end her life. Finally.</p><p>But he\u2019d come here and she\u2019d taught him a quick yet unforgettable lesson instead. He\u2019d been wrong to whisk her to his home and hold her captive. Temptation or not. She might be his enemy in ways she didn\u2019t understand, but he never should have put his will above hers. He should have allowed her to live her life as she saw fit.</p> <p>That\u2019s why he existed in the first place. To protect free will.</p><p>When this wrestling match ended, he would free her as he\u2019d promised. He would watch her, though. Closely. And when she made a mistake, he would strike her down. And she would. Make a mistake, that is. As a Harpy, she wouldn\u2019t be able to help herself. He wished it hadn\u2019t come to that. He wished she could have been happy here with him, learning his ways.</p><p>The thought of losing her did not sadden him. He would not miss her. She\u2019d placed him in a vat of oil to wrestle with another man, for Lord\u2019s sake.</p><p>There was suddenly a bitter taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he prompted. \u201cHave you no response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will set me free,\u201d she finally said with a radiant grin. She twirled a strand of that dark-as-night hair around her finger. \u201cAfter. Now, I do believe I rang the starting bell.\u201d</p><p>Her words were slightly slurred from the wine she\u2019d consumed. A drunken menace, that\u2019s what she was. And he would not miss her, he told himself again.</p><p>The bitterness intensified.</p><p>A hard weight slammed into him and sent him propelling to his back. His wings caught on the sides of the pool as oil washed over him from head to toe, weighing him down. He grunted, and some of the stuff\u2014cherry-flavored\u2014seeped into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to use tongue if you kiss,\u201d Bianka called helpfully.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t lock women away,\u201d Paris growled down at him, a flash of scales suddenly visible under his skin. Eyes red and bright. Demon eyes. \u201cNo matter how irritating they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friends did something similar to their women, did they not? Besides, the girl isn\u2019t your concern.\u201d Lysander shoved, sending the warrior hurtling to his back. He attempted to use his wings to lift himself, but their movements were slow and sluggish so all he could do was stand.</p><p>Oil dripped down his face, momentarily shielding his vision. Paris shot to his feet, as well, hands fisted, body glistening.</p><p>\u201cSo. Much. Fun,\u201d Bianka sang happily.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Lysander told her. \u201cThis is unnecessary. You have made your point. I\u2019m willing to set you free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary to fight without music!\u201d Once again she tapped her chin with a nail, expression thoughtful. \u201cI know! We need some Lady Gaga in this crib.\u201d</p><p>A song Lysander had never heard before was playing through the cloud a second later. Like a siren rising from the sea, Bianka began swaying her hips seductively.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s jaw clenched so painfully the bones would probably snap out of place at any moment. Clearly there would be no reasoning with Bianka. That meant he had to reason with Paris. But who would ever have thought he\u2019d have to bargain with a demon?</p><p>\u201cParis,\u201d he began\u2014just as a fist connected with his face.</p><p>His head whipped back. His feet slipped on the slick floor and he tumbled to his side. More of the cherry flavor filled his mouth.</p><p>Paris straddled his shoulders, punched him again. Lysander\u2019s lip split. Before a single drop of blood could form, however, the wound healed.</p><p>He frowned. He now had the right to slay the man, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. He did not blame Paris for this battle; he blamed Bianka. She had forced them into this situation.</p><p>Another punch. \u201cAre you the one who\u2019s been watching Aeron?\u201d Paris demanded.</p><p>\u201cHey, now,\u201d Bianka called. No longer did she sound so carefree. \u201cParis, you are not to use your fists. That\u2019s boxing, not wrestling.\u201d</p><p>Lysander remained silent, not understanding the difference. A fight was a fight.</p><p>Another punch. \u201cAre you?\u201d Paris growled.</p><p>\u201cParis! Did you hear me?\u201d Now she sounded angry. \u201cUse your fists like that again and I\u2019ll cut off your head.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d do it, too, Lysander thought, and wondered why she was so upset. Could she, perhaps, care for his health? His eyes widened. Was that why she preferred the less intensive wrestling to the more violent boxing? Would she want to do the same to him if he were to punch the Lord? And what would it mean if she did?</p><p>How would he feel about that?</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Paris repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He worked his legs up, planted his feet on Paris\u2019s chest and pressed. But rather than send the warrior flying, his foot slipped and connected with Paris\u2019s jaw, then ear, knocking the man\u2019s head back.</p><p>\u201cUse your hands, angel,\u201d Bianka suggested. \u201cChoke him! He deserves it for breaking my rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d Paris snapped. He lost his footing and tumbled to his butt. \u201cI thought you wanted me to destroy him, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>She blinked over at them, brow furrowed. \u201cI do. I just don\u2019t want you to hurt him. That\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>Paris tangled a hand through his soaked hair. \u201cSorry, darling, but if this continues, I\u2019m going to unleash a world of hurt on your frienemy. Nothing you say will be able to stop me. Clearly, he doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart.\u201d</p><p>Darling? Had the demon-possessed immortal just called Bianka darling? Something dark and dangerous flooded Lysander\u2014mine echoed through his head\u2014and before he realized what he was doing, he was on top of the warrior, a sword of fire in his hand, raised, descending...about to meet flesh.</p><p>A firm hand around his wrist stopped him. Warm, smooth skin. His wild gaze whipped to the side. There was Bianka, inside the tub, oil glistening off her. How fast she\u2019d moved.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him,\u201d she said determinedly.</p><p>\u201cBecause you want him, too,\u201d he snarled. A statement, not a question. Rage, so much rage. He didn\u2019t know where it was coming from or how to stop the flow.</p><p>She blinked again, as if the thought had never entered her mind, and that, miraculously, cooled his temper. \u201cNo. Because then you would be like me and therefore perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be fair to the world.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop talking and fight, damn you,\u201d Paris commanded. A fist connected with Lysander\u2019s jaw, tossing him to the side and out of Bianka\u2019s reach. He maintained his grip on the sword and even when it dipped into the oil, it didn\u2019t lose a single flame. In fact, the oil heated.</p><p>Great. Now he was hot-tubbing, as the humans would say.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for, you big dummy?\u201d Bianka didn\u2019t wait for Paris\u2019s reply but launched herself at him. Rather than scratch him or pull his hair, she punched him. Over and over again. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>Paris took the beating without retaliating.</p><p>That saved his life.</p><p>Lysander grabbed the Harpy around the waist and hefted her into the hard line of his body. Soaked as they both were, he had a difficult time maintaining his grip. She was panting, arms flailing for the demon-possessed warrior, but she didn\u2019t try to pull away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you to defy me, you rotten piece of shit,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Paris rolled his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSend him away,\u201d Lysander commanded.</p><p>\u201cNot until after I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He splayed his fingers, spanning much of her waist. He both rejoiced and cursed that he couldn\u2019t feel the texture of Bianka\u2019s skin through the oil. \u201cI want to be alone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone. With you.\u201d</p><p>With no hesitation, she said, \u201cGo home, Paris. Your work here is done. Thanks for trying to rescue me. That\u2019s the only reason you\u2019re still alive. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to tell my sisters I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>The sputtering Lord disappeared.</p><p>Lysander released her, and she spun around to face him. She was now grinning.</p><p>\u201cSo you want to be alone with me, do you?\u201d</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cWas that fun for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit it, he realized. Captivating baggage. \u201cReturn the cloud to me and I will take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What?\u201d Her grin slowly faded. \u201cI thought you wanted to be alone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. So that we can conclude our business.\u201d</p> <p>Disappointment, regret, anger and relief played over her features. One step, two, she closed the distance between them. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not giving you the cloud. That would be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word that once you return it to me, I will take you home. I know you hear the truth in my claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her shoulders sagged a little. \u201cSo we really would be rid of each other. That\u2019s great, then.\u201d</p><p>Did she still not believe him? Or...No, surely not. \u201cDo you want to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d She sucked her bottom lip into her mouth, and her eyes closed for a moment, an expression of pleasure consuming her features. \u201cMmm, cherries.\u201d</p><p>Blood...heating...</p><p>Her lashes lifted and her gaze locked on him. Determination replaced all the other emotions, yet her voice dipped sexily. \u201cBut I know something that tastes even better.\u201d</p><p>So did he. Her. A tremor slid the length of his spine. \u201cDo not do this, Bianka. You will fail.\u201d He hoped.</p><p>\u201cOne kiss,\u201d she beseeched, \u201cand the cloud is yours.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. Hot, so hot. \u201cYou cannot be trusted to keep your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I want out of this hellhole, so I\u2019ll keep it this time. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Hold your ground. But that was hard to do while his heart was pounding like a hammer against a nail. \u201cIf you wanted out, you would not insist on being kissed.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed, as well. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking for something you haven\u2019t already given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want it?\u201d He regretted the question immediately. He was prolonging the conversation rather than putting an end to it.</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cIt\u2019s a goodbye kiss, moron, but never mind. The cloud is yours. I\u2019ll go home and kiss Paris hello. That\u2019ll be more fun, anyway.\u201d</p><p>There would be no kissing Paris! Lysander had his tongue sliding into her mouth before he could convince himself otherwise. His arms even wound around her waist, pulling her closer to him\u2014so close their chests rubbed each time they breathed. Her nipples were hard, deliciously abrading.</p><p>\u201cOut of the oil,\u201d she murmured. \u201cClean.\u201d</p><p>He was still in the loincloth, but his skin was suddenly free of the oil, his feet on soft yet firm mist. The cloud might belong to him once more, but she could still make reasonable demands.</p><p>Bianka tilted her head and took his possession deeper. Their tongues dueled and rolled and their teeth scraped. Her hands were all over him, no part of him forbidden to her.</p><p>Goodbye, she had said.</p><p>This was it, then. His last chance to touch her skin. To finally know. Yes, he planned to see her again, to watch her from afar, to wait for his chance to rid himself of her permanently, but never again would he allow himself to get this close to her. And he had to know.</p><p>So he did it.</p><p>He glided his hands forward, tracing from her lower back to her stomach. There, he flattened his palms, and her muscles quivered. Dear Deity of Light and Love. She was softer than he\u2019d realized. Softer than anything else he\u2019d ever touched.</p><p>He moaned. Have to touch more. Up he lifted, remaining under her shirt. Warm, smooth, as he\u2019d already known. Still soft, so sweetly soft. Her breasts overflowed, and his mouth watered for a taste of them. Soon, he told himself. Then shook his head. This was it; the last time they would be together. Goodbye, pretty breasts. He kneaded them.</p><p>More soft perfection.</p><p>Trembling now, he reached her collarbone. Her shoulders. She shivered. Still so wonderfully soft. More, more, more, he had to have more. Had to touch all of her.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she gasped out. She dropped to her knees, working at the loincloth before he realized what she was doing.</p><p>His shaft sprang free, and his hands settled atop her shoulders to push her away. But once he touched that soft skin, he was once again lost to the sensation. Perfection, this was perfection.</p><p>\u201cGoing to kiss you now. A different kind of kiss.\u201d Warm, wet heat settled over the hard length of him. Another moan escaped him. Up, down that wicked mouth rode him. The pleasure...it was too much, not enough, everything and nothing. In that moment, it was necessary to his survival. His every breath hinged on what she would do next. There would be no pushing her away.</p><p>She twirled her tongue over the plump head; her fingers played with his testicles. Soon he was arching his hips, thrusting deep into her mouth. He couldn\u2019t stop moaning, groaning, the gasping breaths leaving him in a constant stream.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he growled. \u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way, baby. Give Bianka everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Everything. He would give her everything.</p><p>The sensation was building, his skin tightening, his muscles locking down on his bones. And then something exploded inside him. Something hot and wanton. His entire body jerked. Seed jetted from him, and she swallowed every drop.</p><p>Finally she pulled away from him, but his body wouldn\u2019t stop shaking. His knees were weak, his limbs nearly uncontrollable. That was pleasure, he realized, dazed. That was passion. That was what human men were willing to die to possess. That was what turned normally sane men into slaves. Like I am now. He was Bianka\u2019s slave.</p><p>Fool! You knew this would happen. Fight. It was only as she stood and smiled at him tenderly\u2014and he wanted to tug her into his arms and hold on forever\u2014that a measure of sanity stole back into his mind. Yes. Fight. How could he have allowed her to do that?</p><p>How could he still want her?</p><p>How could he want to do that to her in return?</p><p>How could he ever let her go?</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he said. He needed a moment to catch his breath. No. He needed to think about what had happened and how they should proceed. No. He tangled a hand in his hair. What should he do?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d Her smile disappeared as if it had never been. \u201cThe cloud is yours.\u201d Her voice trembled with...fear? Couldn\u2019t be. She hadn\u2019t showed a moment of fear since he\u2019d first abducted her. But she even backed away from him. \u201cNow take me home. Please.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply. What he would say, he didn\u2019t know. He only knew he did not like seeing her like that.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>He\u2019d never gone back on his word, and he wouldn\u2019t start now. He nodded stiffly, grabbed her hand, and flew her back to the ice mountain in Alaska, exactly as he\u2019d found her. Red coat, tall boots. Sensual in a way he hadn\u2019t understood then.</p><p>He maintained his grip on her until the last possible second\u2014until she slipped away from him, taking her warmth and the sweet softness of her skin with her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you again.\u201d Mist wafted around her as she turned her back on him. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>She...what? After what had happened between them, she was dismissing him? No, a voice roared inside his head. \u201cBehave, and you will not,\u201d he gritted out. A lie? The bitter taste in his mouth had returned.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Without meeting his gaze, she twisted and blew him a kiss as if she hadn\u2019t a care in the world. \u201cI\u2019d say you were an excellent host, but then, you don\u2019t want me to lie, do you?\u201d With that, she strolled away from him, dark hair blowing in the wind.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>FIRST THING BIANKA DID after bathing, dressing, eating a bag of stolen chips she had hidden in her kitchen, painting her nails, listening to her iPod for half an hour and taking a nap in her secret basement was call Kaia. Not that she had dreaded the call and wanted to put it off or anything. All of those other activities had been necessary. Really.</p><p>Plus, it wasn\u2019t like her sister was worried about her anymore. Paris would already have told her what was going on. But Bianka didn\u2019t want to discuss Lysander. Didn\u2019t even want to think about him and the havoc he was causing her emotions\u2014and her body and her thoughts and her common sense.After making out with him a little, she\u2019d wanted to freaking stay with him, curl up in his arms, make love and sleep. And that was unacceptable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The moment her sister answered, she said, \u201cNo need to throw me a Welcome Home party. I\u2019m not sticking around for long.\u201d Do not ask me about the angel. Do not ask me about the angel.</p><p>\u201cBianka?\u201d her twin asked groggily.</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting someone else to call in the middle of the night?\u201d It was 6:00 a.m. here in Alaska. Having traveled between the two places multiple times since Gwen had gotten involved with Sabin, she knew that meant it was 3:00 a.m. there in Budapest.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of people. Gwennie, who has become the ultimate bridezilla. Sabin, who is doing his best to soothe the beast but whines to me like I care.\u201d She rambled on as if Bianka had never been abducted and she\u2019d never been worried. Sure, she\u2019d thought Bianka was merely shirking her duties, but was a little worry too much to ask for? \u201cAnya, who has decided she deserves a wedding, too. Only bigger and better than Gwen\u2019s. William, who wants to sleep with me and doesn\u2019t know how to take no for an answer. He\u2019s not possessed by a demon so he\u2019s not my type. Shall I go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p> <p>She imagined Kaia high in a treetop, clutching her cell to her ear, grinning and trying not to fall. \u201cSo really, you were sleeping? While I was missing, my life in terrible danger? Some loving sister you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. You were on vacay, and we both know it. So don\u2019t give me a hard time. I had an...exciting day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing who?\u201d she asked dryly. Only two weeks had passed since she\u2019d last seen Kaia, but suddenly a wave of homesickness\u2014or rather, sistersickness\u2014flooded her. She loved this woman more than she loved herself. And that was a lot!</p><p>Kaia chuckled. \u201cI wish it was because of a who. I\u2019m waiting for two of the Lords to fight over me. Then I\u2019ll comfort them both. So far, no luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! But I mentioned Gwen has become the bride from hell, right? They\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll act just like her, so no one\u2019s willing to take a real chance on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBride from hell, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer dress didn\u2019t fit right. Her napkins weren\u2019t the right color. No one has the flowers she wants. Whaa, whaa, whaa.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like the usually calm Gwen. \u201cDistract her. Tell her the Hunters captured me and performed a handbotomy on me like they did on Gideon.\u201d Gideon, keeper of Lies. A sexy warrior who dyed his hair as blue as his eyes and had a wicked sense of humor.</p><p>The thought of seducing him didn\u2019t delight her as it once might have. Stupid angel. Do not think about him.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t care if you were chopped up into little pieces. You\u2019re too much like me and apparently we take nothing seriously so we deserve what we get,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cShe\u2019s driving me freaking insane! And to top off my mountain-o-crap, I was totally losing our game of Hide and Seek. So anyway, why\u2019d you decide to rescue yourself? I\u2019m telling you, you have a better chance of survival in the clouds than here with Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival schmival. It wasn\u2019t fun anymore.\u201d A lie. Things had just started to heat up the way she\u2019d wanted. But how could she have known that would scare her so badly?</p><p>\u201cGood going, by the way. Allowing yourself to be taken into the clouds where I couldn\u2019t get to you. Brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo was it terrible? Being spirited away by a sexy angel?\u201d</p><p>She twirled a strand of hair around her finger and pictured Lysander\u2019s glorious face. The desire he\u2019d leveled at her while she\u2019d sucked him dry had been miraculous. You don\u2019t want to talk about him, remember? \u201cYes. It was terrible.\u201d Terribly wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYou bringing him to Buda for the wedding?\u201d</p><p>The words were sneered, clearly a joke, but Bianka found herself shouting, \u201cNo!\u201d before she could stop herself. A Harpy dating an angel? Unacceptable!</p><p>And anyway, allowing the demon-possessed Lords of the Underworld to surround a warrior straight from heaven would be stupid. Not that she feared for Lysander. Guy could handle himself, no problem. The way he formed a sword of fire from nothing but air was proof of that. But if something were to happen to Gwennie\u2019s precious Sabin, like, oh, decapitation, the festivities would be somewhat dimmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there, though,\u201d she added in a calmer tone. \u201cI kinda have to, you know. Since I\u2019m the maid of honor and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, no. I am, remember?\u201d</p><p>She grinned slowly. \u201cYou told me you\u2019d rather be hit by a bus than be a bridesmaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I want to have a bigger part than you, so...here I am, in Budapest, helping little Gwennie plan the ceremony. Not that she\u2019s taking my suggestions. Would it kill her to at least consider making everyone come naked?\u201d</p><p>They shared a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, you and I can attend naked,\u201d Bianka said. \u201cIt\u2019ll certainly liven things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>Kaia pushed out a breath. \u201cSo you\u2019re fine?\u201d she asked, a twinge of concern finally appearing in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d And she was. Or would be. Soon, she hoped. All she had to do was figure out what to do about Lysander. Not that he\u2019d tried to stick around, the jerk. He hadn\u2019t been able to get away from her fast enough. Sure, she\u2019d pushed him away. But dude could have fought for her attention after what she\u2019d done for him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make the angel pay for taking you without permission, right? Who am I kidding? Of course you are. If you wait till after the wedding, I can help. Please, please let me help. I have a few ideas and I think you\u2019ll like them. Picture this. It\u2019s midnight, your angel is strapped to your bed, and we each rip off one of his wings.\u201d</p><p>Nice. But because she didn\u2019t know whether Lysander was watching and listening or not\u2014was he? It was possible, and just the thought had her skin heating\u2014she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m done with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Kaia gasped out. \u201cYou can\u2019t be done with him. He abducted you. Held you prisoner. Yeah, he oil-wrestled Paris and I\u2019m pissed I didn\u2019t get to see, but that doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior. If you let him off without punishment, he\u2019ll think it\u2019s okay. He\u2019ll think you\u2019re weak. He\u2019ll come after you again.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, he would, she thought, suddenly trying not to grin. \u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d she lied. Are you listening, Lysander, baby?</p><p>\u201cBianka, tell me you don\u2019t like him. Tell me you aren\u2019t lusting for an angel.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly her smile faded. This was exactly the line of questioning she\u2019d hoped to avoid. \u201cI\u2019m not lusting for an angel.\u201d Another lie.</p><p>Another pause. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom thought Gwen\u2019s dad was an angel and she regretted sleeping with him all these years. They\u2019re too good. Too...different from us. Angels and Harpies are not meant to mix. Tell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know it. Now, I\u2019ve gotta go. Tell the bridezilla to go easy on you. Love you and see you soon,\u201d she replied and hung up before Kaia could say anything else.</p><p>Despite her fear of what Lysander made her feel, Bianka wasn\u2019t done with him. Not even close. But she\u2019d been on his turf before and therefore at a disadvantage. If he wasn\u2019t here, she needed to get him here. Willingly.</p><p>She\u2019d told him to leave her alone, she thought, and that could be a problem. Except...</p><p>With a whoop, she jumped up and spun around. That wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all. That was actually a blessing and she was smarter than she\u2019d realized. By telling him to stay away from her, she\u2019d surely become the forbidden fruit. Of course he was here, watching her.</p><p>Men never could do what they were told. Not even angels.</p><p>So. Easy.</p><p>Even better, she\u2019d given him a little taste of what it was like to be with her. He would crave more. But also, she hadn\u2019t allowed him to pleasure her. His pride would not allow her to remain in this unsatisfied state for long, while he had enjoyed such sweet completion.</p><p>And if that wasn\u2019t the case, he wasn\u2019t the virile warrior she thought he was and he therefore wouldn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>How long till he made an actual appearance? They\u2019d only been apart half a day, but she already missed him.</p><p>Missed him. Ugh. She\u2019d never missed a man before. Especially one who wanted to change her. One who despised what she was. One who could only be labeled enemy.</p><p>You have to avoid him. You want to sleep in his arms. You were protective of him while he fought Paris. He angered you but you didn\u2019t kill him. And now you\u2019re missing him? You know what this means, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Her eyes widened, and her excitement drained. Oh, gods. She should have realized...should at least have suspected. Especially when she\u2019d protected him, defended him.</p><p>Lysander, a goody-goody angel, was her consort.</p><p>Her knees gave out and she flopped onto the floor. As long as she\u2019d been alive, she\u2019d never thought to find one. Because, well, a consort was a meant-to-be husband. Some nights she\u2019d dreamed of finding hers, yes, but she hadn\u2019t thought it would actually happen.</p><p>Her consort. Wow.</p><p>Her family was going to flip. Not because Lysander had abducted her\u2014they\u2019d come to respect that\u2014but because of what he was. More than that, she didn\u2019t trust Lysander, would never trust him, and so could never do any actual sleeping with him.</p><p>Sex, though, she could allow. Often. Yes, yes, she could make this work, she thought, brightening. She could lure him to the dark side without letting her family know she was spending time with him. Humiliation averted!</p><p>Decided, she nodded. Lysander would be hers. In secret. And there was no better time to begin. If he was watching as she suspected, there was only one way to get him to reveal himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She dressed in a lacy red halter and her favorite skinny jeans and drove into town. Only reason she owned a car was because it made her appear more human. Flying kind of gave her away. Though her arms and navel were exposed, the frigid wind didn\u2019t bother her. Chilled her, yes, but that she could deal with. She wanted Lysander to see as much of her as possible.</p><p>She parked in front of The Moose Lodge, a local diner, and strode to the front door. Because it was so early and so cold, no one was nearby. A few streetlamps illuminated her, but she wasn\u2019t worried. She unlocked the door\u2014she\u2019d stolen the key from the owner months ago\u2014and disabled the alarm.</p><p>Inside, she claimed a pecan pie from the glassed refrigerator, grabbed a fork and dug in while walking to her favorite booth. She\u2019d done this a thousand times before.</p><p>Come out, come out, wherever you are. He wouldn\u2019t have just left her to her evil ways without thinking to protect the world from her. Right? She wished she could feel him, at least sense him in some way. His scent perhaps, that wild, night sky scent. But as she breathed deeply, she smelled only pecans and sugar. Still. She hadn\u2019t sensed him when he\u2019d snatched her from mid-free fall, so it stood to reason she wouldn\u2019t sense him now.</p> <p>Once the pie was polished off, the pan discarded and her fork licked clean, she filled a cup with Dr. Pepper. She placed a few quarters in the old jukebox and soon an erratic beat was echoing from the walls. Bianka danced around one of the tables, thrusting her hips forward and back, arching, sliding around, hands roving over her entire body.</p><p>For a moment, only a brief, sultry moment, she thought she felt hot hands replace her own, exploring her breasts, her stomach. Thought she felt soft feathered wings envelop her, closing her in. She stilled, heart drumming in her chest. So badly she wanted to say his name, but she didn\u2019t want to scare him away. So...what should she do? How should she\u2014</p><p>The feeling of being surrounded evaporated completely.</p><p>Damn him!</p><p>Teeth grinding, not knowing what else to do, she exited the diner the same way she\u2019d entered. Through the front door, as if she hadn\u2019t a care. That door slammed behind her, the force of it nearly shaking the walls.</p> <p>\u201cYou should lock up after yourself.\u201d</p><p>He was here; he\u2019d been watching. She\u2019d known it! Trying not to grin, she spun around to face Lysander. The sight of him stole her breath. He was as beautiful as she remembered. His pale hair whipped in the wind, little snow crystals flying around him. His golden wings were extended and glowing. But his dark eyes were not blank, as when she\u2019d first met him. They were as turbulent as an ocean\u2014just as they\u2019d been when she\u2019d left him.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to stay away from me,\u201d she said, doing her best to sound angry rather than aroused.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAnd I told you to behave. Yet here you are, full of stolen pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Return it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crass. I want you to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMoment I do, I\u2019ll start to vomit.\u201d She crossed her arms over her middle. Close the distance. Kiss me. \u201cThat would ruin my lipstick, so I have to decline.\u201d</p><p>He, too, crossed his arms over his middle. \u201cYou can also earn your food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence. Then, \u201cDo you have no morals?\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d No sexual boundaries, either. So freaking kiss me already! \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw in frustration and disappeared.</p><p>Bianka\u2019s arms dropped to her sides and she gazed around in astonishment. He\u2019d left? Left? Without touching her? Without kissing her? Bastard! She stomped to her car.</p><p>LYSANDER WATCHED AS Bianka drove away. He was hard as a rock, had been that way since she\u2019d paraded around her cabin naked, had lingered in a bubble bath and then changed into that wicked shirt. His shaft was desperate for her.</p> <p>Why couldn\u2019t she be an angel? Why couldn\u2019t she abhor sin? Why did she have to embrace it?And why was the fact that she did these things\u2014steal, curse, lie\u2014still exciting him?</p><p>Because that was the way of things, he supposed, and had been since the beginning of time. Temptation seeped past your defenses, changed you, made you long for things you shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>There had to be a way to end this madness. He couldn\u2019t destroy her, he\u2019d already proven that. But what if he could change her? He hadn\u2019t truly tried before, so it could work. And if she embraced his way of life, they could be together. He could have her. Have more of her kisses, touch more of her body.</p><p>Yes, he thought. Yes. He would help her become a woman he could be proud to walk beside. A woman he could happily claim as his own. A woman who would not be his downfall.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>AS LYSANDER HAD NEVER had a...girlfriend, as the humans would say, he had no idea how to train one. He knew only how to train his soldiers. Without emotion, maintaining distance and taking nothing personally. His soldiers, however, wanted to learn. They were eager, his every word welcomed. Bianka would resist him at every turn. That much he knew.</p><p>So. The first day, he followed her, simply observing. Planning.She, of course, stole every meal, even snacks, drank too much at a bar, danced too closely with a man she obviously did not know, then broke that man\u2019s nose when he cupped her bottom. Lysander wanted to do damage of his own, but restrained himself. Barely. At bedtime, Bianka merely paced the confines of her cabin, cursing his name. Not for a minute did she rest.</p><p>How lovely she was, dark hair streaming down her back. Red lips pursed. Skin glowing like a rainbow in the moonlight. So badly he wanted to touch her, to surround her with his wings, making them the only two people alive, and simply enjoy her.</p><p>Soon, he promised himself.</p><p>She\u2019d given him release, yet he had not done the same for her. The more he thought about that\u2014and think about it he did, all the time\u2014the more that did not sit well with him. The more he thought about it, in fact, the more embarrassed he was.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to touch her to bring her release, but he was willing to try, to learn. First, though, he had to train her as planned. How, though? he wondered again. She seemed to respond well to his kisses\u2014his chest puffed up with pride at that. He\u2019d never rewarded his soldiers for a job well done, but perhaps he could do so for Bianka. Reward her with a kiss every time she pleased him.</p><p>A failproof plan. He hoped.</p><p>The second day, he was practically humming with anticipation. When she entered a clothing store and stuffed a beaded scarf into her purse, he materialized in front of her, ready to begin.</p><p>She stilled, gaze lifting and meeting his. Rather than bow her head in contrition, she grinned. \u201cFancy meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut that back,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou do not need to steal clothing to survive.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her middle, a stubborn stance he knew well. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>A human woman who stood off to the side eyed Bianka strangely. \u201cUh, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Bianka never looked away from him. \u201cNope. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cannot see me,\u201d Lysander told her. \u201cOnly you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I look insane for talking with you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She laughed, surprising him. And even though her amusement was misplaced, he loved the sound of her laughter. It was magical, like the strum of a harp. He loved the way her mirth softened her expression and lit her magnificent skin.</p><p>Have to touch her, he thought, suddenly dazed. He took a step closer, intending to do just that. Have to experience that softness again. And in doing so, she could begin to know the delights of his rewards.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cWh-what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t help you?\u201d the woman asked, cutting her off.</p><p>Bianka remained in place, trembling, but tossed her a glare. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Now shut it before I sew your lips together.\u201d</p><p>The woman backed away, spun and raced to help someone else.</p><p>Lysander froze.</p><p>\u201cYou may continue,\u201d Bianka said to him.</p><p>How could he reward her for such rudeness? That would defeat the purpose of her training. \u201cDo you not care what people think of you?\u201d he asked, head tilting to the side.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and she stopped trembling. \u201cNo. Why should I? In a few years, these people will be dead but I\u2019ll still be alive and kicking.\u201d As she spoke, she stuffed another scarf in her purse.</p><p>Now she was simply taunting him. \u201cPut it back, and I\u2019ll give you a kiss,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Stuttering again. He was affecting her. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d He would not repeat the words. Having said them, all he wanted to do was mesh their lips together, thrust his tongue into her mouth and taste her. Hear her moan. Feel her clutch at him.</p><p>\u201cYou would willingly kiss me?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>Willingly. Desperately. He nodded.</p><p>She licked her lips, leaving a sheen of moisture behind. The sight of that pink tongue sent blood rushing into his shaft. His hands clenched at his sides. Anything to keep from grabbing her and jerking her against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d She shook her head, as if clearing her thoughts. Her eyes narrowed again, those long, dark lashes fusing together. \u201cWhy would you do that? You, who have tried to resist me at every turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust put the scarves back.\u201d So the kissing can begin.</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cAre you trying to bribe me? Because you should know, that won\u2019t work with me.\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer\u2014and lie\u2014he remained silent, chin jutting in the air. Blood...heating.</p><p>Still watching him, she reached out, palmed a belt and stuffed it in her purse, as well. \u201cSo what do you plan to do to me if I keep stealing? Give me a severe tongue-lashing? Too bad. I don\u2019t accept.\u201d</p><p>Fire slid the length of his spine even as his anger spiked. He closed the distance until the warmth of her breath was fanning over his neck and chest. \u201cYou could not get enough of me in the heavens, yet now that you are here, you want nothing to do with me. Tell me. Was your every word and action up there a lie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course my every word and action was a lie. That\u2019s what I do. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>So...did she desire him or not? Two days ago she\u2019d told her sister, Kaia, that she wanted nothing to do with him. At the time, he\u2019d thought she was merely saying that for Kaia\u2019s benefit. Now, he wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cYou could be lying now,\u201d he said. At least, that\u2019s what he hoped. And who would have thought he\u2019d ever wish for a lie?</p> <p>Excitement sparked in her eyes and spread to the rest of her features. She patted his cheek, then flattened her palm on his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re learning, angel.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath. So hot. So soft.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a proposition for you. Steal something from this store and I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Her words from a moment ago drifted through his head. You\u2019re learning, angel. He was learning? \u201cNo,\u201d he croaked out. He would not do such a thing. Not even for her. \u201cThese people need the money their goods provide. Do you care nothing for their welfare?\u201d</p><p>A flash of guilt joined the excitement. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Another lie? Probably. That guilt...it gave him hope. \u201cWhy do you need to steal like this, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeplay,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>Blood...heating...again.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I need you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>At the unexpected intrusion, they both stiffened. Bianka\u2019s gaze pulled from his; together they eyed the policeman now standing beside her.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t you see that I\u2019m in the middle of a conversation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re talking to God Himself.\u201d The grim-faced officer latched on to her wrist. \u201cI need you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Lysander,\u201d she said, clearly expecting him to do something.</p><p>Instinct demanded he save her. He wanted her safe and happy, but this would be good for her. \u201cI told you to put the items back.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped as the officer led her away. And, if Lysander wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was pride in her gaze.</p><p>ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING, Bianka thought with disgust. Again. Her third time that year. Lysander had watched the policeman usher her in back, empty her purse and cuff her. All without a word. His disapproval had said plenty, though.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t let it upset her. He\u2019d stood his ground, and she admired that. Was turned on by it. This wouldn\u2019t be an easy victory, as she\u2019d assumed. Besides, for the first time in their relationship, he\u2019d offered to kiss her. Willingly kiss her.But only if she replaced her stolen goods, she reminded herself darkly. Didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that he wanted to change her. To condition her to his way of life.</p><p>It was exactly what she wanted to do to him. Which meant he wanted her as desperately as she wanted him.</p><p>It also meant it was time to take this game to the next level. She, however, would not be the one to cave. The six hours she\u2019d spent behind bars had given her time to think. To form a strategy.</p> <p>She was whistling as she meandered down the station steps. Lysander had finally posted her bail, but he hadn\u2019t hung around to speak with her. Well, he hadn\u2019t needed to. She knew he was following her.</p><p>At home, she showered, lingering under the hot spray, soaping herself more slowly than necessary and caressing her breasts and playing between her legs. Unfortunately, he never appeared. But no matter.</p><p>Just in case her shower hadn\u2019t gotten him in the mood, she read a few passages from her favorite romance novel. And just in case that hadn\u2019t gotten him in the mood, she decorated her navel with her favorite dangling diamond, dressed in a skintight tank and skirt and knee-high boots, and drove to the closest strip club.</p><p>\u201cI only have a few days left. Then I\u2019m traveling to Budapest for Gwen\u2019s wedding and you are not invited. Do you hear me? Try and come and I\u2019ll make your life hell. So, if you want a go at me, now\u2019s the time,\u201d she said as she got out of the car.</p><p>Again, he didn\u2019t appear.</p><p>She almost screeched in frustration. So far, her strategy sucked. What was he doing?</p><p>The night was cold yet the inside of the club was hot and stuffy, the seats packed with men. Onstage, a redhead\u2014clearly not a natural redhead\u2014swung around a pole. The lights were dimmed, and smoke clung to the air.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna dance, darling?\u201d someone asked Bianka.</p><p>\u201cNope. Got better things to do.\u201d She did, however, steal the stranger\u2019s wallet, sneak a beer from the bar and settle into a table in the back corner. Alone. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d she whispered to Lysander, toasting him with the bottle.</p><p>\u201cHave you no shame?\u201d he suddenly growled from behind her.</p><p>Finally! Every muscle in her body relaxed, even as her blood heated with awareness. But she didn\u2019t turn to face him. He would have seen the triumph in her eyes. \u201cYou have enough shame for both of us.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThat does not seem to be the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, then, let\u2019s loosen you up. Do you want a lap dance?\u201d She held up the cash she\u2019d taken. \u201cI\u2019m sure the redhead onstage would love to rub against you.\u201d</p><p>His big hands settled on her shoulders, squeezing.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you\u2019d like a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would indeed,\u201d the stranger she\u2019d stolen from said, now in front of her table. He reached into his back pocket. Frowned. \u201cHey, my wallet\u2019s gone.\u201d His gaze settled on the small brown leather case resting on her tabletop. His frown deepened. \u201cThat looks like mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d she said innocently. \u201cSo do you want me to buy you a beer or not?\u201d</p><p>Lysander\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cGive him back his wallet and I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat. Gods, she wanted his kiss. More than she\u2019d ever wanted anything. His lips were soft, his taste decadent. And if she allowed him to kiss her, well, she knew she could convince him to do other things.</p><p>But she said, \u201cSteal his watch and I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d the guy asked, brow furrowed. \u201cSteal whose watch?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, wishing she could shoo him away.</p><p>Lysander leaned down and cupped her breasts. A tremor moved through her, her nipples beading, reaching for him. Sweet heaven. Her stomach quivered, jealous of her breasts, wanting the touch lower.</p><p>\u201cGive him back the wallet.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she wanted to do just that. Anything for more of Lysander and this sultry side of him. She didn\u2019t need the money, anyway. Wait. What are you doing? Caving? She straightened her spine. \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you all over your body,\u201d Lysander added.</p><p>Oh...Hell. He\u2019d decided to take their game to the next level, as well.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. She couldn\u2019t lose. If she did, he would control her with sex. He would expect her to be good like him. All the damn time. There would be no more stealing, no more cursing, no more fun. Well, except when they were in bed\u2014but would he expect her to be good there, too?</p><p>Life would become boring and sinless, everything a Harpy was taught to fight against.</p><p>She stood to shaky legs and turned, finally facing him. His hands fell away from her. She tried not to moan in disappointment. His expression was blank.</p><p>She blanked hers, as well, reached out and cupped him. Though he showed no emotion, he couldn\u2019t hide his hardness. \u201cSteal something, anything at all, and I\u2019ll kiss you all over.\u201d Her voice dipped huskily. \u201cRemember last time? You came in my mouth, and I loved every moment of it.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d the guy behind her exclaimed. \u201cGive me five minutes and I\u2019ll have stolen something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t trainable, are you?\u201d Lysander asked stiffly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, but suddenly she didn\u2019t feel like smiling. There\u2019d been resignation in his tone. Had she pushed him too far again? Was he going to leave her? Never return? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you should stop trying, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Trying what?\u201d the stranger asked, confused.</p><p>Gods, when would he leave?</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet lost,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Lysander\u2019s gaze lifted, narrowed on the human. Then Bianka heard footsteps. Her angel hadn\u2019t said anything, hadn\u2019t revealed himself, but had somehow managed to make the human leave. He had powers she hadn\u2019t known about, then. Why was that even more exciting?</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t give the wallet back and I won\u2019t steal anything, where does that leave us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAt war. I don\u2019t know about you, but I do my best fighting in bed,\u201d she said, and then threw her arms around his neck.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>WIND WHIPPED THROUGH Bianka\u2019s hair, and she knew that Lysander was flying her somewhere with those majestic wings. She had her eyes closed, too busy enjoying him\u2014finally!\u2014to care where he took her. His tongue made love to hers. His hands clutched her hips, fingers digging sharply. Then she was tipping over, a cool, soft mattress pressing into her back. His weight pinned her deliciously.</p><p>And it shouldn\u2019t have been delicious. This was not a position she allowed. Ever. It caged her wings, and her wings were the source of her strength. Without them, she was almost as weak as a human. But this was Lysander, honest to a fault, and she\u2019d wanted him forever, it seemed. And as wary as he\u2019d been about this sort of thing, she was afraid any type of rebuke would send him flying away.Besides, he could do anything he wanted to her like this...</p><p>\u201cNo one is to enter,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>Moaning, she wound her legs around his waist, tilted her head to receive his newest kiss and enjoyed a deeper thrust of his tongue. White lightning, the man was a fast learner. Very fast. He was now an expert at kissing. The best she\u2019d ever had. By the time she finished with him, he\u2019d be an expert at everything carnal.</p><p>His cock, hard and long and thick, rode the apex of her thighs. She could feel every inch of him through the softness of his robe. His arms enveloped her, and when she opened her eyes\u2014they were inside his cloud, she realized\u2014she saw his golden wings were spread, forming a blanket over them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tangled her hands in his hair and pulled from the kiss. \u201cAre you going to get into trouble for this?\u201d she asked, panting. Wait. What? Where had that thought come from?</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she lied, forcing a grin. No, no, no. That wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cBut that adds a little extra danger, don\u2019t you think?\u201d There. Better. That was more like her normal self. She didn\u2019t like his goodness, didn\u2019t want to preserve it and keep him safe.</p> <p>Did she?</p><p>\u201cWell, I will not get into trouble.\u201d He flattened his palms at her temples, boxing her in and taking the bulk of his own weight. \u201cIf that is the only reason you are here, you can leave.\u201d</p><p>How fierce he appeared. \u201cSo sensitive, angel.\u201d She hooked her fingers at the neck of his robe and tugged. The material ripped easily. But as she held it, it began to weave itself back together. Frowning, she ripped again, harder this time, until there was a big enough gap to shove the clothing from his shoulders and off his arms. \u201cI was only teasing.\u201d</p><p>His chest was magnificent. A work of art. Muscled and sun-kissed and devoid of any hair. She lifted her head and licked the pulse at the base of his neck, then traced his collarbone, then circled one of his nipples. \u201cDo you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot. Wet,\u201d he rasped, lids squeezed tight.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but do you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She sucked a peak until he gasped, then kissed away the sting. A tremor of pleasure rocked him, which caused a lance of pride to work through her. \u201cWhy do you desire me, angel? Why do you care if I\u2019m good or not?\u201d</p><p>A pause. A tortured, \u201cYour skin...\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in her body stiffened, and she glared up at him. \u201cSo any Harpy will do?\u201d She tried to hide her insult, but didn\u2019t quite manage it. The thought of another Harpy\u2014hell, any other woman, immortal or not\u2014enjoying him roused her most vicious instincts. Her nails lengthened, and her teeth sharpened. A red haze dotted her line of vision. Mine, she thought. She would kill anyone who touched him. \u201cWe all have this skin, you know?\u201d The words were guttural, scraping her throat.</p><p>His lashes separated as his eyes opened. His pupils were dilated, his expression tightening with...an emotion she didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cYes, but only yours tempts me. Why is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all she could first think to say, her anger draining completely. But she needed to respond, had to think of something light, easy. \u201cTo answer your question, you want me because I\u2019m made of awesome. And guess what? I will make you so happy you said that, warrior.\u201d</p><p>Warrior, rather than angel. She\u2019d never called him that before. Why? And why now?</p><p>\u201cNo. I will make you happy.\u201d He ripped her shirt just as she had done his robe. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra, and her breasts sprang free. Another tremor moved through him as he lowered his head.</p><p>He licked and sucked one nipple, as she had done to him, then the other, feasting. Savoring. Soon she was arching and writhing against him, craving his mouth elsewhere. Her skin was sensitized, her body desperate for release. Yet she didn\u2019t want to rush him. She was still afraid of scaring him away. But damn him, if he didn\u2019t hurry, didn\u2019t touch her between her legs, she was going to die.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she said on a trembling breath.</p><p>His wings brushed both her arms, up and down, tickling, caressing, raising goosebumps on her flesh. Holy hell, that was good. So damn good.</p><p>He lifted from her completely.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you doing? I wasn\u2019t going to tell you to leave,\u201d she screeched, bracing her weight on her elbows.</p> <p>\u201cI do not want anything between us.\u201d He shoved the robe down his legs until he was gloriously naked. Moisture gleamed at the head of his cock, and her mouth watered. Reaching out, he gripped her boots and tore them off. Her jeans quickly followed. She, of course, was not wearing any panties.</p><p>His gaze drank her in, and she knew what he saw. Her flushed, glowing skin. The aching juncture between her legs. Her rose-tinted nipples.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch and taste every inch,\u201d he said and just kind of fell on her, as if his will to resist had abandoned him completely.</p><p>\u201cTouch and taste every inch next time.\u201d Please let there be a next time. She tried to hook her legs around his waist again. \u201cI need release now.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her by the knees and spread her. Her head fell back, her hair tangling around her, and he kissed a path to her breasts, then to her stomach. He lingered at her navel until she was moaning.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she said again. Fine. She\u2019d jump on this grenade if she had to; if he wanted to taste, he could taste. \u201cMore. I need more.\u201d</p><p>Rather than give it to her, he stilled. \u201cI...took care of myself before following you this day,\u201d he admitted, cheeks pinkening. \u201cI thought that would give me resistance against you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, shock pouring through her. \u201cYou pleasured yourself?\u201d</p><p>A stiff nod.</p><p>\u201cDid you think of me?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. That\u2019s good. I can picture it, and I love what I see.\u201d His hand on his cock, stroking up and down, eyes closed, features tight with arousal, body straining toward release. Wings spread as he fell to his knees, the pleasure too much. Her, naked in his mind. \u201cWhat did you think about doing?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. A hesitant response. \u201cLicking. Between your legs. Tasting you, as I said.\u201d</p><p>She arched her back, hands skimming down her middle to her thighs. Although he already held her open, she pushed her legs farther apart. \u201cThen do it. Lick me. I want it so bad. Want your tongue on me. See how wet I am?\u201d</p><p>He hissed in a breath. \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d Leaning down, he started at her ankles and kissed his way up, lingering at the back of her knees, at the crease of her legs.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, so on edge she was ready to scream. \u201cPlease. Do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered again. \u201cYes.\u201d Finally he settled over her, mouth poised, ready. His tongue flicked out. Then, sweet contact.</p><p>She expected the touch, but nothing could have prepared her for the perfection of it. She did scream, shivered. Begged for more. \u201cYes, yes, yes. Please, please, please.\u201d</p><p>At first, he merely lapped at her, humming his approval at her taste. Thank the gods. Or God. Or whoever was responsible for this man. If he hadn\u2019t liked her in that way, she wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done. In that moment, she wanted\u2014needed\u2014to be everything he wanted\u2014needed. She wanted him to crave every part of her, as she craved every part of him.</p><p>Even his goodness?</p><p>Yes, she thought, finally admitting it. Yes. Just then, she had no defenses; she\u2019d been stripped to her soul. His goodness somehow balanced her out. She\u2019d fought against it\u2014and still had no plans to change\u2014but they were two extremes and actually complemented each other, each giving the other what he or she lacked. In her case, the knowledge that some things were worth taking seriously. In his, that it wasn\u2019t a crime to have fun.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he moaned. \u201cTell me how...what...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Soon his tongue was darting in and out of her, mimicking the act of sex. She grasped at the sheets, fisting them. She writhed, meeting his every thrust. She screamed again, moaned and begged some more.</p><p>Finally, she splintered apart. Bit down on her bottom lip until she tasted blood. White lights danced over her eyes\u2014from her skin, she realized. Her skin was so bright it was almost blinding, glowing like a lamp, something that had never happened before.</p><p>Then Lysander was looming above her. \u201cYou are not fertile,\u201d he rasped. Sweat beaded him.</p><p>That gave her fuzzy mind pause. \u201cI know.\u201d Her words were as labored as his. Harpies were only fertile once a year and this wasn\u2019t her time. \u201cBut how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSense it. Always know that kind of thing. So...are you ready?\u201d he asked, and she could hear the uncertainty in his voice.</p><p>He must not know proper etiquette, the darling virgin. He would learn. With her, there was no etiquette. Doing what felt good was the only thing that drove her.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She flattened her hands on his shoulders and pushed him to his back, careful of his wings. He didn\u2019t protest or fight her as she straddled his waist and gripped his cock by the base. Her wings fluttered in joy at their freedom. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips, nodded. His wings lifted, enveloped her, caressing her. Her head fell, the long length of her hair tickling his thighs. He trembled.</p><p>Would he regret this? she suddenly wondered. She didn\u2019t want him to hate her for supposedly ruining him.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no taking it back once it\u2019s done.\u201d If he wasn\u2019t ready, well, she would...wait, she realized. Yes, she would wait until he was ready. Only he would do. No other. Her body only wanted him.</p><p>\u201cDo not stop,\u201d he commanded, mimicking her.</p><p>A grin bloomed. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful with you,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers circled her hips and lifted her until she was poised at his tip. \u201cThe only thing that could hurt me is if you leave me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance of that,\u201d she said, and sank all the way to the hilt.</p><p>He arched up to meet her, feeding her his length, his eyes squeezing shut, his teeth nearly chewing their way through his bottom lip. He stretched her perfectly, hit her in just the right spot, and she found herself desperate for release once more. But she paused, his enjoyment more important than her own. For whatever reason.</p><p>\u201cTell me when you\u2019re ready for me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d he shouted, hips thrusting so high he raised her knees from the mattress.</p><p>Groaning at the pleasure, she moved, up and down, slipping and sliding over his erection. He was wild beneath her, as if he\u2019d kept his passion bottled up all these years and it had suddenly exploded from him, unstoppable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon, even that wasn\u2019t enough for him. He began hammering inside her, and she loved it. Loved his intensity. All she could do was hold on for the ride, slamming down on him, gasping. Her nails dug into his chest, her moans blended with his. And when her second orgasm hit, Lysander was right there with her, roaring, muscles stiffening.</p><p>He grabbed her by the neck and jerked her down, meshing their lips together. Their teeth scraped as he primitively, savagely kissed her. It was a kiss that stripped her once more to her soul, left her raw, agonized. Reeling.</p><p>He was indeed her consort, she thought, dazed. There was no denying it now. He was it for her. Her one and only. Necessary. Angel or not. She laughed, and was surprised by how carefree it sounded. Tamed by great sex. It figured. After this, no other man would do. Ever. She knew it, sensed it.</p> <p>She collapsed atop him, panting, sweating. Scared. Suddenly vulnerable. How did he feel about her? He didn\u2019t approve of her, yet he had gifted her with his virginity. Surely that meant he liked her, just as she was. Surely that meant he wanted her around.</p><p>His heart thundered in his chest, and she grinned. Surely.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he said shakily.</p><p>She yawned, more replete than she\u2019d ever been. My consort. Her eyelids closed, her lashes suddenly too heavy to hold up. Fatigue washed through her, so intense she couldn\u2019t fight it.</p><p>\u201cTalk...later,\u201d she replied, and drifted into the most peaceful sleep of her life.</p> <p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>FOR HOURS LYSANDER HELD Bianka in the crook of his arm while she slept, marveling\u2014this was what she\u2019d craved most in the world and he had given it to her\u2014and yet, he was also worrying. He knew what that meant, knew how difficult it was for a Harpy to let down her guard and sleep in front of another. It meant she trusted him to protect her, to keep her safe. And he was glad. He wanted to protect her. Even from herself.</p><p>But could he? He didn\u2019t know. They were so different.Until they got into bed, that is.</p><p>He could not believe what had just happened. He had become a creature of sensation, his baser urges all that mattered. The pleasure...unlike anything he\u2019d ever experienced. Her taste was like honey, her skin so soft he wanted it against him for the rest of eternity. Her breathy moans\u2014even her screams\u2014had been a caress inside his ears. He\u2019d loved every moment of it.</p><p>Had he been called to battle, he wasn\u2019t sure he would have been able to leave her.</p><p>Why her, though? Why had she been the one to captivate him?</p> <p>She lied to him at every opportunity. She embodied everything he despised. Yet he did not despise her. For every moment with her, he only wanted more. Everything she did excited him. The pleasure she\u2019d found in his arms...she had been unashamed, uninhibited, demanding everything he had to give.</p><p>Would he have been as enthralled by her if she had led a blameless life? If she had been more demure? He didn\u2019t think so. He liked her exactly as she was.</p><p>Why? he wondered again.</p><p>By the time she stretched lazily, sensually against him, he still did not have the answers. Nor did he know what to do with her. He\u2019d already proven he could not leave her alone. And now that he knew all of her, she would be even more impossible to resist.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she said, voice husky from her rest.</p><p>\u201cI am here.\u201d</p><p>She blinked open her eyes, jolted upright. \u201cI fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but I feel asleep.\u201d She scrubbed a hand down her beautiful face, twisted and peered down at him with vulnerable astonishment. \u201cI should be ashamed of myself, but I\u2019m not. What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>He reached up and traced a fingertip over her swollen lips. How hard had he kissed her? \u201cI\u2019m...sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost control for a moment. I shouldn\u2019t have taken you so\u2014\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his finger, her self-recrimination seeming to melt away in favor of amusement. \u201cDo you hear me complaining about that?\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. No, he did not hear her complaining. In fact, she appeared utterly sated. And he had done that. He had given her pleasure. Pride filled him. Pride\u2014a foolish emotion that often led to a man\u2019s downfall. Was that how Bianka would make him fall? For as his temptation, she would make him fall.</p><p>With a sigh, she flopped back against him. \u201cYou turned serious all of the sudden. Want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad,\u201d she grumbled, but he heard a layer of satisfaction in her tone. Did she enjoy making him do things he didn\u2019t want to do\u2014or didn\u2019t think he wanted to do? \u201cBecause you\u2019re going to talk. A lot. You can start with why you first abducted me. I know you wanted to change me, but why me? I still don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t tell her; she already had enough power over him, and knowing the truth would only increase that power. But he also wanted her to understand how desperate he\u2019d been. Was. \u201cAt the heart of my duties, I am a peacekeeper, and as such, I must peek into the lives of the Lords of the Underworld every so often, making sure they are obeying heavenly laws. I...saw you with them. And as I have proven with my actions this day, I realized you are my one temptation. The one thing that can tear me from my righteous path.\u201d</p><p>She sat up again, faced him again. Her eyes were wide with...pleasure? \u201cReally? I alone can ruin you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat does not mean you should try and do so.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she leaned down and kissed him. Her breasts pressed against his chest, once again heating his blood in that way only she could do. But he was done fighting it, done resisting it. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I just like being important to you, I guess.\u201d Her cheeks suddenly bloomed with color. \u201cWait. That\u2019s not what I meant, either. What I\u2019m trying to say is that you\u2019re forgiven for whisking me to your palace in the sky. I would have done the same thing to you had the situation been reversed.\u201d</p><p>He had not expected forgiveness to come so easily. Not from her. Frown intensifying, he cupped her cheeks and forced her to meet his gaze. \u201cWhy were you with me? I know I am not what your kind views as acceptable.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, the action a little stiff. \u201cI guess you\u2019re my temptation.\u201d</p><p>Now he understood why she\u2019d grinned over his proclamation. He wanted to whoop with satisfied laughter.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be together\u2014\u201d She stopped, waiting. When he nodded, she relaxed and continued, \u201cThen I guess I could only steal from the wicked.\u201d</p><p>It was a concession. A concession he\u2019d never thought she would make. She truly must like him. Must want more time with him.</p><p>\u201cSo listen,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sister is getting married in a week, as I told you before. Do you want to, like, come with me? As my guest? I know, I know. It\u2019s short notice. But I didn\u2019t intend to invite you. I mean, you\u2019re an angel.\u201d There was disgust in her voice. \u201cBut you make love like a demon so I guess I should, I don\u2019t know, show you off or something.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply. What he would say, he didn\u2019t know. They could not tell others of their relationship. Ever. But a voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cLysander. Are you home?\u201d</p><p>Lysander recognized the speaker immediately. Raphael, the warrior angel. Panic nearly choked him. He couldn\u2019t let the man see him like this. Couldn\u2019t let any of his kind see him with the Harpy.</p><p>\u201cWe must discuss Olivia,\u201d Raphael called. \u201cMay I enter your abode? There is some sort of block preventing me from doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he called. Was his panic in his voice? He\u2019d never experienced it before, so didn\u2019t know how to combat it. \u201cWait for me. I will emerge.\u201d He sat up and slipped from the bed, from Bianka. He grabbed his robe, or rather, the pieces of it, from the floor and wrapped it around himself. Immediately it wove back together to fit his frame. The material even cleaned him, wiping away Bianka\u2019s scent.</p><p>The latter, he inwardly cursed. For the best.</p><p>\u201cLet him in,\u201d Bianka said, fitting the sheet around her, oblivious. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Lysander kept his back to her. \u201cI do not want him to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve covered my naughty nakedness.\u201d</p><p>He gave no reply. Unlike her, he would not lie. And if he did not lie to her, he would hurt her. He did not want to do that either.</p><p>\u201cSo call him in already,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI want to see if all angels look like sin but act like saints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want him inside right now. I will go out to meet him. You will stay here,\u201d he said. Still he couldn\u2019t face her.</p><p>\u201cWait. Are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>He gave no reply.</p><p>\u201cLysander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay silent. Please. Cloud walls are thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay...silent?\u201d A moment passed in the very silence he\u2019d requested. Only, he didn\u2019t like it. He heard the rustle of fabric, a sharp intake of breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t want him to know I\u2019m here, do you? You\u2019re ashamed of me,\u201d she said, clearly shocked. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your friend to know you\u2019ve been with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to speak right now.\u201d With every word, her voice rose. \u201cI was willing to take you to my sister\u2019s wedding. Even though I knew my family would laugh at me or view me with disgust. I was willing to give you a chance. Give us a chance. But not you. You were going to hide me away. As if I\u2019m something shameful.\u201d</p><p>He whirled on her, fury burning through him. At her, at himself. \u201cYou are something shameful. I kill beings like you. I do not fall in love with them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything. Just looked up at him with wide, hurt-filled eyes. So much hurt he actually stumbled back. A sharp pain lanced his chest. But as he watched, her hurt mutated into a fury that far surpassed his.</p><p>\u201cKill me, then,\u201d she growled.</p><p>\u201cYou know I will not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Because deep down you still think you can change me. You think that I will become the pure, virtuous woman you want me to be. Well, who are you to say what\u2019s virtuous and what isn\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>He merely arched a brow. The answer was obvious and didn\u2019t need to be stated.</p><p>\u201cI told you that from now on I\u2019d only hurt the wicked, right? Well, surprise! That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done since the beginning. The pie you watched me eat? The owner of that restaurant cheats at cards, takes money that doesn\u2019t belong to him. The wallet I stole? I took it from a man cheating on his wife.\u201d</p><p>He blinked down at her, unsure he\u2019d heard correctly. \u201cWhy would you have kept that from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it change how you feel about me?\u201d She tossed back the cover and stood, glorious in her nakedness. Her skin was still aglow, multihued light reflecting off it\u2014he\u2019d touched that skin. Dark hair cascaded around her\u2014he\u2019d fisted that hair.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI do. But it has to be in secret.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought the same. Until what we just did,\u201d she said as she hastily dressed. Her clothes were not like his, did not repair on their own, and so that ripped shirt revealed more than it hid.</p><p>He tried again. Tried to make her understand. \u201cYou are everything my kind stands against, Bianka. I train warriors to hunt and kill demons. What would it say to them were I to take you as my companion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a better question. What does it say to them that you hide your sin? Because that\u2019s how you view me, isn\u2019t it? Your sin. You are such a hypocrite.\u201d She stormed past him, careful not to touch him. \u201cAnd I will not be with a hypocrite. That\u2019s worse than being an angel.\u201d</p><p>He thought she meant to race to Raphael and flaunt her presence. Shockingly enough, she didn\u2019t. And because he hadn\u2019t commanded her to stay, when she said, \u201cI want to leave,\u201d the cloud opened up at her feet.</p><p>She disappeared, falling through the sky.</p><p>\u201cBianka,\u201d he shouted. Lysander spread his wings and jumped after her. He passed Raphael, but at that point, he didn\u2019t care. He only wanted Bianka safe\u2014and that hurt and fury wiped away from her expression.</p> <p>She\u2019d turned facedown to increase her momentum. He had to tuck his wings into his back to increase his own. Finally, he caught her halfway and wrapped his arms around her, her back pressed into his stomach. She didn\u2019t flail, didn\u2019t order him to release her, which he\u2019d been prepared for.</p><p>When they reached her cabin, he straightened them, spread his wings and slowed. Snow still covered the ground and crunched when they landed. She didn\u2019t pull away. Didn\u2019t run. Something else he\u2019d been prepared for.</p><p>Clearly he knew very little about her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably best this way, you know,\u201d she said flatly, keeping her back to him. The wind slapped her hair against his cheeks. \u201cThat was my afterglow talking earlier, anyway. I never should have invited you to the wedding. We\u2019re too different to make anything work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was willing to try,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. Don\u2019t do this, he projected. Don\u2019t end us.</p><p>She laughed without humor, and he marveled at the difference between this laugh and the one she\u2019d given inside his cloud. Marveled and mourned. \u201cNo, you were willing to hide me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Therefore I was trying to make something work. I want to be with you, Bianka. Otherwise I would not have followed you. I would have left you alone from the first. I would not have tried to show you the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a pompous ass,\u201d she spat. \u201cShow me the light? Please! You want me to be perfect. Blameless. But what happens when I fail? And I will, you know? Perfection just isn\u2019t in me. One day I will curse. Like now. Fuck you. One day I will take something just because it\u2019s pretty and I want it. Would that ruin me in your eyes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t so far,\u201d he spat back.</p><p>She laughed again, this one bleaker, grim. \u201cThe scarves I took were made by child laborers. So I haven\u2019t really done anything too terrible yet. But I will. And you know what? If you were to do something nauseatingly righteous, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. I would still have wanted to take you to the wedding. That\u2019s the difference between us. Evil or not, good or not, I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, too. But that was not always the case, and you know it. You would care.\u201d He tightened his grip on her. \u201cBianka. We can work this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201d Finally, she twisted to face him. \u201cThat would require giving you a second chance, and I don\u2019t do second chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a second chance. I just need you to think about this. To realize our relationship must stay hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be your secret shame, Lysander.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. She was trying to force his hand, and he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cYou steal in secret. You sleep in secret. Why not this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you don\u2019t know the answer proves you aren\u2019t the warrior I thought you were. Have a nice life, Lysander,\u201d she said, jerking from his hold and walking away without a backward glance.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>LYSANDER SAT IN THE BACK of the Budapest chapel, undetectable, watching Bianka help her sisters and their friends decorate for the wedding. She was currently hanging flowers from the vaulted ceiling. Without a ladder.</p><p>He\u2019d been following her for days, unable to stay away. One thing he\u2019d noticed: she talked and laughed as if she was fine, normal, but the sparkle was gone from her eyes, her skin.And he had done that to her. Worse, not once had she cursed, lied or stolen. Again, his fault. He\u2019d told her she was unworthy of him. He\u2019d been\u2014was, right?\u2014too embarrassed of her to tell his people about her.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t deny that he missed her. Missed everything about her. That much he knew. She excited him, challenged him, frustrated him, consumed him, drew him, made him feel. He did not want to be without her.</p><p>Something soft brushed his shoulder. He barely managed to tear his gaze from Bianka to turn and see that Olivia was now sitting beside him.</p><p>What was wrong with him? He hadn\u2019t heard her arrive. Normally his senses were tuned, alert.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you summon me here?\u201d she asked. She glanced around nervously. Her dark curls framed her face, rosebuds dripping from a few of the strands.</p><p>\u201cTo Budapest? Because you are always here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs are you these days,\u201d she replied dryly.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDid you just come from Aeron\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>She gave a reluctant nod.</p><p>\u201cRaphael came to me,\u201d he said. The day he\u2019d lost Bianka. The worst day of his existence.</p><p>\u201cThose flowers aren\u2019t centered, B,\u201d the redheaded Kaia called, claiming his attention and stopping the rest of his speech to his charge. \u201cShift them a little to the left.\u201d</p><p>Bianka expelled a frustrated sigh. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My left, dummy.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling, Bianka obeyed.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Kaia beamed up at her.</p><p>Bianka flipped her off, and Lysander grinned. Thank the One True Deity he had not killed all of her spirit.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re perfect, too,\u201d her youngest sister, Gwendolyn, said.</p><p>Bianka released the ceiling panels and dropped to the floor. When she landed, she straightened as if the jolt had not affected her in any way. \u201cGlad the princess is finally happy with something,\u201d she muttered. Then, more loudly, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t get married in a tree like a civilized Harpy.\u201d</p><p>Gwen anchored her hands on her fists. \u201cBecause my dream has always been to be wed in a chapel like any other normal person. Now, will someone please remove the naked portraits of Sabin from the walls? Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to get rid of them when I just spent all that time hanging them?\u201d Anya, goddess of Anarchy and companion to Lucien, keeper of Death, asked, clearly offended. \u201cThey add a little something extra to what would otherwise be very boring proceedings. My wedding will have strippers. Live ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring? Boring!\u201d Fury passed over Gwen\u2019s features, black bleeding into her eyes, her teeth sharpening.</p><p>Lysander had watched this same change overtake her multiple times already. In the past hour alone.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be boring,\u201d Ashlyn, companion to Maddox, the keeper of Violence, said soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The pregnant woman rubbed her rounded belly. That belly was larger than it should have been, given the early state of her pregnancy. No one seemed to realize it, though. They would soon enough, he supposed. He just hoped they were ready for what she carried.</p><p>What would a child of Bianka\u2019s be like? he suddenly wondered. Harpy, like her? Angel, like him? Or a mix of both?</p><p>A pang took root and flourished in his chest.</p><p>\u201cBoring?\u201d Gwen snarled again, clearly not ready to let the insult slide.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Bianka threw up her arms. \u201cSomeone get Sabin before Gwennie kills us all in a rage.\u201d</p><p>A Harpy in a rage could hurt even other Harpies, Lysander knew. As Gwen\u2019s consort, Sabin, keeper of Doubt, was the only one who could calm her.</p><p>With that thought, Lysander\u2019s head tilted to the side. He had never seen Bianka erupt, he realized. She\u2019d viewed everything as a game. Well, not true. Once, she had gotten mad. The time Paris had punched him. Lysander had been her enemy, but she\u2019d still gotten mad over his mistreatment.</p><p>Lysander had calmed her.</p><p>The pang grew in intensity, and he rubbed his breastbone. Was he Bianka\u2019s consort? Did he want to be?</p><p>\u201cNo need to search me out. I\u2019m here.\u201d Sabin strode through the double doors. \u201cAs if I\u2019d be more than a few feet away when she\u2019s so sensitiv\u2014uh, just in case she needed my help. Gwen, baby.\u201d There at the end, his tone had lowered, gentled. He reached her and pulled her into his arms; she snuggled against him. \u201cThe most important thing tomorrow is that we\u2019ll be together. Right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLysander,\u201d Olivia said, drawing his attention from the now-cooing couple. \u201cThe wait is difficult. Raphael came to you and...what?\u201d</p><p>Lysander sighed, forcing himself to concentrate. \u201cAnswer a few questions for me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said after a brief hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you like Aeron when he is so different from you?\u201d</p><p>She twisted the fabric of her robe. \u201cI think I like him because he is so different from me. He has thrived amid darkness, managing to retain a spark of light in his soul. He is not perfect, is not blameless, but he could have given in to his demon long ago and yet still he fights. He protects those he loves. His passion for life is...\u201d She shivered. \u201cAmazing. And really, he only hurts people when his demon overtakes him\u2014and only if they are wicked, at that. Innocents, he leaves alone.\u201d</p><p>It was the same with Bianka. Yet Lysander had tried to make her ashamed of herself. Ashamed when she should only be proud of what she had accomplished, thriving amid darkness, as Olivia had said. \u201cAnd you are not embarrassed for our kind to know of your affection for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassed of Aeron?\u201d Olivia laughed. \u201cWhen he is stronger, fiercer, more alive than anyone I know? Of course not. I would be proud to be called his woman. Not that it could ever happen,\u201d she added sadly.</p><p>Proud. There was that word again. And this time, something clicked in his mind. I\u2019m not going to be your secret shame, Lysander, Bianka had said. He\u2019d reminded her that she committed all her other sins in secret. Why not him? She hadn\u2019t told him the answer, but it came to him now. Because she\u2019d been proud of him. Because she\u2019d wanted to show him off.</p> <p>As he should have wanted to show her off.</p><p>Any other man would have been proud to stand beside her. She was beautiful, intelligent, witty, passionate and lived by her own moral code. Her laughter was more lovely than the song of a harp, her kiss as sweet as a prayer.</p><p>He\u2019d considered her the spawn of Lucifer, yet she was a gift from the One True Deity. He was such a fool.</p><p>\u201cHave I answered your questions sufficiently?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He was surprised by the rawness of his voice. Had he ruined things irreparably between them?</p><p>\u201cSo answer a few now for me.\u201d</p> <p>Unable to find his voice, he nodded. He had to make this right. Had to try, at least.</p><p>\u201cBianka. The Harpy you watch. Do you love her?\u201d</p><p>Love. He found her among the crowd and the pang in his chest grew unbearable. She was currently adding a magic marker mustache to one of Sabin\u2019s portraits while Kaia added...other things down below. Kaia was giggling; Bianka looked like she was just going through the motions, taking no joy.</p><p>He wanted her happy. Wanted her the way she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cYou think you are embarrassed of her,\u201d Olivia continued when he gave no response.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He forced the words to leave him.</p><p>\u201cI am\u2014or was\u2014a joy-bringer, Lysander. It was my job to know what people were feeling and then help them see the truth. Because only in truth can one find real joy. You were never embarrassed of her. I know you. You are embarrassed by nothing. You were simply scared. Scared that you were not what she needs.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. Could that be true? He\u2019d tried to change her. Had tried to make her what he was so that she, in turn, would like what he was? Yes. Yes, that made sense, and for the second time in his existence, he hated himself.</p> <p>He had let Bianka get away from him. When he should have sung her praises to all of the heavens, he had cast her aside. No man was more foolish. Irreparable damage or not, he had to try and win her back.</p><p>He jumped to his feet. \u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cI love her.\u201d He wanted to throw his arms around her. Wanted to shout to all the world that she belonged to him. That she had chosen him as her man.</p><p>His shoulders slumped. Chosen. Key word. Past tense. She would not choose him again. She did not give second chances, she\u2019d said.</p><p>She often lies...</p><p>For the first time, the thought that his woman liked to lie caused him to smile. Perhaps she had lied about that. Perhaps she would give him a second chance. A chance to prove his love.</p><p>If he had to grovel, he would. She was his temptation, but that did not have to be a bad thing. That could be his salvation. After all, his life would mean nothing without her. Same for her. She had told him that he was her own temptation. He could be her salvation.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told Olivia. \u201cThank you for showing me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>How should he approach Bianka? When? Urgency flooded him. He wanted to do so now. As a warrior, though, he knew some battles required planning. And as this was the most important battle of his existence, plan his attack he would.</p><p>If she forgave him and decided to be with him, they would still have a tough road ahead. Where would they live? His duties were in the heavens. She thrived on earth, with her family nearby. Plus, Olivia was destined to kill Aeron, who would essentially be Bianka\u2019s brother-in-law after tomorrow. And if Olivia decided not to, another angel would be chosen to do the job.</p><p>Most likely, that would be Lysander.</p><p>One thing his Deity had taught him, however, was that love truly could conquer all. Nothing was stronger. They could make this work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost you again,\u201d Olivia said with a laugh. \u201cBefore you rush off, you must tell me why you summoned me. What Raphael said to you.\u201d</p><p>Some of his good mood evaporated. While Olivia had just given him hope and helped him find the right path, he was about to dash any hopes of a happily-ever-after for her.</p><p>\u201cRaphael came to me,\u201d he repeated. Just do it; just say it. \u201cHe told me of the council\u2019s unhappiness with you. He told me they grow weary of your continued defiance.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fell away. \u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just...I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to hurt him. Watching him gives me joy. And I deserve to experience joy after so many centuries of devoted service, do I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he is dead, I will never be able to do the things I now dream about.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching him. Curling into his arms.\u201d A pause. \u201cKissing him.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous desires indeed. Oh, did he know their power. \u201cIf you never experience them,\u201d he offered, \u201cthey are easier to resist.\u201d But he hated to think of this wonderful female being without something she wanted.</p><p>He could petition the council for Aeron\u2019s forgiveness, but that would do no good. A decree was a decree. A law had been broken and someone had to pay. \u201cVery soon, the council will be forced to offer you a choice. Your duty or your downfall.\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at her hands, once again twisting the fabric of her robe. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t know why I hesitate. He would never desire me, anyway. The women here, they are exciting, dangerous. As fierce as he is. And I am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are precious. Never think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a shaky smile.</p><p>\u201cI have always loved you, Olivia. I would hate to see you give up everything you are for a man who has threatened to kill you. You do know what you would be losing, yes?\u201d</p><p>That smile fell away as she nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou would fall straight into hell. The demons there will go for your wings. They always go for the wings first. No longer will you be impervious to pain. You will hurt, yet you will have to dig your way free of the underground\u2014or die there. Your strength will be depleted. Your body will not regenerate on its own. You will be more fragile than a human because you were not raised among them.\u201d</p><p>While he thought he could survive such a thing, he did not think Olivia would. She was too delicate. Too...sheltered. Until this point, every facet of her life had dealt with joy and happiness. She had known nothing else.</p><p>The demons of hell would be crueler to her than they would be even to him, the man they feared more than any other. She was all they despised. Wholly good. Destroying such innocence and purity would delight them.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Her voice trembled. Tears streaked down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cBecause I do not want you to make the wrong decision. Because I want you to know what you\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in silence, then she jumped up and threw her arms around his neck. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her tightly, sensing that this was her way of saying goodbye. Sensing that this would be the last time they were offered such a reprieve. But he would not stop her, whatever path she chose.</p><p>She pulled back and smoothed her trembling hands down her glistening white robe. \u201cYou have given me much to consider. So now I will leave you to your female. May love always follow you, Lysander.\u201d As she spoke, her wings expanded. Up, up she flew, misting through the ceiling\u2014and Bianka\u2019s flowers\u2014before disappearing.</p><p>He hoped she\u2019d choose her faith, her immortality, over the keeper of Wrath, but feared she would not. His gaze strayed to Bianka, now walking down the aisle toward the exit. She paused at his row, frowned, before shaking her head and leaving. If he\u2019d been forced to pick between her and his reputation and lifestyle, he would have picked her, he realized.</p><p>And now it was time to prove it to her.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>I\u2019VE GOT TO PULL MYSELF from this funk, Bianka thought. This was her youngest sister\u2019s wedding day. She should be happy. Delighted. If she were honest, though, she was a tiny bit\u2014aka a lot\u2014jealous. Gwen\u2019s man, a demon, loved her. Was proud of her.</p><p>Lysander considered Bianka unworthy.She\u2019d thought about proving herself to him, but had quickly discarded the idea. Proving herself worthy\u2014his idea of worthy, that is\u2014would entail nothing more than a lie. And Lysander hated lies. So, according to him, she would never be good enough for him. Which meant he was stupid, and she didn\u2019t date stupid men. Plus, he didn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>He deserved to rot in his unhappiness. And that\u2019s what he\u2019d be without her. Unhappy. Or so she hoped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo much for our plan to go naked,\u201d Kaia muttered beside her. \u201cGwen saw me leave my room that way and almost sliced my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not,\u201d the bride in question said from behind them.</p><p>They turned in unison. Bianka\u2019s breath caught as it had every time she\u2019d seen her youngest sister in her gown. It was a princess cut, which was fitting, the straps thin, the beautiful white lace cinching just under her breasts before flowing to her ankles. The material covering her legs was sheer, allowing glimpses of thigh and those gorgeous red heels.</p> <p>Her strawberry curls were half up, half down, diamonds glittering through the strands. There was so much love and excitement in her gold-gray eyes it was almost blinding.</p><p>\u201cI almost pushed you out a window,\u201d Gwen added.</p><p>They laughed. Even stoic Taliyah, their oldest sister, who had her arm wrapped through Gwen\u2019s. Since it turned out Gwen\u2019s father was the Lords\u2019 greatest enemy, and Gwen\u2019s mom had disowned her years ago, Taliyah was escorting Gwen down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cHence the reason I\u2019m now wearing this.\u201d Kaia motioned to her own gown, an exact match to Bianka\u2019s. A buttercup yellow creation with more ribbons, bows and sequined rose appliqu\u00e9s than anyone should wear in an entire lifetime. They even wore hats with orange streamers.</p><p>Gwen shrugged, unrepentant. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you looking prettier than me, so sue me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWeddings suck,\u201d Bianka said. \u201cYou should have just had Sabin tattoo your name on his ass and called it good.\u201d That\u2019s what she would have done. Not that Lysander ever would have agreed to such a thing. Whether they were together or not.</p><p>Which they never would be. Bastard.</p><p>\u201cI did. Have him tattoo my name on his ass,\u201d Gwen said. \u201cAnd his arm. And his chest. And his back. But then I casually mentioned how much I\u2019d always wanted a big wedding, and well, he told me I had four weeks to plan it or he\u2019d take over and do it himself. And everyone knows men can\u2019t plan shit. So...\u201d She shrugged again, though the excitement and love on her face had intensified. \u201cAre they ready for us yet?\u201d</p><p>Bianka and Kaia turned back to the chapel, peeking through the crack in the closed doors.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Bianka said. \u201cParis is missing.\u201d</p><p>Paris, who had gotten ordained over the Internet, would be presiding over the nuptials.</p> <p>\u201cHe better hurry,\u201d she added grumpily. \u201cOr I\u2019ll find a way to make him oil-wrestle again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been so depressed lately. Missing your angel?\u201d Kaia asked her, pinkie-waving to Amun, who stood in the line of groomsmen beside Sabin at the altar.</p><p>Amun shouldn\u2019t have been able to see her, but somehow he did. He nodded, a smile twitching at the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I hate him.\u201d A lie. She hadn\u2019t told her sisters why she and Lysander had parted, only that they had. Forever. If they knew the truth, they\u2019d want to kill him. And as all but Gwen were paid killers, immensely good at their job, she\u2019d find herself the proud owner of Lysander\u2019s head.</p><p>Which she didn\u2019t want.</p><p>She just wanted him. Stupid girl.</p><p>\u201cI only would have teased you for a few years, you know,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cYou should have kept him around. It might have been fun to corrupt him.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be corrupted any more than she wanted to be purified. They were too different. Could never make anything work. Their separation was for the best. So why couldn\u2019t she get over it? Why did she feel his gaze on her, every minute of every day? Even now, when she looked like a Southern belle on crack?</p> <p>\u201cSo Sabin doesn\u2019t have a last name,\u201d she said to Gwen, drawing attention away from herself. \u201cAre you going to call yourself Gwen Sabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. I\u2019m going to call myself Gwen Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Anya plan to call herself? Anya Underworld?\u201d Kaia asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cKnowing our goddess, she\u2019ll demand Lucien take her last name. Trouble. Or is that her middle name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI here, I here,\u201d a voice suddenly screeched. Legion pushed her way in front of Bianka and Kaia. She was wearing a yellow dress, as well. Only hers had more ribbons, bows and sequins. A basket of flowers was clutched in her hands, her too-long nails curling around the handle. Best of all, she wore a tiara. Because she didn\u2019t have hair, it had had to be glued to her scaled head. \u201cWe begin now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for permission but shouldered her way through the door. The crowd\u2014which consisted of the Lords of the Underworld, their companions and some gods and goddesses Anya knew\u2014turned and gasped when they saw her. Well, except for Gideon. He\u2019d recently been captured and tortured by Hunters, the Lords\u2019 nemeses, and was currently missing his hands. (His feet weren\u2019t in the best of shape, either.) Because of his injuries, he was beyond weak, so he lay in his gurney, barely conscious. He\u2019d insisted on coming, though.</p><p>From his pew, Aeron smiled indulgently as Legion tossed pink petals in every direction. Just as she reached the front, Paris raced to the podium. He looked harried, pale, and Sabin punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>Sabin looked amazing. He wore a black tux, his hair slicked back, and when he turned to face the door, watching for Gwen, his entire face lit. With love. With pride. Bianka\u2019s jealousy increased. She wanted that. Wanted her man to find her perfect in every way.</p><p>Was that too much to ask?</p><p>Apparently so. Stupid Lysander.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go,\u201d Gwen ordered, giving them a little push.</p><p>Bianka kicked into motion, heading toward Strider, her appointed groomsman. He smiled at her when she reached him. He would be proud to call her his woman, she thought. She tried to make herself return the gesture, but her eyes were too busy filling with tears. She looked around, trying to distract herself.</p><p>The chapel really was beautiful. The glittery white flowers she\u2019d hung from the ceiling were thick and lush and offered a canopy, a haven. They were the best part of the decor, if you asked her. Candles flickered with golden light, twining with shadows.</p><p>Kaia approached her side, and everyone except for Gideon stood. The music changed, slowing down to the bridal march. Gwen and Taliyah appeared. Sabin\u2019s breath caught. Yes, that was the way a man should react to the sight of his woman.</p><p>What makes you think you were ever Lysander\u2019s woman?</p><p>Because she was his one temptation. Because of the reverent way he had touched her. Because she liked how he made her feel. Because they balanced each other. Because he completed her in a way she hadn\u2019t known she needed. He was the light to her darkness.</p><p>He was willing to show you that light. Over and over again.</p><p>Perhaps she should have fought for him. That\u2019s what she was, after all. A fighter. Yet she\u2019d given in as if he meant nothing to her when he had somehow become the most important thing in her life.</p><p>Bianka didn\u2019t mean to, but she tuned out as Paris gave his speech and the happy couple recited their vows, her thoughts remaining focused on Lysander. Should she try and fight for him now? If so, how would she go about it?</p><p>Only when the crowd cheered did she snap out of her haze, watching as Sabin and Gwen kissed. Then they were marching down the aisle and out the doors together. The rest of the bridal party made their way out, as well.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Strider asked, holding out his arm for her.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t.\u201d Paris grabbed her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re needed in that room.\u201d With his free hand, he pointed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Was he planning revenge against her for forcing him to oil-wrestle Lysander? He hadn\u2019t mentioned it in the days since her return to Buda, but he couldn\u2019t be happy with her. He should be thanking her, for gods\u2019 sake. He\u2019d gotten to touch all of Lysander\u2019s hawtness.</p><p>Paris rolled his eyes. \u201cJust go before your boyfriend decides he\u2019s tired of waiting and comes out here.\u201d</p><p>Her boyfriend. Lysander? Couldn\u2019t be. Could it? But why would he have come? Heart drumming in her chest, she walked forward. She didn\u2019t allow herself to run, though she wanted to soooo badly. She reached the door. Her hand shook as she turned the knob.</p><p>Hinges creaked. Then she was staring into\u2014an empty room. Her teeth ground together. Paris\u2019s revenge, just as she\u2019d figured. Of course. That rat bastard piece of shit was going to pay. She wasn\u2019t just going to make him oil-wrestle. She was going to\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello, Bianka.\u201d</p><p>Lysander.</p><p>Gasping, she whipped around. Her eyes widened. In an instant, the chapel had been transformed. No longer were her sisters and friends inside. Lysander and his kind occupied every spare inch. Angels were everywhere, light surrounding them and putting Gwen\u2019s candles to shame.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, not daring to hope.</p><p>\u201cI came to beg your forgiveness.\u201d His arms spread. \u201cI came to tell you that I am proud to be your man. I brought my friends and brethren to bear witness to my proclamation.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, still not letting hope take over. \u201cBut I\u2019m evil and that\u2019s not going to change. I\u2019m your temptation. You could, I don\u2019t know, lose everything by being with me.\u201d The thought hit her, and she wanted to wilt. He could lose everything. No wonder he had wanted to destroy her. No wonder he had wanted to hide her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not evil. And I don\u2019t want you to change. You are beautiful and intelligent and brave. But more than that, you are my everything. I am nothing without you. Not good, not right, not complete. And do not worry. I will not lose everything as you said. You have not committed an unpardonable sin.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cAnd if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will fall.\u201d</p><p>Okay. A small kernel of hope managed to seep inside her. But no way would she let him fall. Ever. He loved being an angel. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finally pulled my head out of my ass,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>He\u2019d said ass. Lysander had just said the word ass. More hope beat its way inside and she had to press her lips together to keep from smiling. And crying! Tears were springing in her eyes, burning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Could they actually make their relationship work? Just a little bit ago, she\u2019d been grateful\u2014or pretending to be grateful\u2014that they were apart, since so many obstacles existed.</p><p>\u201cI only hope you can love so foolish a man. I am willing to live wherever you desire. I am willing to do anything you need to win you back.\u201d He dropped to his knees. \u201cI love you, Bianka Skyhawk. I would be proud to be yours.\u201d</p><p>He was proud of her. He wanted her. He loved her. It was everything she\u2019d secretly dreamed about this past week. Yes, they could make this work. They would be together, and that was the most important thing. But she told him none of that.</p> <p>\u201cNow?\u201d she screeched instead. \u201cYou decided to introduce me to your friends now? When I look like this?\u201d Scowling, she peeked over his shoulder at them and saw their stunned expressions. \u201cI usually look better than this, you know. You should have seen me the other day. When I was naked.\u201d</p><p>Lysander stood. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say to me?\u201d</p><p>She focused back on him. His eyes were as wide as hers had been, his arms crossed over his middle. \u201cNo. There\u2019s more,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cBut I will never live this yellow gown thing down, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I love you, too. But if you ever decide I\u2019m unworthy again, I\u2019ll show you just how demonic I can be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeal. But you don\u2019t have to worry, love,\u201d he said, a slow smile lifting those delectable lips. \u201cIt is I who am unworthy. I only pray you never learn of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it already,\u201d she said, and his grin spread. \u201cNow c\u2019mere, you.\u201d She cupped the back of his neck and jerked him down for a kiss.</p><p>His arms banded around her, holding her close. She\u2019d never thought to be paired with an angel, but she couldn\u2019t regret it now. Not when Lysander was the angel in question.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready for me?\u201d she asked him when they came up for air.</p><p>He nipped at her chin. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for you my entire life. I just didn\u2019t know it until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With a whoop, she jumped up and wound her legs around his waist. A wave of gasps circled the room. They were still here? \u201cDitch your friends, I\u2019ll blow off my sister\u2019s reception and we\u2019ll go oil-wrestle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny,\u201d he said, wings enveloping her as he flew her up, up and into his cloud. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was thinking.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
