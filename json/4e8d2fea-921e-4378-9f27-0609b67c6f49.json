When are you going to start acting like one?\u201d</p><p>I snarled and showed some fang. \u201cCareful, fur face. You really don\u2019t want to make me mad.\u201d Yeah, I\u2019m a vampire. Forget stereotypes. I\u2019m blond, blue-eyed and twentysomething with a, uh, voluptuous figure. Vamps are everywhere and you won\u2019t have a clue. We\u2019re pretty good at blending with mortals and if we\u2019re caught in a compromising situation, like say with our fangs in your neck . . . ? Well, there\u2019s always the whammy. We can make fang marks disappear along with your memory. Hmmm. Makes you wonder, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cCome on, Glory. I\u2019m hurting here.\u201d Valdez talks in my head. A lot.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my dog-slash-bodyguard, Valdez. You\u2019re supposed to be taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I am. Now turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to the store. Forget it. I got the essentials \u2014cream rinse and flea shampoo.\u201d I gasped when my stomach cramped again. \u201cThose damned Cheetos almost killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to eat any. You expect me to give them up just because you can\u2019t handle them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a near-death experience.\u201d Who knew a Big Grab of Cheetos could be so lethal? If you know anything about vampires, you know we can dish it out, but we can\u2019t or won\u2019t take it. I\u2019m an old vampire. Like, \u201cI hung out with Billy Shakespeare\u201d old. I knew better, but just once I\u2019d wanted a little crunch in my diet. I gave up biting mortals, mostly, ages ago. But chugging the bottled fake stuff just hadn\u2019t been cutting it for me for a long, long time.</p> <p>I wheeled my aging Suburban into the parking lot behind my apartment building where I have my shop, Vintage Vamp \u2019s Emporium (cute, huh?) on the ground floor. The security lights were out again. Not a good sign. Valdez had taken an arrow in the hip back here. An arrow intended for me. I slowed down to a crawl, fought another pain, this one in my head for a change, then pulled into my parking spot.</p><p>Crunch, thump and the car lurched to a stop. Oops.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve done it. Stay here and lock yourself in.\u201d Valdez opened the passenger door (don\u2019t ask) and hopped out, obviously on high alert. Was this a trap? Everyone I know realizes that\u2019s my parking spot. Was some stake-happy vamp hunter waiting to get me when I checked out whatever I\u2019d hit?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not picking up on a threat. But we\u2019re in deep shit anyway. \u201d Valdez stopped next to my door. \u201cBack up a foot, then come see.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I turned off the engine, another sharp pain hit me right between my eyes. What the hell? I never have headaches unless I\u2019m trying to block one of my mind-reading friends. And the Cheetos didn\u2019t mess with my head. Instead I\u2019m stuck with what I\u2019ll call the Cheeto bulge. I\u2019m curvy anyway, but since I did the dirty with the snacks, I\u2019ve developed a new curve in my tummy area. I unlocked the doors and got out.</p><p>Thanks to my superior vamp night vision I could see that the Suburban looked undamaged, but the crushed metal between the car and the fence had once been, gulp, a motorcycle. And not one of those cheap bikes, but, double gulp, a classic Harley. And I know about these things. Had a boyfriend once who\u2019d been into those. Mortal. And very last century. One thing I try to do is stay current. I may be ancient, but I don\u2019t ever intend to look or act that way.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell have you done, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>I turned around, fully prepared to do some kind of vamp whammy until I could figure out how to make this right without the involvement of law enforcement or insurance adjusters. One look at the furious Harley owner and I knew the whammy wasn \u2019t going to cut it.</p><p>Richard Mainwaring is a vamp too. A friend, sort of, but also a scary dude. Anyway, he was staring at the mangled mess like, if he\u2019d been any less pure macho male, he would have shed a few tears. I wanted to cry too. Maybe I could entice him upstairs for a bottle of Fangtastic (my blood substitute of choice lately) and an all-out sob fest.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it. And this is my parking spot.\u201d Yep, I was defensive.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no assigned parking here.\u201d He tenderly set the fallen motorcycle back on its wheels, the effort doing nice things to his biceps. The Harley wobbled for a moment and I held my breath until it seemed steady.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s for residents only. You don\u2019t live here, do you?\u201d He\u2019d been an item with my roommate, Florence da Vinci, until recently, but the last word on that subject was that Flo had dumped him. Had they made up and he was moving into Flo \u2019s bedroom?</p><p>\u201cNo. And I\u2019m not with Florence.\u201d He had a grim look. And don\u2019t you hate the fact that he\u2019d read my mind? It\u2019s a bad vamp habit that I refuse to acquire, at least not on a regular basis. And I\u2019d had run-ins with Richard before. His thoughts are never up for grabs.</p><p>\u201cThen you have no business parking here. Visitor parking is in front of the building.\u201d</p> <p>He knelt down to examine what had been the rear wheel of the Harley. Hmm. He did fill out a pair of jeans nicely. Not that I should be noticing that right now. More to the point, he had a set of shoulders on him, clearly showcased in a sleeveless leather vest, shoulders that would have done a line-backer proud. I have vamp strength, but this guy could have thrown me across the parking lot without breaking a sweat.</p><p>He turned and gave me a measuring look. Oops. I think I came up short. I unzipped my jacket, a cozy velour hoodie that matched my turquoise sweat pants and sleeveless tank. He could outmuscle me, but I\u2019ve got a few weapons of my own. Maybe if I flashed a little cleavage . . . Mainwaring\u2019s a former priest turned vamp, but I know for a fact that he\u2019s very into women.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, how could you do this? Didn\u2019t you see the space was already occupied?\u201d Mainwaring has a slight British accent, white blond hair and the kind of eyes that make you think of clear skies. That is, if you can remember that far back. Me, I haven \u2019t seen daylight personally since 1604. Sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark back here.\u201d I looked down at my dog, pressed against my right leg. \u201cAnd Valdez and I were having a discussion . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lay this off on me, Blondie.\u201d Valdez chuffed and stepped away. \u201cYou were driving this heap, not me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not the only one who can hear Valdez and Mainwaring gave the dog a look, like\u2014who\u2019s the master here? Good question. Instead of growling at Mainwaring like a good guard dog, Valdez sat down and scratched his left ear. We really needed that flea shampoo.</p><p>\u201cLook. The Harley is, I mean was, black without a lot of chrome or anything. Plus the security lights are out. Maybe we should hustle our butts inside to discuss this. Hunters could be stalking us as we speak.\u201d I did feel . . . something out here. Mainwaring stood and scanned the area with a narrow-eyed look that meant business if anyone dared make a move on us. Finally he shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re safe enough. But perhaps you\u2019d like to go inside, closer to your checkbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha.\u201d I put my hand on his bulging bicep, fluttered my eyelashes and leaned in to give him a cleavage close-up. Mainwaring just glared. Ever try charming an uptight man with a wounded Harley? But charm was all I had at the moment. Unlike a lot of vamps, I\u2019m not rich. I work for a living. This century I started my own business, and it got off to a great start, but there\u2019s overhead, stock to buy, my own living expenses . . . Well, you get the picture. Obviously, I don\u2019t have enough in my checking account to pay for Richie Rich\u2019s Harley. Hey, I buy generic cream rinse. What does that tell you?</p><p>\u201cNow, Richard.\u201d I smiled what I hoped was sweetly. Not easy to do when your head feels like it \u2019s about to split open. \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry, but be reasonable. You know I didn\u2019t mean to hit the motorcycle. And I\u2019m sure you can afford\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned and squatted next to the downed bike. I knew enough to shut up. For a long moment, he just stared at it, then he picked up a piece of metal that had fallen to the ground. He finally stood and walked closer to me, too close. I held my ground, even though I could practically feel the hostility coming off of Mr. Motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be held accountable, Gloriana. Whether or not I can afford to replace a 1946 Knucklehead is not the issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I knew better than to grin, but it was a struggle. \u201cDid you just call your bike a knucklehead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the model. A 1946 Harley Davidson Knucklehead. Rare. Valuable. \u201d He was really in my space. \u201cMaybe even irreplaceable.\u201d</p><p>Oh, jeez. Heaven forbid I should have mangled a vintage cycle. And I did feel bad, especially with Richard looming over me. I eased around him to check out the damage.</p><p>\u201cLook. I think it can be fixed. It\u2019s mainly the back end that\u2019s crunched. Why don\u2019t you get an estimate or two and then we\u2019ll talk?\u201d And maybe I could win the lottery in the meantime.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the money, it\u2019s the principle.\u201d Richard was right behind me, peering over my shoulder. He smelled like all vamps do, it\u2019s a yummy scent that mere mortals can\u2019t even pick up. But Richard also had a nice sandalwood kind of thing going on and a male musk that was having an unfortunate effect on my sex-starved libido.</p><p>I swore off men after my on-again, off-again maker and mate, Jeremy Blade aka Angus Jeremiah Campbell III, and I faced death at stake-point together on Halloween. I\u2019d expected a little post-action celebration, one-on-one. Instead, Jerry played hero to his best friend\u2019s widow, who\u2019s thin and beautiful, and, well, thin. You get the idea. Okay, so I\u2019d only been celibate a little over a week, but vamps are sensual creatures. Sometimes that\u2019s a blessing, sometimes a curse. So I was noticing Mainwaring\u2019s male attributes. For a former priest, he was surprisingly built. Though I \u2019d heard he\u2019d been a crusader back in the day.</p><p>\u201cCrusader then galley slave.\u201d His open vest brushed my back. \u201cAnd I gave up celibacy a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>His breath stirred my hair, which should have been washed two days ago. I inhaled and licked my lips. I \u2019m really not good at celibacy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turned to face him. Diversion time. \u201cYeah? Bet that\u2019s an interesting story. How\u2019d you escape? I\u2019ve heard most galley slaves die at their oar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story. And don\u2019t change the subject.\u201d He stared at the bike for a moment, shook his head, then reached down to pick up his saddle bags.</p><p>Gee. He may have given up celibacy, but he wasn \u2019t exactly falling under my spell, either. Well, what did I expect? His last girlfriend had been my roommate, Florence da Vinci, ancient vampire and certified sex goddess. Of course Flo isn\u2019t her real name, she\u2019s paying homage to her favorite Italian city and one of her former lovers. Flo is a love \u2019em and leave \u2019em kind of gal. How could I compete with a woman who\u2019d talked Leonardo into painting her into the Last Supper at you know who\u2019s right hand?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an appointment. We\u2019ll discuss the Harley later.\u201d With a glance at Valdez, Richard strode off into the night.</p><p>\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t much help.\u201d I fussed at Valdez while I grabbed the grocery sacks out of the car. Most of the stuff was for the dog anyway. I order the Fangtastic online. It\u2019s not exactly a beverage you find at your local mini-mart.</p><p>\u201cThe guy was pissed. You can\u2019t blame him.\u201d Valdez looked mournfully at the motorcycle. Even in dog form, he is such a guy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t try to knock you on your ass. If he\u2019d raised his hand, then I\u2019d have made my move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour move. Yeah, right.\u201d I was being bitchy. Valdez did have some pretty scary moves, which he\u2019s saved me with more than once. But Mainwaring dripped power like my old car did oil. I locked the car and headed for the back entrance to the building, stopping when my head screamed again.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana. Come to me.\u201d A husky whisper made me drop my groceries and grab my head. Who or what was this?</p><p>Valdez growled and looked around. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on. Your head is killing you. Because someone or something is trying to send you a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. This guy\u2019s one bad actor, trying to get you to go somewhere. I\u2019d like a piece of him.\u201d Valdez growled again and paced in a circle around me.</p><p>I held onto my head, queasy with pain. Obviously my dog reads my mind too. I \u2019m used to it. I\u2019m also used to letting him take care of me. Like now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a cell phone?\u201d This didn\u2019t make sense. Blade sent me mental messages all the time and it didn\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, come here.\u201d Same damned compelling voice. I fought the urge to follow it.</p><p>\u201cI tell you. It ain\u2019t Blade.\u201d Valdez growled, deep and dangerous enough to give me goose bumps. \u201cCut it out, whoever you are. Gloriana\u2019s goin\u2019 nowhere and you don\u2019t want to mess with me.\u201d Valdez backed up until his tail brushed my legs. \u201cSuck it up, Blondie. Punch in the code. I figure you\u2019ll be okay once we get inside.\u201d</p><p>I managed to grab my bags and deal with the code. Believe me, vamps only live where there\u2019s great security. We both scooted inside. As soon as the steel door slammed shut, I did feel better.</p><p>\u201cYou okay now? \u201d Valdez nudged me.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was weird though.\u201d I trudged up the stairs. You get that Valdez isn\u2019t really a dog, don\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201cCareful, you\u2019re smashing my Twinkies.\u201d Valdez is into junk food and the occasional steak. I get him what he wants since I know he\u2019d lay down his life for me. Previous Valdezes have. And isn\u2019t that hellacious?</p><p>Not my idea, of course. But when Blade and I parted company the first time, centuries ago, he\u2019d insisted I needed a bodyguard. Jerry made me, so I give him a certain amount of respect. Respect, not obedience. I do have my pride. But I caved. Of course I sure wasn\u2019t going to be saddled with a male guard, even a cute one. That would \u2019ve cramped my style, big time. And, trust me, Jerry wasn\u2019t going to send in a hunk of the month to be with me twenty-four seven. Remember my celibacy issues?</p><p>So we\u2019d settled on guard dogs, always named Valdez for some reason. Recent ones have been shape -shifters, though Jerry forbids the guards to be anything but dogs around me. Think Jerry\u2019s jealous? Works for me. Anyway, he\u2019s got some kind of hold over the guys, this Valdez for sure. I don\u2019t know what kind of debt the V-man owes, but it\u2019s made for some really fierce and loyal protection.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. You think Mainwaring was doing that to me? Giving me a headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s one tough dude and neither one of us needs to be making him mad. But you had that headache before we hit the Harley. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d I threw up a block so Valdez couldn\u2019t read my mind. I remembered a night when Mainwaring showed me his scary side right here on the stairs to my apartment. The worst part? He\u2019d wiped Valdez\u2019s memory. Poor pup didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been whammied into sitting meekly at the bottom of the stairs while I\u2019d fought off the Mainwaring mojo all by my lonesome. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t Mainwaring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMainwaring? You\u2019ve seen Ricardo?\u201d Florence met us at the door and took one of the bags from me. \u201cNot that I care. I\u2019m through with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because he parks like he lives here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this apartment.\u201d Flo pulled out nail polish remover and a sack of cotton balls. \u201cI hate mysterious men. He keeps secrets. Pah! I have a secret for him. He\u2019s the worst lover I ever had.\u201d Flo\u2019s cheeks were pink, which meant she was really agitated. Vamps don\u2019t have enough blood to flush unless they\u2019ve just fed. I saw three empty Fangtastic bottles on the table. Okay, so Flo had been hitting the red stuff pretty hard.</p><p>I can never read Flo\u2019s mind, though I sure as heck try. She reads mine, of course. Everyone does. Unless I block them. Unfortunately, blocking brings on another kind of headache. But I knew Flo was lying anyway. I mean, even Sex and the City reruns turned up full blast hadn\u2019t completely drowned out her shrieks of ecstasy when she\u2019d been doing the wild thing with Richard. And, trust me, Flo doesn\u2019t fake it for anyone.</p><p>I let it go. She needed to vent. Neither of us had a decent boyfriend at the moment. And we live forever. Not a situation conducive to self-denial of any kind.</p><p>It was almost dawn and I felt it. All day I\u2019d be dead to the world, literally. I threw on a comfy nightgown, glad to be safe inside, no weird voice in my head. I let Valdez into the bedroom and he hopped on the foot of my queen -sized bed. You didn\u2019t think I slept in a coffin, did you? That would be so clich\u00e9.</p><p>Two</p><p>Whump, whump, whump, whump.</p><p>\u201cPlease remain calm. The fire is out. The fire is out. Firemen are on their way and are clearing the smoke out of the building.\u201d</p><p>I was wet, cold and lying on concrete. My baby dolls were tangled around my hips and Valdez was barking into my ear.</p><p>\u201cFire?\u201d I took a breath. Smoke. Oh, shit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, fire. I dragged you up here.\u201d Valdez bumped me with his cold nose. \u201cBut you\u2019re okay now, Blondie. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d I swallowed and sat up. A helicopter sporting the logo of a local TV station hovered overhead. Nice. My chubby thighs would be on the evening news.</p><p>\u201cYou dragged me up here? Flo! Diana!\u201d I jumped up and looked around. I may sleep like the dead, but once the sun goes down, I\u2019m operating on all cylinders. I saw the other resident vamps\u2014Flo, Diana and a guy I knew lived on the third floor\u2014laid out on the roof. They were all wet and all in various stages of stirring. The sun had obviously just slipped below the horizon.</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019d say our old buddy Brent Westwood decided to take a parting shot.\u201d Valdez growled and leaned against my leg.</p><p>\u201cSomebody threw a firebomb into your shop and the fire spread from there. Whoever did it had a hell of a nerve pulling that in broad daylight. Of course it\u2019s Monday and the shop was closed. Mugs and Muffins was probably open though. I wonder\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Valdez. I . . . My God!\u201d My legs folded and I sat hard on the concrete again. Just about anything, from a wooden skewer to a chopstick could take a vamp out while she\u2019s sleeping. And a fire . . . No amount of healing sleep could bring a vamp back from being a crispy critter. I rubbed my dog\u2019s ears. He\u2019d saved me.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this was Westwood?\u201d We\u2019d been fighting off the big-game hunter, who thought vamps were the biggest game of all, ever since I\u2019d arrived in Austin. After a recent showdown, we all figured he\u2019d move on to easier prey. Parting shot.</p><p>\u201cWho else? People love your shop. Only an asshole like Westwood\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whump. Whump. Whump. Whump. \u201cMedical assistance is on its way. Please wave if you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Smile for the camera, you mean.\u201d I picked up my sodden sheet and threw it over my head.</p><p>\u201cHow are the others?\u201d I pushed to my feet again and wobbled over to Flo like Casper the not-so-friendly ghost, Valdez at my heels. Of course my roommate would sleep in the raw. Valdez had draped a wet sheet over her but the rotors were blowing everything on the roof all to hell. Flo sat up, giving the camera a nice shot of her boobs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on camera, Flo. You might want to wrap your sheet a little tighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d She pushed back her dark hair and looked around, then up. \u201cThey\u2019d better not be taking my picture. I need my hair dryer, my makeup.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully, they didn\u2019t have audio. I could hear the lead-in now. \u201cFire victim runs for blow dryer as rescuers battle blaze.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Valdez. \u201cMy shop?\u201d My voice cracked. I\u2019d built Vintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium from nothing into a thriving business that actually supported me.</p><p>\u201cI figure it\u2019s probably gutted.\u201d Valdez sat down and scratched his ear. \u201cOf course I was pretty busy. When the smoke alarms went off, I had to clear you guys out. And the stairwell was solid smoke.\u201d He coughed, sneezed, then looked at me for sympathy.</p><p>\u201cMy hero!\u201d I dropped to my knees and threw my arms around his neck. I sniffed wet fur, a mix of dog and smoke. Valdez coughed again and I looked at him, really looked at him. \u201cSeriously. Are you all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Cough, cough.</p><p>Okay, now he was faking it.

So I had to pile you guys up inside the stairwell with the door open for ventilation until the sun went down. I had a hell of a time keeping all of you from frying. \u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrying. Oh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are alive, no?\u201d Flo sat down and put her arm around me.

You know they\u2019re going to want an interview. \u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Right. Talking dog saves sleeping vampires. Sorry, but you\u2019ll have to settle for a bag of Cheetos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d</p> <p>I gave him a final ear rub, then walked over to check on Diana. She ran the coffee shop downstairs. If my shop was toast, so was hers.</p><p>\u201cDi, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She coughed and sat up. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She wore cute red plaid flannel jammies and her sheet, wet of course, coordinated in navy blue.</p><p>\u201cFire. Someone firebombed my shop, probably yours too if Westwood did it.\u201d I reached out and pulled her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She glanced up, then shot the finger at the helicopter. \u201cBuzz off, vultures.\u201d She headed for the door to the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ve got to check on the shop.\u201d Mugs and Muffins. Like me, Diana has to support herself. If her shop had been hit too . . . Well, this was really, really bad. For both of us.</p><p>I grabbed her before she could open the door. \u201cWait. The firemen are working their way up here. The building\u2019s full of smoke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy shoes!\u201d Flo was on her feet, her sheet wrapped into a strapless sheath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the fire got that far. The building\u2019s security system went off as soon as I heard something crash through Blondie\u2019s shop window. The fire trucks got here pretty quick after that.\u201d Valdez spent my sleeping hours on hyper alert. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cI say, how did we get wet?\u201d The third floor vampire had joined us. He was a sight in an old -fashioned nightshirt but good looking in a college professor kind of way. His British accent was cute. We \u2019d met him at some vamp meetings. Dennis, David, something like that.</p><p>\u201cSprinkler system in the halls. You got wet when I dragged you out of bed and up the stairs to the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my door was locked. Double dead bolts.\u201d The prof stared at Valdez.</p><p>\u201cSo I did a little damage. I couldn\u2019t just let you guys go up in smoke.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a lump the size of Valdez\u2019s food bowl.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant! You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d The male vamp had obviously just found his new best friend.</p> <p>\u201cI saved all the vamps in the building.\u201d Valdez was visibly preening, and why not? \u201cIt\u2019s my thing. You\u2019d think some of those shifters would have been around, but no such luck. So I handled it.\u201d</p><p>Shifters. Shape-shifters, that is, live in a couple of the apartments. A werecat, my friend and employee, lives right across the hall. I took a shaky breath and felt sick again. This time I couldn\u2019t blame it on Cheetos or an evil mind-meld. If Valdez hadn\u2019t been who or what he was . . .</p><p>The stair door slammed open and three firemen dressed in full, bright yellow gear appeared on the roof. The first one threw off his helmet and ran his hand through his short brown hair.</p><p>\u201cAnybody hurt? You folks okay?\u201d</p><p>We stayed huddled together, looking appropriately shocked and disoriented.</p><p>\u201cThe fire. It didn\u2019t spread to the apartments, did it?\u201d If I had lost everything I owned . . . I\u2019ve had to start over before, but it\u2019s hard, really hard.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Sprinkler and alarm systems saved the day.\u201d The fireman sounded pure Texan. \u201cYou got good response time too. The fire itself didn\u2019t have a chance to spread upstairs. Just the smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sprinklers didn\u2019t go off in the apartments, did they?\u201d Flo was suddenly right beside the fireman and grabbed his arm. \u201cI have a most valuable collection that will be ruined if it gets wet.\u201d</p><p>Flo\u2019s collection of Ferragamos, Pradas, Manolos, et al. The fireman looked down at her, obviously liked the way Flo \u2019s sheet was slipping, and patted her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Only the hallways have sprinklers. Fire\u2019s out now. Smoke\u2019s just about cleared. Do any of you folks need the paramedics?\u201d The fireman whipped out his walkie-talkie when Diana coughed.</p><p>\u201cNo! Really! I\u2019m fine. Just the night air and wet clothes.\u201d Diana managed a smile. \u201cCan we go in now? I\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>Actually we were lucky for early November in Austin. It was fairly cool, but not even close to freezing. Maybe I was being too literal. I\u2019d almost been fried. Okay? A vamp doesn\u2019t feel heat and cold like a mortal does. So I faked a shiver.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s move inside if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne minute.\u201d The fireman spoke into a walkie-talkie. \u201cLet me get the all clear.\u201d Another fireman showed up in the doorway with a stack of blankets. We each took one gratefully.</p><p>Whump. Whump. Whump. Whump. Channel whatever was getting this all on tape. Flo decided to take advantage and planted a big wet one of thanks on cute fireman\u2019s lips after he announced we were good to go. Then we all hustled into the stairwell and out of camera view.</p><p>\u201cWhat started the fire?\u201d I glanced at Valdez.</p><p>\u201cArson.\u201d The fireman had a grim look as he stopped at the top of the stairs. \u201cSomeone broke the windows in the stores downstairs and tossed in incendiary devices.\u201d The fireman couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Flo. She was busy rearranging her sheet again, flashing the entire crew. Probably unintentional. She was really anxious to check out that shoe collection. The fireman\u2019s walkie-talkie squawked again. \u201cHow\u2019d you folks get up here? The smoke alarm wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Who could sleep through that?\u201d Professor Vamp patted Valdez. \u201cThis fellow barked too, though. Just to be sure we knew to take it seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d The fireman, Flo attached to his side, gave Valdez an admiring glance. \u201cBut why are the doors knocked down?</p><p>And who the hell could do that? I mean, three apartments look like a battering ram . . .\u201d Flo looked up into the fireman\u2019s eyes and he was under the whammy.</p><p>As damage control, it was a Band-Aid. We\u2019d have to whammy every fireman who\u2019d seen the doors Valdez had obviously knocked down. I looked at Di and the professor and they went to work on the other firemen coming down the stairs behind us. Before we got to the bottom, the guys had no memory of anything other than knocking the doors down themselves because they were looking for victims.</p><p>We stepped outside and I got my first look at what used to be a pretty cute vintage clothing shop. Thank God for sprinkler systems. The windows were shattered, the area right in front of them totaled. It didn\u2019t look like the fire had penetrated the closed door into the back room, though. I felt wobbly as I picked my way around broken glass. Diana cried out and I saw that Mugs and Muffins had received the same treatment. If Westwood had done this . . .</p><p>\u201cFolks, you\u2019ve got to let the paramedics look you over. It\u2019s our policy.\u201d Cute fireman led Flo over to an ambulance. You can bet she wasn\u2019t letting anyone put a stethoscope to her barely beating heart. And, sure enough, the men around her smiled and nodded and let her walk back to us without a checkup. The whammy at work again.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t bother us now. Let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cThe whole building smells like smoke. My shoes had better not be ruined.\u201d</p><p>Diana looked at her with red eyes. \u201cYour shoes? Your shoes? Excuse me? Do you see my shop? Glory\u2019s shop? We\u2019re out of business!\u201d</p><p>I grabbed Diana\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. Damian\u2019s bound to have insurance.\u201d Hope. Pray. Damian Sabatini was Flo\u2019s brother and owned the building. \u201cUpstairs. Get a shower and some dry clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElectricity will be off for a while, people.\u201d Another fireman, a captain according to his helmet. \u201cHere are some flashlights. But please just gather what you need for the night and make plans to sleep elsewhere. Until the building inspector gives the go ahead to occupy the residences.\u201d</p><p>I realized we were lucky no one had asked why we all were ready for bed at what must be seven in the evening. We were a pretty strange looking group.</p><p>We heard a shout and I saw Diana grabbed by two of her employees. I caught some snatches. Slow time of day. No customers so both workers had been in the back area making up a batch of the muffins the place was famous for. At least neither of them had been hurt.</p><p>A car pulled up behind the fire engine and a man jumped out. Damian aka Casanova. He \u2019s a sexy vampire, but I\u2019m now immune. He\u2019d played some dirty tricks on me while trying to add another notch to his bed post. Did I mention he\u2019s our landlord? I was actually glad to see him and his look of concern. Please let him have insurance. I sure didn\u2019t. I know. I know. But the premiums! I looked back at the shop. Maybe I\u2019d rethink my priorities if my business survived this.</p><p>\u201cFlorence, Gloriana, are you all right?\u201d He grabbed Flo and looked her over. \u201cDiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all fine, Damian.\u201d Flo hugged him before we all turned to head upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Someone grabbed my arm. \u201cDonna Mitchell, Channel Six News. The fireman said this is your shop?\u201d A female reporter dressed in a blazer and running shoes thrust a microphone near my mouth. I started to brush her off, then glanced at the front of my shop again.</p><p>\u201cYes. This is, was my place. Vintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium, offering fine clothing and accessories from the past at bargain prices.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so I had to plug it, even if I had no idea if I even had a shop anymore. Tears filled my eyes and the camera zoomed in. Nothing like a tragedy to boost ratings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny idea what happened, Ms. . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana St. Clair.\u201d I hitched my slipping blanket up on my shoulders. My wet hair dripped into my eyes. I was damned mad and looking pitiful worked for me right now. Valdez pressed himself against my legs and looked up at me soulfully. \u201cWe all work night shifts, so my dog here helped wake us up.\u201d I patted him on the head and he showed his teeth in a doggy grin. \u201cSomeone did this on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying this was arson?\u201d The reporter was all business now, gesturing at the cameraman so he could pan to the broken and blackened windows.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I looked directly at the camera when it was aimed at me again. \u201cAnd I want to put whoever did this on notice. I</p><p>will reopen. I will not just disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, you make this sound like a hate crime. Are you, um, a minority?\u201d</p><p>Blond, blue-eyed white girl a minority? I smiled and read the reporter \u2019s mind. Hmm. I could set her straight, ha-ha, but why bother?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman, trying to support myself. Some people\u201d\u2014 maybe I was digging a hole here\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t like independence or people who are different.\u201d</p> <p>The reporter thrust the microphone at Flo who had somehow managed to pull her hair back into a chic ponytail, her sheet now a toga that Julius Caesar himself had probably taught her how to wrap.</p><p>\u201cAre you Ms. St. Clair\u2019s partner?\u201d</p><p>Flo grinned, obviously reading the reporter\u2019s mind too.</p><p>\u201cGlory and I haven\u2019t been together long\u201d\u2014she linked her arm through mine\u2014\u201cand the business is all hers. Me, I\u2019m into new. I have a wonderful shoe collection, spared by the fire, thank God. I just hope Glory\u2019s business survives this.\u201d Flo actually kissed my cheek and I swear I jumped a foot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Glory. Let me tell Donna about my shoes.\u201d Flo began rattling off designer names until the reporter\u2019s eyes glazed and she signaled the cameraman to cut.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have enough. Excuse me, I see an arson investigator has arrived. Good luck with your business, Ms. St. Clair. Here\u2019s my card. If you need to contact me for a follow-up.\u201d</p><p>Follow-up. I took one more long look at my shop, shook my head then went inside the apartment building. The halls were wet and the smell of smoke made my nose run and my eyes sting. I climbed the stairs, then stepped over the door Valdez had knocked down to get me out. The frame was broken, the locks shattered. I felt him beside me.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a hero, Valdez.\u201d I dropped to my knees and buried my face in his damp fur. Oh, great. Now I cried. I held onto him and felt Flo patting my back. I know blood -sucking vampires are supposed to be tough, but we\u2019re still human, sort of. We have feelings. I swear sometimes I think if I didn\u2019t have bad luck I\u2019d have no luck at all. Three</p><p>\"Gloriana, sweetheart. Och now, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>I was gently lifted off of Valdez and wrapped in strong masculine arms. Definitely an improvement over smoke -tinged dog fur. And don\u2019t you love the Scottish thing? I\u2019ve always had a weakness for it.</p><p>\u201cBlade.\u201d I sagged against him, for once glad of his need to take care of me. When I \u2019d first met Jeremiah Campbell, I was attracted to his take-charge attitude. Hey, it was 1604. That\u2019s what men did back then. I closed my eyes and inhaled. Jerry smelled of male and midnight. One whiff and I was right back at the Globe and the early days of hot sex and his promise of \u201cI\u2019ll be here for you forever.\u201d It was all I could do not to wrap my legs around his waist and beg him to take me. I got a grip. Barely. We\u2019re friends now, sometimes lovers, but I couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t just relapse into a quivering mass of female insecurities around him.</p><p>\u201cDid you see my shop?\u201d I looked up and saw his teeth clench.</p><p>\u201cWhat was left of it.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cDamn Westwood. I\u2019ll find him and rip his throat out. Tear him apart. There won\u2019t be enough left of him to interest carrion. He\u2019ll pay for this, Gloriana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if he didn\u2019t do it?\u201d I wiped at my eyes, then leaned against his hard chest for a moment longer.</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve had headaches. And a voice in my head. Menacing.\u201d I looked up at Blade who was glaring at Valdez. Obviously the dog hadn\u2019t mentioned this in his reports. Yeah, he\u2019s Jerry\u2019s furry spy.</p><p>\u201cA voice? What the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. Had to be Westwood. The voice has to be another vampire\u2014\u201d I heard Jerry\u2019s chest rumble. Had he growled?</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jerry. A vampire wouldn\u2019t burn up another one. Plus it was daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith enough hatred, some would hire it done.\u201d Jerry put me from him. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you with such an enemy, but tell me more.\u201d</p><p>I sank down on the couch. \u201cNot now. I\u2019ve had a rough night. And quit giving Valdez the evil eye. If it hadn\u2019t been for this dog\u2014</p><p>\u201d My voice broke. Burned in my sleep. The end. No encores. Hey, I\u2019d decided to be immortal, I damned well intended to keep on keeping on.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I really earned my Twinkies today. Dragging four vampires all the way to the roof, up lots of stairs. And I had to knock down doors with double dead bolts.\u201d Valdez paused for a weary breath. Oh, yeah, he was pouring on the drama.</p><p>\u201cExcept for Florence, none of them was exactly a lightweight if you know what I mean.\u201d Valdez bumped my leg with his nose. \u201cSomeone promised to buy me Cheetos.\u201d</p><p>Jerry pulled me up to hug me again, before he settled me back on the couch. \u201cValdez, you\u2019ve gone a long way toward earning your freedom. But if you ever withhold information again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, boss. I was gonna tell you if somebody actually made a move on Glory. Hey, it was just a voice. I never saw</p><p>anybody.\u201d Valdez laid his head on my knee. \u201cGlory knows I\u2019ve got her back.\u201d</p><p>Jerry frowned, then turned to pick up the door and lean it against the wall. I watched his muscles bulge under his black sweater. Black sweater, dark jeans, black loafers. With his dark eyes and hair, Jerry had the vamp look going on. Not that a mortal would see him that way. All they\u2019d see was a handsome man in his prime. Jerry always could light my fire, and I was feeling an urge to reaffirm life if you know what I mean.</p><p>\u201cI heard the fireman tell you to evacuate.\u201d Jerry turned back to me. \u201cCome home with me, Glory. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I had my mouth open to say hell yes when Flo emerged from her bedroom. She was dressed in one of her favorite outfits. I won\u2019t describe it, just know it was cut down to there and up to here. And black. She wore red heels, her current favorites. If we were hosting a cocktail party, she was good to go. She was cradling a pair of Manolo stilettos.</p><p>\u201cMy poor babies. They have survived, but stink of smoke. So do I.\u201d She sighed and stroked the shoes. \u201cI am devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come home with me, Florence. I have a steam shower that will set you to rights. S\u00ec?\u201d Damian lounged in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou can come too, Gloriana. I\u2019ve offered all the residents of the building rooms.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cOf course it will be a little crowded, cara. Some of us may have to double up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Sabatini. Gloriana\u2019s coming home with me.\u201d Blade slung his arm around my shoulders. \u201cAren\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>How nice. I was still dripping and stinky, but two hunky vamps were fighting over me. Well, maybe not actually fighting. And Jerry had asked instead of ordered. He knew Damian had been pursuing me. Jerry was jealous. Excellent. I threw up a block so Jerry wouldn\u2019t be able to tell just how not tempted I was by the Italian stud\u2019s offer.</p><p>\u201cJerry\u2019s right, Damian. I\u2019m going home with him. But thanks for the offer.\u201d I glanced at Flo, very aware of my wet jammies, wet sheet, wet blanket . . . you get the picture.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Damian. Jeremiah will take care of her. \u201d Flo grabbed her brother\u2019s hand and dragged him toward her bedroom. \u201cCome help me. I\u2019ve three suitcases and my shoes, of course, that you must carry downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hire a restoration company. They\u2019ll come in here. Get rid of the stink. Even clean your clothes. \u201d Damian had a hunted look when Flo started filling his hands with shoe boxes. \u201cYou two should be able to move back in a day or two, a week at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo company will touch my shoes, Damian.\u201d Flo eyed Jerry. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d take down a load for me, Jeremiah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s helping me, Flo. Make two,\u201d\u2014I watched the tower of shoe boxes Damian was balancing wobble\u2014\u201cor six trips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Flo is always practical, and she liked seeing me with Jerry. She\u2019s convinced we\u2019re probably fated to be together, since we\u2019ve kept our relationship going on and off for centuries. When Flo\u2019s through with a lover, they might as well be dead. She never looks back. I\u2019ve looked back way too often.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll ask those cute firemen to help me. This is an emergency.\u201d Flo picked up a velvet sack with her most expensive ostrich pumps. \u201cCome on, Damian. You\u2019d better have brought one of your big cars.\u201d</p><p>Damian muttered something vile under his breath as he stalked into the hall. There was a crash, then a slap and Flo shouted Italian insults. I managed a laugh, even though I was more than a little depressed by the smell and the thought of having to pack. I stood and stretched.</p><p>\u201cLet me grab some stuff and get dressed and I\u2019ll be ready in a minute.\u201d I patted Valdez on the head. \u201cJerry, would you help out by grabbing some of this pup\u2019s treats from the kitchen? He\u2019ll tell you what to bring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure will.\u201d Valdez trotted toward the kitchen. \u201cThe Twinkies are in the cabinet next to the refrigerator. Glory probably wants some of that bottled stuff she drinks too. And the lights are out. There\u2019s a rib eye in the freezer that will ruin if I don\u2019t eat it soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne moment.\u201d Jerry reached out and pulled me back into his arms. He looked at me for a long moment. Probing my mind? Or my heart? \u201cAre you really all right? I almost lost you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. Nobody can do intense like Blade. I reached up and stroked his cheek, rough because he hadn\u2019t shaved. In fact, Valdez\u2019s report that we were on the roof had probably sent Jerry straight from his bed to my side.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost me, Jeremiah. And you won\u2019t.\u201d I pulled his head down and kissed him. Not a little peck either. I was already in life-affirming mode. When I leaned back I glanced at the doorway. Damian was back for another load. He grinned and winked. The man thinks the world revolves around him. I\u2019m sure he interpreted that kiss as an attempt to make him jealous. I smiled back. Whatever.</p> <p>\u201cDamian, this smell disgusts me. Hurry.\u201d Flo pushed him across the room. \u201cGlory, I take the Sex and the City DVDs with me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. TV was the last thing on my mind right now.</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to watch your girlie TV shows?\u201d Damian came out loaded like a pack mule. \u201cI\u2019ll pay the company double. You\u2019ll be back here by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Flo sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. And, caro, you could learn a lot about women from that show.\u201d She patted his cheek.</p><p>\u201cPah! I know all I need to.\u201d He gave me a smoldering look. \u201cI\u2019ve had no complaints.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to your face anyway, little brother.\u201d Flo smiled as two burly firemen appeared in the hall doorway. In minutes she had everything loaded and shouted \u201cCiao,\u201d on her way out the door.</p><p>I headed into the bedroom. Boy, did I need a shower. I reeked. To hell with it. The building looked safe enough to me. Sure, with the electricity out, it was dark, but with vamp vision, that was no problem for me. I hit the bathroom, shut the door and stripped down. Shampoo, that stupid generic cream rinse that left my hair limp and about ten minutes under hot spray had me feeling a thousand times better. No hair dryer, but I combed out the tangles and pulled my hair back. Of course the clothes I had to put on smelled bad, but I didn\u2019t plan to keep them on long. When I got back to Jerry\u2019s place I was going to thank him very personally for a place to stay and for making Valdez watch over me. I stared at my rumpled bed. The fire hadn\u2019t made it upstairs, but it could have. And I would have . . . The bed blurred and I grabbed a tissue. Damn it, even it stunk like smoke. I threw some things into a suitcase and opened the door to the living room. Blade was there talking to a fireman who obviously was anxious for us to vacate the premises.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving. Right now.\u201d Jerry smiled at me. \u201cYou look wonderful, dearling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to know where to reach you. The arson crew\u2019s down there right now. This fire was no accident. An investigator\u2019s going to want to question you.\u201d The fireman glanced at the door leaning against the wall. \u201cAs soon as we get a structural report, we can let you know when it\u2019s safe to return here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Fine.\u201d I grabbed a magazine, tore off the cover and scribbled my cell phone number on it. \u201cYou can reach me here.\u201d I thought about shouting accusations along with the name of suspect number one. Brent Westwood couldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with this. But Jerry squeezed my hand. He had his own plans for Westwood.</p><p>If the billionaire was responsible, the fire was just the latest in the hunter \u2019s attacks on vampires. The man had almost killed me more than once, and he wore a necklace made of fangs. I shuddered, remembering. Two of those fangs had belonged to Jerry \u2019s best friend.</p> <p>Valdez woofed and headed for the door, obviously ready to get out of here. Me too. I held on to Jerry \u2019s hand and looked around. My home. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever feel the same way about it again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re outta here.\u201d</p><p>\"Come here, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the lid on the washer and turned the knob. At least I\u2019d have clean clothes tomorrow. I smiled at Blade who\u2019d been beyond patient as he waited for me to cook Valdez\u2019s steak, rare of course. Then throw my first load into the dryer.</p><p>\u201cIs that an order?\u201d I moved up close and put my hands on his sweater, dark, like his eyes. His hair was wild, like he \u2019d run his hands through it. I reached up to tweak it into place, almost holding my breath while I waited for his answer. This was old territory with us. He ordered, I didn\u2019t obey. Splitsville.</p><p>\u201cNay. I may have been slow with ye, Glory, but I finally understand that ye dunna take orders well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you also understand that I melt for the whole Scottish Highlander thing.\u201d I grinned and slipped my hand under his sweater. Firm stomach, warm, not cold like people think vampires should be. We have a little heat, though not the same as mortals.</p><p>\u201cAre ye? Melting?\u201d He pushed his own hand into the back of my hair and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d I stretched up to kiss his smiling mouth. \u201cTake me to bed, ye lusty Scot. I have a need for\u2014\u201d He kissed me silent, then swung me into his arms. He strode past Valdez who was sacked out on the living room couch, his paw on the remote control as he searched for porn. Have I mentioned that the dog is such a . . . guy?</p><p>\u201cHey, look. We\u2019re on the ten o\u2019clock news.\u201d</p><p>Jerry stopped behind the couch. \u201cYou were on the roof.\u201d</p><p>I felt his arms around me. Good, at least he wasn\u2019t dumping me on my ass. Gloriana with a sheet over her head was not a pretty sight.</p><p>\u201cMust be a slow news day.\u201d The reporter\u2019s voice described the scene, but the billowing smoke told the tale. Then we were in front of my shop. The interview. Valdez was by my side looking like a regular dog, a black Labradoodle with a cute face and wagging tail. Amazing that he looked so ordinary. Especially since he\u2019d spent the afternoon dragging vampires up flights of stairs to safety.</p><p>The camera panned to my burned-out shop and I swallowed. Would I be able to rebuild? I\u2019d sunk everything I owned into that shop. I\u2019d never let Jerry take care of me, though he\u2019d offered often enough. I could always waitress again. I\u2019d gotten good tips, especially if I showed some cleavage. Forget cleavage. On TV I looked like hell. Wet hair hanging, raccoon eyes because I\u2019d fallen asleep with my makeup on. A bad habit, but my skin will always be twenty -four years old. Don\u2019t you hate me? I don\u2019t even use moisturizer.</p><p>On TV Flo was clinging to me like plastic wrap and all of Austin now thought we were a couple. Though why a hottie like Flo would hook up with a woman who looked four feet wide in her fireman blanket\u2014</p><p>\u201cI think you and Florence make a cute couple.\u201d Jerry dropped a kiss on my head. I socked him in the arm. \u201cHow about some sympathy here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have that.\u201d A softer kiss this time, close to my ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your business, Gloriana. If you want to rebuild, I\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Help. As in labor? Knowing Jerry, it was help as in throwing money at the situation. Unless he was needed for swordplay, that was his best move. He could afford it. But could I afford the complications?</p><p>\u201cThanks. Let me see what the damage is first. And if Damian had any insurance.\u201d</p><p>Valdez was doing his thing with the remote again. Forget Valdez. Jerry carried me up the stairs. To his bedroom. I admit I \u2019ve spent a few nights there. He has a really nice home that he rents from Damian, who is a real estate tycoon. Renting. Like maybe he wouldn\u2019t stay in Austin. Jerry had moved here from Shreveport to be near me. But he didn\u2019t have any other reason to stay. I had to quit thinking. No problem. Especially when he dropped me on his king-sized bed. He stripped off his sweater, grinning when I tossed my own across the room. I hadn\u2019t bothered with a bra. They were all in the wash. Jerry fell on top of me. I laughed and pretended he\u2019d knocked the wind out of me. Fat chance. With my vamp strength I could toss him across the room. He obviously read my mind because he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOnly if I were unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on. Let me try.\u201d I pushed at him. No go. His face got serious just before he kissed me. He was obviously in life - affirming mode too. When we came up for air, I ran my hands through his thick hair.</p><p>\u201cWe probably should shut the door.\u201d</p><p>Blade didn\u2019t answer, just nuzzled my breast. The door slammed shut and the lock clicked. Got to love vamp powers. Not that I was really paying that much attention. Not with Blade\u2019s mouth on my nipple.</p><p>I held on to his hair and just relaxed into the moment. I saw his jeans off of him and they hit the floor. I can make things move with my mind. Pretty cool. I concentrated and my skirt and panties landed next to Jerry \u2019s jeans. Now we were skin to skin, my favorite way to be with Jerry. He chuckled and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI love your new tricks, lass. Mayhap you\u2019d like to see one of mine.\u201d He reached down to stroke my hip. A new trick? We\u2019d had some amazing sex over the centuries. On mountaintops, in caves, not to mention that tricky time on horseback. I smiled and ran my hands over his firm buttocks.</p><p>\u201cOnly if it involves you screwing me until I go blind.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>\"Definitely.\u201d Jerry\u2019s chuckle rippled through me. God, everything he did was sexy.</p><p>\u201cThen go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, close your eyes.\u201d Jerry rolled over until I was on top of him. \u201cNo peeking. Not until I tell you to.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked. Four hundred years. You\u2019d think that sex would get boring. And the same old same old might. But with a vampire, there was always a little something extra. Vampire men are like that bunny in the commercial \u2014they keep going and going . . . Boy, could I tell you stories. And then there\u2019s the mind reading. Try drawing a mental map for your lover of hot spots that need attention. I took a deep breath. What did I smell? Lilacs? I love lilacs. I kept my eyes closed even though I could tell I was no longer on Blade\u2019s pillow-top mattress. I was warm, floating, but not in water. Then I settled onto something hard and slightly scratchy. What?</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>I did and gasped. We were in an English garden. One very like the one my mother had tended behind our house when I\u2019d been a child. Lilacs were in bloom, bees buzzed and I lay on a blanket under the tree that had been next to the pond. And the sun. The sun was shining, warming my naked body. I looked at Jerry, at the way the light hit his broad chest and the proof that he still wanted me. I leaned on one elbow, striking a pose that pushed out my breasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about how. Just relax and enjoy.\u201d Jerry picked up a ripe strawberry and brought it to my lips. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled and almost cried again. The delicious smell . . . \u201cI . . . I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you can. This isn\u2019t real, Gloriana. We\u2019re living a fantasy. One of yours, I hope.\u201d Jerry grinned and pushed the strawberry into my mouth. \u201cBite. Remember the sweetness. Taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d I admit I\u2019m a little food obsessed. Remember the Cheetos debacle? The berry burst in my mouth. Too divine. I chewed, but hesitated. Okay, I took a chance and swallowed. \u201cWill this hurt me? You know when I ate those Cheetos . . .\u201d I sucked in my tummy. Damned stupid Cheetos bulge.</p><p>\u201cWould I do that to you?\u201d He smiled and laid his hand on my tummy. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to hold this in. I think you\u2019re perfect just as you are.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand over his. Perfect? Of course. This was my fantasy after all. And I\u2019d just had a strawberry.</p><p>\u201cMmmm. Have I told you you\u2019re a genius?\u201d I reached for another berry. He\u2019d conjured up a whole bowl of them. God, how I\u2019d missed this. Food. That\u2019s why I\u2019d made a fool of myself over Cheetos. I had to learn how to do this trick.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you how. Someday.\u201d Jerry picked up a pastry. \u201cSmell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. Lemon tart?\u201d I dipped a finger into the filling. This felt so real. And when I licked my finger clean, my tastebuds were in full party mode. I sighed with pleasure. \u201cYou did this for me?\u201d I scooped up another finger full and wrote a \u201cG\u201d on his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing. How can I ever repay you?\u201d I leaned forward, my tongue tracing a path down his stomach. Mmm. Blade and lemon. Delicious. I reached for another tart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a pretty good job of it.\u201d He gasped when I scooped up more lemon and dropped a dollop of it on his jutting penis. \u201cOf course if you\u2019d like to lick that off . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d I slid down his body. He lay back and groaned when I took him in my mouth. I stroked him, inhaled him and made him arch off the blanket when I swept my tongue around his hot length. Mmm, those vamp powers. I didn\u2019t have to look at a clock to know he could stay hard and ready for me for hours. And he\u2019d have to, because it was definitely my turn. I sat up and tossed my hair behind my back. Jerry\u2019s eyes had actually rolled back in his head and a fine sheen of sweat glistened on his pecs when he clinched his fists. Birds still sang, bees still buzzed, but my heart seemed to stop as I looked down at him.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Jerry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Barely.\u201d He opened his eyes as he leaned up to slide his tongue across one of my nipples. Then his fangs, deliciously sharp and dangerous, traced a path over my breasts.</p><p>I reached for another strawberry. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, lass. I hunger for something much sweeter. But go ahead. I like seeing your pleasure. \u201d He held onto my breast and watched me.</p><p>Sex with a handsome man? Or strawberries? Okay, so I\u2019m one sick puppy. But for a moment the fruit won. I bit into a berry and the sweetness filled my mouth again. The thrill was almost enough to make me forget Jerry \u2019s fingers toying with my nipples. Almost. But I ate another, then rubbed a third across Jerry\u2019s smiling lips and kissed him. So delicious. I sat up and ate the last of the strawberries.</p><p>Sue me, but I\u2019m full-figured for a reason. I always loved my food. And after I married unwisely, we\u2019d struggled on an actor\u2019s pay. Treats like strawberries had been unheard of. Then I\u2019d been widowed. I\u2019d been hungry, a lot. Only Billy Shakespeare\u2019s kindness in letting me play an occasional part and repair costumes, had kept me from starving. Jerry\u2019s hands gripped my ass before his fingers drifted between my thighs, finding me ready and then some.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ne\u2019er forget the night I met you.\u201d Jerry smiled and touched me until I gasped. \u201cI knew you were no man on that stage.\u201d</p><p>I explored his firm chest. \u201cAre you saying I was a poor actor? \u201d I lightly pinched one of his nipples. I\u2019d been a woman pretending to be a man playing a woman. Billy Shakespeare always had loved that type of game.</p><p>\u201cNever that. You had the audience convinced. But then I\u2019m no ordinary man, you see.\u201d He slipped two fingers inside me and I swear my eyes crossed.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do see, sort of.\u201d I put my hand around his cock. \u201cNot ordinary at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won me twenty guineas that night.\u201d He grinned, stroking me just the way I liked. I returned the favor, moving my hand in a rhythm that had him pushing into my hand.</p><p>\u201cSo glad I could help.\u201d I sent him a mental message. Harder. Deeper. I moaned when he slid his fingers even farther inside me.</p><p>\u201cYou were bold that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and I got my face slapped for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should have.\u201d Blade had come backstage and, before I\u2019d known what he was about, he\u2019d thrust his hand down my bodice and up my skirt.</p><p>\u201cYou held back, lass. I know a love tap when I feel one.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his cheek, rough with evening beard. \u201cMayhap I like bold. And you did offer to buy me a late supper. I was a greedy wench.\u201d Still am, truth be told. I leaned into his open-mouthed kiss, greedy for him. I\u2019d been easy for him too since the moment I\u2019d seen him. He\u2019d fed all my hungers, wining and dining me until I was stuffed like a Christmas goose. I hadn\u2019t known he was vampire at first. When he\u2019d finally taken me, I\u2019d been so hot for him, he could have bit off my left tit and I would have begged for him to take the other one. As it was, I found the blood drinking incredibly erotic. Feeding him, feeling the pull from my neck to my womb. My body clenched, remembering.</p><p>Little wonder I\u2019d finally begged him to make me vampire. So we could live together forever. Forever is a long, long time. Jerry pulled me up his body until I sat astride his clever mouth. Oh, God. I leaned back, turning my face to the sun. When he stroked me with his tongue, I shuddered and made those stupid little sounds I make when I\u2019m close to coming. He held me to him. I bucked when his tongue darted inside and his fangs touched me. Then he sucked. Oh, sweet Lord. I held back when I wanted to bounce on him like a pogo stick.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll crush you.\u201d I felt him smile against me. He lifted me slightly, just to prove he could, I guess.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a feather, lass.\u201d</p><p>A feather? Don\u2019t I wish. You\u2019d think a vamp\u2019s liquid diet would make you thin. No such luck. I\u2019d been supersized when he\u2019d turned me. I\u2019d be supersized forever.</p><p>\u201cQuit thinking, Gloriana.\u201d Of course he\u2019d read my mind. My insecurities. He looked up, his eyes twinkling. \u201cAnd if you crush me, lass, know that any man would be happy to die with his face buried in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremiah!\u201d</p><p>Jerry grinned, then slid me down until I felt his erection between my thighs.</p><p>I quivered and opened my legs. I needed him, inside me. Now.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, lass. Patience.\u201d He flipped us until I was beside him on that damned blanket.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you become a tease?\u201d My mood was deteriorating. I nudged his erection with my knee. \u201cI want you, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Arrogant Scot. \u201cFirst, tell me something you\u2019d like to taste.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at his erection. \u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>He growled and gave me a hot look. \u201cCareful, lass. You\u2019re going to undo me.\u201d He took a breath, visibly taking control of himself. \u201cI\u2019m not through with this fantasy. Food. Tell me something you never got to taste when you were mortal.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. We both knew I\u2019d tasted him back in the day. So I took about half a second to think about mortal treats. \u201cIce cream. Chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a challenge. And a mortal favorite. I\u2019ve heard a few moaning with pleasure over such a simple food. You\u2019d think they were having great sex.\u201d</p><p>Before I could blink, he had a double scoop cone of rich deep chocolate ice cream in his hand. I swear my taste buds tingled. I know my thighs did.</p><p>\u201cTaste.\u201d He held it inches from my mouth.</p><p>I inhaled, then sighed. \u201cForget it. What good would it do? Lemon? Yes. Strawberries? Of course. But chocolate ice cream? It wasn\u2019t even thought of when we were alive. You can\u2019t possibly know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can. When I saw those mortals, usually women, crying out with pleasure over the dish, I probed their minds. A man needs to know these things. What gives a woman such satisfaction.\u201d Jerry made a show of stroking his tongue over the ice cream. \u201cAhh. I think I see the appeal. \u201d</p><p>\u201cVicarious eating. Wow. Now that\u2019s something I have to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not now.\u201d Jerry shifted so that I leaned against his chest. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the cone in his hands. Chocolate ice cream melted down his fingers. \u201cCome now, lass. You know you want a taste.\u201d</p><p>I reached out with my tongue. Sweet, dark and as erotic in its own way as the man smiling at me, his eyes sparkling with pleasure. At my pleasure. I took a greedy bite, then licked his fingers clean before I tossed the cone aside to kiss him. How could I waste my time on food when I had a man ready to satisfy a much deeper hunger? A dear man who knew how to please me and, better yet, took the time to do it. I wrapped my legs around his hips and finally, finally he let me take him in. I shuddered. He fit me like no else ever did. No one.</p><p>\u201cGloriana,\u201d he whispered as he moved over me. \u201cBlind yet?\u201d</p><p>I pretended to grope for his face. \u201cNot yet. But everything\u2019s going dark.\u201d I squealed when he pulled me up until we were faceto-face, still connected. The new position shocked me into an orgasm.</p><p>\u201cI think this may be better than chocolate,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d He touched me just right to send another jolt through me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said when I caught my breath again. \u201cThis is better than chocolate, way better.\u201d I kissed him and held onto him when we moved together. So good, so good, so incredibly, unbelievably good. I closed my eyes, my world went black and I broke apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I opened my eyes again, I was back in Blade\u2019s bed. No sign of chocolate, strawberries or lemon tarts. And no sign of Blade.</p><p>\"Finally , you\u2019re awake.\u201d Valdez dropped my purse next to my head. \u201cYour damned cell phone\u2019s been ringing all day. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m expected to function as your body guard without my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhining\u2019s very unattractive, fur face.\u201d I pushed my hair out of my eyes and sat up. Oops. Not wearing anything. I held the sheet up to my chin. Valdez and I\u2019ve been together for five years now. He\u2019s probably seen more of me than he wanted to, but that didn\u2019t mean I liked to flaunt it. Dog form he may be, but I know he \u2019s also something else, something or someone who has a decidedly masculine gleam in his dark brown eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Blade?\u201d I pushed Valdez off the bed. \u201cTurn your back.\u201d When he did, I hightailed it to the bathroom and the robe I knew Jerry kept on the back of the door. It dragged the ground, but was a nice thick terry that covered me from neck to toe.</p><p>\u201cBlade\u2019s downstairs. He and Mara are having words.\u201d Valdez was back on the bed again, glaring at my purse. It was ringing, \u201cPhantom of the Opera.\u201d I love Broadway show tunes and you can imagine why Phantom is one of my faves. \u201cYou gonna answer this?\u201d</p><p>I dove for the purse and fished out the phone just as it stopped. A beep and I saw that I had missed ten calls with five voice messages. Scrolling through the system, it was easy to see that most of the calls had been from the fire department. My day employees had called too. And the vamp who filled in some nights for me had just left message number six.</p><p>\u201cBlade and Mara? What kind of words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFighting words. It\u2019s a hate-a-thon. Westwood being at the top of their list.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not fighting each other?\u201d Mara MacTavish is the widow of Blade\u2019s best friend, the one the vamp hunter had taken out. That fang necklace thing. Mara was not taking her loss well and who could blame her. She \u2019s obsessed with making Brent Westwood pay. I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is that she seems determined to use Blade, my Jeremy Blade, to do her dirty work. Okay, maybe that\u2019s not entirely true. Mara is more than capable of ripping Westwood\u2019s throat out. But the billionaire is proving to be too damned wily for even a vampire to catch.</p><p>\u201cNope. They\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>No surprise there. Blade\u2019s all for the revenge thing. If Mara weren\u2019t super sexy with the whole Scottish lass deal going for her, I would say let them have at it. But, while Jerry and I are on again, off again, that doesn \u2019t mean I like his off periods from me to be spent with beautiful women. Yeah, I\u2019m perverse. I\u2019ve always been happy to spend more than my share of off time with beautiful men when I can get them.</p><p>\u201cHello. Glory, answer the damned phone.\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019d been lost in my dismal thoughts, the phone had started up again.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlory, finally! Are you all right?\u201d Lacy Devereau, my shape-shifter day worker. She\u2019s actually a werecat. You can imagine what Valdez, \u00fcberdog, thinks of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Lacy. I\u2019m at Blade\u2019s.\u201d I settled back on the pillows. My vamp healing sleep had taken care of any residual aches and pains from being dragged to the roof. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve seen the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Big sigh. \u201cAnd I had to fight like hell to get to my apartment to pick up a few things. They \u2019re investigating the cause of the fire and are supposed to be inspecting the building, but no one will tell me when we might be able to move back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some messages from the fire department, maybe that will tell me something. \u201d I mentally checked my bank balance. How long could I afford to keep my employees on the payroll without any income coming in? Answer: two days, three tops. \u201cIn the daylight, what does the shop look like? Do you think we can salvage anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWindows blown out. Everything soaked with water and some kind of chemicals. \u201d Another big sigh. \u201cBurglar bars will keep looters out, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything they\u2019d want anyway. It looks pretty bad to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought when I saw it last night. \u201d I looked at Valdez who was obviously taking a nap. \u201cYou\u2019d better look for another job, Lacy. I hate to lose you, but I don\u2019t know when or if we\u2019ll be able to reopen.\u201d I paid my employees minimum wage plus commission. The kind of people I hired didn\u2019t come with references and PhDs. Lacy is a hard worker, good with customers and a were-kitty who knows what I am and understands my weird schedule. I also had another vamp and a college student working for me. The mortal student was a merchandising major who did it for the love of the clothes. She spent more than she earned, maybe because she had a daddy bankrolling her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some money saved and Damian is letting me stay at the castle until the apartments are livable again. \u201d Lacy giggled. \u201cI have to share a bathroom with Florence. I don\u2019t see how you guys do it on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>My roomie believes in the power of long soaks in fragrant bath salts. Sharing a bathroom with her is a challenge that I suddenly missed so much tears stung my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019ll help me fix up the shop? If it can be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You\u2019re going to need someone to handle the daylight hours. You know any repairs are gonna have to be made then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My life is complicated.\u201d For a moment I missed Las Vegas. I\u2019d spent a few decades there working as a dancer in a club/casino right off The Strip. No one questioned a night owl in Vegas. Austin was a tougher sell. But Austin is full of vamps and other immortals. I\u2019m getting really comfortable being surrounded by my own kind.</p><p>\u201cGlory? You do think we can get the shop going again, don \u2019t you?\u201d Lacy cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of jobs over the years and working for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more. We\u2019ll figure it out. Together.\u201d My phone beeped again, incoming call. \u201cThanks, Lacy. I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I know anything. Say hi to Flo for me and ask her to loan you some of her brown sugar body scrub. It \u2019s to die for.\u201d I disconnected and took the other call.</p><p>\u201cMs. St. Clair? This is Steve Fleming with the Austin fire department, arson division.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, yes. What can I do for you?\u201d I hate dealing with government bureaucracy. I know from experience that they have a nineto-five kind of mentality. Getting them to wait until the sun goes down is a bitch. I usually have to whammy them into cooperating. Or get a friendly mortal or shifter like Lacy to do the daytime thing for me.</p><p>\u201cI need to get a statement from you and ask you some questions. Could you meet me at the site?\u201d Steve had a nice deep voice with a Texas drawl I found interesting. Valdez snorted in his sleep and rubbed his nose on Blade \u2019s pillow. Blade. I\u2019d moved to Texas with the idea of hooking up with a cowboy type. But Blade in a Western shirt was close enough for me.</p><p>\u201cWhen? Mr. er, Officer, er, Detective\u2014\u201d What the heck did you call an arson investigator anyway?</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Fleming, but call me Steve, ma\u2019am. I understand from Ms. Devereau that you\u2019re a night person. Works for me. I\u2019m on the night shift myself. How about meeting me in about an hour, in front of your shop?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the clock on the bedside table. \u201cTen o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. And call me Glory. See you there.\u201d I lay back and rubbed my forehead. The business meant a lot to me. This fire had been personal and whoever had started it was going to pay. Big time.</p><p>Five</p><p>\"You\u2019re frowning.\u201d Jerry stood in the doorway with a glass of what looked like my favorite beverage in his hand. \u201cValdez, get your mangy hide off my bed.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and gave Valdez a shove. He jumped down quickly. He knew better than to cross Jerry. I don \u2019t know what my boyfriend has on the dog, but it must be pretty serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs. Call if you need me.\u201d Valdez stretched, gave Jerry a tail wag as he walked by and disappeared down the hall.</p><p>\u201cHe never obeys me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a firm hand with him, Gloriana. He\u2019s here to serve you.\u201d Jerry sat on the edge of the bed and handed me the glass.</p><p>\u201cFunny how that works. He\u2019s here to serve me, but if I want to go out alone . . . \u201d I sniffed. Fangtastic in AB negative, my favorite. I took a sip.</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen. He\u2019s here to guard you. Something he can\u2019t do locked in your apartment while you\u2019re out God knows where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit he saved me. But Jerry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d</p><p>I gave up for the moment and took a swallow of Fangtastic. Drinking fake blood is probably like drinking a diet decaf when you really want the full shot of caffeine and sugar. Pretty good, but nothing like the real deal straight from the source. Hey, I\u2019ve evolved enough to survive on it.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the drink anyway. But,\u201d\u2014I held up my hand when he opened his mouth\u2014\u201cif I decide I want to go out alone, or with Flo, or anyone for that matter, I will. Sans dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t do anything foolish. Just to prove your independence.\u201d He watched me sip my drink. I licked my lips and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI am independent. Get used to the idea.\u201d Like that would ever happen. After four hundred years, I\u2019d finally snapped to the fact that Jerry wasn\u2019t changing. Period. And this protective thing would really be pretty flattering if it weren\u2019t so damned invasive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about recent events. Valdez has proved his worth, but now I think he needs help.\u201d Jerry frowned. I sat up. \u201cOf course Valdez has proved himself. He managed fine without any help.\u201d The rejuvenating effect of fake blood was doing its thing. I was alert and a little pissed that I\u2019d basically been talking to the hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something we can discuss later.\u201d Jerry frowned, picked up his pillow and tossed it on the floor. \u201cThat damned dog stinks like smoke. We\u2019ll send him to a groomer in the morning. Louise will take him.\u201d</p><p>Jerry\u2019s housekeeper. \u201cWarn her that Valdez isn\u2019t exactly thrilled to go to those places. I took him once, to an all-night place in Vegas. After he finally quit terrifying the staff, he let a female groomer, a cute young thing, bathe him. Then he got the poor girl fired because she accused him of sexual harassment, claimed he talked to her and made, um, lewd propositions while she was bathing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t do that again or he\u2019ll answer to me. Until he completes his duties to my satisfaction, he knows I won \u2019t tolerate problems.\u201d Blade watched me closely when I lay back and stretched. Oops, that pesky robe just wouldn\u2019t stay closed. \u201cWhat kind of lewd propositions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d Bingo. Jerry\u2019s eyes gleamed and he reached for the robe\u2019s tie. \u201cMaybe you can make me talk, with the right method of persuasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with the dog. I have my own lewd proposition. Starting with you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful. You\u2019ll spill my drink.\u201d I took a long swallow. \u201cThis is the good stuff. I can only afford O positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a case of the damned stuff if you put down that glass.\u201d</p><p>I grinned when he opened the robe and laid me bare. I sucked in my stomach. Habit and a good habit at that. No matter what Jerry said, a tummy bulge is not sexy. Jerry ran a hand over it, then teased the curls between my legs.</p> <p>\u201cYou look very good to me, lass. But if the Cheetos gave you pain, I say forget about them.\u201d He stroked his hand up to cup one of my breasts.</p><p>Easy to forget everything when his hands were on me. He was dressed in a black polo and jeans. Strong, masculine and his smile showed me fangs that had me aching for him. There\u2019s nothing better than sex with a vampire. Take my word for it. Feeding from each other while doing the deed is beyond orgasmic. We\u2019d done a little fang action in his secret garden, but I was always up for a rerun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet an arson investigator at my shop in an hour.\u201d I drained my glass, set it on the nightstand, then shrugged out of the robe.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to hurry.\u201d Jerry ripped his shirt off over his head and then stood. Vamp speed had his jeans off and sailing across the room in less time than you could say hot body. I reached for him and brought him down on top of me. I cradled him between my legs and kissed him. We were comfortable lovers together. But last night had proved, to me anyway, that we still had things to show each other. I nipped his ear with my fangs then flipped him off of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Jerry grinned up at me.</p><p>\u201cRoll over.\u201d I gave him a shove and he lay on his stomach, his head on his arms.</p> <p>\u201cAre you giving me a massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I was a little distracted. Muscular male buns do that to me. Not to mention a strong back that has scars from his warrior days, prevampire. He\u2019d kicked off his shoes and even his feet were sexy. I ran my hands up the backs of his hairy legs, then leaned down to nibble a path up to his backside. His muscles twitched against my tongue. I pushed his legs apart and found those sacs that were firm and warm. I tasted them until he groaned and reached for me.</p><p>\u201cNay, warrior. I would pleasure ye.\u201d The actress in me had always been good with an accent.</p><p>\u201cYou torture me, lass. I want my hands on you.\u201d No acting from Jerry. He was in pain.</p><p>\u201cForget it. Hold on to the headboard. This is my treat.\u201d I raised his hips and slipped under him. I touched him, stroked him, then pushed my fangs into the sweet spot inside his thigh.</p><p>\u201cGood God, Gloriana!\u201d He jerked and I heard the headboard crack.</p><p>I tasted his essence, his blood, then his maleness. Before I knew it, he was on top of me in another of his vamp moves, pushing inside me before I offered my neck and he drank. I felt the pull of his mouth all through me. Waves of pleasure curled my toes and had me scoring his back with my nails. By the time we\u2019d collapsed next to each other in a tangle of sheets, I knew I was going to be very late for my date with the arson investigator. And I could not care less.</p><p>\"Are you ever going to get out of that bed?\u201d</p> <p>I looked up and met Mara\u2019s gaze. I didn\u2019t bother to erase the dreamy look I probably still had on my face, along with whisker burns . . . Well, you get it and so did she. She dumped a laundry basket on the bed.</p><p>\u201cLouise folded your laundry for you.\u201d Mara held up a T-shirt, one of my favorites from the annual Austin Bat Festival. \u201cAre you sure you can fit in this?\u201d She held it up to her B cup chest. \u201cIt\u2019ll be quite a stretch.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the robe that had landed on the floor beside the bed and slipped into it. \u201cGive that here. What have you done to my clothes?\u201d The last was a wail. My XL shirt had shrunk to a barely medium.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t put this stuff in the dryer.\u201d Mara\u2019s smirk was not attractive. \u201cOn hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez.\u201d I sat on the edge of the bed. I hadn\u2019t exactly been firing on all cylinders the night before. And I\u2019d been paying way too much attention to Blade\u2019s personal equipment and not nearly enough to his laundry equipment.</p><p>\u201cCheck out the jeans. I\u2019d pay money to see you fit into these.\u201d She tossed my vintage jeans, the well-worn ones that had actually fit like a glove, into my lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them fit.\u201d I ignored Valdez\u2019s chuff of amusement. He\u2019d seen me struggle into tight jeans before. Not a pretty picture.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d Mara frowned and sat on the foot of the bed. Obviously Jerry hadn\u2019t deigned to include her in his plans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get to the shop. I\u2019m meeting an arson investigator. \u201d I stood and fished underwear and a bra out of the basket. They hadn\u2019t shrunk, but then a thong doesn\u2019t have much to it anyway. The bra looked a little sad, but the double D industrial strength ones I wore most days could take a lot of punishment.</p><p>\u201cArson. You know it had to be Westwood.\u201d Mara\u2019s hands were fisted on her knees. She had on the kind of low slung skinny jeans I\u2019d have killed to be able to wear and a tank top that almost hit the waist band. Men loved the look. All she needed was a belly ring. But piercings close during vamp sleep. I know, I\u2019ve tried and ain\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>\u201cYes, probably Westwood.\u201d I started to put my hand on her shoulder, but thought better of it. She is an old, old, old acquaintance. We\u2019d never been friends, because I\u2019m a low class actress type and she\u2019s practically royalty to hear her tell it. But I\u2019ve known her since my first visit to Scotland and Campbell Castle. She and MacTavish had been so in love. And Westwood now sported Mac\u2019s fangs on his trophy necklace.</p><p>\u201cValdez says you and Jerry were talking about Westwood earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking?\u201d She grimaced at my dog, who sat at her feet as if hoping she \u2019d actually pet him. Did I mention Mara is gorgeous?</p><p>\u201cWe were yelling, more like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I hate the hunter too.\u201d I sat next to her on the bed. Not touching. She\u2019d not appreciate that kind of familiarity from an underling. \u201cWhat are we going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremiah and I are going to hunt him down. And . . .\u201d Her green eyes shimmered with unshed tears. One crystal drop slid down her porcelain cheek. Of course she cried prettily. I get a red nose and puffy eyes. It\u2019s common among us underlings.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be careful, Mara. Westwood\u2019s got more money than God and all the latest technology. \u201d Including a high-tech vamp detector. I hate that thing. I\u2019ve blended with mortals successfully for centuries. And with one blast of his ray gun, the hunter had seen through all my excellent acting skills.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful. But we will destroy him.\u201d Mara jumped to her feet. All tears had dried up in the heat of her rage. \u201cBut not before we make him suffer.\u201d</p><p>I watched Valdez scoot out of range when she stomped one foot. Not that Prada sandals could do him much harm.</p><p>\u201cCute shoes.\u201d I\u2019d heard these rants before and Westwood wasn\u2019t the only one richer than God.</p><p>\u201cYou are so . . . useless.\u201d She gave me a disdainful look and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cLow blow.\u201d Valdez jumped up on the bed and nosed my jeans. \u201cThese are going to be a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have bit her on her skinny ass. She insulted me.\u201d I snatched up the jeans and the rest of what I needed and headed for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cBlade wouldn\u2019t allow me to hurt her.\u201d Valdez stayed on the bed and watched me. \u201cHe\u2019s very protective of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I leaned against the door jamb. \u201cAnd she\u2019s right. I am useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. You saved the day or night on Halloween.\u201d Valdez licked one paw. \u201cYou would be nothing but a set of fangs on a necklace right now if you hadn\u2019t distracted Westwood at the critical moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty cool.\u201d I\u2019d been inches away from being skewered, but I\u2019d practiced a little self-defense and visualization and actually saved myself. Unfortunately, the ensuing chaos had allowed Westwood to get away from Blade. Jerry had wounded him, but Mara wasn\u2019t ever going to forget that I\u2019d caused Jerry to focus on me instead of Westwood. I was sorry about the guy getting away, but I hadn\u2019t been useless that night.</p><p>I looked around. My distraction had involved setting a fire. Hey, I could start something right now, just to prove I still had it in me. Forget the bed\u2014brass, and I\u2019d developed a real fondness for it.</p><p>\u201cBlade\u2019s not gonna like it if you set his stuff on fire, Blondie. Besides, I for one never want to smell smoke again.\u201d</p><p>Valdez snorted and licked his other paw.</p><p>I sniffed. Thanks to my sensitive nose, I didn\u2019t have to be close to realize Valdez reeked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the groomer in the morning. You\u2019d better behave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo way. Put me in the shower. Like you do at home.\u201d He leaped off the bed and practically knocked me down getting into the bathroom. \u201cPlease, Blondie. You know I hate those places. They leave a guy no dignity.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d managed to get the shower door open and stood looking at me hopefully. I had a handheld showerhead at home and bathing him was a weekly ritual I\u2019d insisted on. I looked at the gleaming glass box with everything from a rain showerhead to multiple body sprays. I couldn\u2019t wait to check it out for myself.</p><p>\u201cYou leave yourself no dignity. Propositioning the shampoo girl. You got her fired.\u201d I opened a cabinet and found a bottle of shower gel, a manly scent that Valdez would approve of. He hated my flowery gels. Too bad I\u2019d left the flea shampoo at home.</p> <p>\u201cNot my fault. She got soap in my eyes. I couldn\u2019t just bark. And then when I\u2019d already blown my cover and I could see again, I thought, hey, she\u2019s cute. Why waste an opportunity?\u201d Valdez let me squirt the gel all over him. There was a toe tester and it took a moment to get the temperature to his liking. Then I reached in to turn on the shower, jumped out of the way, and watched him sit under the spray.</p><p>\u201cAny woman who would accept a proposition from a dog, sorry, but that\u2019s what you are, my friend, is not a woman you would want anything to do with.\u201d I sat on the closed toilet and watched as he positioned himself in front of one particular showerhead with what I swear was a smile on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re grossing me out. Move around or the groomer gets you first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! Like you\u2019re not going to check out all of these features.\u201d Valdez snorted and did his own version of a doggy break dance. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. But I guess it\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p><p>He stuck his head under a showerhead and let it rinse him clean. \u201cI smell better already. And once we\u2019re back home, you can do me over. With the flea shampoo again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I think you\u2019re done.\u201d I reached in and turned off the water. By the time I\u2019d rubbed him down with a bath sheet, my robe was as wet as he was. \u201cOut. And don\u2019t get on the bed.\u201d I pulled the towel off of him. \u201cGo down to the kitchen and lie on the tile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll shake a little of this water off on Miss Mara. Would that make you feel better?\u201d Valdez shook, flinging water all over the bathroom. \u201cSorry. Couldn\u2019t help it. Reflex. It\u2019s hell being a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, go spray the wench. Cool her down.\u201d I slammed the door in his face and dropped the wet robe on the floor. Useless. I refused to think so. Sure I had a business to put back together, so I couldn\u2019t go running off to wherever in search of Westwood. But I was not useless. I adjusted the water and stepped into Blade\u2019s decadent shower. Oh, boy, there was one showerhead that hit me right where I was just a little sore. From the gymnastics Blade and I had done. I wondered where he\u2019d gone. I\u2019d love for him to surprise me in the shower. I had lots of ideas for things we could do here. Hey, I was useful for some things. Did that make me a slut? I could live with that.</p><p>\"You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said eleven-thirty.\u201d I looked into the mortal\u2019s eyes and willed him to believe me.</p><p>\u201cRight. I forgot.\u201d Steve Fleming was a well-built man in his thirties who had a young Hugh Grant look to him. Dark curly hair, twinkling eyes and, hmm, a black cowboy hat. I\u2019d be attracted if I hadn\u2019t just had vampire sex with a man who could light every fire a woman never knew she had. Mortals, even hunky ones reeking of AB negative, are so . . . ordinary. This one wore jeans and a plaid western shirt that brought out the color of his eyes, a surprising blue. He glanced at his watch. \u201cSorry ma\u2019am.\u201d He tipped his hat. How cute was that? \u201cDon\u2019t know where my manners went. Can we start over?\u201d He grinned. Great teeth. Some of the older vampires . . . Well, an orthodontist would have made a killing a few centuries ago.</p> <p>\u201cUh, sure, Steve, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me show you what I\u2019ve found.\u201d Steve unlocked the burglar bars. I\u2019d never liked the look of those things, like we were doing business in a prison. But they were saving my shop from vandalism now. Yeah, right. Vandals would be salivating over my burnt offerings.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get the key?\u201d I did not want to go inside.</p><p>\u201cLandlord. Watch your step now. There\u2019s glass and debris. \u201d</p><p>Debris. Cute vintage clothing store with stock like fifties \u2019 cocktail dresses reduced to debris. I couldn\u2019t avoid it so I stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, this is a disaster!\u201d Despite a vow to be tough, I felt tears fill my eyes. Piles of filthy, wet clothes, fried furniture and swollen books littered the floor. The plate glass windows had been shattered. Glass crunched under our feet as we walked around.</p><p>\u201cThe fire must have been pretty intense.\u201d I sniffled and rubbed my burning eyes. \u201cSorry, the smell\u2019s getting to me.\u201d</p><p>Steve patted my arm. \u201cAnd the damage. I know this is hard to take.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, Steve had probably seen this kind of thing dozens of times. He got down to business, aiming a large flashlight and using a probe to move a few things around.</p><p>My mannequins lay like dead, formerly well-dressed ladies who lunch in their fifties suits. With their scorched faces and fried wigs, they stared at a blackened ceiling. A book shelf had fallen over, the contents scattered. I love old books and picked up a 1936 edition of Gone With the Wind from a puddle. A total loss. My tears dried up in a wave of fury. My fangs swelled against my gums and I barely swallowed a snarl. Valdez was right outside, obviously mind reading. He barked, reminding me I had company. I coughed, like the acrid stench was choking me.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d Steve looked at me with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I croaked. \u201cI\u2019m pissed. Who would do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was goin\u2019 to be my first question.\u201d Steve patted my shoulder again. \u201cAt least no one was hurt. The sprinklers and alarm system saved the day. Response time was good. It could have been a lot worse.\u201d Steve walked over and opened the door to the storeroom. \u201cSee? Fire didn\u2019t penetrate.\u201d</p><p>I glanced inside. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Except that everything\u2019s wet.\u201d Did I mention that I deal mostly in vintage clothing? A wet cotton shirtwaist was no problem. But the silk Chanel suit from the sixties that I \u2019d paid big bucks for . . . ? I stroked the limp sleeve. Emerald green silk.</p><p>I swallowed a sob and looked for a place to sit. No such luck, unless I wanted a wet butt. I followed Steve back into the main room. My friend and semipartner, the Countess Cecilia von Repsdorf, otherwise known as CiCi, had consigned a few pieces of furniture, but the Queen Anne chairs were Queen Anne kindling now.</p><p>Steve pointed to a piece of fluorescent tape. \u201cThis is where we found the incendiary device. I reckon someone broke the window and tossed it inside. The place has been processed as a crime scene, but the firebomb\u2019s all we found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirebomb.\u201d I shuddered. If a vampire has a worst nightmare, it\u2019s fire. Consumed while you slept. Steve\u2019s arm came around my shoulders. He was looking at me like he felt my pain. He wasn\u2019t all that tall, maybe five ten to my five five, but he had a nice face that oozed sympathy. I thought about leaning against him for a moment.</p><p>Another bark brought me back to reality. Valdez was up, like he was about to come inside from where I\u2019d ordered him to sit in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want the dog in here. Broken glass. It\u2019s too dangerous for a pet.\u201d</p><p>My \u201cpet\u201d growled, showing some serious teeth. Steve stiffened.</p><p>\u201cValdez!\u201d I put a foot between me and the fireman and smiled at Steve. \u201cSorry, he\u2019s very protective of me.\u201d He was standing in for Jerry too. Blade had a business appointment, so he\u2019d loaned me one of his cars, a Mercedes convertible he\u2019d offered to give me more than once. Then he\u2019d ordered Valdez to keep an eye on me. Apparently arson investigators posed a threat.</p><p>\u201cHey, I love dogs.\u201d Steve walked to the door. \u201cHey, cute fella. What\u2019s the breed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLabradoodle.\u201d Steve looked a question. \u201cYou know a Lab poodle mix.\u201d Steve seemed like he was about to offer his hand.</p><p>\u201cCareful, he\u2019s been known to bite.\u201d I sent the dog a mental message to play nice. \u201cHe\u2019s still upset by the whole fire thing. His barking actually alerted the residents and helped save us.\u201d</p><p>Valdez gave me a look and growled. Steve backed up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s in my report. The smoke was pretty dense. The dog definitely saved your lives, especially if you sleep hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep hard? Uh, yeah, you could say that. Several of us in the building work nights.\u201d</p><p>Steve gave Valdez a final look then turned back to me. \u201cNow why don\u2019t you tell me who might want to put you out of business.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>\"Me? Why do you think I was the target?\u201d Give this girl an Oscar. I really wanted to shout Brent Westwood\u2019s name. The vamp killer knew way too much about me and my shop. But the billionaire had made a fortune here in Austin. His high -tech company employed thousands in the area. Pointing the finger at him would get me nothing but a quick trip to the loony bin.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like random vandalism. But the store next door did get the same treatment.\u201d Steve walked over to the door and looked outside. \u201cVandals, gangs, would have tagged the place. You know, with spray paint. I don\u2019t see any graffiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe somebody had a bad coffee at Mugs and Muffins. I sure don\u2019t have any enemies.\u201d Not that I knew of anyway, other than Westwood. And I was convinced that he would have hired this done, making sure he was far, far away before the whole thing went down.</p><p>We\u2019d take care of him anyway. There was nowhere he could hide that a vampire couldn\u2019t find him eventually. And take him out. I had to believe that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the owner of Mugs and Muffins next. You both seem to be night people.\u201d Steve set his high-powered flashlight on the counter, pulled a notebook out of his back pocket and flipped it open. \u201cDiana Marchand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d My fellow vamp would be just as unhelpful to Steve as I was. Dealing with any kind of government official made me twitchy. Steve was cute, though. And I liked the way he kept giving me looks when he thought I wasn\u2019t noticing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting her in a few minutes. Her store had less damage than this one. Because the workers in the back had fire extinguishers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re open twenty-four seven. My shop\u2019s closed every Sunday and Monday.\u201d I took a step and a shattered porcelain figurine crunched under my feet. A black velvet cloche hat drooped with sodden feathers. I walked over to a soggy pile of silk scarves and picked up a yellow and orange Vera. These could be dry cleaned. And maybe a really genius cleaner could salvage the Chanel suit. \u201cGo, if you want to talk to Diana. I\u2019m going to stay in here for a few minutes. To assess the damage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere. You\u2019ll need this.\u201d Steve handed me his flashlight. \u201cI\u2019ve got another one in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll get it back to you.\u201d I swept the light around like I hadn\u2019t already been able to see every excruciating detail perfectly with my vamp vision. The beam settled on the computer we used for everything from sales receipts to inventory. I swallowed. The thing was a melted mass of plastic. At least I had a backup copy of the info, but where? At the moment, I was too rattled to remember.</p><p>Steve pressed a card into my hand. \u201cCall me if you think of anyone who might have had a grudge . . .\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cTrust me. Women are pretty passionate about their clothes, but I don\u2019t think any of them would destroy this many innocent . . . victims.\u201d</p><p>Steve patted me on the shoulder. \u201cWell, you never know. And I\u2019ll probably be calling on you again too. For a progress report.\u201d</p> <p>He swept his eyes over me, over my clingy T-shirt and tight jeans that had zipped only after I\u2019d stretched out flat on my back on the bed and sucked in my stomach. Hey, no pain, no gain.</p><p>Worth it, apparently, since I was detecting a little male interest from Steve, the fireman. I took a breath. That interest might come in handy if old Steve got too nosy and discovered I never, and I mean never, saw the light of day. Of course there was always the whammy.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. I\u2019m a little early, but I\u2019m anxious to talk to you, Detective.\u201d Diana had poked her head into the doorway. She gasped when she saw my shop. \u201cOh, Glory! This is horrible. Much worse than my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Diana. I needed an outside opinion.\u201d I shook my head. No need to act the bitch to Diana. She was my friend and a vampire who\u2019d been a role model as far as creating a successful business goes. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m reeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are, honey. The place will come back together, you\u2019ll see.\u201d Diana frowned as she looked around.</p><p>\u201cI could run a sale. Southern fried suits half price.\u201d I faked a laugh, then put my hand on Steve\u2019s arm. \u201cLet us know when the electricity will be back on. We both want to get in here as soon as possible. And moved back in upstairs, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShould be soon. Inspectors will be out tomorrow, but it doesn\u2019t look like the fire spread enough to do any structural damage to me.\u201d Steve squeezed my hand, then walked over to Diana.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Come over here and let me know what you think. \u201d Diana had cleaned up pretty well and had on a Mugs and Muffins T-shirt that highlighted her assets. Steve was in megaboob heaven.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, Glory.\u201d Steve trailed Diana without a backward glance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in.\u201d Valdez stepped across the threshold.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to spend the rest of the night picking glass out of your paws.\u201d I pushed him back out the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute. Guard the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, honey. I thought I was in the fires of hell yesterday. \u201d A figure appeared in front of me. Emmie Lou Nutt and her husband Harvey are my resident ghosts. Emmie\u2019s stuck for eternity in what she\u2019d had on when she died, a cute little cowgirl outfit that would have been a big seller in the shop. She\u2019d had it on for the Texas State Fair pie competition. It definitely made you think about what you wore on a daily basis. In case you were run over by a pickup truck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Emmie. I\u2019d say someone with a hate for vampires decided to make a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomebody. I\u2019ll say. First the window blows out. Then whoosh, fire everywhere.\u201d Emmie fanned herself and drifted over to the doorway. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t kids either. I saw the whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>I put down the laundry basket I\u2019d started filling with everything I thought could be washed.</p><p>\u201cReally? You saw who did it?\u201d I don\u2019t know why that got me excited. It\u2019s not as if I could send a ghost down to pick the perp out of a lineup. I watch cop shows. Obviously.</p><p>\u201cI saw him too. He ever sets foot in here, Glory, darlin\u2019, we\u2019ll get him good.\u201d Harvey appeared in front of me. His starched and pressed jeans and western shirt had probably been made that way by his beloved Emmie before the fateful day when they \u2019d headed to the state fair. The day he\u2019d accidentally run over Emmie in the parking lot. Could a ghost still iron?</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Glory?\u201d Harvey looked at Emmie. \u201cMaybe you should come back later. With some help.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not all right. I think Westwood\u2019s behind this.\u201d I grabbed some cotton skirts and stuffed them in the basket.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me none.\u201d Emmie hovered over a shattered crystal vase. \u201cBastard seems determined to make your life a misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmie Lou Nutt!\u201d Harvey drifted closer to his wife.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. He\u2019s a bastard. Lacy told us he tried to kill our Glory and that nice Mr. Blade on Halloween.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and dropped another skirt in the basket. \u201cBlade\u2019s going after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Mr. Blade looks like he can handle himself.\u201d Emmie shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need starch and a hot iron after you wash those, honey. I always liked the spray starch myself.\u201d Emmie sniffled. \u201cDang it. I never thought I\u2019d miss ironing.\u201d She sobbed and disappeared.</p><p>Harvey grunted. \u201cGlory, you just be careful. Without Mr. Blade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d I looked at Valdez. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to yourself, Gloriana?\u201d Richard Mainwaring lounged in the door. Valdez lay calmly by the door and barely twitched.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m talking to ghosts.\u201d I looked around. Harvey had vanished too. \u201cAnd what did you do to my guard dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez is doing his job. He knows I\u2019m no threat to you.\u201d Richard stepped inside and looked around. \u201cGhosts? Whatever you say, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me, Mainwaring. I have ghosts here. Nice ones. And they\u2019ll make you sorry if you aren\u2019t nice to me too.\u201d A soggy alligator bag sailed across the room and barely missed Richard\u2019s head. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>He reached up and snagged it in midair in a pretty impressive vamp move. \u201cYes, I see.\u201d He set the purse down on the blackened counter. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a mess here. So I guess I\u2019ll have to postpone my plans for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour plans? For me?\u201d Damn it. Wasn\u2019t there anywhere I could sit in here? I headed to the back room and sat on the wooden table there. Between the smell and the sheer trauma of the whole fire thing, I was a little weak in the knees. A wet butt was worth it.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a debt. I haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d Richard pulled a paper from his back pocket. He wore leather pants that should have been illegal, they were so . . . formfitting. I made myself look into his eyes. His brilliant blue eyes that matched the faded ZZ Top Tshirt he wore. Mainwaring and classic rock. The man obviously had depth.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d I stretched out my hand. Good thing I was sitting, the estimate from a Harley specialty shop was three figures, nearly four. I sighed and handed it back to him. \u201cWhat are they doing, plating it in diamonds?\u201d</p><p>Richard looked down at the paper. \u201cThis is a reasonable estimate. The work is delicate. And it\u2019s platinum. Diamonds would be too flashy.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d made a joke. His sexy grin confirmed it. I smiled back. Maybe he was going to be reasonable. Surely he realized I was ass deep in alligators here, with my livelihood in ruins.</p><p>\u201cAss deep in alligators? Where did you hear that?\u201d Richard was grinning for sure now.</p><p>\u201cMy ghosts. They have a colorful vocabulary.\u201d I leaned closer. \u201cAnd quit reading my mind. I hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s rude.\u201d He tucked the paper back in his pocket. \u201cBut definitely informative. I consider it a survival skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, obviously I\u2019m going to be strapped for cash for a while. Can we work out some kind of payment plan? Say, a dollar a week?\u201d I should not be interested in the pull of the leather across his zipper area. \u201cHey, I\u2019ll live long enough to pay it out.\u201d Forget the dollar deal. I had a mental picture, just a snatch, of two naked bodies working something out on a wide bed. I threw up a block in case Richard was getting the same X-rated preview. Preview? No way. I was with Blade. Had enjoyed something wonderful with him just hours ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d He was still grinning and he moved closer, until he was almost between my legs. He grunted when a vintage Tony Lama boot whacked him between the shoulder blades. \u201cHey, I\u2019m Glory\u2019s friend. Tell them, Gloriana.\u201d He looked down at me, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay, guys.\u201d My ghosts were rooting for Blade. Emmie Lou in particular liked the way he looked out for me. And Harvey saw Blade as a man\u2019s man. Which he was. When he was just a man. Now he\u2019s a vampire\u2019s vampire. Richard is too. Sort of. If said vampire is behaving himself. But let a vampire go rogue, endangering the rest of us with reckless behavior, and Richard is there to see justice done. He considers himself an enforcer, a vamp vigilante. Probably goes back to his stint in the priesthood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are okay, aren\u2019t you, Richard?\u201d He was an inch from invading my space but I was not leaning away from him. He just stared at me, a little something interesting in his eyes before he stepped back and smiled again.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am, Gloriana. I\u2019m your friend, if you\u2019ll let me be. Even though you practically destroyed my ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ride that was parked illegally.\u201d Okay, a slight exaggeration. \u201cBut I said I\u2019d make things right and I will.\u201d Uh-oh. Why did Richard\u2019s smile suddenly make me nervous?</p> <p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m staying with Blade now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else?\u201d He had a look that made me want to get all defensive again. Like I had to run to Blade for every little thing? But a burned-out shop was not a little thing.</p><p>\u201cI have other friends. Damian offered me a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Florence is there.\u201d He got another look in his eyes. Hard this time, like he had a score to settle there.</p><p>\u201cYou and Flo\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre done. We go our own ways now.\u201d He definitely was nursing some feelings and not warm and fuzzy ones either. I don\u2019t know what went down between the two, but the ending had not been mutual or friendly.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll call you. When I\u2019m moved back in.\u201d I jumped off the table. \u201cI know I owe you. I\u2019m sorry about the damage and I\u2019ll make good on it. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask.\u201d And with a wink, he was gone.</p><p>I set about sorting laundry again, but the stench of scorched clothing had my head pounding in about five minutes. I said good bye to my ghosts, gathered up my dog and headed for Blade \u2019s. I needed a bath, a cold glass of Fangtastic and Blade, not necessarily in that order.</p><p>\"I have a surprise for you, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and rubbed Blade\u2019s cheek. I was sated, again. And couldn\u2019t quite open my eyes. \u201cSurprise? Like the picnic in the garden? I could go for some more strawberries.\u201d I felt his smile before I finally looked at him.</p> <p>\u201cNo, something a bit more tangible.\u201d He rolled out of bed and pulled on his jeans. \u201cCover yourself and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>I blatantly stretched, as sensuously as I could make it, and posed at the angle that made the best of my overabundant curves.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want me to cover myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit distracting me, lass. I\u2019m leaving tomorrow night and we need to get this settled.\u201d</p><p>Leaving? I snatched up the sheet and held it under my chin. \u201cWhere are you going? Why tomorrow? I\u2019m traumatized. I need your . . .\u201d I dropped the sheet again. \u201cComfort.\u201d</p><p>Blade was beside me in a flash. \u201cYou will always have my . . .\u201d He drew a finger around one of my nipples, making me shiver.</p><p>\u201cComfort.\u201d He leaned down and kissed me with enough energy to make me pull him down on top of me again. Can we say insatiable? Me, him, maybe all vamps now that I think about it.</p><p>\u201cStop. I\u2019m serious.\u201d He leaped off of me and moved to the end of the bed. Like he needed the distance to keep his thoughts together. Excellent.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I pulled up the sheet again. \u201cWhere are you going? After Westwood?\u201d I\u2019d figured out that it was only a matter of time. I\u2019d had Jerry practically stuck to me like glue for almost a week. He\u2019d even wielded a broom to help me clear out the worst of the mess in my shop.</p><p>\u201cAye. I have a lead. Mara and I need to pursue it.\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d take Mara with him. She\u2019d insist on it. I should be just as determined to put a period to the hunter\u2019s existence. But I had a business to resurrect. And, while revenge is sweet, it\u2019s not my be-all and end-all if you know what I mean.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think he went?\u201d I found my black lace nightgown and dropped it over my head. It was sexy enough that Blade actually stepped a little closer.</p><p>\u201cAfrica.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cPut on a robe. I\u2019m bringing in your surprise now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfrica? That\u2019s so far away.\u201d I stood and walked up to him. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d He pulled me to him and held me for a minute.</p><p>I felt so close to him. And not just physically. I hugged him and breathed in his essence. Maybe it was because he \u2019d made me what I am, but Jerry was the only man I\u2019d ever felt so connected with. At least when I wasn\u2019t on the verge of killing him.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Blade stepped back and pulled the terry robe from the wad of comforter and sheets at the foot of the bed. \u201cCover yourself. I don\u2019t want to start this relationship on the wrong foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart a relationship?\u201d I tied the robe at the waist and sat on the end of the bed. \u201cWho or what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in danger, Gloriana. I\u2019ve had concerns about your security for some time.\u201d Blade was looking pretty serious.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve got Valdez. We do pretty well. And I did save myself on Halloween. Or have you already forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that. You almost\u2014\u201d Blade rubbed his face, like he was actually tearing up and didn\u2019t want me to see it. Gee. When he put it like that, I felt a little queasy. I\u2019d had the business end of a stake poking my left breast. One false move . . .</p><p>\u201cMy heart stopped that night.\u201d</p><p>You had to love that kind of declaration. I smiled, threw my arms around him and rubbed his back. \u201cHey, any damage I got healed almost instantly. Remember, I\u2019m tougher than I look.\u201d</p><p>Blade gripped my shoulders and looked down at me. \u201cI never want to see you in such peril again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re sounding like one of those heroes in a romance novel.\u201d I love those things. Especially the paranormal ones. The things they think vamps do. What a hoot.</p><p>\u201cI mean what I say, Glory. I\u2019ve decided to double your guard.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\"Double ...\u201d I extracted myself from his arms and sat down again. \u201cTwo dogs? Or something else? Come on, Jerry. It\u2019s hard enough living with Valdez. We\u2019ve worked out our relationship pretty well. But it took a while and I\u2019m not in any hurry to go through that again. Besides, I need my privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need protection.\u201d Blade strode to the door and flung it open. A dog sat in the hall. A cute dog, with wavy white fur and startling green eyes. Green eyes that promised mischief and reminded me . . .</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is this . . . this wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him. Doesn\u2019t she, Will?\u201d Blade gestured for the dog to pad into the room.</p><p>\u201cAye, though it\u2019s been a century or two.\u201d The dog sat in front of me and casually scratched behind one ear. \u201cDamned mutt ye\u2019ve got workin\u2019 for her already is loaded with fleas. I\u2019ll not be sufferin\u2019 this kind of treatment.\u201d He didn\u2019t talk in my head, like Valdez did. No, this one moved his lips. It was bizarre. And if this was who I thought it was, I was putting up a hell of a fight before I took</p><p>him on as bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll suffer what is necessary to take care of Gloriana, Will, if you want to earn your reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring William Kilpatrick into this house, did you?\u201d Mara was in the doorway, Valdez right beside her.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Blade turned to smile at her. \u201cI\u2019d think it would do you good to see your brother as a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppropriate perhaps. But I\u2019d rather not lay eyes on him at all. He\u2019s a cur who does nothing but disgrace the family.\u201d</p><p>This from a woman who was a blood-sucking vampire. Made you wonder just what it would take to disgrace a pedigree like that.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need Kilpatrick here, Blade. I\u2019m more than capable of taking care of Glory by myself.\u201d Valdez came close to lean against my leg. \u201cTell him, Glory. We do okay, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do. I already told him that.\u201d I glared at the dog that had jumped up on his sister, practically knocking her over. He wasn\u2019t any bigger than Valdez, but he obviously had some vamp strength going on.</p><p>\u201cDown, you oaf.\u201d She pushed until he sat at her feet, tail thumping the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the love, sis?\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cHey, Glory, lass, ye\u2019re lookin\u2019 well rested.\u201d</p><p>Well rested. Translation: I had a severe case of bed head, no makeup and looked like hell.</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to let one of the Kilpatricks invade my space?\u201d And this Kilpatrick in particular wasn\u2019t exactly on the top of my list for potential roommates. Will was a wild child, Mara was right about that. And he chased anything female. He\u2019d cornered me a time or two when we\u2019d first met at Campbell Castle, treating me like the lightskirt all actresses were thought to be back then. In dog form, he was cute. In human form . . . Well, let\u2019s just say he was pretty hard to resist and he knew it. But I\u2019d resisted him. His air of superiority, like I should be honored to do him, had made it easy.</p><p>\u201cAw, now, Gloriana. You know you always had a soft spot for me.\u201d Will nudged Valdez and tried to get closer to me. Growls that made the hair stand up on my arms promised an all-out doggy war.</p><p>Blade wasn\u2019t tolerating it. \u201cEnough. You\u2019ll both take care of Gloriana. And she\u2019s your mistress in this, as always, Valdez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress? Is this a sweet deal or what?\u201d Will laid his muzzle on my knee. \u201cRemember me now, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVividly. And I\u2019m still immune.\u201d I pushed his face away and stood. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I don\u2019t want or need another guard. Send this . . . beast back to whatever rock he crawled out from under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s right.\u201d Mara was obviously not struck with brotherly love. \u201cGet out, Will. Don\u2019t let the door hit your tail on the way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this!\u201d Blade\u2019s voice was a thunderclap. \u201cYou\u2019ll all get along. Or answer to me.\u201d He pulled me to his side. I thought about resisting. Don\u2019t you just hate the way he issues orders? But while Blade would never hurt me, he was still one scary dude when he was riled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRelax, Jer. We\u2019ll get along.\u201d I patted his cheek and he did relax his jaw a bit. \u201cBut I think this is totally unnecessary. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know you\u2019re safe, Gloriana, or I can\u2019t leave.\u201d His arm tightened around me and he gave me a tender look that melted any contrariness I\u2019d been building up.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d I leaned against him. \u201cJust hurry back. This is temporary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He dropped a kiss on my head. \u201cWill, Glory is in your care. One hair on her head comes to harm and there will be no bailout. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBailout?\u201d Mara tossed her head. \u201cSurprise, surprise. You\u2019ve got yourself in another financial bind, haven\u2019t you? At least you had the good sense not to come running to me this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat lot of good it would do me.\u201d Will heaved a sigh. \u201cMy own sister wouldn\u2019t throw me a bone if I was starving.\u201d He sidled up to Blade. \u201cSpeaking of bones. We don\u2019t have to eat dog food and crap like that, do we? I\u2019ve got standards.\u201d</p><p>Valdez perked up, obviously sensing an ally. \u201cNo way. I had a rib eye night before last. You just tell Glory what you like to eat and she\u2019s on top of it. Though she doesn\u2019t really cook. She can barely panfry a steak without burning it. She just doesn\u2019t get the concept of rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone didn\u2019t insist on this dog form, I\u2019d cook for both of us. I\u2019ve studied at the Cordon Bleu in Paris. Night classes. When I get the money together, I plan to open a restaurant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re vampire, aren\u2019t you? How can you stand to eat?\u201d Could everybody eat but me? Life is so not fair.</p><p>\u201cKilpatrick vampires are born, not made, and can do some things made vamps can\u2019t. Didn\u2019t you know that, Gloriana? \u201d Mara gave me a sympathetic look, like only an idiot could have been around this crowd for hundreds of years and still not have a clue.</p><p>\u201cSure I knew that.\u201d Not. I probably was an idiot. But I\u2019d spent most of those hundreds of years trying to be anything but vampire.</p><p>\u201cWill is to do your bidding, Glory.\u201d Jerry gave him a hard look. \u201cIf he is too much of a problem, I\u2019ll replace him.\u201d</p><p>Mara shook her head. \u201cGood thing you\u2019re poor, Glory. Will goes through cash like Valdez goes through Twinkies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I need my strength. And I want to know why he can talk like that and I have to do it inside people\u2019s heads.\u201d</p> <p>Valdez leaned against my knee. \u201cThough if the number two guy tries talking like that in front of mortals, you\u2019ll straighten him out, won\u2019t you, Glory?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed Valdez behind his ears. \u201cYes, puppy. He\u2019ll have to follow the same rules you do. And you\u2019ll always be number one with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d Blade\u2019s arm tightened around my waist. \u201cI thought I was number one.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and smiled. \u201cLet me clarify. Valdez, you\u2019re my number one bodyguard. Blade, you\u2019re my number one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me.\u201d Mara rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve had quite enough of Gloriana\u2019s drama. Westwood killed MacTavish. My husband. I see no reason to wait for tomorrow night. Shift with me now, Jeremiah, and we can be in Africa before sunrise. \u201d Mara looked down and gasped. \u201cWilliam Allan Kilpatrick, what do you have in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>Will looked up from his new chew toy, one of Mara\u2019s Prada sandals. \u201cThere\u2019s something very tasty about a high-priced shoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you, you hound.\u201d Mara charged, Will lunged and the two of them ran out of the room, Mara screeching and Will laughing like a hyena.</p><p>\u201cThat was a surprise.\u201d I sat on the foot of the bed again. \u201cWill Kilpatrick. I don\u2019t know if this is going to work out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI probably do need backup, Glory. Think about it. I\u2019m on duty twenty-four seven. Sure, I get a nap now and then, but I can tell you that years of that kind of stress takes its toll. I could have slept through the whole fire thing. I was that exhausted.\u201d Valdez had obviously decided to join the dark side, especially if it might mean a better menu.</p><p>\u201cTwo dogs?\u201d I collapsed on the bed. \u201cJeremiah Campbell you are a wicked, wicked man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cue. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d Valdez ran out the door, which slammed behind him.</p><p>\u201cThe dog\u2019s learning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but are you? Why do you always have to make these major decisions about my life without consulting me?\u201d I tried hard to hang on to my mad, but Blade never had put on a shirt. And a half -naked Blade did stupid things to my mind. Like wiping out my logical thinking.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t consult you. You would have said no.\u201d</p><p>I stopped just as I was about to untie my robe again. \u201cDamned right.\u201d Controlling man. Always. One reason we\u2019d parted as often as we\u2019d gotten together. \u201cTake off those jeans and come back to bed. I\u2019m going to punish you for your impertinence. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d Jerry grinned as he shucked his jeans and leaped on top of me.</p><p>\"Okay, you\u2019ve distracted me long enough. I\u2019ve been an idiot long enough. Mara\u2019s right about that. Made vampires versus born vampires. What other differences do I need to know about?\u201d I watched Jerry get dressed. He was leaving tonight and I\u2019d given him a send-off guaranteed to help him remember me during those long, hot nights in Africa. Jerry zipped his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we went over this the first time I took you home to meet mum and dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably did.\u201d And as an actress from humble beginnings, I\u2019d been too busy trying to please the laird and lady of Castle Campbell to pay much attention. Of course I hadn\u2019t pleased the parents. Jerry and I never married for one thing. And I was what I was. Not a Scottish heiress like Mara, in other words.</p><p>I\u2019d met plenty of vamps over the years but it\u2019s not considered polite to ask about one\u2019s origins. Some vamps, like me, came to the deal willingly and saved regrets for later. Others had been forced into the life. You think I whine. So vamps tend to live in the moment. Usually. Speaking of the moment . . .</p><p>Jerry pulled on a snap-front cotton Western shirt. He\u2019d been going for a cowboy look to please me because I had a yen for a cowboy type, now that I lived in Texas and all. The yellow looked good with his dark hair and eyes, really good. He left it open. Even better.</p><p>\u201cThe Kilpatrick, Mara\u2019s father, is the one who made my father vampire in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo started the family from hell.\u201d I muttered it, but nothing gets past Jerry\u2019s vamp hearing.</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory, the clan is quite fond of you. If you\u2019d married me, they would have accepted you as part of the family.\u201d</p><p>A big \u201cif.\u201d Jerry had popped that particular question about a century late as far as I was concerned. By then I\u2019d spent way too much time with \u201cthe clan,\u201d four brothers, all alpha males, and two sisters who could give Joan Rivers bitch lessons. And then there was dear Mama, who\u2019d actually tried to stake me one cold winter night. But, hey, I don\u2019t hold it against her. I just don\u2019t plan to be in the same continent, let alone the same room, with the woman ever again.</p><p>\u201cWe had some issues. One being that I wasn\u2019t part of a dynasty.\u201d Like Mara. Or even MacTavish\u2019s sister who Mama Campbell had really wanted for Jerry.</p><p>\u201cI would never have married Tess MacTavish.\u201d Jerry gave me a look, letting me know he\u2019d really like me to get over this ancient jealousy.</p><p>\u201cQuit reading my mind. And tell Tess she \u2019s off your potential bride list the next time you see her. Watch her reaction. \u201d Tess MacTavish put the vamp in vampire if you know what I mean. Men flocked. And she \u2019d always had a thing for Jerry. Hard to believe he was immune. I got another one of those looks. Time for a subject change. I watched Jerry run a leather belt through the loops on his jeans. \u201cIs that a Gucci belt?\u201d I know my leather goods.</p><p>\u201cSo Mara said. It\u2019s a gift from her.\u201d Jerry buckled it, then picked up his wallet from the dresser and slipped it in his back pocket, like he thought I wouldn\u2019t notice it was Gucci too.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing giving you expensive presents?\u201d This was serious. I gave Jerry the same thing every Christmas and birthday that we were seeing each other\u2014my own too well-curved body. Hey, I\u2019m on a budget. And I am enthusiastic. I usually tie a bow on myself somewhere interesting. Jerry loves it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m letting her stay with me and won\u2019t accept payment. So she gives me gifts. It makes her feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I was also sure Jerry had no clue what a nice Gucci belt and wallet cost either. I wasn \u2019t telling him. \u201cSo born vampires can eat. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can eat and drink. Don\u2019t let Will near strong spirits. He\u2019s quite fond of whisky and doesn\u2019t handle it well.\u201d Jerry frowned, as if wondering if he\u2019d done me any favors bringing Will on board. I wondered the same thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen Mara shift, use her strength, the regular vamp powers. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn vampires don\u2019t turn until thirty or so. Before then they\u2019re human and mortal. Can even have children. The Kilpatricks have lost many a bairn before the change.\u201d Jerry was still frowning. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that every hundred years or so they can get fertile again. And if they mate with a mortal, the babe will be vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Mara have children?\u201d What a concept. The woman had about as much maternal instinct as a rabid bat.</p><p>\u201cAye. A daughter, Lily, with Mac before the change. We\u2019ve not seen her for years. She and her parents had a falling out.\u201d Jerry sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for her. To let her know about her father. No luck so far.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on Jerry\u2019s knee. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a shock. Vampires are supposed to live forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I must go after Westwood. To avenge Mac and pay Westwood back for the harm he has done you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I couldn\u2019t argue. And Jerry was at his best in fierce warrior mode. \u201cBe careful. Westwood\u2019s going to be surrounded by stakehappy goons, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he might not have left some men here. To finish what he started.\u201d Jerry pulled me into his arms and rested his cheek on my hair. Tears filled my eyes. Vampires were supposed to live forever, especially this one.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. Now I\u2019ve got two guard dogs.\u201d I looked up with a watery smile. \u201cBut if Will gets into Flo\u2019s shoe collection, I may be down to one again before you get back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t just stay here while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to get back to my own place. You know how I am about my stuff.\u201d I\u2019m a nester with a capital N.</p><p>\u201cOf course. And Florence will be coming back as well? \u201d Jerry likes Flo, everyone does. And she\u2019s pretty powerful. If she wasn\u2019t too involved with her lover du jour, she\u2019d be bodyguard number three. Do you get the idea that I\u2019m regarded here as Glory the helpless? My own fault. I\u2019m afraid to shape-shift. Spend most of my waking hours trying to blend by acting more mortal than the average human being.</p><p>But I\u2019ve been changing since I moved to Texas. I\u2019m surrounded by powerful vamps and shifters who know all kinds of neat tricks. I\u2019m determined to start using some of my latent power. I bet I\u2019ve stored a ton of it since 1604. There was a knock. Jerry kissed my cheek, then got up and opened the door. Mara stood in the hall, positively humming with impatience.</p><p>\u201cWe should go now, Jeremiah. Once we get to Namibia, we\u2019ve got to find a safe place to sleep before dawn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll arranged, Mara. I sent a man over yesterday. He called a half hour ago. My shipment arrived. He picked it up at the airport and found us appropriate lodging.\u201d</p><p>Jerry must have shipped his clothes, Fangtastic and other stuff that he saw as essential for an all -out war with Westwood. Vampires don\u2019t exactly make reservations on Continental. He and Mara would shape-shift into hawks or some other bird and fly with preternatural speed from here. Mere mortals wouldn\u2019t even be able to see them. The two vamps would be in Africa before dawn.</p><p>Jerry jumped when I used my own warp speed, newly learned of course, to slip behind him and wrap my arms around his waist. He put his hands over mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in five minutes, Mara. Feed the dogs, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. Valdez is happy with just about anything, but Will is complaining that his eggs were dry and his toast burned. \u201d Mara wrinkled her perfect nose. \u201cLike I should know how to cook. What are servants for, I ask you?\u201d</p><p>I sure didn\u2019t comment on that. Servants? Yeah, right. \u201cHe\u2019d better get used to takeout and microwave meals while he\u2019s with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeremiah, maybe you should let Will change into human form so he can cook for himself. \u201d Mara stared at my hands on Jerry\u2019s stomach. Or was she enjoying the view? Jerry\u2019s chest was a sight I sure never got tired of. I gently raked my nails over the hair arrowing into his waistband. Her eyes narrowed. Poor Mara, with the famous vamp libido and no man in her life. I actually felt the urge to fix her up. Maybe when she got back from Africa. Unless she finagled her way into Jerry\u2019s bed over there. My hands became claws and Jerry grabbed them.</p><p>\u201cImpossible. Glory\u2019s going to have her hands full handling Will as a dog.\u201d Jerry\u2019s hands tightened over mine. \u201cI know what your brother\u2019s like. But he\u2019s fierce in a fight. And I trust him to stick by Glory\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a price, of course.\u201d Mara made a face. \u201cWhatever. Perhaps Will and Gloriana will suit very well.\u201d She gave me the old Glory\u2019s a slut look.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Mara. Now leave us alone.\u201d I slipped my fingers into Jerry\u2019s waistband. Mara grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs. Five minutes, Jeremiah. \u201d She headed down the hall. Only a vampire like Mara would dress for a transatlantic flight in a black leather mini and high-heeled Gucci boots to match. The woman did love her Gucci. The shape-shifting deal is pretty awesome. Whatever you\u2019re wearing when you change, that\u2019s what you have on when you go humanoid again. I have no idea what physics or whatever you call it are involved. But I \u2019ve seen it work. Many times. I just don\u2019t trust myself not to screw it up. How would you like to be stuck as a bird or dog or something equally gross?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crushing the wind out of me, lass.\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t sound like he minded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d But I eased up and turned him around to face me. \u201cKiss me good-bye and make it a good one.\u201d</p><p>Jerry smiled and ran his hands over my body. I\u2019d been naked in the bed and I was still naked. Not that I\u2019d let Mara see me like that. She\u2019d never made a secret of the fact that she thought I was fat. Skinny bitch. So I\u2019d been hiding behind Jerry. He didn\u2019t mind my generous curves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do more than kiss you, lass, but five minutes wouldn \u2019t be nearly enough. I\u2019d\u2014\u201d He leaned down and whispered graphic details of what he\u2019d like to do. The list was long, maybe an hour\u2019s worth. And I felt heat pooling between my thighs.</p> <p>\u201cI love it when you talk dirty. Mara can wait. \u201d I dragged his lips to mine and gave him a kiss guaranteed to curl his toes. I whispered some interesting variations on his earlier suggestions in his mind. He growled and grabbed my ass like he\u2019d never let go. But he did. Let go, that is.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to leave now or we won\u2019t beat the sun to land-fall. \u201d</p><p>I sighed and gave him a final hug. \u201cBe careful. And come back as quick as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Jerry gave me a hard kiss, then strode out of the room. I flopped on the bed and stared dry-eyed at the ceiling. There was a scratching at the door and I dove under the covers. Until Blade came back, it was flannel nightgowns for me.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Two dogs, one trailing a lime green Prada sandal by its broken strap, came in with concerned looks. Valdez jumped on the bed. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I buried my fingers in his fur. The bed dipped and I figured Will had jumped up on the bed too. Valdez growled and gave him a head butt that sent Will crashing into the nightstand. A brass lamp wobbled then hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cEasy there, my canine cohort. I\u2019m only guarding our mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can guard her from the floor, asshole.\u201d Valdez had obviously decided to be top dog. Which was fine with me. The way Will said mistress made my fangs swell and I had a real strong urge to rip his head off and stuff it up his . . . you know. Good. Anger beat the hell out of all the other emotions that I was set to wallow in.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Will. And you touch even one strap on any of my shoes and you\u2019ll get generic canned dog food for the duration.\u201d I almost laughed at the expression on Will\u2019s furry face.</p><p>\u201cMakes me wonder if I\u2019ve landed in hell.\u201d Will stalked over to the door and lay across the threshold. Valdez snorted. \u201cDrama queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen? Queen?\u201d</p><p>Who knew a dog could hit high C? I closed my eyes as the insults flew back and forth. All I could think about was Blade, flying over a dark, cold ocean.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\"This is where we\u2019re going to live?\u201d Will poked his head into the kitchen. \u201cI liked Blade\u2019s place better. State of the art. This is pathetic. Electric stove. Don\u2019t you know gas is the way to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it, Emeril. You\u2019re not going to be cooking here and neither is Glory if you don\u2019t shape up.\u201d Valdez took his top dog role seriously. He looked around and chuffed. \u201cStill smells a little funky in here, but it\u2019s good to be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d I collapsed on the couch and wrinkled my nose. A restoration company had been through the place and what I smelled wasn\u2019t so much smoke as disinfectant used with a liberal hand. Too liberal. I immediately had a headache.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Glory?\u201d Valdez put his head on my knee. \u201cIs that vamp trying to communicate again? Bad news if he can get at you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just the cleaning stuff.\u201d But the other headaches hadn\u2019t stopped. When we were outside, I still heard someone calling my name. There was a knock on the door and both dogs jumped up and growled.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I got up and looked through the peephole. No one should have been able to get inside without buzzing from downstairs. But then someone might have let this one in, since he\u2019d been a regular visitor until a few weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cMainwaring. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>Orders. I felt my usual resistance, then remembered that I owed this guy a debt the size of Montana.</p><p>\u201cSure. Come in.\u201d I flipped back the dead bolts and flung open my new door. \u201cThanks for not knocking the door down. I\u2019m not sure how many Damian is willing to pay for.\u201d Mainwaring brushed past me.</p><p>\u201cIs Florence here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s moving back in tomorrow. Something about dry cleaning that won \u2019t be ready. She wants to move everything at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Not that she\u2019ll actually pick up anything herself. \u201d Richard stared down at Will. \u201cI don\u2019t know this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Kilpatrick, Mara\u2019s brother. You know Mara MacTavish. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The grieving widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Where\u2019s your respect?\u201d Will showed some teeth, but one steely look from Mainwaring and he shut his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI have great respect for Mrs. MacTavish.\u201d Richard nodded at Valdez. \u201cBut I wonder what you\u2019re doing here and why you\u2019re not comforting your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s in Africa, with Blade. Hellbent on revenge.\u201d Will sat down next to the door. \u201cI\u2019m on assignment. Guard duty.\u201d</p><p>Richard looked at me. \u201cTwo dogs? What\u2019s the story? Doesn\u2019t Blade trust you with a real bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to smack his handsome face. \u201cHe trusts me. He just doesn\u2019t trust men not to fall in lust with me and drive me crazy with their unwanted advances.\u201d I gave him a head toss. \u201cI\u2019m irresistible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard actually grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not arguing with you.\u201d He looked around the living room. \u201cWhere\u2019s your computer? Was it damaged in the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy laptop is in the bedroom. I haven\u2019t had time to check it out. Why?\u201d I watched Richard prowl the living room. Something had him worked up. Maybe he\u2019d hoped Flo would be here. For a month, the couple had been hot and heavy. Even short term, which is the way my roomie likes it, it\u2019s hard to just turn off that kind of attraction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of a way for you to repay your debt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow this is getting interesting.\u201d Will stood and walked closer. \u201cYou got debts too, Glory? This guy loans money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown, boy. Glory had a little accident. She\u2019s paying for repairs to Mainwaring\u2019s vintage Harley.\u201d Valdez pushed between me and Will. \u201cIt\u2019s a sweet piece of machinery. Or was until Glory ran right over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident. And Richard was at fault too. He \u2019d parked in my spot.\u201d I went to get my computer. \u201cIf doing some computer work will get me off the hook, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</p><p>Richard followed me into the bedroom, Valdez on his heels. \u201cI need you to do some research for me. And maybe it\u2019s time I learned to navigate one of these things. You can give me lessons on how to use the Internet.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my computer and took it to the table in the breakfast nook.</p> <p>\u201cYou never learned how to operate a computer?\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to admit I\u2019d been resistant to new technology myself for way too long. Then I\u2019d discovered I could actually do some bargain shopping online. The rest as they say is history. I sat down, flipped open the computer and powered it up. To my relief, it seemed to be operating all right. We had good wireless Internet access here. Damian had made sure of that once he\u2019d moved his sister in. Flo supposedly didn\u2019t read or write, but she was hell on wheels when it came to online shopping. We\u2019d spent many a fun evening on the Italian shoe sites.</p><p>\u201cLet me check my e-mail first.\u201d I hadn\u2019t done it since the night before the fire. A quick glance showed the usual notices from my favorite shopping sites, some spam (yeah, right, like I want to see a nympho getting up close and personal with livestock) and e mails from some buds I\u2019d left behind in Las Vegas. Richard leaned over my shoulder, an interested observer. I wished he didn \u2019t smell so good.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d A message from the Fang Collector. One guess who that might be from.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d Richard leaned over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAn e-mail from Westwood. I doubt it\u2019s a thank you for the lovely time we had on Halloween.\u201d Especially since the toad was probably still recovering from the wicked knife wound Jerry had managed to give him. I hope it hurt like hell.</p><p>\u201cHow could he know how to contact you?\u201d Richard pulled out a chair and sat beside me.</p> <p>\u201cWestwood\u2019s a computer genius. He practically invented the Internet. He probably knows everything about me. From my reading habits to my cup size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCup size?\u201d Richard looked puzzled.</p><p>\u201cBra cup. I shop online a lot.\u201d I felt too queasy to be embarrassed. I sucked up my courage and opened the e-mail.</p><p>\u201cListen to this: \u2018If you\u2019re reading this, then I guess my fire failed to send you to hell where you belong. Too bad. Either you have the world\u2019s best luck or I\u2019m losing my touch. I choose to think the former. But, trust me, vampire, your luck is about to run out. I may have left the scene, but my men have not. They\u2019re paid well to make your life a living hell. But not to kill you. I reserve that pleasure for myself. Soon. W\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bastard\u2019s got his nerve. But he\u2019s an idiot for taunting a vampire.\u201d Richard jumped up, looking around like he wanted to tear something apart or maybe smash something. I could definitely relate. \u201cAre you going to answer him, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might encourage him.\u201d Westwood\u2019s pen pal? My finger twitched over the delete button, but I knew I had to save this garbage. Evidence of harassment, though going to the police was obviously not an option. I did the next best thing, I forwarded it to Blade. As soon as I did it, I knew it was a big mistake. He\u2019d go ballistic.</p><p>I took a shaky breath. I had to trust Blade not to go off half-cocked. Hopefully, he\u2019d use his rage to formulate a plan, a carefully executed plan that would turn Westwood into roadkill.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I jumped up, fighting my own urge to smash and trash. I grabbed a bottle of Fangtastic out of the fridge. I offered a bottle to Richard but he shook his head. I took a deep swallow and waited for the jugular juice to do its thing. It did make me feel marginally better, stronger anyway.</p> <p>\u201cI just hope Blade manages to get to Westwood and takes him out. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the paychecks stop, Westwood\u2019s men will be creating a nuisance.\u201d Richard glanced at the living room. Valdez and Will had both looked up when they\u2019d heard the refrigerator door open, but when neither Twinkies nor a steak came out of the kitchen, they\u2019d gone back to snoozing, Valdez on the couch, Will on the floor. \u201cAt least you have protection of a sort.\u201d</p><p>I was not comforted. \u201cDamn! Damn! What next? Slashed tires? Another fire in the shop?\u201d This was infuriating. I sure wasn\u2019t going to sit calmly by waiting to be attacked.</p><p>I sat back in front of the computer and hit reply. Westwood wanted to start a flame war? I was all over it. I \u2019d had centuries to hone my verbal skills. I hit send before I could even reread for typos.</p><p>\u201cTake that, you creep with the bad jewelry. Fang necklaces are so not cool.\u201d</p><p>Richard grinned and pulled out a chair to sit across from me. \u201cWhat did you say, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty. I even threw in a voodoo curse I learned in New Orleans.\u201d I smiled in spite of my still simmering rage. \u201cWestwood may need clean underwear after he reads my e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t regret that, Glory. It could cause things to escalate.\u201d</p><p>I met Richard\u2019s blue, blue eyes. He was actually worried about me. Hey, he could join the club. I took another swig of Fangtastic. \u201cI can handle a few mortals. Maybe they\u2019ll decide Westwood\u2019s money isn\u2019t worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind reading.\u201d I looked at my dogs. \u201cWe put the pooches to work. They can read the minds of any and all mortals who get within a hundred feet of this building. They pick up a Westwood vibe and we deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking murder and mayhem?\u201d Will had perked up at the word \u201cmoney.\u201d Now he trotted up to stand next to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so eager. Murder no. Mayhem definitely.\u201d I glanced at Richard who\u2019d raised an eyebrow. \u201cWestwood\u2019s sent me an e-mail threatening to harass me with some hired muscle. When they come around I can plant memories, fake memories that make these guys run like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it, Blondie. Mind control.\u201d Valdez pushed Will out of the way. \u201cNot sure we can just run loose outside though. Austin has strict leash laws. And doing mind control on every dog catcher that comes by . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need to run loose. Stay with Gloriana and read the minds of anyone nearby. \u201d Richard looked thoughtful. \u201cWhen she\u2019s in the shop, you can sit by the windows and do your thing through the glass.\u201d</p><p>Valdez nodded. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d I\u2019d just remembered something. \u201cWestwood had those tinted glasses. If his guys all wear those . . .\u201d Trust a techno-freak bastard like Westwood to find and use special eyeglasses that keep us from reading his mind.</p><p>\u201cSo anybody hanging around at night, wearing tinted glasses, is fair game. We act first, ask questions later. The day I can\u2019t knock a pair of glasses off a mere mortal is the day I hang up my dog collar. \u201d Valdez bumped against my leg.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work it out.\u201d I rubbed his ears and felt marginally better. I stared at my computer but neither Blade nor Westwood had answered me. Yet. \u201cLet\u2019s start the computer lessons. \u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Richard got up to lean over my shoulder and study my computer screen. \u201cI see Google dot com there. I\u2019ve heard of it. What does it do? Show me how you \u2018Google\u2019 something. That is what they say, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Hey, knowing the vocabulary is a good start.\u201d I began explaining the process and the dogs settled back in the living room. I laughed at the expression on Richard\u2019s face when I googled him. There were Richard Mainwarings doing everything from rocket science to poetry readings.</p><p>\u201cPoetry, Richard?\u201d His warm hand settled on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve always been fond of a well-turned phrase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry.\u201d Will snorted. \u201cSpare me.\u201d</p><p>Richard gave the dog a look. \" \u2019O \u2019tis a foul thing, when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Will scratched his ear. \u201cA badass vampire spouting poetry? Now that\u2019s foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that bit from my days at the Globe. The Two Gentlemen of Verona.\u201d I smiled at Richard. \u201cNice.\u201d You had to like a man who could quote Shakespeare. I looked at the dogs. Valdez had ignored Will and was sleeping on his back, giving us a not so nice view of his stomach and elsewhere. \u201cUnfortunately my dogs think their place is in the middle of my business. I got used to one, but two . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mistress.\u201d Will wagged his tail. \u201cWe but live to serve.\u201d He glanced at Valdez who had started snoring. \u201cAnd a fresh pair of eyes could be the best thing that ever happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I just had to worry about your eyes, I could deal.\u201d Will turned to give me his best \u201cI\u2019m a badass\u201d look. Okay, maybe he would pull his weight. \u201cNever mind. I did this to myself. I let Blade saddle me with both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter that threat from Westwood, I\u2019d think you\u2019d be glad of the extra protection.\u201d Richard leaned down, like he was studying the web site I\u2019d been showing him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could never read his mind, but I had a feeling . . . Could he see down my V-neck T-shirt?</p><p>\u201cOf course I can, Gloriana. Why do you think I\u2019m standing here? You mentioned cup size. I got distracted checking them out for myself.\u201d Richard chuckled, then stepped back when I jumped to my feet.</p><p>\u201cMind reading scumbag.\u201d I slammed the computer shut. \u201cThis lesson\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTemper, temper. You said you were irresistible. I just proved the point.\u201d Richard dodged my fist, grinned and headed for the door. \u201cI look forward to our next lesson. And while I\u2019m downstairs, I\u2019ll scan the neighborhood for any suspicious characters. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve made a mortal scream. Sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the door behind him and threw the dead bolts. Then I pushed Valdez off the couch and picked up the remote. I needed something funny. Two and a Half Men. When Charlie came on to blond bimbo number sixty -seven, I remembered Richard\u2019s hand, warm on my shoulder and the twinkle in his eyes when he\u2019d admitted to copping a peek. Okay, I admit it, I don\u2019t mind a little male appreciation from someone besides Blade. Hey, Gloriana\u2019s still got it. And I was beginning to understand why Flo had gone for Richard. He had a certain charm . . .</p><p>My cell phone rang during the third commercial.</p><p>\u201cI got your e-mail.\u201d</p><p>If the male voice had been Blade\u2019s, I would have been glad to hear it. Instead I gripped the phone until the plastic cracked.</p> <p>\u201cI got yours first.\u201d Nice comeback, Glory. \u201cFor a billionaire, you\u2019ve got weird hobbies. Has anyone ever suggested therapy? \u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a vampire, you\u2019ve got an interesting vocabulary. Has anyone ever suggested a stake through the heart? \u201d He actually laughed.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d My extensive vocabulary deserted me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry. Are your fangs out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could see them. Run your tongue over them. So sharp, so pretty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSharp enough to suck you dry, you creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember how you looked on Halloween. Your very generous breasts thrusting against that wooden stake.\u201d Westwood made a sound that creeped me out. \u201cWhat are you wearing right now, Gloriana? Are you naked?\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurched and I stared at the phone for half a second before I snapped it closed and threw it across the room. It hit Flo\u2019s collection of Patrick Swayze movies (don\u2019t ask), then bounced on the rug. Valdez\u2019s cold nose brushed my face.</p><p>I threw my arms around him and laid my cheek on his warm fur.</p><p>\u201cWestwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cI think we just had phone sex.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang again and we all stared at it.</p><p>\u201cPick it up. Let me talk to that asshole.\u201d Will paced around the phone. \u201cDamn it, this dog form sucks. Answer the damned phone, Glory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d The ringing stopped for a few blessed seconds then started again.</p><p>\u201cCheck the caller ID.\u201d Valdez licked my cheek and I finally let go of him. \u201cCould be Blade. He\u2019ll be worried if you don\u2019t answer. \u201d</p><p>The phone quit ringing, then beeped to indicate I had voice mail. I made myself rescue the battered phone and check the number. Blade. Thank God. But why did he have to be so far away? I\u2019d give anything to feel his arms around me now. I listened to his voice mail and realized I had to call him back before he flew home to check on me. Times like these, I realized a cell phone is nothing but a long leash. Okay, there were worse things than having a man worried about you. Like having a homicidal maniac as a pen pal. I ignored the rock in the pit of my stomach and hit the speed dial.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t about to mention Westwood\u2019s call. Blade needed to keep his cool and the idea that Westwood . . . Well, let\u2019s just say the whole thing was seriously creeping me out. The less said about it, the better.</p><p>\"It looks good, Glory.\u201d Flo threw down her paintbrush and wiped her hands on a burnt orange cotton T-shirt that she\u2019d declared too ugly to be more than a rag. \u201cA little plain, maybe, but I think better than it did before.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue, at least not without whining. I couldn \u2019t get over the nagging fear that we\u2019d get this place back together and Westwood\u2019s fire bomber would strike again.</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it, Glory. Damian\u2019s put in extra thick windows and hired security to do drive-bys during the day.\u201d Flo put her hand on my shoulder. \u201cAnd Jeremiah has gone after this Westwood. He\u2019ll make him pay for this.\u201d Flo gestured at the empty racks beside her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be back in business in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m snapping out of it right now.\u201d Damian\u2019s workmen had been quick about getting up new drywall and installing flooring. I\u2019d picked out the wood laminate myself, trying for a space that shouted retro, hip, spend your cash here. But fixtures and stock were up to me. Fortunately, an army of friends had shown up ready to paint, clean, whatever I needed. Most surprising had been Flo, who\u2019d put her manicure at risk to pick up a paint brush.</p><p>\u201cNow all we need is some stock.\u201d I sat on a stool next to my refurbished counter, which would hold my new cash register. The old one sat in the stock room, a lump of melted plastic that resembled a science experiment gone terribly wrong.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d Lacy, my day person and shape-shifting neighbor, pushed in through the door loaded down with dry cleaning bags. \u201cThese all came out pretty well. I tried to look them over before I accepted them.\u201d She made a face. \u201cHere\u2019s the bill. I put it on your credit card like you asked. Major bucks, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the bill and swallowed. Since when did dry cleaning cost more than a small car? \u201cHere, let me help you.\u201d I grabbed some bags and began hanging up dresses and suits on the metal racks we\u2019d salvaged by scrubbing off black soot.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have more for you, Glory.\u201d Flo hopped up from where she\u2019d settled to do the baseboards. \u201cI cleaned out my closet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Lacy. \u201cCome upstairs and give me a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lacy gave me a pinch me, I\u2019m dreaming look behind Flo\u2019s back. I love my roomie, but she\u2019d never once considered letting me sell any of her vast collection of shoes, purses or clothes before. She\u2019d always insisted classics never went out of style. And she was right. I\u2019d built a business on that fact.</p><p>\u201cMr. Danger here didn\u2019t even bother to look up when that door opened.\u201d Valdez followed me to the back room where I picked up a trash can. \u201cWill\u2019s not worth the cost of Alpo.\u201d</p><p>I set the can down and began stripping plastic bags off clothes. \u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d I looked around the shop. So much to do. I wished the dogs could hold a paint brush. Maybe if I tied one to Valdez\u2019s tail . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t. Not in the job description.\u201d Valdez sat with a thump. \u201cI was making a point here. About the slug otherwise known as Will. The point is, he\u2019s dead to the world during the day. Which is when you\u2019re most at risk.\u201d Valdez sat near my feet while I stuffed bags into the trash can. \u201cThen at night, when he should be on high alert, so maybe yours truly could get some rest, he\u2019s spending all his time trying to look up Flo\u2019s skirt or down your blouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resent the implication, though I won\u2019t apologize for appreciating fine women, cheese doodle. And I\u2019ve been by the window scanning the street for mischief makers. I saw Lacy when she was a half block away. I know you don\u2019t like cats, but the lady\u2019s on your side, you know.\u201d Will padded up to sit on my other side. \u201cNice suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanel.\u201d I stroked the fine wool. Believe me, if I could have sucked in my gut enough to get the zipper up, I\u2019d have kept it.</p><p>\u201cIn Paris I had a girlfriend once who shopped at Chanel. Expensive habit. I had to dump her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. You dumped her . And I\u2019m a Labradoodle, not a cheese doodle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, puh-leeze. At least I chose to be a purebred Great Pyrenees. A dog known as a faithful friend and fierce guardian. Not a mongrel with questionable ancestors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMongrel!\u201d Valdez growled and moved in on Will. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re fierce. Especially when you finally get up off your ass to come to the food bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Like you\u2019re not Twinkie obsessed. And what\u2019s with the jones you\u2019ve got for Cheetos?\u201d</p><p>I tuned out the ongoing saga. Between the ick factor of Will playing Peeping Tom and paint fumes, I needed air. I stepped outside and took a deep breath. The air was fresh and I instantly felt better. It was after two in the morning, thank God for all night dry cleaners, and the street was almost deserted. Mugs and Muffins, already back in business, boasted only one customer, a student type hunched over his laptop with his coffee at his elbow. His glasses weren\u2019t tinted so I figured he wasn\u2019t in the Westwood spy network. God, I was sick of being paranoid.</p><p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d Oh, hell. A pain stabbed my forehead. \u201cCome to me, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>The voice was inside my head. I had to follow it. I headed down the sidewalk toward the corner.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling. Come closer. You\u2019re beautiful. Let me see you.\u201d</p><p>I threw off my sweater and reached for the buttons on my blouse.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Valdez head-butted me, knocking me on my ass. \u201cGlory, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhat?\u201d Damn, I was freezing. My blouse was open to the waist giving the world a nice view of my black bra, my sweater a lump on the sidewalk a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cGet inside, Gloriana.\u201d Will ran to the corner, barking and snarling like he meant business. I staggered to my feet. \u201cThat voice. I swear I know it.\u201d I grabbed my sweater and ran to the shop door. \u201cWill. You get anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Whoever it was got away.\u201d</p><p>Valdez pushed me inside. My brain was screaming. Even though the voice was gone, the headache seemed determined to hang on. And what was with the striptease? I buttoned my blouse and threw on my sweater again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look around some more.\u201d Will looked at Valdez. \u201cYou stay here with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I take orders from you.\u201d Valdez looked up at me. \u201cSit down, Glory. Flo and Lacy should be back any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d The man in the doorway provoked a bark-a-thon that made my head scream. I collapsed on a stool and leaned my head on the counter. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019s the door standing open?\u201d Richard Mainwaring glared at Valdez, then Will when he came trotting inside.</p><p>\u201cI left it open. I needed air. My head\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Sue me, but I did. Because the light was killing me, not just because he told me to. I felt his hand on the top of my head. Had I combed my hair in the past few hours? Nope. In fact, I think there were globs of yellow paint decorating my crown. I couldn\u2019t get worked up about it. The pain!</p><p>\u201cThe vampire\u2019s been working you again. What happened? \u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was stupid.\u201d I kept my head down, eyes closed. \u201cI followed the voice. Like I was under the whammy or something. \u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s hand on my head had actually made the pain stop. I sat up. \u201cAnd I started taking off my clothes. Like he told me to. How sick is that?\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded toward Will. \u201cBack outside. See if you can find this vampire who wants Glory naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d Will smirked at Valdez, I swear it, then headed out the door just before Richard closed it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should lock the door.\u201d Valdez was obviously not happy to see Will given an assignment and not him. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that Glory-obsessed vampire in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we do.\u201d Richard sure looked scary when he was mad.</p> <p>\u201cLike a door will keep out a vampire.\u201d Flo shouted from outside. \u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Richard flung open the door again and stepped back. He just stared at Flo, his face grim.</p><p>\u201cRichard.\u201d Flo\u2019s look as she walked past him, her arms full of clothes, was equally grim.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to keep out vampires? They\u2019re some of our best customers.\u201d Lacy had her hands full of shoe boxes! And purses!</p><p>No headache can stand up to my love of good accessories. I jumped up to help both of them set the things on a table.</p><p>\u201cSome vampires are much more interested in causing trouble than in looking good.\u201d Richard stared at Flo for a heartbeat or two.</p><p>\u201cSome vampires are interested in nothing but looking good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me, but I take pride in my appearance. \u201d Flo carefully set a pile of silk blouses on the table. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve done the impossible. I\u2019ve kept my look fresh and up to date in spite of being more than a few centuries older than most of the present company.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on Flo\u2019s shoulder. She was shaking with anger, her fangs visible at the edges of her Cherries in the Snow lipstick. Her color, but so last century. I sure wasn\u2019t about to tell her that. Block, block.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my role model, Flo, my guide to fashion forward thinking.\u201d I gave Richard a go away look. \u201cRichard\u2019s concerned about some vamp he\u2019s hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Richard\u2019s concerned about Gloriana being stalked.\u201d At least he wasn\u2019t glaring at Flo anymore. Now he was glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cStalked?\u201d Flo looked at me, fangs full out. \u201cWho would dare do that to my roomie? I\u2019ll rip his throat out. A vampire? No, his throat would heal. Where\u2019s a stake when you need one?\u201d Flo grabbed a paint brush and eyed the wooden end. \u201cA little dull, but with enough pressure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill out, vamp girl, I think Richard can handle it.\u201d Lacy had stacked the shoe boxes neatly. She leaned against the counter so her tiny tank top rode up to show a slim middle that made my jaw clench. The tall redhead had something of a crush on Richard. She was all for his piercing gaze, broody thing.</p><p>\u201cYou should all be on guard.\u201d He turned to his former mistress. \u201cFlorence, I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve heard voices in your head lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoices? Like I\u2019m crazy?\u201d Flo was determined to hate Richard and I\u2019d given up trying to make peace.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been hearing voices, like someone is inside my head, trying to get me to come to them.\u201d Okay, so maybe I was an incurable peacemaker. \u201cYou hear anything like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no one has done this.\u201d Flo studied me with worried green eyes. \u201cDo you recognize the voice? Is it Damian again?\u201d</p><p>Flo\u2019s brother Damian had done a number or two on me with his little mind games while trying to make me another notch on his bedpost. But I\u2019d made it pretty clear to him that I wasn\u2019t playing and I think he\u2019d moved on. \u201cI\u2019d recognize his voice. This one is different. Sounds pure American. Doesn\u2019t have the cute little accent you and Damian have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute, of course. But very little. Whoever is in your head\u2014he\u2019s dead meat. Am I right, girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Now show me some shoes. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re letting me sell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Flo lifted the top off one of the shoe boxes. \u201cAnd maybe I need to keep these. I remember the night I bought them. In New York.\u201d She glanced at Richard. \u201cA generous lover and a famous musician, very famous, demanded I have only the best.\u201d She picked up a red lizard pump and hummed a few bars of a song I recognized immediately.</p><p>\u201cFlo, are you kidding? Was your lover\u2014\u201d Lacy stopped when Flo held up her hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say his name. We did not part well. I had to sign an\u201d\u2014she shuddered\u2014\u201cagreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise. Surprise.\u201d Richard\u2019s smile made me shudder.</p><p>Flo looked daggers, then turned her back on him as she stroked the shoe. \u201cYou can get a good price for these, Glory. Barely worn.\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cI move on. There are many more\u201d\u2014she glanced at Richard\u2014\u201cbetter shoes out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, why bother with shoes at all? You don\u2019t need them when you spend most of your time horizontal.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Richard was playing the scorned lover, big time. Clearly Flo had dumped him. Now Flo muttered something nasty in Italian and rounded on him, hands on hips. I stepped between them, taking my life in my hands, but what \u2019s a girl to do? I needed both of them on my side and I\u2019d just put the shop into some kind of order. Any fight between them was bound to be messy.</p><p>\u201cBehave, please.\u201d I rubbed my head and came away with yellow paint on my hand. How cute was that? I grabbed a rag, wiping my hands while I smiled at Richard.</p><p>\u201cRichard, thanks for the help with my headache. I feel a thousand times better.\u201d This did not go over big with Flo. I put my hand on her shoulder again and felt her quivering with the urge to leap over me and go for you know who\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cFlo, I\u2019m dying to see what you brought me. Let\u2019s dig in.\u201d The door opened and Will trotted in.</p><p>\u201cAll clear outside. Whoever\u2019s after Glory has left.\u201d He shot Valdez a smug look. \u201cToo bad. I was fully prepared to take him out.\u201d</p><p>Flo quit giving Richard a \u201cgo to hell\u201d look long enough to examine me with concern. \u201cIf this happens again, do what he says. Go outside. Then we attack, all of us. An ambush.\u201d</p><p>Lacy gave up on her seductive pose and moved closer. \u201cRight. We\u2019ll teach this brain buster to mess with our friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s a thought.\u201d I glanced at Richard. \u201cBut Richard here is the vamp enforcer. Maybe he can run down this guy. I\u2019ve got too much to do to waste my time dealing with some vague threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so vague if he\u2019s trying to get you alone. For sex, do you think?\u201d Flo bit her lip. She didn\u2019t like the idea of asking Richard for anything, obviously. But the former priest had a reputation for dealing with rogue vampires in a way that stopped the problems they were causing permanently.</p><p>\u201cNot everything is about sex, Florence.\u201d Richard winced when Valdez sat on his foot. \u201cHey, watch it, fella, I\u2019m on Glory\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d The dog moved a quarter of an inch, max. Not surprising. My dog had a crush on Flo that he didn \u2019t bother to hide. He\u2019d obviously decided he had issues with Richard. \u201cAre you going to help Glory or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure it\u2019s a vampire? You know Westwood\u2019s probably got guys keeping tabs on this place. Because he knows vamps work here.\u201d Lacy had just made a good point. I hadn\u2019t told Flo or Lacy about Westwood\u2019s e-mail. I gave them a quick recap.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Lacy snarled like she wanted to change into cat form and rip someone apart. I hid a smile. She\u2019d confessed once that her form was more lap kitty than saber -toothed tiger. What was she going to do? Purr him to death? Flo was agitated too, muttering in Italian.</p><p>\u201cThe guy was talking in Glory\u2019s head. Unless Westwood\u2019s got a paranormal on his payroll, he\u2019s not behind this stunt.\u201d</p><p>Valdez got up and stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going outside for my own look-see. Lacy, do you mind coming with? And use the leash. I figure we\u2019d be well rid of somebody here if animal control had seen him running loose out there, but I don\u2019t want to be the problem instead of the solution. \u201d High and mighty Valdez stalked to the door.</p><p>\u201cIs the little doggy afraid of animal control?\u201d Will pushed his head under my hand. \u201cUnlike you, doodle bug, I\u2019m fearless. I\u2019ll stay here and take care of the mistress.\u201d</p><p>Flo and Richard both gave Will a narrow-eyed look. Ho. So I wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t like the \u201cm\u201d word coming from my dog.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both part of the problem if you don\u2019t get over this rivalry. I\u2019ve got a good mind to call Blade and let him know what\u2019s going on.\u201d I rubbed my hair with the rag and came away with even more paint. There was a mirror in the dressing room, but it \u2019s true that vamps don\u2019t reflect. Just as well. I\u2019d have sent myself screaming into the night. \u201cYou guys are a pain and not in my head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going outside with you, Valdez.\u201d Richard took the leash from Lacy. \u201cLadies, I\u2019ll be back shortly. Lock the door behind me.\u201d He was out the door before any of us had time to react.</p><p>\u201cBossy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Lacy did throw the dead bolts before she picked up a navy Prada clutch. \u201cCan I borrow this before you sell it, Glory?\u201d She smiled at Flo. \u201cYou have amazing taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Flo gave a shrug. \u201cAnd yes, he\u2019s bossy. Just one reason why we didn\u2019t work as a couple.\u201d Her shoulders sagged for a moment, then she visibly pulled herself together. \u201cI\u2019m meeting my new lover later. I\u2019ve been seeing him for a while now. He reminds me of a prince I once knew in Budapest. So handsome, so caring. And he puts my needs first. Compared to him, Richard is a . . .\u201d She glanced around, then grinned. \u201cToad!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lacy looked lost, but I saw what Flo had seen. One of my well-meaning friends had left a box of clothes earlier in the evening. On top was an unfortunate pair of bright green flannel pajamas with frogs and toads leaping from lily pad to lily pad. Need I mention that said friend, a female vampire, had absolutely no social life? She was a project just waiting to be tackled. As soon as I got the shop going again, I was going to see about hooking her up. Maybe Richard . . . Flo laughed. \u201cI\u2019m reading your mind, roomie. By all means set Richard up with toad girl. They will be like two pods in a pea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeas in a pod.\u201d I grinned but couldn\u2019t keep it going. The nagging thought that Westwood could have paranormals on his payroll was deeply disturbing for so many reasons. One: Fighting humans was easy compared to combating the bag of tricks a shape shifter or vamp could whip out. Two: A paranormal who would work for a known vamp hunter had no limits when it came to dirty deeds. Three? Well, two were more than enough for me.</p><p>Will paced in front of the windows, obviously agitated by the thought that Valdez could be getting action while he was on inside guard duty. I went back to sorting through Flo\u2019s fabulous castoffs. My customers would go nuts for these. I happily pushed the whole danger issue to the back of my mind.</p><p>I offered to pay Flo for her things, but she acted so insulted that I might think she needed money, that I quickly gave up. She and Lacy got into a debate over my back wall. I liked the plain, but clean digs. Flo obviously thought the wall needed something. Me, I just needed to reopen before I reached my credit limit. I mentally composed a flyer and decided to get the shop open by next week, come hell or high water. As for the hell . . . What if the freak -a-zoid stalking me created a disturbance and ran off my customers? Or worse, if he or she (women\u2019s lib, you know) caught me alone in the shop one night . . . And what was the deal about getting me to take off my clothes? I may have had my wild and free days, but stripping for strangers was not going to happen again. A memory, just a wisp, nagged at me. If I could just grab on to it. Who or what\u2014</p><p>Will woofed and Lacy opened the door. The boys were back and the two dogs immediately began arguing again. Why was I worrying about being alone? I was never alone. Alone might actually be a real treat.</p> <p>\" Hey, Glory. We\u2019ve got a present for you.\u201d Valdez pushed Will out of the way. \u201cOut back.\u201d</p><p>Richard unclipped Valdez\u2019s leash and grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s right. Open the back door.\u201d This was the third night in a row Richard had shown up and taken one or both dogs out for guard duty.</p><p>\u201cBe careful out there. Do you need us?\u201d Flo gave me a concerned look.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be in danger, Florence.\u201d Richard lost his smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Flo shrugged, then grabbed Lacy\u2019s arm and dragged her to the other side of the shop where she\u2019d started a secret project. She\u2019d even hung a sheet from the ceiling so I couldn\u2019t see what she was up to. I didn\u2019t push to find out either. I was glad for the company.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Richard threw open the back door.</p> <p>\u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d Will was right behind me. I looked out and saw that for a change the security lights were working. My Suburban, its brown a mud color that was supposed to keep the dirt from showing, sat in my usual spot. A man stood beside it. The man wasn\u2019t moving, except his eyes. They darted back and forth.</p><p>I walked closer and stared into those hyper eyes. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cWestwood sent him.\u201d Richard sent both dogs to sit by the back door. He bent down and picked up a pair of tinted glasses.</p><p>\u201cValdez caught him skulking back here and took him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I guess I owe that pup a ribeye.\u201d The man was a muscle bound type who was thinking in a panic.</p><p>\u201cVampires. Blood suckers. I\u2019m cooked. Not worth it. Help. Help. Holy shit, I can\u2019t move. Not even my little finger. What are they doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. What were you doing out here by my car?\u201d I squeezed the guy\u2019s chin. He needed a shave and not in that cool way that makes a guy look edgy and macho. This one just looked scruffy. My touch sent him into hyperdrive.</p><p>\u201cSlash tires, key it, a little sugar in the gas tank. A few harmless hassles. I swear it. Let me go. Let me go. Oh, shit, why can\u2019t I talk? She\u2019s a hot chick, nice knockers, but look at those fangs. Is it gonna hurt? Maybe she\u2019ll have sex with me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The creep wobbled on his feet when I shoved him, but didn\u2019t go over.</p><p>\u201cHarmless hassles?\u201d All I could see were dollar signs and being on foot. Not cool in Austin. There \u2019s great public transit, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be welcome with two dogs, especially dogs prepared to knock the tinted glasses off anyone who had a vision problem.</p><p>\u201cDo what you wish, Gloriana. Though I doubt you\u2019d want to take his blood.\u201d Mainwaring was close to me and I could feel his warmth at my back. \u201cHe\u2019s right about one thing. You\u2019re a hot chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wise not to mention my \u2018knockers,\u2019 Richard, but your timing sucks. I\u2019m not exactly in the mood for a flirtation which is probably all about making Flo jealous.\u201d Okay, maybe men did go for the too tight jeans and snug green T-shirt, both dried on high heat at Blade\u2019s. Blade. Hmm. I missed him, but kind of liked Richard \u2019s flirting. Did that make me a slut? Again? Historically, I never went long without some kind of action except for some lean years mid-nineteenth century. But that\u2019s another story. Yeah, slut was pretty accurate.</p><p>\u201cNow what delicious torture should I use to punish Westwood\u2019s thug?\u201d I stared into the man\u2019s still frantic eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitch. Mitch Ellison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Mitch. You will not hurt my car. You will not hurt my shop and you will definitely never have sex with me. Probably not with anyone.\u201d I looked down at his pants. \u201cYour dick is on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Christ!\u201d The man began clawing at his zipper, tears ran down his cheeks and he fell to the concrete. \u201cThe pain! Stop it. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is fun.\u201d Richard\u2019s breath stirred my hair. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t how you feel about all . . . dicks.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him. \u201cOops. Sorry, Mitch, but your peter just fell off and rolled under the car.\u201d</p><p>The man shrieked and scrambled around frantically until all we could see were his brown loafers sticking out from the side of the car, kicking at the concrete.</p><p>\u201cI can almost feel sorry for the bastard.\u201d Richard didn\u2019t sound sorry.</p><p>I watched the loafers disappear as the wailing reached a fever pitch.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it? I can\u2019t find it. Oh, God.\u201d Loud sobs.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t as much fun as I thought it would be.\u201d I leaned down just as one arm reached out to slap at the ground. Will and Valdez were laughing their furry butts off. For some reason this irritated the hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cInside, both of you.\u201d I strode to the back door and threw it open.</p><p>\u201cAw, Glory, this is just getting good.\u201d Will bumped against me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kilpatrick, let her do her thing.\u201d Valdez looked at Richard. \u201cStay with her.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded and I slammed the door. I turned to finish things. Mitch\u2019s whining was getting to me.</p><p>\u201cCome out now, Mitch. I found your teeny weenie. I\u2019ll give it back if you show me some respect.\u201d</p><p>The man slid out and jumped up. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He was shaking and tears ran down his cheeks. \u201cPlease, please give back my cock. I\u2019ll do anything. Anything.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Richard but he just raised that damned eyebrow. Like this was my party, my call.</p><p>\u201cMitch, you will never work for Brent Westwood again. You will leave Austin and you will know that vampires don \u2019t exist. Westwood made up the whole thing. He\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d The man held out his shaking hand. \u201cPlease. Have pity. My wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop whining.\u201d The cheating lowlife had a wife. \u201cYou will be a wonderful, loving, faithful husband. You will treat your wife like a queen and do whatever she asks as soon as she asks it.\u201d</p><p>Richard chuckled and put his hand on my back. \u201cYou want me to finish this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m handling it.\u201d I grabbed the man\u2019s chin again. \u201cListen to me, Mitch. You will turn over the remote control to your wife. You will watch whatever she wants and never complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being cruel.\u201d Richard walked around me and patted the pockets on the man\u2019s khakis. \u201cAh. I think you could use this.\u201d He pulled out a wad of bills and began peeling off hundreds. \u201cYou can even use it to pay off your debt to me.\u201d</p><p>Visions of financial freedom brought a lump to my throat. I couldn \u2019t feel bad about taking Westwood\u2019s blood money. Blood. The dickless wonder here reeked of B positive. I licked my lips but decided to let the urge pass. Biting this creep would put me way closer to him than I wanted to be. If he\u2019d been a more exotic type . . . Hey, I\u2019m a blood-sucking vampire and don\u2019t you forget it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d The man eagerly thrust out his hand. I hit his palm with my fist. \u201cPut your thing back on and get out of here.\u201d I ignored his pathetic squeal of happiness. When I heard his zipper go down, I turned away. Rapid footsteps announced his departure. I felt Richard at my back again. \u201cEight hundred dollars. Shall we call it even?\u201d</p><p>I turned and looked at him. \u201cMy debt to you?\u201d Gee, he was awfully eager to be rid of our connection. Oh, hell. The gleam in his eyes meant he was doing the mind reading bit even though I\u2019d told him more than once that I hated it. \u201cIf that will satisfy you, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d I was pretty sure the Harley bill had been more than that.</p><p>\u201cSatisfy me? Not a chance.\u201d Richard counted out four bills and stuck them in my jeans\u2019 pocket, his fingers sliding down to rest warm against my tummy. \u201cI want more . . . lessons.\u201d</p> <p>Damned tight jeans. If his fingers got stuck in there . . . I sucked in my gut and pulled out his hand. \u201cFine. I can use the cash and I certainly know how it feels to be technologically challenged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pity me.\u201d He held onto my fingers, then lifted them to his lips. \u201cCharming.\u201d</p><p>I sometimes forgot that Richard and I have the same British roots. His accent was slight, but definitely told of his being more upper crust than I\u2019d ever hoped to be. He\u2019d got the American accent down pretty well, but he \u2019d never completely blend in wherever he went. Not with his almost platinum hair and startling blue eyes. He \u2019d been turned vampire when he\u2019d been deeply tanned, maybe after one of his crusades. Vamp magic kept him that way and the combination was impossibly yummy. At least I\u2019d remembered to block his mind reading this time. I smiled up at him, not exactly hating the feel of his warm lips on my hand.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve moved on, Richard.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. Flo stood in the doorway to the shop. She looked brittle, the twist to her lips as close to ugly as my gorgeous roomie would ever get. I jerked my fingers out of his hand.</p> <p>\u201cFlo, Richard was helping me with a creep sent by Westwood. \u201d</p><p>Flo laughed and looked around. \u201cThe creep has crept away, I guess. Glory, your cell phone has been ringing. You might want to check your voice mail.\u201d She nodded, like\u2014 See? I didn\u2019t just come out here to spy on my ex-lover and my roomie.</p><p>\u201cFlo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarry on, cara. I couldn\u2019t care less what you do with Richard. But why you would be interested in this one when you have Blade . . .\u201d A Gaelic shrug. \u201cWhatever.\u201d She turned on her four-inch heels and went back inside. The door slammed behind her.</p><p>\u201cThat was harsh.\u201d I turned to Richard, but he was smiling, apparently not disturbed at all.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d He winked and strolled away, the picture of unconcerned male.</p> <p>Great. I got to go in to a simmering roomie and a voice mail that might be from Westwood again. I \u2019d had two since our phone chat. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d swear Westwood was hot for me. Now there was something useful. I could play along, seduce him back into coming home for a little sack action, then bam!\u2014bye, bye billionaire. I\u2019d love to see Westwood on his knees begging for his dick or his life or whatever.</p><p>I opened the back door and met Valdez\u2019s glare. I\u2019d been outside alone for exactly fifteen seconds. The lecture lasted ten times longer than that.</p><p>Ten</p><p>\"I\u2019m going alone and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade will kill us if we let you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade will just have to get over it.\u201d I stopped brushing my hair and looked at Valdez. \u201cOr he doesn\u2019t even have to know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll know.\u201d Will had been watching me get ready with interest.</p><p>When I\u2019d emerged from my bedroom dressed to kill in a leather mini and red bustier, both dogs had perked up. Because they thought we were all going out. Not.</p> <p>\u201cI can keep my lips zipped, but the doodle dog won\u2019t. He\u2019s too whipped.\u201d Will gave Valdez a look. Valdez growled, his ears flat. \u201cI\u2019ll show you whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool it, Valdez. I have a date. A date. Can you grasp the concept? It does not include taking along my pets, no matter how cute. Or protective. Or insane.\u201d</p><p>Valdez snorted. \u201cWhat do we really know about this fireman? He could be on Westwood\u2019s payroll. When he gets you alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve is an arson investigator and a mortal. I can read his mind. He doesn\u2019t wear those special glasses and he\u2019s not working for Westwood.\u201d He\u2019d come by the shop one night while I\u2019d been putting the finishing touches on pricing my new inventory. The dogs had behaved, barely. Flo had scoped him out, then dismissed him. It didn\u2019t take mind reading to know she thought mortals were too ordinary for her attention.</p><p>But I\u2019d read Steve\u2019s mind and liked what I saw. He thought I was hot and he admired the way I was putting my business back together. Worked for me. I kind of looked forward to an uncomplicated date. One where I didn\u2019t have to block my thoughts. Or take along a pooper scooper.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019re going to a club on Sixth Street, just a few blocks from here. There will be other people around.\u201d And we were going dancing. My toes tingled just thinking about it. Yeah, I did miss Blade, but he \u2019d never been much for dancing and I absolutely love it. Steve said he was into the country western thing, part of the Texas experience I \u2019d been determined to enjoy when I\u2019d moved to Austin.</p><p>The buzzer sounded. He was here. I tied a red scarf around my neck, then hit the button.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Should I come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I glanced at the dogs. \u201cI\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on record. This is a bad idea.\u201d Valdez nosed my black leather purse. \u201cTake your cell, call Mainwaring if you get in a bind. You got him on speed dial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Richard? Why not Blade? He could fly in from Africa to hold my hand. \u201d I did have Richard on speed dial. Because we\u2019d been having those computer lessons and needed to set them up. \u201cI can handle myself, Valdez. I know you and Blade don\u2019t think so, but get over it.\u201d I patted Will on the head. \u201cThanks for not nagging me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. A night off. Why would I object?\u201d He looked at Valdez. \u201cLet the doodle here obsess. I\u2019m taking a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping track of this shit, Kilpatrick. Don\u2019t be surprised if Blade docks your pay.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t about to stay and listen to the dogs yammer at each other. I grabbed my purse and shawl and headed down the stairs. Steve waited at the outside door. He was dressed in jeans and a Western shirt that showed off his lean build. The black cowboy hat looked well worn, like he might actually be a cowboy. Very cute.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Steve grinned when he saw me. \u201cYou look great.\u201d He eyed my high-heeled boots. \u201cYou sure you can dance in those?\u201d</p><p>I took his arm. \u201cHey, I danced in Vegas in heels higher than this. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We walked down the street toward the busier, rowdier section of Sixth Street where the clubs were doing a booming business. Saturday night. I was reopening my shop on Tuesday and things had come together pretty well. I\u2019d decided I deserved a night off and had jumped at the chance when Steve suggested it. Steve asked me about my gig in Vegas and I trotted out some of my better stories. By the time we got to the club, we were both laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you to drink?\u201d</p><p>There it was, the awkward moment when I had to either claim to be AA or offer to be the designated driver or something. Instead, I smiled and let him order a rum and coke for me. Why not? I didn\u2019t have to drink it and I was tired of being different. You know?</p><p>Before the drinks even arrived, we were on the dance floor. Steve was a great dancer, slow or fast. We did the Cotton -Eyed Joe, the swing, then two-stepped the perimeter of the dance floor, my fingers in Steve\u2019s belt loops, his hands warm on my shoulder and waist. The night flew by. I didn\u2019t feel a single negative vibe and I wasn\u2019t so oblivious that I didn\u2019t scan the place a time or two or three looking for thuggish men in tinted glasses. Maybe Westwood hadn\u2019t had time to replace Mitch. I didn\u2019t care. I was having fun.</p><p>I laughed off Steve\u2019s concern that the ice had melted in my drink and let him order me a second one. That one I eventually managed to exchange for an empty on another table when Steve hit the men\u2019s room. By the time the band played its last set, I felt really comfortable with Steve. Comfortable. Unfortunately, even during slow dances, with his strong arms wrapped around me, there was simply no chemistry. Not on my part, anyway.</p><p>Steve rubbed my back and nuzzled my neck when the lights were dim, but I felt nada. Well, not exactly nada. Fresh blood pulsed through Steve\u2019s veins. Hot AB negative! Smelling so utterly delicious that I had to fight to keep my fangs in.</p><p>\u201cTime to go home.\u201d I smiled and picked up my purse. I\u2019d turned off my cell phone as soon as I\u2019d left the apartment. No way was my complicated life going to intrude on this evening.</p><p>\u201cHow about breakfast? We can hit an IHOP or Denny\u2019s. My car\u2019s parked not far from here.\u201d</p><p>I stepped into the cool night air and wrapped the black shawl I\u2019d brought around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to, but I\u2019m pretty tired. Maybe another night.\u201d</p><p>Steve grinned and grabbed my hand. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear. Another night.\u201d He leaned down and kissed me. Just a sweet, getting to know you kiss. It wasn\u2019t bad. Or great. I pulled him toward my end of the street. We had about six long blocks to walk. Nothing for a vamp, but a vamp in high heeled boots . . . ? I was leaning on Steve by block three. Unfortunately he took it as encouragement.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He pulled me into a dark parking lot between two cars and pushed me against a black Lexus. Yeah, I wasn \u2019t really into the moment if I was noticing the make of car behind me, was I? He kissed me, a deeper kiss that involved tongues and hands roaming a little too freely. I couldn\u2019t blame the guy. I\u2019d been sending signals all night that I enjoyed his company. Too bad it was his dancing that turned me on. And his sure to be tasty blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled back and looked into his eyes. What I felt was bloodlust. Well, it beat the hell out of no lust at all.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d My voice was low and I had him under the whammy in seconds. He just stood there, his arms still around me while I leaned in and sniffed. I shouldn\u2019t, but who could resist clean male skin, the hint of an aftershave that I liked and that damned AB</p><p>negative? I was in before you could say, \u201cBite me.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, the taste, the heat, and that quivering down low that was damned near orgasmic. I felt him slump against me and reluctantly pulled back. The poor guy should at least be able to walk home. I licked the puncture wounds to close them then gave him a thank you kiss on his very yummy neck.</p><p>\u201cWell, look who\u2019s enjoying a little pre-dawn snack.\u201d The male voice spun me around. Familiar. The freaking voice in my head that had given me migraines.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d I disentangled myself from Steve and propped him against the Lexus. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Head clear. No headache. Feeding had given me a surge of energy, like I could conquer the world or at least this scum-sucking vampire.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me. Who the hell are you and why are you bugging me?\u201d I stepped away from the car and got into his face. Maybe not my smartest move. He was a big guy. Good looking and much too much my type. Dark hair, dark eyes, great build and a dimple in his chin. There was something about that dimple . . . He didn \u2019t touch me, just smiled like I amused him. Okay, now I was really mad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised you don\u2019t remember me. I made sure you wouldn\u2019t. Nothing like dumping a woman and then having her bugging the hell out of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I did the dumping not the other way around. This guy was obviously delusional.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you something.\u201d He grabbed my hand, strong enough that I couldn\u2019t wrench it away even though I damn sure tried.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, asshole.\u201d For the first time, I wished I\u2019d listened to Valdez. An attack dog would be mighty handy about now.</p><p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d I heard the guy\u2019s voice in my head and thought about blocking him. But I wanted to know who or what he was and what he wanted. \u201cRemember this.\u201d</p><p>I was up high, on a bed surrounded by . . . flowers. Sweet smell, but the noise! A band played a college fight song. Thousands cheered. The bed jerked and swayed its way down a corridor between skyscrapers.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNew York City, Gloriana. 1969. Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade. You and I, bed buddies.\u201d</p><p>Naked bed buddies. He laughed up at me when I sat up and pushed out my breasts. Not happening. But the sunlight, the cold, crisp air and the shouts of the crowd sure as hell felt real. So did the rush of doing the wild thing while thousands cheered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think they would stop the parade, try to arrest us.\u201d A snowflake drifted down and melted on my breast. I shivered and grabbed a blanket just as the float lurched to a stop.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to add a cop to the mix?\u201d He grinned and snatched the blanket away. \u201cYou won\u2019t need that. I can keep you hot.\u201d</p><p>Another man appeared beside the bed, this one in full uniform swinging a nightstick.</p><p>\u201cYou two are under arrest. Unless I can have a piece of that.\u201d The cop\u2019s night stick stroked my bare bum. The crowd cheered again, obviously pro-law enforcement.</p><p>\u201cNo, lover, lose the cop, you\u2019re more than enough for me.\u201d I kissed him and the policeman disappeared. The crowds groaned and the band segued into \u201cHail Britannia.\u201d \u201cOoo,\u201d I murmured when he grabbed my ass and pushed into me. \u201cYou do know how to please a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p> <p>Snow came down harder, I came harder. He was right. Who needed a blanket?</p><p>\u201cWhat does this float represent anyway?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and pointed upward. A banner waved above us. \u201cMake Love, Not War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re protesting Vietnam?\u201d Now I noticed that our headboard was a giant peace sign made of red roses and white gardenias.</p><p>\u201cGot to love the sixties, especially when a vampire flies under the draft radar.\u201d His fangs slid across my shoulder. \u201cWave at the crowd, baby. We\u2019re New York\u2019s answer to John and Yoko.\u201d</p><p>The band broke into a Beatles medley. \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The crowd sang along. A turquoise parakeet landed on the brass footboard and began preening.</p><p>\u201cYou up for a threesome?\u201d He nodded and the bird morphed into a tall brunette with disgustingly slim hips and perky C cup breasts. She was naked, of course. The crowd went wild and the band started \u201cA Little Help from My Friends.\u201d</p><p>I dove under the blanket. \u201cNo, thanks, I want you all to myself.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me up for a big kiss, then rolled me under him. I saw the bird disappear into what was practically a snowstorm. Nothing could cool off my lover, though. He surged into me again and again. Orgasm number three hit me, but who was counting?</p><p>\u201cHow long do you want this to last?\u201d he whispered against my neck. His fangs pierced me and another orgasm rocked me and the float. The band found its groove on \u201cLove Me Do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, suddenly back in a dark parking lot in Austin, Texas, in an entirely different century.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I decided we were over. Hate clingy women.\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cEven sexually adventurous ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClingy women? Me?\u201d I jerked my hand from his, my fangs full out. \u201cLike I\u2019d ever need to cling to anyone.\u201d The adventurous thing I could live with. Though the fact that I couldn\u2019t remember was a real buzz-kill. \u201cThat didn\u2019t really happen. You made it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. We had lots of special times.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWant to see another one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself.\u201d My hands were fisted and I was levitating about a foot off the ground. I kind of liked looking down at the slimeball from my past. \u201cAnd clingy? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say, so you said then.\u201d He still had a grin that I was going to smack right off of him. \u201cBut I had to be sure. That\u2019s why I did what you call the whammy. Wham, bam, thank you ma\u2019am. You never knew Greg Kaplan. Never heard of him. Never had the best sex of your life with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelusional creep.\u201d I picked him up and threw him across the parking lot. Yep, threw him. He landed on top of a silver Honda and rubbed his shoulder. The car alarm went off, but he silenced it with a look.</p><p>\u201cImpressive. That\u2019s what I call power. When I saw you on TV the night of your fire, I knew I had to look you up. I figured you never had gotten into shape-shifting, you were so freaked out by it back then. Tried it and totally wimped out. \u201d Greg grinned and looked me over. \u201cWhich is good for me now. You may not use it much, Glory, but you\u2019re a damned power gold mine.\u201d</p><p>While he\u2019d been carrying on about my power, I\u2019d been building up a head of steam.</p><p>\u201cMy power is my business, Greg. And you looked me up before the fire. I had the headache to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo someone mentioned your name. It made me think of old times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet lost, Greg.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWhy do you care about my power level anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower is valuable if you know what to do with it. Let\u2019s get together and I\u2019ll tell you about the possibilities. He actually held out his hand. \u201cI forgot how good-looking you are, Glory. We could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I was going to kill this son of a bitch. \u201cYou did the whammy on me? On me?\u201d Where the hell was a stake when you needed one?</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gloriana. You do the same thing yourself. That \u2019s what the whammy\u2019s for.\u201d He actually laughed. \u201cCheck out your midnight supper over there.\u201d</p><p>I looked around at Steve, still leaning against that Lexus and totally oblivious. \u201cI won\u2019t apologize for using it. But no one does the whammy on me. No one. You want to see my power?\u201d I saw the wooden fence on three sides of the lot and seared it. Flames shot up against the dark night sky, the wood ablaze. I turned to Greg, ready to finish him, but he was morphing into a blackbird, obviously out of there.</p><p>\u201cHot damn. The EVs will love you.\u201d Then he was gone.</p><p>Well, hell. For a moment I tried the change thing myself. I would let my inner hawk come out and take down that freaking little bird. I concentrated, felt tingling in my hands and feet and shuddered. All right now, was I going to let an asshole like Greg Kaplan call me a wimp? I stared at my hands, willing them to grow feathers. Zilch. This was silly. All vampires changed. It was a perk I should make use of. So what if I felt sick and knew if even one feather sprouted I\u2019d probably heave. I could do this. I could. So I stared at my all too humanoid hands until the world spun around me.</p><p>I glanced at Steve again. Who was I kidding? I didn\u2019t change. I was change challenged. A wimp for sure. And, oops, there was the little matter of the fire I \u2019d started. It just might spread to the buildings on either side of the lot. I came down to earth with a thump.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d I got in his face and touched his cheek. \u201cLook, the fence is on fire. Maybe you should call for backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire?\u201d Steve came alive, his eyes wide. \u201cHell, yes. What was it, lightning?\u201d</p><p>I ignored the clear skies and nodded. \u201cFreakish. Zap, and the fire started. It\u2019s spreading. I think the noise dazed you. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Steve whipped out his cell phone and began talking rapidly while he pulled me out into the street. He wobbled a little, but blamed it on the three beers he\u2019d had since he didn\u2019t have a clue he was down a quart. An interested crowd gathered. More late nighters who\u2019d danced the last dance wondered aloud what could have started the fire. Steve repeated the lightning story and got some looks. I just stayed out of the way and wished I had some of my Vintage Vamp\u2019s flyers. I know, but I\u2019m a businesswoman. I know potential customers when I see them. In minutes a fire truck pulled up and quickly got the fire under control. Steve dragged himself away from the action long enough to walk me back to the door of the apartment building. I felt bad. For the juicy kiss I gave him and the vague promise to go out with him again. I wasn\u2019t going to do it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sorry, but mortals just didn\u2019t seem to cut it for me anymore, at least not romantically. And I felt bad for doing the whammy on him earlier. Also for the temptation to do it again. Plant the suggestion that our date had been a dud. But how wimpy would that be? Now that I knew what it felt like to have your memory erased, I was really hating the whole concept. When and if Steve called, I\u2019d just have to let him down gently.</p><p>The lights were on in the shop and I saw Flo inside, a paintbrush in her hand. I unlocked the door and went inside.</p><p>\u201cWho are the EVs?\u201d</p> <p>Flo dropped the loaded paint brush and dark burgundy paint splashed across my brand new fake wood laminate flooring and her shoes.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d I ran to get a rag from the back and mopped at the floor. \u201cHere. I\u2019m going to get another rag, a bucket and some water.\u201d I thrust the rag into her hand. She was being awfully quiet and looked even paler than usual. A fact I \u2019d think about just as soon as I was sure my new floor hadn\u2019t been ruined.</p><p>Five minutes later I was satisfied that no harm had been done. I tried to sneak a peak at whatever Flo had been painting but she quickly stepped in front of me.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a surprise for your big opening night.\u201d She smiled and dropped her dirty rag in the bucket. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like what I\u2019ve done.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI hope so anyway. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll love it, whatever it is. I\u2019m thrilled you\u2019re so involved.\u201d My roomie had largely ignored my business. She likes new, the latest and most up-to-date clothes and accessories mixed with those high-priced classics she\u2019d considered worthy of saving. I like vintage, things with a history and didn\u2019t mind if they were \u201cpre-owned.\u201d We agreed to disagree.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my gift to you. I feel bad your shop was ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ruined and not your fault. Unless your new secret lover is Westwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I would hate to hurl all over your clean floor.\u201d We both laughed. Flo hurling. Her vocabulary was strictly TV sitcom.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Now back to my original question. Who are the EVs?\u201d</p><p>Flo sat on a stool and examined her manicure. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finally met my stalking vampire. The one who\u2019s been giving me the headaches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally!\u201d The chipped nail couldn\u2019t hold a candle to this kind of serious gossip. \u201cSpill, girlfriend. Why was he trying to get you naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. Exactly. Though he could definitely qualify as a sexual predator. But the worst, the absolute worst is that he \u2019d done the whammy on me. On me.\u201d I dumped the dirty water in the sink in the back room and dropped the bucket with a bang.</p><p>\u201cApparently we had a wild time together years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t remember it?\u201d Flo looked indignant. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t stand for that from a lover.\u201d She jumped off the stool. \u201cYou made him sorry, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a good start on it.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut he shape-shifted out of there before I could do any permanent damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t follow.\u201d Flo patted me on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, roomie. You have other talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kept carrying on about my stored power. Like it was something I could sell maybe. The last thing he said was that the EVs would love me.\u201d I looked Flo square in the eye. \u201cWho are the EVs and why would they love me?\u201d</p><p>Flo looked longingly at the door. I stepped in front of her. She wasn\u2019t going to escape without at least a little dish. And it was way too late for her to pretend she didn \u2019t have a clue what I was talking about. Hey, she \u2019d splashed paint on her favorite Ferragamos and she hadn\u2019t even noticed. I let her read that in my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay. I tell you what I know. The EVs are Energy Vampires. Very powerful. Special. They can take power from a vampire and make it into something else.\u201d Flo flushed. Whoa. This was rare enough to make me lean closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do they make with this power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire Viagra.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. Why would a vampire need Viagra?\u201d I\u2019d just revisited with Greg one of many sex marathons I\u2019d had with male vamps. The very idea that they needed a boost was a joke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m reading your mind. I know. Male vampires seem always hard. And can stay that way forever if they want. \u201d She made a face. \u201cSometimes you wish it wasn\u2019t so.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Yeah, lying under an inept lover who was determined to make you come but just wasn \u2019t getting the job done? A</p><p>Texas Chainsaw Massacre marathon would seem shorter.</p><p>\u201cSo explain this Vampire Viagra. Do they sell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. And it\u2019s very expensive.\u201d Flo flushed again. \u201cNot that I\u2019d ever pay for it, you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But who would?\u201d Again. Male vamps are horny toads and ever-ready.</p><p>\u201cVery old vampires. Vampires who have been and done everything, maybe thousands of times. The Vampire Viagra, it gives you a jolt, a freshness, an edge.\u201d Flo got a faraway look. She might not have paid for it, but my roomie had definitely had a Vamp Viagra experience.</p><p>\u201cSo why would the EVs love me?\u201d I sure wasn\u2019t in the market for their drug. Not only did I not need it, but I sure couldn \u2019t afford anything that Ms. Moneybags deemed expensive. My roomie thought Louis Vuitton was bargain basement.</p><p>\u201cPower, Glory. They use power to make the drug. And you have never used yours. Not much of it anyway. \u201d She touched my hand, held on for a second and shivered. \u201cI have learned how to tell . . . Well, you\u2019re full of the kind of power they need. On a scale of one to ten? Girlfriend, you\u2019re an eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Eleven. No, this had to be a joke. \u201cVamp Viagra? What next? Vamp Valium for those stressful dry spells when the Fangtastic delivery is late again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou laugh. Fine. But the EVs would love to get their hands on your power. On you. It would not be a good thing, I think.\u201d Flo bit her lip again. Obviously these EVs weren\u2019t to be taken lightly.</p><p>\u201cFlo, honey, how do you know so much about it?\u201d</p><p>We both heard the roar in front of the building at the same time. There was no mistaking the sound of a Harley. Flo actually looked relieved and dashed to the back door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell Richard about this. He doesn\u2019t like the EVs. They are on his shit list.\u201d With that she threw the dead bolts and headed out into the night. I locked the door behind her just as Richard rapped on the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out late.\u201d Okay, lame. But I was busy trying to block him from reading my whirling thoughts. Vamp Viagra, EVs, and now Flo running out of here like her panties were on fire. What was up with that?</p><p>\u201cI called your cell and it went straight to voice mail. I thought something might be wrong. \u201d Richard ran his hand through his hair. It was getting longer, giving him a rough look. The leathers he wore added to the edginess. Compared to my mortal date, he was sex on a stick.</p><p>\u201cI turned off my cell because I had a date. With the arson investigator who has our case. No progress. They don \u2019t have a clue who set the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date with a mortal you hardly know.\u201d Richard put his hands on the counter. \u201cDid you at least take the dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I wanted a night of normal, Richard. Taking along canine backup doesn\u2019t qualify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went out without protection? Are you crazy? Westwood\u2019s men\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a little credit, Richard. I knew Steve wasn\u2019t going to be a problem. He works for the fire department for crying out loud. And in the alley you saw that I can defend myself.\u201d This whole helpless Glory gig was getting really old. \u201cFlo goes out alone and no one\u2019s bugging her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo can shape-shift and escape if someone comes at her with a stake. You can\u2019t or won\u2019t.\u201d Richard leaned closer and sniffed.</p><p>\u201cNow I know why you made the date. You drank from him. Are you sleeping with him too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. And if I did sleep with him,\u201d I tried for an arch smile, \u201choney, we\u2019d still be at it now, wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s stormy blue eyes bored into me. \u201cWhat did happen tonight, Gloriana? Why are you blocking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met the vamp who\u2019s been giving me headaches. Apparently he\u2019s an old boyfriend.\u201d I still kept up the block and I could tell it was driving Richard crazy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name and why has he been bothering you? Did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you his name and I\u2019m not hurt. I told you I handled him. And as to why he\u2019s been stalking me? Why else? Once a man\u2019s had Gloriana St. Clair . . .\u201d I ran my hands down my leather skirt.</p><p>\u201cAny reason he didn\u2019t just pick up a phone?\u201d Obviously Richard wasn\u2019t buying my story.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t approach me directly before because he\u2019s always been into games.\u201d I shivered remembering just what kind of games. And I\u2019d be lying if I said his parade scenario hadn\u2019t turned me on. Until I\u2019d found out about the whammy.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. You never should have gone out alone.\u201d Richard grabbed my shoulders and looked into my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. You took a hell of a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy choice, Richard. So back off. Relax. Don\u2019t I look all right to you?\u201d I patted his cheek, determined to play this light. I liked Richard\u2019s look if not his attitude. Clean shave. Part of a nice package with the leather pants and his jacket unzipped over a red</p><p>\u201cAustin Rocks\u201d T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to relax when you\u2019re risking your life for some mortal who couldn\u2019t do more than run screaming for his mommy when that vampire came after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve didn\u2019t know anything about it. I put him under so I could . . . you know. That\u2019s when Greg came along.\u201d My cheeks went hot. Richard had already smelled the fresh blood on me. And he hadn\u2019t judged me, just figured it for foreplay. It\u2019s what vampires did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreg.\u201d Richard still held me, trying to read my mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s his last name? I might know him.\u201d His hands tightened on my shoulders.</p><p>Oops. I was definitely keeping my block up. Maybe he had heard of Greg. If the EVs were on Richard\u2019s shit list, he\u2019d obviously been investigating them and didn\u2019t like what he\u2019d discovered. Maybe I should ignore Flo\u2019s advice and pump him for info. But the way he was freaking out, I figured he\u2019d go nuts if I told him about the power issue. I just didn\u2019t feel up to the drama. So I stepped back and Richard let me go.</p><p>\u201cForget him. I let the vampire know I wasn\u2019t interested in a rerun. I handled him. By myself.\u201d I began turning off lights. \u201cI\u2019m locking up. Do you want to go upstairs for a computer lesson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Richard followed me to the door, settling my shawl around my shoulders. His fingers lingered. \u201cYou look more than all right, Gloriana. Very sexy. If this mortal male didn\u2019t try to jump you, he\u2019s a eunuch.\u201d</p><p>I turned and smiled at him. \u201cOf course, he tried. But he just didn\u2019t do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat or who does it for you, Glory?\u201d Richard brushed his thumbs across my throat, which was suddenly dry as dust. I managed a laugh. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I already do.\u201d Mr. Intensity actually grinned and stepped back. \u201cWhere are the dogs now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill upstairs. I just stopped here for a minute, to check things out.\u201d I held up my hand. \u201cAnd spare me another lecture. I\u2019m not up for it.\u201d I locked the door, set the alarm, then looked up at the clear night sky. It was a beautiful night, just a few hours until dawn. I was free for a change and hated to go inside. I glanced at Richard and let him see that last thought.</p> <p>\u201cFine. You like to live dangerously. I can relate to that. And, of course, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d He nodded toward the bike. \u201cAs you can see, the bike\u2019s fixed. I was just testing it out. Don\u2019t go inside. Go for a ride with me. In the hills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that. I really don\u2019t want to go in to all the doggy drama about how reckless I am.\u201d</p><p>Richard pulled the scarf from around my neck and carefully tied my hair back at the nape of my neck. He studied me for a moment, his eyes gleaming in the light from Mugs and Muffins. \u201cIt was reckless. A mortal couldn\u2019t protect you. And Westwood still has men out there. I encountered one earlier tonight here in the coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? Right next door?\u201d Westwood\u2019s man calmly drinking coffee only a few feet away? Holy crap. \u201cWhat was he planning to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a can of spray paint and a wooden stake in his backpack. He was composing a message when I found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. Probably something like, \u2018Die, vampires\u2019 across my new windows and freshly cleaned brick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, something along those lines.\u201d Richard looked grim.</p><p>Graffiti I could deal with, though it pissed me off. But the stake . . . I shuddered. Westwood had claimed to want to take me out himself, but that boast could have been designed to lull me into a false sense of security.</p><p>\u201cNow you see why I was worried about you.\u201d Richard gripped my elbow and urged me toward the bike. \u201cGet on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. How did you handle the Westwood goon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d He got on the bike and started it with a roar. No talk of helmets of course. Why bother? That healing vamp sleep could take care of any injury short of decapitation.</p><p>I let his reticence slide for the moment. While I wasn\u2019t exactly dressed for a bike ride, I didn\u2019t want to miss the chance to feel the wind in my hair. My leather mini was cute, but tight. When I straddled the bike, I\u2019d be showing some serious thigh. Chubby thigh at that.</p><p>\u201cClimb on carefully. The tail pipes get hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve ridden on the back of a bike before.\u201d And I had, though it had been decades. And I\u2019d loved it, feeling wild and free. What the heck. With more energy than grace, I managed to get on, then grabbed Richard\u2019s firm middle. He took off with a roar and I leaned against him and held on tight.</p> <p>Austin\u2019s in what Texans call the hill country. Some of those hills are right in town and very steep. The cold air felt great on my cheeks as we flew up and down, a windy roller-coaster ride. I rubbed my cheek against Richard\u2019s strong back and probed his mind. He finally let me see how he\u2019d dealt with the Westwood man. It wasn\u2019t pretty. And Richard the former priest felt compelled to pray for forgiveness. He hadn\u2019t intended to take a life, but when a man comes at you with a stake . . . I gave Richard a reassuring squeeze and whispered in his mind. \u201cYou did a good thing, Richard. Self-defense. If that man had a vamp detector, he could have staked me or Flo if he\u2019d gotten away.\u201d</p><p>He pulled to a stop on a hilltop. When he cut the engine, it was wonderfully quiet. Peaceful. Richard got off the motorcycle then held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gloriana. I knew what I did was necessary. But it never gets easy.\u201d</p><p>I hopped off with even less finesse than I\u2019d got on with. \u201cI understand, Richard. And I\u2019m grateful.\u201d I turned and looked at the lights of the city spread out below us. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night. Let\u2019s try to forget vamp hunters and enjoy the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the view.\u201d Richard put his arm around me, his eyes on the swells of plump breasts above my bustier. Hey, showing cleavage is in style. Compared to some of the stars on the TV shows I watch, I was dressed like a nun. Nope, not even thinking about the fact that Richard had once been a priest.</p><p>\u201cOut there, Richard. Aren\u2019t the lights beautiful?\u201d We both took a minute to just appreciate the skyline of Austin. Okay, so I also appreciated the vibe between us. I\u2019d had a hellacious night. First biting an innocent mortal, a nice guy, when I really didn\u2019t want to be that kind of user vampire. Then Greg Kaplan had cornered me. Oops. I\u2019d almost forgotten to block Richard. He just looked at me, all dangerous male and intensity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m attracted to you, Gloriana.\u201d He brushed my hair back from my cheeks. \u201cI think we could be good together.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Talk about a subject change. His fingers were rough on my skin, but I couldn \u2019t deny that the chemistry so missing with firefighter Steve, was definitely alive and well here. Hey, a kiss couldn \u2019t hurt. I pulled his head down and planted one on him. It quickly turned into him planting one on me.</p><p>Oh, my. Oh, crap. This could definitely lead to a whole lot more. Could I do this? What about Blade? Forget Blade. Richard cupped my breast and I realized the naughty girl had escaped from my bustier.</p><p>He bent his head to trace my nipple, his fangs brushing the tip over and over until I moaned and held his head to me. Damn, but he was good at this. He eased me down on the ground. A rock stuck me right between my shoulder blades. I moaned louder, pain this time.</p><p>\u201cRichard.\u201d I shoved at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Am I moving too fast for you, Glory?\u201d He looked up, his fangs gleaming in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, yes, I mean, rock!\u201d I sat up and threw the damn boulder across the clearing. Which gave me time to think. What was I doing here making out with Richard?</p><p>\u201cRelax, Glory. Just lie back and look at the stars.\u201d Richard pulled off his jacket and spread it out behind me. Stargazing? I let him ease me back and sighed at the beauty of the star -dusted night sky. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Richard.\u201d I grabbed his hand when it roamed up my thigh. \u201cThis is moving too fast for me.\u201d</p><p>Richard stared down at me. \u201cI get it. You\u2019ve been with Blade. I\u2019ve been with Florence. But unless you\u2019re exclusive . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Or maybe it is.\u201d I tucked both breasts back into my top. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s close to dawn and the dogs will be going nuts. I need to get home.\u201d</p><p>Richard stood and pulled me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cAnother night.\u201d Richard kissed me, but it was quickly obvious to me, anyway, that the moment had passed. I\u2019d remembered a few things about him, he\u2019d probably remembered a few things about me. Maybe someday we\u2019d both be ready for something more. His kiss deepened. I held onto him, appreciating his broad shoulders, the slow glide of his tongue against mine. Maybe someday</p><p>A bird sang and I jumped and quickly scanned the area. If it was a certain blackbird . . . But sometimes a bird is just a bird and a reminder that false dawn had come, warning us that we were running out of time. Hey, there would be other nights. Richard smiled, obviously getting the message loud and clear.</p><p>I got back on the bike and we spoiled the quiet night with the roar of the Harley. I held on as we zoomed down the hills toward home. The sky was getting lighter by the minute. By the time I got home, I \u2019d literally have to jump into bed. At my door, I offered Richard my couch, but he took one look at my sulking dogs and assured me he\u2019d make it home in time. I was tempted to go with, especially when Valdez quit sulking and started lecturing.</p><p>\"Opening night. Finally.\u201d I looked around. Except for the sheet that Flo had insisted stay in front of the back wall until the</p><p>\u201cunveiling,\u201d things looked good. Better than they had before the fire actually.</p><p>\u201cWe throw open the doors at midnight. Right?\u201d Lacy was pumped and, even though she was usually my day manager, she\u2019d insisted on being here for this.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d A knock on the door signaled some early birds. Valdez and Will gave a token bark, but they were still sulking about my night without them. They settled back down on either side of the door, two frowning, furry foo dogs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s CiCi, Frederick and Derek.\u201d I let them in and swapped hugs all around. The Countess Cecilia von Repsdorf and her son had been great friends of mine for years. Since I \u2019d moved to Austin, they\u2019d practically adopted me. Derek, Freddy\u2019s partner, worked in the shop some nights. They were all vampires, of course.</p><p>CiCi had consigned some beautiful pieces from her vast collection of what her son called junk. She \u2019d been furious that most of her porcelain and art glass pieces had been destroyed in the fire. Fortunately, a trip to her attic had refilled the shelves and we were good to go. But if Westwood ever crossed her path, she\u2019d vowed to end up wearing his eyeteeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDarling, the store looks wonderful.\u201d Cici walked over to a shelf to adjust a winged cherub. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will sell, sell, sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will, Mother.\u201d Frederick dropped a kiss on my cheek. \u201cI have some more clothes for you in the trunk of my car. Old tuxes, a cashmere coat with a mink collar that I really don\u2019t need in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwinkie,\u201d Will muttered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Derek was nose to nose with the dog before I could step between them.</p><p>\u201cWill . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to the doodle here. Valdez. You know how he is about his treats.\u201d Will backed up, his tail between his legs. I didn\u2019t blame him. Derek\u2019s fangs glinted in the light from the vintage chandeliers I\u2019d had hung around the shop and he must have seriously worked out in his mortal lifetime.</p><p>\u201cSounded to me like a slur.\u201d Derek glanced at Freddy. \u201cI won\u2019t stand for it. Especially not from you, dog breath.\u201d He poked Will in the shoulder.</p><p>Will growled and showed his own canines. \u201cYou want to take this outside?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool it, boys. Sounds like a simple misunderstanding.\u201d I gave Will a \u201cshut-the-hell-up\u201d look. \u201cFreddy\u2019s coat sounds fabulous.\u201d I put a hand on Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou want to bring the clothes in?\u201d</p><p>Derek gave Will one more look, then shrugged. \u201cSure. Anything to help the shop get going. I need this job. \u201d He ignored Freddy\u2019s snort. It was no secret that his partner would have happily supported Derek forever. But Derek was a lot like me. He didn\u2019t like to be totally dependent on anyone. His commissions at the shop gave him a much needed freedom from an allowance.</p><p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019m just happy you didn\u2019t hook up with someone else while I was out of business.\u201d I glanced at Freddy. Poor choice of words. Handsome, rich Freddy was more insecure than you\u2019d expect from a man with his assets. But then he\u2019d only been out of the closet a few decades. His earlier liaisons had all ended badly. Hey, I got it. I squeezed his arm and looked at the clock.</p><p>\u201cBring it in later, Derek. It\u2019s almost time to open the doors.\u201d</p><p>Derek nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you first.\u201d He dug into his leather messenger bag and pulled out his laptop. He was one of those techno-geeks, not surprising since he hadn\u2019t been a vampire for even half a century. He\u2019d put my inventory on computer when I\u2019d first opened the shop.</p><p>\u201cSomething on the laptop?\u201d I gestured toward the counter. \u201cI\u2019ve updated our inventory on my new computer.\u201d Translation: I\u2019d done a lot of deleting. Thank God Derek had got us all in the habit of downloading everything on a flash drive each morning. A flash drive I\u2019d had tucked in my purse upstairs the day of the fire. Boy, had I been relieved to remember that detail.</p> <p>\u201cA grand opening present.\u201d Derek whipped open the laptop and set it on the counter. \u201cGather around everyone.\u201d He booted it up and began typing. \u201cVoil\u00e0. Vintagevamp shop.com.\u201d</p><p>A Web site popped up on the screen. There it was, my shop. Or at least a photo of my shop at night. And all sorts of options including a shopping cart. Derek clicked on an icon and the Chanel suit I so adored came up, complete with price.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! This is so cool.\u201d I hugged him and stepped back so everyone could take a look.</p><p>\u201cI tried to get Vintagevamps.com but it was taken. And who can spell emporium? I hope this is all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right? Are you kidding?\u201d I hugged him again, then clicked on another icon. CiCi\u2019s porcelain cherub appeared. Sold, too, apparently, and at a great price. \u201cWhen did you get this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days ago. I\u2019ll have to show you how to access your PayPal account. We\u2019ve already sold a few pieces.\u201d He took the cherub off the shelf. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the shipping and everything if I can have a commission on what we sell online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I was elated. A mantel clock Lacy had picked up at an estate sale chimed twelve and she threw open the doors. Flyers had gone out over the weekend and, even though it was 12:01 on a Tuesday morning, a massive crowd of three shoppers surged through the door.</p><p>\u201cI love that poodle skirt in the window. My husband\u2019s lodge is having a fifties dance. That would be perfect.\u201d A woman with a name tag from a local supermarket had obviously just gotten off work.</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d Flo had been pretty quiet, but now she was determined to have center stage. She looked great in a blue cashmere sweater and Seven jeans with her high-heeled Christian Dior boots. She tossed her dark hair over her shoulder and stared until everyone, including the mortals, focused on her.</p><p>\u201cAre we finally going to get to see what you\u2019ve been painting?\u201d I moved closer and grabbed my roomie\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying of curiosity.\u201d</p><p>Lacy made a sound. Was she choking or\u2014oh, my God\u2014laughing? I braced myself. I\u2019d had no idea that Flo even knew how to paint. Though she\u2019d certainly had her share of artist lovers. All of them famous. Wouldn \u2019t it be cool if she\u2019d copied her lover Leonardo\u2019s Mona Lisa on the wall? No, scratch that. Flo hated Lisa and kept insisting she had been a he. Flo\u2019s version would probably include a mustache.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen. Welcome to Vintage Vamp\u2019s.\u201d Flo paused for dramatic effect and I braced myself. She ripped down the sheet.</p><p>The room was silent. Well, almost. Poodle Skirt Lady gasped and dropped a vintage twin set.</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d CiCi looked at me, then at Flo. \u201cWhy I had no idea, Florence, dear, that you had such hidden talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they should have stayed hidden.\u201d Valdez nudged my hip. \u201cSay something, Blondie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s fabulous.\u201d</p><p>Flo broke into a smile. \u201cI learned to paint this way from my dear lover Edvard. I thought it was just what this wall needed. For a place called Vintage Vamp\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdvard Munch?\u201d One of the mortals, a tall woman who looked like she\u2019d just left a trendy cocktail party, frowned. \u201cBut he\u2019s been dead for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Frederick was beside her in a flash, literally. He nodded and Derek and CiCi handled the other two mortals. I may not be fond of the whammy anymore, but here it was a necessary evil. Had to feel sorry for the mortals, though, standing there with vacant eyes and gaping mouths, barely breathing mannequins.</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s been dead for over a century. The fool wouldn\u2019t let me turn him. \u2018Why live forever,\u2019 he would say, \u2018When life is so painful?\u2019 He was always sad. I think I only saw him laugh a few times. Sexy of course or I wouldn \u2019t have bothered with him.\u201d</p><p>Flo stared at the painting with a wistful smile. \u201cMaybe I should add more yellow. Edvard\u2019s paintings were pretty gloomy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. His work wasn\u2019t exactly a laugh riot.\u201d Will stared at the wall, apparently feeling free to chime in since the mortals were out of action, Lacy had locked the door again and Derek was ignoring him. \u201cYou did a good job. I recognized it immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m surprised you know it.\u201d Flo hadn\u2019t exactly fallen in love with Will, not when he\u2019d dragged one of her Ferragamo slides out of her closet. No damage or we\u2019d be talking dead dog here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen some of his work.\u201d Will looked over at Valdez\u2019s snort. \u201cAn artistic girlfriend who liked museums. This looks like a combo platter, half The Scream, half Vampire.\u201d He turned to Flo. \u201cAnd all cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, William.\u201d Flo pushed his head away when he nudged her butt. Then she looked around uncertainly. \u201cIs it too .</p><p>. . dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Derek shook his head. \u201cHey, let\u2019s see what mortals think, I figure it \u2019ll be unique to this shop. A conversation piece. Maybe I should take a picture of it and put it on the Web site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a great job, Flo. This looks completely professional. \u201d I stepped closer. The female vamp had flowing red hair and leaned over a man. She looked on the verge of taking a bite. It was weird but, in its own way, beautiful. Now the screamer was a different story. Mouth open, he was probably horrified by the pair occupying the other half of the wall. He stood on a bridge, probably ready to jump because he had this really freaky looking alien head.</p><p>\u201cIt was fun. I may paint again.\u201d Flo looked around the shop.</p><p>I had visions of a shop slash spook house that would make a horror director weak with envy. I had to head that off at the pass.</p><p>\u201cWe should hit an art supply store. Maybe you\u2019d like to try your hand at a picture, something smaller to hang on the wall upstairs. Maybe a self-portrait. The vampire in this looks familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, of course, though why Edvard wouldn\u2019t paint in my face, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Flo wrinkled her perfect nose. \u201cHe said I was beautiful, but then he gave my hair red highlights. Do you see red in my hair? Pah! I think he lied when he said it had something to do with the composition. He had a redheaded lover after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the color draws attention to the vampire. Makes her the star.\u201d Freddy grinned when Flo made one of her Italian gestures.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. I swear this looks just like his stuff. I have a print of Vampire in my study.\u201d He\u2019d been walking from one end of the wall to the other. \u201cMunch was a little twisted, but brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Edvard. So tortured. I cheered him up for a little while, but it didn \u2019t last.\u201d Flo made a dismissive gesture with her hands. \u201cI moved on.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door. More customers. Which was a good thing. I glanced at the wall. Derek was right. As a conversation piece, this was a doozy. I sent a mental message all around and we jumped back into place. The mortals snapped out of it, back on the scene as if they\u2019d never moved from the spot when they\u2019d first seen the painting. They were exclaiming over it when Lacy opened the door again and two men in their early twenties pushed inside. Richard was right behind them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d He smiled at me, then walked over to look at the wall. \u201cFlorence, you\u2019ve certainly picked up a trick or two in the years you\u2019ve been\u201d\u2014he glanced at the mortals\u2014 \u201cstudying the great artists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, Richard.\u201d Flo picked up her black leather jacket and slipped into it. \u201cGood luck with your opening, Glory. I have a date. I won\u2019t be back tonight.\u201d She smiled at the group and headed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little worried about her.\u201d Lacy was at my elbow. \u201cHave you met her new man?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual, though. She kept Richard a secret for a while. Seems like we met him just before she dumped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s weird. She won\u2019t even talk about this new guy. And we got pretty close while she was working on \u201d\u2014a sweeping gesture toward the wall\u2014\u201cthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorence always has a new man. He won\u2019t last, none of her men do.\u201d Richard strolled over to Freddy and they soon had their heads together at the laptop discussing the new Web site.</p><p>I was doing my best not to stare at Richard\u2019s butt in worn denims that hugged his muscular thighs. For a second there, I\u2019d almost felt sorry for him, the most recent in a long, long line of Florence rejects.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t heard the Harley roar up so maybe he\u2019d flown or driven in. That was the thing with dating a vampire. They could do and be just about anything. Hold it. Not dating. Paying off a debt. Friends. That\u2019s all. Okay, okay, friends with . . . benefits. Like rolling on the ground playing tonsil hockey. Hmm. I checked out his taut butt again. With benefits like those, who needed a relationship?</p> <p>Especially one as complicated as mine was with Blade.</p><p>I glanced back at Flo\u2019s mural. Maybe highlighting the vamp thing wasn\u2019t smart, but it was definitely interesting. The artsy looking woman was talking on her cell phone and I heard her say \u201camazing painting.\u201d Good. Maybe her friend would rush right over and find something to buy while she was here.</p><p>The poodle skirt lady had talked Derek into undressing the mannequin in the window and headed for the dressing room. CiCi was showing a bronze to one of the men when the bells on the front door rang. Another man came inside. I froze. Tinted glasses. But I got closer and relaxed when I could read his mind. He was following the hot guys he\u2019d met at a bar down the street. He was also into butts and hot guy number one had some sweet cheeks. Then he spotted an Armani jacket and was hooked on my \u201ccool\u201d shop. No Westwood thoughts from him at all. I smiled and rang up my first sale, that bronze CiCi had consigned. All right. We were back in business.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\"I tell you, honeybunch, that wall is giving me night-mares. \u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Ghosts don\u2019t sleep. Do they?\u201d I was deep into an argument with my resident ghosts forty-eight hours after our grand opening. Emmie Lou hated Flo\u2019s painting and, since I was alone in the shop with just the dogs, she\u2019d come out to speak her piece.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I mean. How would you like to stare at that thing all day and all night? That screaming skull. And, honey, you know I love vampires, but that picture\u2019s just flat creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s art. The customers love it.\u201d And they did. Even wanted to take pictures of it. I\u2019d had Flo sign her name to it to make it clear that this was just a depiction, not a forgery. It took some prodding, but she\u2019d finally printed in da Vinci just big enough to cause even more comment. Can\u2019t read or write? I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cLet her count her money, Emmie Lou. You know she ain\u2019t gonna paint over that mural. People\u2019ve done nothing but talk about it since the place opened up again.\u201d Harvey hitched up his britches and stepped closer to the vampire section of the wall. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of sexy, the way she\u2019s biting him right there.\u201d He looked meaningfully at Emmie Lou\u2019s neck. \u201cYou used to like a little nibble, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNibble this, Harvey Nutt.\u201d Emmie took a swing at him with one of Flo\u2019s purses and an alligator bag sailed across the room.</p><p>\u201cCool it, you two. And don\u2019t throw the merchandise.\u201d I rescued the purse and put it back on a shelf. I\u2019d locked the door at five a.m. after sending everyone off so I could count the night \u2019s receipts. This was typically our dead time. Oops. Okay, maybe it\u2019s always dead time for a vampire. But in a business sense, there wasn\u2019t much happening. At six, when Lacy came in, we usually got a few night workers as they came off their shifts.</p><p>\u201cSorry, honey. Earlier it did look like your business was booming again.\u201d Emmie Lou turned her back to the painting. \u201cGlad of that. I sure didn\u2019t want to go back to the days of biker bars or tattoo parlors. Between the smoke and the loud music, honey, we were in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a great start.\u201d I looked up at the tap on the door. Hmm. The dogs growled and started barking. I thought Valdez was going to go through the safety glass. I moved closer.</p><p>\u201cStop it. I know this guy.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Kaplan grinned at me and gestured, like, let me in. Probably not a good idea, but I wanted to talk to him. Ask him about the EVs since I\u2019d got a little of nothing from Flo. And, yeah, it bugged the hell out of me that I couldn \u2019t remember our affair. I wanted details. How long had we been together? Why had we been together? I didn\u2019t doubt the dogs would make quick work of Greg if he threatened me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Blondie. This is the asshole who gave you the headaches.\u201d Valdez growled again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to do that again, are you, Greg?\u201d I yelled this through the door and Greg nodded, then crossed his heart. \u201cIf he does, you have my permission to rip him a new one, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d Will glanced at Valdez. \u201cIt\u2019s about time we saw some action. I say she lets him in. If you can\u2019t handle him,</p><p>I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day I can\u2019t take out a loser like that, is the day I turn in my flea collar.\u201d Valdez gave Greg the eye through the glass and showed some teeth.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m letting him in. But I don\u2019t need your permission. Just stay on high alert. I may decide he needs a hurt put on him. For past insults.\u201d Emmie Lou and Harvey had vanished, but were probably still lurking about. They didn\u2019t miss anything and also liked to do some damage when they felt I was being mistreated.</p><p>Feeling like I had backup out the whazoo, I flipped open the dead bolts and let Greg in along with the cold night air. Austin had had a cold front, and the temperature was hovering around forty degrees, about twenty lower than on my date night. Texas weather. Nowhere close to the snow weather during the parade when I\u2019d had some of the best sex . . .</p><p>\u201cStop it, Greg. You\u2019re planting memories again.\u201d This time I threw up a block. We were going to communicate like mortals, with voices and body language, or not at all.</p><p>\u201cYou heard her, asshole. I\u2019m watching you.\u201d Valdez growled for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both watching you.\u201d Will growled even louder and I shot him a dirty look to keep things from deteriorating into a contest.</p><p>\u201cSorry, okay? I just wanted to talk, maybe shop a little.\u201d Greg studied the dogs. \u201cGlory, anybody ever tell you that you keep weird company? What\u2019s with the talking dogs?\u201d He sniffed the air. \u201cWho aren\u2019t really dogs.\u201d</p><p>Will snarled and Valdez grabbed a chunk of Greg\u2019s jeans.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my bodyguards. Since I didn\u2019t whammy you, you should remember that I always had a dog with me, a Valdez to guard me. Now I\u2019ve got two. So I\u2019d be careful about insulting them. They take their job seriously.\u201d I loved the way Greg had gone pale.</p><p>\u201cNice doggies. Please let go of my pants.\u201d Greg shot me a frantic look.</p><p>\u201cOkay, guys. You\u2019ve made your point. Let him go, but be ready in case this freak tries his mind control tricks again. These men can and will read your mind, Greg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen?\u201d Greg flinched when Valdez tugged and his jeans ripped. \u201cSorry, I get it.\u201d He held up his hands in surrender. \u201cYou have my utmost respect, both of you.\u201d</p><p>Valdez reluctantly released the fabric, leaving a damp spot on Greg\u2019s hem.</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d Greg stuck his hands in his pockets. \u201cI guess I\u2019m in the right place to buy new jeans. I\u2019ve heard you have an interesting shop. You always were into clothes.\u201d He smiled and strolled around. \u201cThat\u2019s where I met you. At a sale at Bloomingdale\u2019s. I was shopping with a girlfriend, but once I saw you, I dropped her like a bad habit.\u201d He grinned and winked, obviously expecting me to be flattered.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not the only lucky lady you dumped. You wipe her memory too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Greg wasn\u2019t stupid. He could tell I was on the verge of doing something violent. I let him see it in my eyes. \u201cCome on, Glory. Ancient history.\u201d He stopped in front of Flo\u2019s mural and whistled. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d He glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cGutsy, putting the vampire thing right out there. On the sign out front and now on the wall. I remember what you used to call it, blending. When did you stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still blending. A vamp was a sexy chick during the roaring twenties. \u201d I did a hair toss. \u201cKind of like me back in the day. Mortals don\u2019t have a clue it could mean anything else and I make a decent living. \u201d I remembered just how decent and carefully locked the night\u2019s receipts in the safe under the counter. When I tore the paper off the printing calculator, I took a moment to admire the total.</p><p>\u201cThey have a clue now.\u201d Greg gestured toward Flo\u2019s mural. \u201cBut I\u2019m impressed. I guess you have people who handle days for you.\u201d Greg stopped next to a rack of vintage jeans and checked a price tag. \u201cGood deal.\u201d</p><p>What was I doing having a civilized conversation with this creep? He\u2019d whammied me, given me headaches, even tried to get me outside and naked. I gave Valdez a look and he moved closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Greg moved on to the suit rack and fingered one of Freddy\u2019s tuxes. \u201cNice. Custom tailored.\u201d He glanced at the tag. \u201cAnd my size.\u201d He dropped the tag. \u201cIf I buy this, will you go out with me? Thanksgiving \u2019s coming up. This isn\u2019t New York, but I imagine Austin has a parade of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d I threw Flo\u2019s alligator bag at his head but he ducked and it landed next to the book shelf. With this kind of abuse, I was going to have to mark that purse down. That stirred my temper even more.</p><p>\u201cGlory, Glory, get over it, darling. Where\u2019s your famous sense of humor? We had a lot of laughs in New York.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI lost my sense of humor when I lost my memory.\u201d I picked up an oversized leather tote and swung it over my head like David getting ready to chuck a rock at Goliath. Greg slid behind a rack. I \u2019d really like to whack him, but there were just too many breakables around to take a chance. I dropped the bag with a thump.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Greg grinned. \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve. Dancing at a fancy place. I remember you doing a mean twist.\u201d He pulled out a blue sixties cocktail dress with a chiffon skirt. \u201cCome on, Glory. You\u2019d look a treat in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your grubby paws off the merchandise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I made some great moves. On and off the dance floor.\u201d Greg moved closer and Valdez growled. \u201cCall off the attack dogs and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attack dogs stay on.\u201d I made sure my block was firmly in place. \u201cTell me why you\u2019ve been stalking me or move your butt out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Greg glanced at the dogs. \u201cI\u2019d like you to go somewhere with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to a Wal-Mart with you, Gregory.\u201d I decided to play it cool and began to rearrange a display of vintage necklaces.</p><p>\u201cCome on, give me a break. I never should have wiped away your memory. But what \u2019s done is done.\u201d Greg picked up a rhinestone tiara and dropped it on his head. \u201cWe had some great times. You should remember the night we went out as two girlfriends. Halloween in Times Square. I made a hot chick, if I do say so myself. \u201d He swayed around a rack of vintage scarves, then draped one around his neck. \u201cAlmost as hot as you.\u201d</p><p>Will snorted and muttered something about lace on Greg\u2019s panties.</p><p>\u201cListen, hound, a man who\u2019s sure of his masculinity doesn \u2019t worry about crap like that. Glory can tell you I don \u2019t wear underwear.\u201d A sly grin. \u201cEasy access.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGag me. And no, Glory can\u2019t tell Will anything. Because Glory can\u2019t remember.\u201d I threw down the necklaces. So much for playing it cool. \u201cBut I do remember what you said Saturday night. You said the EVs would love me.\u201d Greg frowned. \u201cWhat do you have to do with the EVs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou misheard, obviously. What\u2019s an EV? A new cell phone provider?\u201d Greg whipped out a snappy new Razr phone. \u201cMy provider\u2019s not worth shit. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many dropped calls I get.\u201d He held up the phone and I\u2019ll be damned if he didn\u2019t take my picture.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d I grabbed the phone. \u201cWhat do you need with my picture?\u201d Was this really a phone? I looked it over. Of course it was. Only Westwood had a cell phone that could identify vampires. Greg wouldn\u2019t need a detector, he could smell us. Just like I could smell him, though there was something off about his essence. Like he\u2019d fed recently, but not on mortal blood or Fangtastic.</p><p>\u201cI was just playing, Gloriana. And why wouldn\u2019t I want a picture of you? For my memory book.\u201d</p><p>Now both Valdez and Will snorted. This was not good. They were dismissing Greg as a harmless flake. I knew better. He grinned at me, his fangs gleaming in the light. I read his mind and saw memories of Greg juggling stakes and throwing one at me. Missing on purpose, of course, but I\u2019d carried on for hours, claiming he\u2019d been trying to kill me. His eyes narrowed and I felt a bad vibe from my head to my heart. If I crossed him now, I didn\u2019t doubt he\u2019d take me out without a second thought. The fact that my dogs would make sure he didn\u2019t live long after that wasn\u2019t exactly comforting.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Glory. I wouldn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d He threw on his Greg the nice guy look again. But I didn\u2019t trust it, didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you trying to reassure me with your cute little memories? Or maybe I\u2019m supposed to be grateful that you didn\u2019t kill me when you had the chance.\u201d I grabbed a pencil and moved closer, aiming for his so-called heart. \u201cQuit playing dumb. The EVs want my power? Are you working for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Greg picked up a Sevres porcelain and held it up. \u201cPut down the so-called weapon, Glory, or I drop this\u201d\u2014he glanced at the tag\u2014\u201cfive hundred dollar tribute to spring.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThink it will break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. And a pencil\u2019s not a weapon. This,\u201d I picked up the wooden stool we kept behind the counter. \u201cThis might do some damage. I could heave it at your head. Think it will break? The stool, that is. Or maybe it\u2019ll just knock you out long enough for me to rip off a wooden leg and ram it into the region where your heart is supposed to be.\u201d I smiled and held the stool over my head. I had to love the fact that Greg backed up a foot. He acted like I was making him nervous and put the porcelain back where it belonged.</p> <p>I probed his mind again, but he\u2019d slammed it shut. He was humoring me, trying to lull me into relaxing my guard. Wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>I balanced the stool on one finger. Will whistled and even Valdez looked impressed. I did have a lot of stored power. Four centuries worth of it. The fact that I hardly ever used it was my own fault. Too much blending, not enough vamping. I eased the stool back to the floor and picked up an African fertility god, carved from a piece of beautiful dark mahogany. You wouldn \u2019t believe who\u2019d consigned it. Who knew were-zebras even existed? I gripped it tighter.</p><p>\u201cAnswer my questions, Gregory.\u201d I glanced at the god with the enormous phallus, nicely pointed. \u201cThis is the perfect way to end your worthless life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory.\u201d Greg made a vamp move toward the door. My dogs sat up straight, teeth bared. I heard the dead bolts whisk shut. Greg looked from the dogs back to me. \u201cNo need for violence here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen answer me. And don\u2019t try to shape-shift. Your little birdie would make a tasty snack for Valdez. He needs some protein.\u201d</p><p>Valdez smacked his lips on cue.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I work for the EVs. They\u2019d like to meet you. No big deal.\u201d Greg backed away from the dogs.</p><p>\u201cWuss,\u201d Will muttered.</p><p>I gave him a look. No need to get Greg worked up to prove his macho.</p><p>\u201cI think meeting the EVs would be a big deal. I think they want more from me than a little chat. \u201d I gripped the wooden statue. What had I ever seen in Gregory Kaplan? Sure, he was good looking, but there was something missing. Like a moral compass. I could see that in his eyes, now that I really looked. He\u2019d do anything to get what he wanted. Anything. Obviously I\u2019d made a big mistake ever hooking up with him. But it had been the sixties. Free love and all that. And I was starting to remember how cute he\u2019d looked in a Nehru jacket. Nope, not going there. He was not cute, he was dangerous as hell, despite the \u201cscared of Glory\u201d act.</p><p>\u201cPower, Glory. You wouldn\u2019t believe what the EVs can do with it. Try it. Give them a little of your stuff and then sample their product.\u201d Greg got a faraway look for a second, then quickly focused again. \u201cYou\u2019ll realize it\u2019s well worth whatever they have to do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever they\u2019d do to me? To make Vampire Viagra?\u201d Oh, God, both dogs had perked up at that. \u201cYou two forget you ever heard this conversation. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Valdez settled back down, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t forget a thing. He never did. This would be in his next report to Blade.</p><p>Will paced in front of the glass windows. \u201cThis is why I need money so badly that I do dog duty. Expensive, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Greg smiled at me. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m working for them? I\u2019m not paid in cash, I\u2019m paid in VV.\u201d He stared at Will. \u201cYou should try it. The rush is unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t need help in that department.\u201d Will gave Valdez a look when he snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve had no complaints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about that. Hell, I could break bricks with my cock when it \u2019s in ready position without the VV.\u201d Greg gave me a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry you can\u2019t remember that, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Spare me.\u201d I had a feeling the male bragging could go on and on. \u201cBut the next time I need to break a brick, I\u2019ll be sure to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Glory, it\u2019s a pleasure enhancer. For women as well as men. Honey, it\u2019s like comparing a wave to a tsunami.\u201d</p><p>I let that thought wash over me. \u201cSo instead of a big O, I\u2019d get a giant one.\u201d I had to smile, men can be such idiots.</p><p>\u201cLots of giant ones.\u201d Greg focused on Will, obviously sensing a potential customer. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re an old vampire. Son, you have no idea what pleasure there is still to be had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the sales pitch, Greg.\u201d I didn\u2019t like this, didn\u2019t like the look in Will\u2019s squinty green eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give the EVs any of my power. You can tell them that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory. Maybe you should consider\u2014Ow!\u201d Will looked back to where Valdez had taken a chunk out of his tail.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting who we work for, son. Our job here. Glory\u2019s not going within a hundred miles of an EV.\u201d</p><p>Valdez spit out fur.</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s already much closer to them than she thinks. Maybe she should ask her roommate about the EVs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, I have. What does Flo have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Ms. Florence da Vinci.\u201d Greg laughed. \u201cGot to love that name. And she paints too.\u201d He strolled to the door. \u201cCan I leave now? I\u2019ll give them the message. Can\u2019t say they\u2019ll like it, but hopefully they won\u2019t kill the messenger.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Greg looked awfully calm for a man who had just failed in a mission for what amounted to vampire drug dealers. He gave me a wry smile, obviously not needing to read my mind to see what I thought.</p><p>\u201cBe warned, Gloriana. The EVs are drug dealers, ruthless ones. They\u2019ll do anything to get what they want. If I didn\u2019t think I could still be useful to them, I\u2019d be three states away by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree states away is about right.\u201d I kept up my brave front, but I was seriously creeped out. Bad enough Westwood wanted me dead, now Energy Vampires wanted my power. What next? Pirates after my earring collection?</p> <p>\u201cGet out, Greg. Do us all a favor and never come back here again.\u201d I nodded and Will and Valdez moved out of the way. Greg turned the dead bolt and then gave me a last lingering look.</p><p>\u201cBig mistake. Think about it, Glory. Vamp Viagra could take you to a whole new level. You \u2019ve been settling, babe. Trust me, the sex, the sensations, you\u2019ll never forget them. Even better than New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you? Sure. Like I\u2019d trust Valdez next to an open bag of Cheetos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about, gorgeous, but think about what I said. The VV could change your life. \u201d He winked and was gone.</p><p>\u201cCreep.\u201d Valdez moved closer. \u201cI\u2019m definitely telling Blade about this and you can\u2019t stop me. Especially after that Cheetos slam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, bud, I was just making a point. Be a tattletale. Nothing new there. But did you see me handle Greg?\u201d I stomped back to the counter and my pile of necklaces. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, we\u2019re all okay. Problem solved.\u201d If only. This was so not fair. Surely there were other vamps, other sources for this power the EVs were so hungry for. Valdez came over and lay next to my feet. I reached down and buried my fingers in his warm fur.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, pup. That was a low blow. This whole EV thing has me rattled. And the idea that I have a past I don \u2019t remember bugs the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. And don\u2019t let him get to you, Glory. No EV\u2019s getting past me.\u201d</p><p>I blinked back tears. \u201cThanks, puppy.\u201d Will nudged me from the other side.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both here for you. Like I said, I got no performance issues. That Kaplan dude was blowing smoke. He probably wiped your memory because his dick\u2019s as limp as Granny\u2019s hanky without the VV.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and scratched behind his ears. \u201cOkay, I feel better.\u201d Will ambled back over to the door, but Valdez just looked at me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Really. Guard the door.\u201d I was okay. Powerful. I could start fires with a look, move so fast I was a blur and pick up heavy objects with one finger. I sat on the stool. Okay, so it wasn\u2019t all that heavy. And my vamp moves were a few seconds short of a blur. I looked around at my newly redone shop. The fire thing I was pretty good at, but I wasn \u2019t about to risk the store to prove it.</p><p>I distracted myself sorting silver chains, crystal beads and ropes of pearls, at one point flinging a locket across the room with a look, just to prove I could do it. The first wave of night -shift shoppers came in and I could almost forget the whole Greg thing. Almost. By the time Lacy came in to relieve me, I\u2019d convinced myself that power-hungry EVs didn\u2019t freak me out. Vampire Viagra. Naw. Gloriana St. Clair didn\u2019t need any help finding her bliss. But what was the deal with Flo? She was always mysterious about her boyfriends. Nothing new there. But this interest in Vamp Viagra . . . That worried me. If this stuff was addictive and Flo was hooked on tsunamis of pleasure . . .</p><p>Ridiculous. My roomie might be heavily into her own fulfillment, but she was also the toughest vampire I knew. I couldn\u2019t imagine her addicted to anything beyond shoe shopping. Come to think of it, she hadn\u2019t done any shopping lately. I shivered as the door opened again, letting in another customer and the chill night air.</p><p>Maybe it would be a good idea to call Flo\u2019s brother. Damian had to know about this Vamp Viagra. He was into everything sensual, seeing as how he claimed to have been the original Casanova. I\u2019d been avoiding him since he\u2019d pulled some stunts with me. I didn\u2019t trust him, but I knew he\u2019d do anything for his sister.</p><p>I picked up the phone. Oops. I still had Greg\u2019s Razr phone. I was about to punch through his contact list when the customer asked a question. Okay, business first. I dropped the phone into my purse. I definitely was doing something about this. Just what, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\"Gloriana, I think you\u2019re overreacting. Florence has always loved her secrets.\u201d Damian strolled around my living room and stopped in front of my loaded book shelves. Self-help books mostly. I know, you\u2019d think I\u2019d have given up by now. He picked one up.</p><p>\u201cPut that back.\u201d Leave it to Damian to go straight to my copy of The Sixty Second Orgasm.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d He thumbed through it.</p><p>\u201cBe careful. I stood in line for over an hour to get that autographed. \u201d It was a cry for help. I\u2019d had a run of really inept lovers and I just wasn\u2019t getting there. You know? And the author was this really hot doctor of something called sensuality studies. I \u2019m a sucker for advice from an expert.</p><p>\u201cSatisfaction in sixty seconds?\u201d Damian laughed. \u201cWhat fun is that?\u201d He smiled knowingly and slid the book back on the shelf. \u201cI can give you an orgasm . . .\u201d He was suddenly right in front of me, his hands on my ass. \u201c. . . that lasts as long as you want it to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill, Damian. We\u2019re here to talk about Flo.\u201d I used my own vamp move to put the couch between us. Flo yes. Orgasms no. At least not tonight. And while I didn\u2019t doubt Damian could push all the right buttons, I wasn\u2019t going there again. \u201cWhat do you know about the EVs and this Vampire Viagra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re asking me about Viagra?\u201d Damian pushed his hands into his pockets so I could see how he didn\u2019t need a boost to spring into action.</p><p>\u201cRelax, stud muffin, I know you\u2019re not . . .\u201d I swept my eyes down his zipper. \u201cImpaired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor vampires it\u2019s not about erections anyway.\u201d Will was still way too interested in the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s about heightening pleasure. Who couldn\u2019t use a little of that?\u201d</p><p>Damian gave Will a look and the dog shut his mouth with a snap. Clearly Damian didn \u2019t discuss his love life with furry, fourfooted animals, even those with the ability to morph into vampires when they weren\u2019t indentured. I sat on the couch and watched Damian prowl around my living room. Damian was arguably one of the finest looking vampires in the known and unknown world. Of course his personality defects cancelled most of that out. He was full of himself, called himself Casanova, and resorted to mind control when his charm failed to get him what he wanted. All that didn\u2019t stop me from admiring the package and now I had the whole never ending orgasm tape playing in my head. I blocked him even though it gave me a headache. No way was I letting him get a clue that I admired any part of him. He turned for another lap around the couch. Damn, he had a fine butt.</p><p>\"EVs have been around for centuries, but I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d settled in Texas. Stay away from them, Gloriana. They\u2019re bad news.\u201d Damian picked up a bottle of Fangtastic and sniffed it with a frown. \u201cThis is okay, but\u201d\u2014he gave me a wink\u2014\u201cyou would taste much better.\u201d He put down the bottle and moved closer, fangs glinting in the lamp light. \u201cAll this talk of EVs and pleasure is making me . . . hungry.\u201d</p><p>Both dogs growled, but I silenced them with a look. Since they knew I had steaks thawing for them, they subsided with a grumble.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Damian. We were discussing your sister, remember? \u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorence is too smart to run with the EVs.\u201d Damian sat next to me on the couch, just a few inches too close.</p><p>\u201cA man approached me who said he works for the EVs. Gregory Kaplan. Do you know him?\u201d I watched Damian\u2019s face this time. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of him. He approached you? Did he threaten you?\u201d Damian\u2019s green eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cNo. We were . . . lovers once. Not that I remember it.\u201d</p><p>Damian put his hand on mine. \u201cAre you telling me he did what you call the whammy on you?\u201d</p><p>My fangs popped out, a knee-jerk reaction when I thought about the way Greg had manipulated me. Someday I was going to rip open his lying throat and drain him dry.</p><p>\u201cHe did, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Damian was suddenly all sweet concern. \u201cBastard. I can punish him for you, Glory. Just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe word.\u201d Damian looked startled and I found my sense of humor. \u201cDon\u2019t bother, Damian. He\u2019s a sleaze, obviously. But what worries me is that he insists Flo knows something about the EVs. She didn\u2019t come home last night, so I haven\u2019t been able to ask her about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course Florence knows about the EVs. We both do. There was a time in Madrid . . .\u201d Damian waved his hand. \u201cShe knows they\u2019re dangerous. They are like, hmm, I guess you could say a cult. They have devoted followers, weak-willed paranormals who are seduced by their promises. But my sister is not so easily swayed. She wouldn\u2019t get involved with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d I got up and headed into the kitchen. Both dogs followed me and looked up hopefully. \u201cWhat kind of promises? Is it all about sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They can do other things with power.\u201d Damian was right behind me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooking for the dogs.\u201d I poked the steaks with a fork. \u201cSorry, guys. Still frozen. Maybe I should stick them in the microwave.\u201d</p><p>I looked down when Will groaned. \u201cJust on defrost. I\u2019ve got to go downstairs soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, Glory.\u201d Valdez was obviously a less discriminating diner than Will.</p><p>\u201cIf you turn it into some kind of gray crud . . .\u201d Will looked over his shoulder at Damian.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dogs. You shouldn\u2019t coddle them, Glory.\u201d Damian frowned at the steak. \u201cDisgusting. Also disgusting that Blade doesn\u2019t trust you to handle your own affairs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy relationship with Blade is not up for discussion.\u201d I couldn\u2019t blame Damian for his attitude.

Then Blade had managed to kill the mood. \u201cHe only wants to keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could keep you safe.\u201d Damian whispered it next to my ear, his breath sending shivers down to the general area of my G-spot. Which I knew well. Hey, it was in the book.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d I stuck the steak in the microwave, setting it for defrost. \u201cBut I do handle my own affairs. My canine companions are backup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBackup, my ass.\u201d Valdez had muttered it, but he\u2019d known I would hear. I gave him a look that promised retribution.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Yankee-Doodle. When she\u2019s pissed, she might throw down a bowl of Alpo.\u201d Will wagged his tail. \u201cYou can handle yourself, Glory. We saw it. That Kaplan creep was quaking in his boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous women fascinate me.\u201d Damian rubbed my shoulders.</p><p>I thought about fascinating him with an elbow to his stomach, but he \u2019d probably take it as foreplay. Instead, I stared at the microwave until it dinged, then threw the steaks into a pan and turned up the heat.</p><p>\u201cAbout the EVs. Apparently I have lots of power, stored power.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you have lots of power. The way you refuse to shape-shift, and the way you\u201d\u2014Damian glanced at the dogs\u2014\u201clet others fight your battles for you. Your power is just sitting there, waiting to be tapped. \u201d He ran his finger up my arm, under my sleeve. \u201cThe EVs would turn it into something they could profit from. Why not use it yourself?\u201d He leaned close again. \u201cEver made love on a cloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hasn\u2019t?\u201d I flipped the steaks and frowned down at them. If I stabbed Damian with the fork, he\u2019d bleed. More foreplay in the vamp world. I know, we\u2019re twisted. But\u2014 what can I say?\u2014blood does it for us.</p><p>\u201cRare, Glory. Turn off the fire.\u201d Will pressed against my leg. The fact that he\u2019d pushed my tie-dyed skirt up almost to my waist wasn\u2019t lost on Damian.</p><p>\u201cStep away from the stove, all of you.\u201d</p><p>Damian just shook his head. \u201cWhat next? Takeout from a five star restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, Sabatini. Give Glory the phone number. I\u2019ve got a craving for Italian. Comes from being around Florence all the time.\u201d Valdez was pressing me on the other side and I had to shove him away to reach for a knife. I dropped each steak on a plate.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not even. I just bet Valdez gets the biggest piece. \u201d Will had his front paws on the counter. \u201cYou never did like me, Glory. Not since I grabbed your tit at Campbell Castle.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him down and picked up a knife and fork. \u201cThanks for reminding me. You know I never did tell Blade about that. What do you think he\u2019d do if he knew how you\u2019d disrespected me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean you grabbed her tit? \u201d Damian was clearly appalled. Otherwise he would never have deigned to speak to a dog directly.</p><p>\u201cShe was an actress, man. You remember what that meant a few centuries ago? I apologized. Done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez, you\u2019ve hit the jackpot.\u201d I deliberately trimmed an inch from Will\u2019s portion and dropped it on Valdez\u2019s plate.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Will threw back his head and howled.</p><p>\u201cFair is fair.\u201d Valdez wagged his tail. \u201cI\u2019d never grab any part of you, Glory, unless it was to save your life.\u201d</p><p>Damian frowned. \u201cBlade has much to answer for, saddling you with this . . . menagerie.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped a bite into Valdez\u2019s open mouth. \u201cThis one saved my life and Flo\u2019s not long ago.\u201d I finished cutting the steaks into bite-sized pieces and set the plates on the floor, a good three feet between them. \u201cEat. I\u2019m running out of time. I need to relieve Lacy in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do spoil the beasts.\u201d Damian frowned at the dogs. \u201cBut I guess they do have their uses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right they do.\u201d I patted them both on the head, but they were too busy inhaling steak to notice. \u201cI guess it\u2019s some latent mothering instinct, but I don\u2019t mind doing for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrets, Glory?\u201d Damian put his arm around my shoulder and guided me into the living room. \u201cI know I\u2019ve only planted one kind of fantasy in your mind, but if you \u2019ve got a notion to play housefrau, I\u2019m up for it.\u201d He turned me to look into my eyes, his hands warm on the back of my neck.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. I looked south. Yep, Damian was up for anything.</p><p>\u201cPicture this, Glory. I\u2019m Joe Ordinary, coming home from a hard day at the blood bank, and you\u2019ve just put little Fang down for his nap.\u201d His finger gently stroked the sensitive area behind my ear.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut. Damian was way too good at the whammy. And I was way too good at jumping right into his fantasies. But then he was a multitalented seducer. The husky voice, the practiced slide of his fingers into my hair. I felt him lean closer and suck my right earlobe into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Damian. And don\u2019t swallow my earring. It\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gloriana. Relax. I\u2019m just getting to the good part.\u201d He plucked out the earring and tucked it into my hand, the hand which had somehow landed on his nice wide, way too masculine chest.</p><p>Okay, this is the part where I should have shoved him away and called a halt. But Damian is nothing if not inventive. So I just stood there, silent, a safe three or four inches between us. Except for his lips on my earlobe. Was he reading my mind through my block? I admit my ears are one of my hot spots.</p><p>He took my silence as consent and drew me another inch closer. \u201cYou greet me at the door, Gloriana, wearing nothing but an apron. One of those sheer things. And high heels of course. Italian stilettos. \u201d He hummed and slid his tongue down to the pulse point in my throat. I braced myself. If he so much as touched a fang to me, I was shoving him through the wall and into the next room.</p><p>\u201cGloriana,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so stunned by your beauty that I drop my car keys. You bend over to pick them up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. Right. Now.\u201d My face hot, I gripped my self-control like it was the last life jacket on the Titanic. At least his mention of stilettos had put me back on the Flo track. I shoved, though not nearly as hard as I could have. I put the sofa between us and pushed my vintage silver earring back into my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cI got to you. I know I did.\u201d Damian stuck his hands in his pockets again, making it clear that I\u2019d gotten to him too.</p><p>\u201cRemember why you\u2019re here, Damian. This could be serious. What about the EVs? And why do I think maybe Flo \u2019s new boyfriend is connected to them somehow?\u201d</p><p>Damian\u2019s brows hit his hair line. \u201cDo you know this? That Florence is sleeping with an EV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for sure. But I\u2019m pretty positive she\u2019s been hitting the Vamp Viagra.\u201d I sat on the couch. \u201cYou should have seen the look on her face when she was telling about that stuff.\u201d I looked up at Damian. \u201cHave you tried it? Do you think it\u2019s addictive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t need to try it. But I have. A woman I knew was into it. And I\u2019ll admit it. I\u2019ll try anything once. Okay, twice.\u201d</p><p>Damian waggled his eyebrows, then collapsed on the couch next to me. \u201cThis woman was wealthy, beautiful, of course, and she couldn\u2019t make love without it. She was addicted. Not me, of course.\u201d He tapped his fingers on his dark jeans. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. The sex was fantastic and lasted for hours.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cBut I like being in control, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I could have launched into a litany of reasons why Damian\u2019s mind control bits had hurt me, yada, yada, but he was on to something. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like that. Losing control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did things, felt things. Pleasure, of course. Incredible, endless gratification. \u201d Damian smiled. \u201cNow that I remember, maybe I\u2019ve been hasty. We could try it together, Gloriana. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any part of it.\u201d</p><p>Damian shrugged. \u201cI had to give it a shot. I wasn\u2019t serious anyway. That Vamp Viagra. It messes with your mind. I couldn\u2019t stop when I wanted to. Couldn\u2019t slow down and think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking is highly overrated. Especially if you\u2019re getting great sex.\u201d Will had emerged from the kitchen licking his lips. \u201cI\u2019d try that Vampire Viagra in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says a man who lives and acts like a dog.\u201d Damian\u2019s lip curled. He turned his back on Will. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got me worried about my sister. She\u2019s too easily persuaded to take chances. It comes with having lived so long and so well. Florence is always looking for the next big thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we all? But Flo\u2019s usually satisfied with a shoe sale. This is different.\u201d I squeezed Damian\u2019s hand. One thing I liked about him was his family loyalty. I didn\u2019t have a family. But then, even when they were alive, my parents had ignored me, ashamed of my lifestyle. The whole \u201cactresses are sluts and whores\u201d thing. I\u2019d gotten over it, but sometimes I wished . . . Nope, I wasn\u2019t going to start a pity party.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do? Where do these EVs live? Should we go see them?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to, but if Flo was in danger . . . Hey, she was my family. All my close vamp friends were. I glanced at Damian. Yeah, even Casanova.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they want, Glory. For you to hand yourself over to them. Kaplan told you that. You ain\u2019t going within miles of their hideout. Even if we could find it.\u201d Valdez stretched and ambled over to collapse at my feet, pretending like he hadn\u2019t just waved a red flag at this bull. I gave him a look he couldn\u2019t misinterpret.</p><p>\u201cThe dog has a point. They are drug dealers. Vicious drug dealers. They keep a low profile or I would have already known they were in the area.\u201d Damian looked scarily serious. \u201cI\u2019m sure they have plenty of customers, though. But I\u2019m sure they screen those carefully. This Vampire Viagra isn\u2019t something you can buy on a street corner. Unless things have changed, they control the production and distribution with an iron fist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe got that from listening to Kaplan. Can\u2019t say I like who they put to work for them.\u201d Will was playing Mr. Righteous, trying to get back into my good graces.</p><p>As usual, Damian ignored him. \u201cTheir security will be extremely tight. They \u2019d be happy to let you in, Gloriana, but not your guards. And as for getting out . . .\u201d Damian ran a hand through his dark hair. \u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t like the idea of Florence having anything to do with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could just ask her if her boyfriend is an EV.\u201d Valdez yawned.</p> <p>Will put his head on his paws. \u201cYou know that lady keeps her secrets. Hell, Glory didn\u2019t have a clue her roommate was painting vampires on her wall downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of downstairs, I\u2019ve got to relieve Lacy. Maybe Flo will come by later. I\u2019ll call her. Leave a message if she doesn\u2019t pick up. She doesn\u2019t like vintage unless she bought it herself, but a werecat sold me a brand-new pair of Christian Louboutin suede pumps back in the day. Never worn. Flo\u2019s size. That should bring her in.\u201d I stood and smoothed my sixties skirt. I was a walking advertisement for the shop. Thank God I was a packrat who\u2019d kept my favorite outfits through the years. Vamp magic that I would forever wear the same size. Sucksville though, that the size was a twelve, not a six like roomie Flo. Tonight I wore a red off-the-shoulder peasant blouse with my long skirt. Oh, shoot, I hoped the sixties look wasn\u2019t because I still had Greg Kaplan and his free love era on the brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go down with you.\u201d Damian handed me my crocheted hobo bag. \u201cIf Florence comes in, we\u2019ll both confront her.\u201d</p><p>I locked up and headed downstairs with my entourage. When I got to the door of the shop, I could see through the glass that things were hopping. A crowd clustered around the counter. Waiting to pay? I smiled and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cThere she is.\u201d Lacy looked harried when the crowd parted. I could see why. \u201cI was just about to call you, Glory. Look who\u2019s here.\u201d She gestured to a woman I recognized immediately.</p> <p>\u201cDonna Mitchell, Channel Six News. I interviewed you on the night of the fire. \u201d She smiled and held out her hand. \u201cYour shop looks amazing. When I heard you\u2019d reopened, I thought you might agree to a follow-up. Free publicity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sounds good.\u201d I shook her hand and read her mind. She also wanted a shot at another feature. And rumor had it this was a slow news night. Then her eyes widened when she saw Damian behind me. He had that effect on women. \u201cHot bod alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d Donna\u2019s mind had gone completely blank. I had to step between them, to block her view of the Italian before I could get her attention again.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d No way was I introducing her to Damian. He was here to help with the Flo situation, not bewitch a new girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cWell, first we need to get a shot of this fabulous mural.\u201d Donna laughed. \u201cBy da Vinci, of course. What a hoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hilarious.\u201d I saw Lacy roll her eyes. \u201cMy roommate painted it. Customers seem to get a kick out of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me call my cameraman.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cWe might be able to get this on the ten o\u2019clock news if they\u2019ve got a spot open. At the very least, it\u2019ll be on the weekend wrap-up and the Web site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeb site. Yes. We have one too now. Vintagevampshop .com.\u201d I steered Donna over to the mural, well away from Damian.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could plug it.\u201d</p><p>Donna had her cell phone to her ear. \u201cGood. See you in ten.\u201d She snapped her phone closed and smiled. \u201cSure, you can plug your new site. Let\u2019s do a walk through. Tell me about your business. \u201d She kept glancing at Damian, who lounged next to the counter putting the flirt on one of my customers.</p><p>The fiftyish woman laughed at something he said. Yes, he could be charming. And useful. Like now, when he picked up a length of crystal beads and draped them around the woman\u2019s neck. She flushed and I heard her tell Lacy to add them to her bill. Donna hadn\u2019t missed the exchange either. \u201cWho is that man?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNobody. Now where would you like me to stand for the interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could get your partner here. You two made such a cute couple and she did paint the mural.\u201d</p><p>Damian choked and moved closer, his eyes twinkling. \u201cI\u2019m Gloriana\u2019s \u2018partner\u2019s\u2019 brother, Damian Sabatini.\u201d He bowed over Donna\u2019s hand, leaving her wide-eyed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet a woman who is even more beautiful in person than she is on television.\u201d</p> <p>Donna\u2019s mouth opened and closed but no sound came out. I knew the feeling.</p><p>\u201cDamian, why don\u2019t you try calling Flo while Donna and I discuss the shoot? I know she\u2019d hate to miss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Excuse me, ladies.\u201d He pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and stepped outside. I saw him speaking so maybe Flo had actually picked up, even though she had a policy of turning off her cell during dates.</p><p>\u201cWhat a hunk.\u201d Donna clutched my arm. \u201cTell me he\u2019s not gay.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Tempting. And I\u2019d spread that rumor myself when he\u2019d pissed me off. But he was helping with Flo. \u201cNo, very straight. But I wouldn\u2019t get too close if I were you. He\u2019s strictly love \u2019em and leave \u2019em\u2014\u201d Donna gave me a sharp look\u2014\u201caccording to his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks like he might be worth the risk. Too bad I\u2019m in a relationship.\u201d It didn\u2019t take a mind reader to see that Donna was reevaluating the whole relationship issue. If her significant other didn\u2019t get back into a gym soon and quit eating the last of the butter pecan ice cream . . . She eyed Damian\u2019s abs again when he came back inside.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough, Donna, for setting this up.\u201d I took her arm and dragged her back to the mural, halfway between the screamer and the vamp. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we shoot here first?\u201d</p><p>Now the reporter was all business, pointing out a likely spot for the camera. Damian caught my eye and shook his head. Obviously he\u2019d gotten Flo\u2019s voice mail.</p><p>I excused myself long enough to head to the back room to freshen my lipstick and fluff my hair. If I\u2019d known I was going on TV, I would have chosen a different outfit. A fifties shirtwaist would have really sent the message that we had a cool shop. Or a forties suit with a cute little hat. I gestured for Valdez to come back with me, then shut the door.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d What a pain that vamps don\u2019t reflect. \u201cOh, God, this skirt makes my ass look huge, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve heard the camera adds ten pounds too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look okay. But you got lipstick on your teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I scrubbed my front teeth with my finger. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Valdez cocked his head. \u201cNot like a vampire at all, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Actually I\u2019d forgotten all about that part. I touched my tongue to my fangs. Retracted, just like they would stay unless someone came in with AB negative. I\u2019m a slut for AB negative. Especially AB negative men. Remember the firefighter Steve incident?</p><p>\u201cI hope I don\u2019t forget to mention we carry men\u2019s clothing. \u201d I sat on a stool for a minute. \u201cMaybe all this publicity isn\u2019t such a good idea. You can\u2019t tell me Westwood\u2019s men won\u2019t see it. And then there are the EVs. I wonder if they watch TV. I know Greg did. He said he\u2019d seen me on the news.\u201d I was babbling. Nerves.</p><p>\u201cToo late for a low profile now, Blondie. You\u2019ve got a business to run. Let Westwood\u2019s men report back to him that you\u2019re not intimidated by his tactics.\u201d</p><p>A knock. \u201cThe cameraman\u2019s here, Glory.\u201d Lacy opened the door. \u201cYou look cute. The sixties look is hot right now. But you\u2019re a little pale.\u201d She handed me a makeup bag. \u201cThrow on some blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be pale.\u201d Valdez was obviously defensive. \u201cShe never sees daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to advertise the fact.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d gone through a fake tanning phase. Part of my lifelong obsession with blending. I \u2019d managed to avoid a lot of grief by pretending to be mortal. But since I\u2019d been in Austin, I\u2019d discovered how much better life could be surrounded by my own kind\u2014I glanced at Lacy, the were-kitty\u2014and other assorted entities. Lacy gave me a critical look after I brushed a little blush on my cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Don\u2019t forget to mention the address at least three times. So people will remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I took a breath, stepped out and ran straight into Donna.</p><p>\u201cMs. St. Clair, please stand over here.\u201d Donna had powdered her own nose and slipped on a green silk blazer. \u201cWe\u2019ve already taken some shots around the store and I filmed my intro outside. We\u2019ll put it all together later.\u201d She nodded to the cameraman and turned to look at me. I almost ran out of the store when I saw her thoughts.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\"We\u2019re here with Gloriana St. Clair, owner of Vintage Vamp \u2019s Emporium. If you remember our previous report several weeks ago, this shop was practically destroyed in a fire that the Austin fire department has determined was arson. Unfortunately there have been no arrests in the case.\u201d The microphone shifted to me. \u201cGloriana, we\u2019re glad to see you\u2019ve reopened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Donna.\u201d I braced myself because I could see what was coming. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, but I\u2019m glad to say it\u2019s business as usual at Vintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium, your vintage clothing store in the heart of historic Sixth Street. \u201d I smiled and kept smiling. Yeah, I sounded like a commercial and why not? I was about to be ambushed and putting Donna under the whammy wasn \u2019t an option, not with a crowd of interested shoppers looking on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve certainly made your shop unique. Right now we\u2019re standing in front of a mural your partner painted on one wall inside your shop, a painting of a vampire attacking a man. Are you sending a message?\u201d She thrust her microphone under my mouth, this time close enough to bite in two. And don\u2019t think I wasn\u2019t tempted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I mean, it\u2019s art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone recognizes The Scream by Edvard Munch. And he also painted Vampire, though it\u2019s not as well known. Aren\u2019t you implying that the store\u2019s name has a special meaning? Exactly what is a vintage vamp?\u201d</p><p>That damned microphone was in my face again. I\u2019d love to yell \u201cCut\u201d and cancel the whole deal. But there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity, right?</p> <p>\u201cDonna, I\u2019m into fashion history. A vamp was a hottie back in the roaring twenties. Do you really think I believe in vampires?\u201d I laughed, what else could I do? \u201cGive me a break. Fangs? Blood sucking?\u201d I shuddered. \u201cI know it\u2019s a popular theme in fiction.\u201d I nodded at the mural. \u201cAnd art. But this is just a vintage clothing store.\u201d I looked directly at the camera and grinned like an idiot. Then I got a whiff of the cameraman. AB negative. Oh, God, my fangs!</p><p>\u201cRat! I see a rat!\u201d Someone, I swear it was Will, screamed. Valdez and Will started barking like maniacs and racing around the shop, knocking the cameraman down and starting a general stampede for the door. Donna dropped the microphone and, when she scrambled to pick it up, Valdez head butted her into a rack of vintage hats. Donna shrieked and landed face first on a black straw with a wide brim. She came up spitting ostrich feathers.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I had the fangs well under control now and helped Donna to her feet. I sent the dogs a mental message to cool it. \u201cGive me a minute to lock up my pets. There is no way anyone saw a rat, I had the exterminator in just last week.\u201d Truth. I have this thing about bugs. Go figure.</p><p>\u201cDogs in a clothing store. Is that really a good idea?\u201d Donna brushed off her skirt. She was one tough lady, the rat thing hadn\u2019t even phased her. \u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest mirror?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDressing room. The dogs are friendly and sleep through most of the night while I\u2019m working.\u201d I smiled and patted Valdez when he sat beside me. \u201cMost customers appreciate our animal friendly policy.\u201d I was on solid ground here. Austin is full of animal rights activists. If Donna tried to criticize my pets on the air, she\u2019d have backlash on her hands. She nodded thoughtfully. \u201cLet me think about whether I got enough or not. Get some more shots of that mural. Sorry, Ms. St. Clair, but a story\u2019s a story. People will groove on the vampire angle.\u201d</p> <p>I glared as she headed for the dressing room, plucking feathers out of her hair.</p><p>\u201cExcitement\u2019s over, folks. No rat, I promise. Will! Drop that!\u201d The dog looked innocent, but he had something in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cChrist! That\u2019s the connector wire to the lights.\u201d Danny the cameraman tried to snatch the wire, but Will growled and wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Will it shock him? If my dog gets hurt, who do I sue?\u201d I gestured and Will dropped the slimy cable. The cameraman wasn\u2019t worried about slime. He grabbed it, looked it over, then wiped it on his jeans. \u201cNo harm done. I don\u2019t see how it could hurt the dog. But I\u2019m not taking any more pictures in here.\u201d</p><p>Will groaned, gasped and rolled over, his feet quivering straight up in the air. It was a pretty good imitation of death throes.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! You\u2019ve killed him.\u201d I clasped Will to my breasts. \u201cSweet Willy. Come back to me.\u201d I felt a wet tongue trace my cleavage and pushed him away. \u201cSomeone help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, Gloriana.\u201d Damian stepped over Will, limp on the carpet. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d He gave the cameraman a hard look.</p><p>\u201cMouth to mouth?\u201d It was all I could do not to crack up at Damian\u2019s look of horror. Valdez solved the problem by jumping on Will\u2019s stomach, his back feet landing solidly on . . . you know. The dog screamed\u2014tough to explain that one\u2014and jumped up to run to the back room.</p><p>\u201cHe lives!\u201d I clasped my hands to my chest, wiping away dog spit. The few customers left burst into applause, including a woman still standing on a Morris chair, her eyes peeled for rats. \u201cTwenty-five percent off everything!\u201d The woman climbed down and hurried over to the purses. I understood. A sale is a sale.</p><p>Donna was out of the dressing room, her blazer over her arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Danny. We\u2019ve got enough here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d Danny was busily packing up his equipment.</p><p>Damian picked up the hat rack while I gathered up hats and stacked them on the counter. I could have used the publicity if Donna had played it straight with me, but putting the vampire thing out there? No thanks. This wasn\u2019t the first time I wondered if I\u2019d been a little too cute with the name for my shop. I didn\u2019t try to stop the reporter when she left without a backward glance.</p><p>Damian took me aside. \u201cNow that the entertainment\u2019s over, I\u2019m going to look for my sister. I left a message that you were going to be interviewed for TV, but she didn\u2019t call back. She wouldn\u2019t miss an opportunity to show off her painting to all of Austin unless something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on his arm. \u201cI doubt she\u2019s even checked her voice mail, Damian. If she\u2019s with a lover . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. But if he\u2019s an EV, she\u2019s in over her head. You\u2019re a good friend to her, Glory. Thanks for telling me about this.\u201d Damian covered my hand with his and gave me one of his intense looks. I\u2019d relaxed my block, but now I tightened up because Damian was looking better and better to me. I glanced around the shop, like I had things to do. Which I did, truth be told. Stick a dozen hats back on the rack. Help that customer find her size in vintage sweaters. Get the hell away from Damian.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check in with you later.\u201d With that Damian left and I let the dogs out of the back room. I sent Lacy home and settled in for the rest of the night.</p><p>I murmured reassurances when one of the customers who\u2019d witnessed the recent chaos gave them a wide berth. I waited on a few customers, including the lady who was happy she hadn\u2019t actually seen a rat and ecstatic that she\u2019d gotten such a deal on two vintage Gucci bags.</p><p>I tried to call Flo and got her voice mail too. So I left my message about the shoes and hung up. The store was empty and the dogs snoozing when my cell phone rang. I grabbed it in case it was Flo, but the caller ID let me know it was Blade. I was happy to talk to him and spent a few minutes telling him about my TV experience. An edited version, but I had him laughing anyway.</p><p>\u201cSounds like Will helped you out in dramatic fashion. Maybe now you \u2019ll forgive me for saddling you with him.\u201d Blade\u2019s voice was low and sexy and I suddenly wanted to wrap my legs around him and make him growl with hunger.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I took a breath. Fresh paint, moth balls from some of the clothing and dog. \u201cJerry, I miss you.\u201d I meant it. I missed his smell, his warmth, his strength. And, yeah, his ever ready lust for me. While I like being in charge of my own life, it was nice to have someone I could always count on to care what happened to me.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mara there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s watching Westwood\u2019s compound. We\u2019re afraid he may have skipped out on us. He\u2019s flown in doctors to work on his arm, but he may have left to get further medical treatment.\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t laugh, but I could hear the satisfaction in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou really got him good then.\u201d Halloween. Jerry\u2019s lethal with a knife, and should have finished the hunter then. He\u2019d let my own antics distract him and Jerry still beat himself up for not killing the bastard when he had the chance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard his men talking. Westwood will never pull on a bow again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw gee. Give me a minute while my heart bleeds.\u201d Westwood\u2019s olive wood arrows had taken out more than one vampire. Like we\u2019re big game or something. Then there\u2019s the fangs he takes as a trophy. Obviously Westwood is one brick short of a load.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him get away this time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d heard this all before. Hey, I understood. The creep had killed Jerry\u2019s best friend right in front of him. I noticed Will \u2019s ears twitching. He was obviously tuned in to our conversation despite closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut if Westwood\u2019s left the country, what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow him. He\u2019s a dead man.\u201d</p><p>I headed into the back room and closed and locked the door. I would hear the bells on the outside door if a customer came in. Warrior Blade really did it for me, but Westwood wasn \u2019t your ordinary opponent. He had billions at his disposal from his computer empire. And technology. His technology scared the hell out of me. I didn\u2019t say that. It would just stir up Blade\u2019s macho</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you who\u2019s stronger\u201d instincts. Instead, I settled for a warning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget how dangerous Westwood is. He\u2019s got all this equipment. And he hates you. Not just because you\u2019re vampire either. You bested him on Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he bested me. He got away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you feel like you owe MacTavish this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe all vampires Westwood\u2019s total destruction. If he starts producing his vampire detectors and sells them to every would-be fang hunter, none of us will be safe, Gloriana. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. At least his injury has kept him out of commission. And Derek \u2019s been monitoring the Internet. If any vamp detectors come on the market, we\u2019ll know about it.\u201d Leave it to a techno-freak like Westwood to figure out how to spot a vampire and put it into something resembling a cell phone. So, no matter how cute I dressed or normal I seemed I couldn\u2019t blend enough to avoid detection.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be careful, Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being careful. Too damned careful. I want to settle this once and for all. If he\u2019s really moved on . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of moving on . . . Are we actually alone right now?\u201d I\u2019d had enough of this angst over a problem I sure had no way of solving. And Jerry needed a break. I could hear the tension in his voice. He needed to relieve some stress or he might do something crazy, like storm Westwood\u2019s compound. Or jump Mara\u2019s way too beautiful bones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m alone. Why? Do we need privacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would probably be a good idea.\u201d I smiled into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m taking off my skirt. You take off something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this phone sex?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I couldn\u2019t hear the smile in his voice yet. It made me even more determined to wipe the thought of Westwood out of Jerry\u2019s head for a few minutes. And the memories of the hunter\u2019s sleazy call out of mine. How better than to replace them with new and improved memories with a man who made me melt just hearing his deep, sexy voice?</p><p>\u201cI kicked off my shoes, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, no good. I want to see some skin. Take off your shirt.\u201d I did drop my skirt to the floor and kicked off my slingbacks. If any customers came in at three thirty in the morning, the dogs would warn me. For once I hoped I didn \u2019t have any business for a while. I wanted to find out just how hot phone sex could be with the right man.</p><p>\u201cMy shirt just hit the wall. Take off yours. What color is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed. And I\u2019m not wearing a bra.\u201d I tossed the shirt on a chair. \u201cMmm. It\u2019s a little chilly in here. My nipples are all pointy and tingling. I\u2019m warming them with my hands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, Gloriana. What kind of panties are you wearing?\u201d Jerry groaned and I knew I had him revved up. Good.</p><p>\u201cBlack thong. Oops. I was wearing a black thong.\u201d I sighed. \u201cNow all I\u2019m wearing are my earrings. Are you naked yet?\u201d</p><p>Silence. One thousand one, one thousand two . . .</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was that growl I loved so much.</p><p>\u201cAre you touching yourself like I\u2019m touching myself?\u201d Who was I kidding? Blade was a man. He probably touched himself when deciding whether to wear the black or brown socks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m touching you. Can you feel me, Glory?\u201d</p> <p>I gasped. Impossible. He was thousands of miles away. He couldn\u2019t possibly . . . But I swear those were his fingers, not mine stroking me. My body wept for him and I quivered from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m laying you on that big table in your workroom and kissing the curls between your legs. Open for me, sweetheart. That\u2019s right. Now my tongue dips inside you, tasting your honey. Delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade.\u201d I swear I felt his mouth on me, every sweep of his tongue. Oh, God. Oh, God. Not happening. Mind control across continents. But I was flat on my back on the table and I swear I hadn\u2019t climbed up there. Wow, I thought I had a lot of power. My body clenched until I arched against the table. I closed my eyes and saw Blade\u2019s face, then his naked body where he lay on a cot in a tent. The sounds of Africa were a murmur in the background. Could I touch him?</p><p>\u201cFeel my hands on you, Jerry. I\u2019m pulling you up my body to kiss you on the mouth. A soul kiss to show you how much I \u2019ve missed you. Can you feel it, Jerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I can taste you. And then I look at you, just look at you. I love your broad shoulders. Can you feel me touching them?\u201d</p><p>I took a breath and knew his scent, unique and all Blade. \u201cI kiss your chest. I sweep my tongue around your nipples and taste the salt on your skin. Is it hot there, Jerry?\u201d I heard him gasp.</p><p>\u201cHot as hell.\u201d</p> <p>A touch, a pressure then a spasm between my legs. Could he really take me? From so far away?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pushing inside you, Gloriana. I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve got to have you. Now.\u201d</p><p>And I felt it. Insane, but he was hard inside me, filling me and touching my womb. Shock waves rippled through me until even my toes tingled.</p><p>\u201cGod, I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d I knew I was really alone, flat on my back, legs wide. One hand gripped the phone, the other the wooden table. Blade wasn\u2019t here, but this felt so real. \u201cYou can\u2019t be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. Come with me, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>He pushed into me again, harder, deeper. I gasped and the bells on the shop door rang.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He thrust again while my body held him inside me. The room swam and I couldn\u2019t seem to focus.</p><p>\u201cI mean no, there\u2019s a customer in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the dogs handle it.\u201d His hands cupped my breasts before his hot mouth burned a path from one nipple to another.</p><p>\u201cI . . . can\u2019t.\u201d I sighed. I had to crash back down to earth. I tried counting ceiling tiles. I \u2019d made it to three when Blade\u2019s lips circled my belly, then headed south.</p><p>A knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cGloriana? Are you all right?\u201d Derek, here to pick up a commission check.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out, uh, in a minute. I\u2019m, oh, on the phone. Would you, um, cover the front for me?\u201d Not a customer. My hips came off the table and I bit back a moan.</p><p>\u201cSure. Take your time. Tell Blade hi for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEavesdrop on my conversation and you\u2019re fired.\u201d Damned mind reading vampires. Right now I was, oh yes, the star in my own triple X movie.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dare, boss. I\u2019ll be checking on the Web site. My attention is totally on that. \u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m turning up the radio.\u201d</p><p>The Doobie Brothers blasted through the door. Whatever. I groaned when hands followed lips over my breasts and down my tummy.</p><p>\u201cThis will take more than a minute, Gloriana.\u201d Blade lifted my hips and pushed into me again. Still hard? Hard again? Obviously this man would never need Vamp Viagra. And, damn, but I didn\u2019t want to think about that stuff right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to go in . . .\u201d Gasp, \u201cMaybe five minutes. \u201d Could I make him scream his satisfaction? I \u201csaw\u201d his thigh, close to his sacs and imagined my fangs piercing the tender skin.</p><p>\u201cGod, Gloriana. You\u2019re evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil?\u201d I could definitely taste him. \u201cI\u2019ll show you evil.\u201d I squeezed his cock while his essence flooded my mouth. This was all in my mind, of course. Had to be. But the mind is a powerful thing. Had that been a shriek? Couldn \u2019t have been. Way too girly for Blade.</p><p>\u201cMara\u2019s here.\u201d Blade sounded like he was strangling.</p><p>Ah, the shrieker. I sat up, suddenly aware of the where and the how. \u201cYou\u2019d better be covering yourself.\u201d That witch would like nothing better than to take over where I\u2019d left off.</p><p>\u201cI told her to get out.\u201d Blade sounded like he was in serious pain. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Just the mention of Blade\u2019s female companion was enough to bring me crashing back to a hard wooden table in a chilly storage room.</p><p>\u201cGloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. But I\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Blade or something pushed me back on the table. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>I felt his fangs on my inner thigh. Pay back.</p><p>\u201cJerry,\u201d I moaned. He drew on me and I jerked like I\u2019d been electrocuted. The pleasure/pain went on and on. Talk about tsunamis . . . hands, mouth, teeth. Finally I collapsed, hitting my head on the wooden table.</p><p>\u201cThis did not happen.\u201d I looked at the phone I still clutched in one fist. Yep, same old cell. Who knew? And now I figured I needed a camera phone. Jerry and I both did. Hmm. Phone sex with pictures. I took slow even breaths before I started heating up all over again.</p><p>\u201cIt did happen. I\u2019ve got Mara sulking outside my tent to prove it.\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice was low, full of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cBack to reality, big guy.\u201d I smiled and sat up. Showing Mara who Blade really wanted was a guaranteed mood enhancer. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on there besides a Mara meltdown. \u201d Did he know about my little confrontation with Greg Kaplan? Apparently not, since he merely gave me a quick rundown of their progress, or lack of, with getting to Westwood. The billionaire was too smart to go out at night and no amount of shape-shifting or other spy techniques had managed to infiltrate his hideout. The guards, who couldn\u2019t be bribed, were armed with vamp detectors and had every entrance, including the windows, well covered.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right, Gloriana? I haven\u2019t heard from Valdez this week.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea how those two communicate. It sure wasn\u2019t with e-mail, since Valdez couldn\u2019t exactly type in dog form. Or with the phone, same problem with dialing. Mental telepathy. I \u2019d just had a toe-curling example of how that worked no matter the distance. Of course we\u2019d also had cell phones . . .</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been busy getting the shop back up and running. The TV interview tonight should help get the word out that we\u2019re open again. If it actually airs. And if it doesn\u2019t make us look like the latest vampire hangout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Gloriana. Westwood\u2019s men are everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re handling it. And I forwarded the e-mail the man himself sent me. Nice to know that he\u2019s saving a stake for me that he plans to deliver personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about it.\u201d I shuddered. I wasn\u2019t about to give Jerry an update on all the e-mails and calls since. \u201cJust stay safe.\u201d I scrambled back into my clothes, one handed because I still had him on the phone.</p><p>\u201cI will if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Say hi to Mara.\u201d Am I civilized, or what? Should I tell Jerry about Greg? Ask his advice about the EVs? I heard the bells tinkle again signaling a customer. Derek could handle it, but I took it as a sign that I should leave it alone. Blade had enough worries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you again soon.\u201d I hung up and sat on a stool to give myself a moment. From sixty to zero in a few minutes wasn \u2019t exactly an easy trip. I felt drained, yet still hungry. That\u2019s the problem with virtual sex, virtual anything. It wasn\u2019t real. And Blade had no idea when he\u2019d be home. In the meantime, my gut clenched and I still had damp panties. I wanted more than a little, okay, a lot, of phone sex. It made me crazy that I didn \u2019t feel satisfied. It was like being all dressed up in your cute new leather mini with nowhere to go. I needed something or someone a little more substantial than my own right hand. The bell tinkled again. I unlocked the storeroom door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard leaned against the counter talking to Derek. I clutched a bottle of Fangtastic I \u2019d pulled from the fridge back there, hoping that would explain the flush I was sure still brightened my face.</p><p>A customer picked through my selection of fur jackets. I ignored the men for the moment, my inner saleswoman on high alert. I spent a few minutes helping the woman pick out a muskrat stroller with curly lamb cuffs. Richard paced the store, obviously impatient.</p><p>\u201cHere. Let my associate Derek write you up.\u201d I smiled and nodded, sending Derek a mental message that he could have the commission if he\u2019d give me a few minutes in the back room with Richard.</p> <p>\u201cSure, Glory. Richard says you have business to discuss. I\u2019ll hold down the fort until Lacy comes in if you want to go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Did I? Want to go upstairs? I could either go upstairs or drag Richard to the back where, one whiff, and he\u2019d know exactly what I\u2019d been up to back there. Richard\u2019s hand on my elbow and Richard\u2019s set face made me decide the scene might go better upstairs where I could put a couch between us if I needed to.</p><p>I glanced at the clock. Only an hour and a half until dawn. Where did the time go? I guess I\u2019d spent more time in the back room than I thought. But time flies . . .</p><p>\u201cThanks, Derek. Upstairs it is. See you tomorrow night.\u201d I grabbed my purse from Derek\u2019s outstretched hand.</p><p>\u201cLeave the dogs here.\u201d Richard\u2019s nostrils flared.</p> <p>Uh-oh. He\u2019d already smelled sex on me. I\u2019m sure Derek had told him I was on the phone with Blade. Well, so what? Rich and I were friends. Blade and I . . ? More than friends and for a long, long, long time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>Valdez growled but didn\u2019t say anything since the customer was still standing there.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Derek, see you.\u201d I patted each frustrated dog on the head as I swept out of the door Richard held open. He put his hand on my back and steered me to the apartment entry where I punched in the security code. He was being awfully quiet. Jealous? I didn\u2019t have a problem with that. Once we got inside, I turned on some lamps and hit the remote for the CD player. Norah Jones. Slow and sexy. I glanced at Richard and hit stop. He was not in the mood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been with Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to him on the phone. So what?\u201d I headed for the kitchen. I didn\u2019t want any more Fangtastic, but needed something to do with my hands. I opened the fridge. \u201cYou want one? I can heat it if you prefer it that way.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI know you and Blade have been together. But you\u2019re not together. Not physically or otherwise. Not exclusively. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>I gave up on the drink thing and went back into the living room to sit on the couch. Hey, a man was actually talking about relationships. I was riveted. I patted the seat beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. My connection to Blade is complicated. \u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain it.\u201d He sat close, too close, his thigh brushing mine. Now he could really smell sex on me and I could tell it had an effect on him. Well, I knew just what to say to deflate any notion he had that he might be allowed to take up where Blade had left off.</p><p>\u201cInstead, I need you to tell me what you know about the EVs.\u201d</p><p>You had to give Richard credit. Except for the tightening of his jaw, you\u2019d never know I\u2019d sucker punched him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the EVs?\u201d His blue eyes were the color of an ice flow and just as warm. Yikes.</p><p>\u201cI know that they sent someone after me.\u201d Richard grabbed my hand and I couldn\u2019t bite back a squeal at the pain. \u201cHey, careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He instantly eased his grip. \u201cYou want to tell me what you mean?\u201d</p> <p>So I did. I told him the whole Greg Kaplan, EV thing. When I got to the part where Greg claimed Flo was involved with them, Richard shot to his feet. I\u2019d suspected he still had feelings for my roomie. Now I knew he did.</p><p>\u201cFlorence wouldn\u2019t sleep with an EV. I\u2019ve told her how they are. What they\u2019ve done.\u201d He paced the small room, making a circle around the couch and coffee table. I glanced longingly at the CD player. Maybe Norah could diffuse the tension that was coming off Richard in waves. He gave me a hard look. Maybe not.</p><p>\u201cClue me in, Richard. You\u2019ve got to admit Flo\u2019s not afraid of anyone or anything.\u201d The couch shook when Richard dropped down on it next to me again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s enjoying the perks, like the Vamp Viagra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid female.\u201d He shot me a look. \u201cSorry, that was unbelievably insensitive.\u201d He tried for a smile but failed. \u201cWhat I meant to say was exasperating bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, much better.\u201d I put my hand on his hard thigh. He was really upset and I had to like that about him. Flo had dumped him badly and not looked back. But he still cared what happened to her. \u201cWhat do you know about the EVs? She warned me not to tell you I\u2019d even heard of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she knows I\u2019ve been following their activities for decades, no, make that centuries. \u201d Richard ran his hand through his platinum hair. When I\u2019d first met him, it had been practically a buzz cut. Now it had grown out and I itched to touch the silky strands. On that hilltop . . . He gave me a hot look. I was either going to have to block my thoughts or accept that he was going to read me. I sent him a mental message to cut me a break and leave my mind the hell alone. He leaned back then slung his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. No more mind reading. But I do care about Florence. As a friend. The EVs are ruthless bastards, always hunting for new power sources.\u201d Richard squeezed my shoulders gently and I felt myself sway toward him. Nope. Not going to do it. I wanted to hear this.</p><p>\u201cFlo said she could check my power level and that I had a ton of it. How does that work? Can they suck the power from someone and use it to make things?\u201d And does the whole power draining operation hurt? I kept that one to myself. Richard didn\u2019t need to hear me whine. Besides, I didn\u2019t plan to let an EV within sucking distance.</p><p>\u201cThe EVs are the reason I came to Austin in the first place. Their unique ability is that they can convert power into other things. Drugs. In the right hands, this could be a good thing, a way to perform miracles.\u201d Richard let go of me and jumped to his feet again. The way he said miracles reminded me about the whole former priest thing.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re the wrong hands?\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s fists opened and closed against his strong thighs. Righteous warrior, former crusader, you didn \u2019t want to mess with him. I could easily picture him crushing the life out of some bad actor.</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t be more wrong. The EVs have taken this ability and perverted it. They take advantage of an immortal \u2019s boredom, his\u201d\u2014he glanced at me\u2014\u201cor her desire for excitement, something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike being immortal and vampire isn\u2019t enough. There has to be more than the same old, same old.\u201d I got it. But I didn\u2019t see a drug as the answer. There were always new places to go, people to meet. Of course all the drifting got old too. I could vouch for that. Since settling in Austin I felt like I\u2019d finally found a home. I\u2019d hate like hell to leave here.</p><p>\u201cI followed the EVs here from Buenos Aires. I want to put them out of business permanently. \u201d He had a fierce look. I didn\u2019t doubt that if anyone could bring the EVs down it was Richard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you could do that alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone there. I had allies. And here I was waiting until I knew more about their current setup before involving the locals.\u201d</p><p>Richard glanced at me again and shook his head. \u201cNot you, Glory. Some of the older, stronger vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s me they want, Richard.\u201d I bit back a snarky comment. Of course he hadn\u2019t considered me in forming his vampire militia. What could a clothes-obsessed vamp with a shifting phobia do for him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never use you as bait, Glory. But it will be difficult to get to them. The EVs in Argentina were well guarded. I \u2019m sure they will be here too. I\u2019ve been searching for their stronghold, but haven\u2019t found it yet. Apparently the power supply in Argentina was running low. And then there was a coup, I guess you\u2019d call it. They have a new leader and he decided to change location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA coup? Damian said they were like a cult. I assumed they had some kind of charismatic leader. \u201d It never failed to amaze me what I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019d sure had enough years to learn just about everything. But then the EVs were apparently a secret society. A well-kept secret.</p><p>\u201cThe EVs\u2019 secrets are held by what they call the Demoness, Honoria, the spirit of a Roman princess who was married to Attila the Hun. She\u2019s the source of their power and speaks to the current leader. If a leader doesn\u2019t keep his followers in line or please her, Honoria devours him, literally.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. Devouring female demons. Of course any woman married to Attila the Hun might actually enjoy snacking on hapless men. And Flo was involved with these creeps? \u201cMakes you wonder what the old leader did, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have been rumors . . .\u201d Richard shook his head, like he\u2019d exhausted his knowledge or didn\u2019t want to waste any more time on the subject with me. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t surprised that the group moved to Texas. Even down there, we heard that Austin is a paranormal playground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They even print up T-shirts that say \u2018Keep Austin Weird.\u2019 \u201d Okay, so I had one. Pink and very cute, though a little tight since I\u2019d dried it on hot. \u201cI don\u2019t think the chamber of commerce realizes just how weird Austin really is though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe EVs know. They have spies like Greg Kaplan, fools who will work for their drugs, finding power sources for them. \u201d</p><p>Richard stalked to the kitchen, pulled out a Fangtastic and twisted off the top. He took two deep gulps and his face turned pink. I was so not noticing how cute he looked with that slight flush, not to mention the late night beard, as pale as his hair, that hugged his strong jaw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me one. You know you still haven\u2019t told me how they do their power thing.\u201d I was obviously having a sinking spell if I could forget what I\u2019d just had with Blade and have lustful thoughts about Richard. He drained his bottle, then grabbed two more from the fridge. Hey, that stuff wasn\u2019t cheap, but one look at his set face and I wasn\u2019t going to bring up my budget concerns. I took the bottle and opened it. The flavor of the month was O positive. On sale and always the cheapest vintage. Remember that budget? I wrinkled my nose, then took a swallow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalling, Richard. How do the EVs get power from a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey suck your belly, Glory.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen</p><p>I spewed about two dollars worth of Fangtastic all over the coffee table. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I set the bottle down before I dropped it.</p><p>\u201cYour belly, your navel, like where you were attached to your mother. That\u2019s where they get your power.\u201d Richard headed for the kitchen and came back with a handful of paper towels. He efficiently cleaned off the coffee table, then I heard the thunk of wet towels hitting the bottom of the trash can.</p><p>\u201cThat is beyond gross.\u201d I pressed a hand to my oh-so-generous power base. No wonder the EVs wanted me, especially now that I had the added attraction of the Cheetos bulge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they do.\u201d Richard sat down beside me.</p> <p>\u201cHow do they convert it, though? And is there a vein there? Do they use blood or . . . something else? \u201d I had visions of lying drained and helpless atop some kind of altar with a straw in my belly button. South America. Maybe they\u2019d also called in Incas or Mayans or, oh, hell, the Devil, for ideas on how to convert power. And Honoria had been married to Attila the Hun. I bet he \u2019d been so busy conquering countries she\u2019d been deprived sexually. Was that why she\u2019d helped the EVs come up with the Vamp Viagra?</p><p>\u201cThey have a council of twelve. All born vampires. Their secret abilities come from an ancient book that Honoria controls. Only the chosen twelve have access to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn EV manual. How creepy is that? It figures they\u2019re born vampires. Born vamps think they\u2019re superior to us made types. And they can eat.\u201d If Mara ever dared eat a bag of Cheetos in front of me . . . Well, let\u2019s just see how she\u2019d like wearing a Cheetos bag thong.</p><p>Richard was deep in thought. Obviously eating wasn\u2019t on his radar. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how they even knew about you, Glory.\u201d</p><p>Richard plucked my hand off my stomach.</p><p>\u201cGreg said someone mentioned my name and he remembered me and my shift aversion. What do you bet my roomie Flo was the one with the loose lips?\u201d I made a face. \u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t intend . . . Oh, hell, Richard, do you think they\u2019re sucking Flo\u2019s power?\u201d Richard\u2019s flush had faded until he was ghostly white.</p> <p>\u201cI hope to hell not. If they don\u2019t kill her,\u201d he said, and I saw him swallow, \u201cshe can recover some of it. But it leaves a vampire weak and vulnerable. Just about powerless.\u201d He looked down at my hand. \u201cDamn it, we need to find her.\u201d</p><p>The door crashed open. \u201cFind who?\u201d Flo swayed into the room, clearly high on something. Or was that low? She didn\u2019t look right, like she was dreaming, or fading. Or . . . oh, shit. I jumped up and grabbed her when she stumbled. Richard was on her other side and shot me a concerned look over her head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been worried about you, Flo. Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d I sent Richard a mental message and we guided Flo down the hall and into her bedroom. Her hair was wild, her face pale sans lipstick and, scariest of all, she\u2019d lost her shoes somewhere. Flo never went anywhere without top of the line footgear.</p><p>\u201cSimon and I were together.\u201d She reached up and patted Richard\u2019s cheek. \u201cSorry, caro, but I move on.\u201d</p><p>I had to give Richard credit for not dropping Flo right on her cute little butt. Instead he helped me lay Flo gently on her bed, a decadent number complete with gilt cherub headboard. Her red satin comforter slid to the floor and he kicked it aside. I didn\u2019t say anything, just adjusted a pillow under Flo\u2019s head. Her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare go to sleep.\u201d I tapped her cheek lightly and her eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cDid you just hit me?\u201d She sat up, eyes shooting sparks.</p><p>\u201cGlory didn\u2019t hit you, Florence, but if you don\u2019t calm down, I might.\u201d Richard fisted his hands and I believed he had a slap or two in him.</p> <p>Flo\u2019s anger dissolved into tears and she clasped me to her bosom. Mood swings. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory. You\u2019re my best friend in the world. You must come with me to meet Simon. He will love you as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled and almost choked on the scent of sex, blood and something sickly sweet. I looked at Richard. Vamp Viagra? He nodded. I patted Flo\u2019s slim back. Hmm. She\u2019d lost her bra somewhere, but with perky twentysomething breasts, this wasn\u2019t a tragedy.</p><p>\u201cFlo, tell us about Simon. Is he an EV?\u201d</p><p>Flo collapsed back on the pillows. \u201cNot just an EV. The leader. The king of the EVs. I think I\u2019ll change my name again. Simon calls me Fantasia. Like the Idol. Isn\u2019t that sweet?\u201d She sighed and cuddled the pillow to her.</p><p>\u201cIdol?\u201d Richard looked mystified.</p><p>\u201cAmerican Idol. Third season. Flo and I . . . Never mind.\u201d I touched Flo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWake up, Flo. Tell us about Simon.\u201d</p><p>She smiled into her pillow. \u201cHe promises to make me his queen. But he wants to meet you first, Glory. To get your approval. Isn\u2019t that sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me, he should need Damian\u2019s approval, not mine.\u201d Like I didn\u2019t know what Simon really wanted with me. Would he hang me upside down and drain me? Oh, with a siphon at my navel, of course.</p><p>\u201cHe knows my brother doesn\u2019t give me permission for what I do. But you, Glory, my roomie, he knows I care what you think. Simon\u2019s so considerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsiderate? Like hell.\u201d Richard jerked the pillow from Flo\u2019s grasp. \u201cWhat are you playing at, Florence? Do you want to get Gloriana killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I love her.\u201d Flo\u2019s lips trembled. \u201cI do, I love you, Glory. I\u2019ve never had such a good woman friend before.\u201d Her eyes closed and a tear streaked down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Flo.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it, I pulled up her shirt. Her navel, above her low rise jeans, was bracketed by two angry welts. Damn them, the EVs hadn\u2019t even bothered to heal her. I shuddered. Obviously Flo had been giving power. Had the Vamp Viagra been her reward? I checked out Richard\u2019s reaction. I\u2019d never seen him more furious. I pulled up a sheet to cover her. Maybe I should undress her, but we still had an hour before dawn and I wanted to learn more. If not from her, then from Richard. I heard a soft snore. Okay, Richard would have to fill me in. I threw the coverlet over her too, turned off the light and gestured for Richard to follow me back to the living room.</p><p>\u201cThis is bad, Richard, really bad. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Florence is in way deeper than we realized if she\u2019s involved with Simon.\u201d Richard paced the worn hardwoods around the area rug, a nice fake Oriental I\u2019d found in a Dumpster out back. The things people throw away . . . I dragged myself away from the edge of meltdown. I didn\u2019t give a damn about the rug. I was terrified. For Flo and, gulp, myself. I looked down at my rounded tummy, which I\u2019d suddenly discovered I loved with a passion and wasn\u2019t about to give up. Not to an EV anyway. Now if liposuction worked . . . Never mind. Obviously my thoughts were all over the place. Right now my stomach was covered by three layers, blouse, skirt and my skimpy excuse for panties. Maybe if I wore one of my vintage panty girdles . . . Those things were like iron. Trust me, you can\u2019t even bend in one. Of course a vampire, even an ordinary one, could make quick work of it. I\u2019d had a lover bite one off me once. Of course that had been consensual and not the least bit threatening. But if an EV came at me, fangs drawn . . . Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cGlory.\u201d Richard spoke next to my ear. \u201cQuit freaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Obviously Simon, king of the EVs, is trying to use Flo to get to me. \u201d A role that normally would\u2019ve turned my roomie into a shrieking harridan. Flo-slash-Fantasia used men, not vice versa. \u201cDo you think he could really make her his queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonoria wouldn\u2019t stand for it. She\u2019s the only female in charge of that group. If Simon thinks he could use Flo to get to you, he\u2019s going to be disappointed. He\u2019ll have to go through me and two very angry dogs to get to you.\u201d Richard grabbed my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs and get the beasts. And we need to warn Derek. No powerful vampire is safe with the EVs on the prowl.\u201d</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. Loud noises from Flo \u2019s bedroom. We both rushed down the hall and I threw open the door. Flo was standing on the bed, a gold Manolo sandal in her hand.</p><p>\u201cFlo, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging this picture of Simon.\u201d She gave the tack another whack with the stiletto heel. \u201cIsn\u2019t he handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Flo.\u201d</p><p>The shoe heel snapped and Flo tossed it aside without so much as a glance. She dropped back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Simon?\u201d Richard and I both gaped at the computer generated photo she\u2019d tacked to the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo handsome.\u201d Flo had a dreamy look on her face. \u201cHe should be in movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, he is in movies.\u201d I glanced at Richard and he shook his head. What? I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell Flo that she\u2019d just ruined a very expensive shoe hanging up a picture of Brad Pitt? I looked down at her still unfocused eyes and loopy smile. \u201cI mean, yeah, he\u2019s movie star handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s all mine.\u201d Flo threw out her arms then was out like a light again. Richard gestured and we stepped back into the hall. He closed the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Does Simon really look like that?\u201d I gave myself a few seconds to live the fantasy. He could suck my belly button, my ear, my big toe for all I cared. Hey, he\u2019d played a vampire in a movie. If Brad really was one . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSnap out of it, Glory. Of course he doesn\u2019t really look like that. You\u2019ve just seen one of the powers an EV has. He can delve into your mind, find your secret fantasy and make you believe you \u2019ve found it.\u201d Richard ground his teeth like maybe he\u2019d hoped</p><p>he\u2019d been Flo\u2019s secret fantasy. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even have to shape-shift to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of like the whammy then. With a twist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe twist is Flo\u2019s been brainwashed. She sees what she wants to see when she looks at Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I met Simon, he\u2019d look like Johnny Depp?\u201d Chocolat Johnny, not Pirates or, shudder, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Johnny.</p><p>Richard snorted. \u201cIf that\u2019s your fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I mean that conniving bastard.\u201d Wow. No wonder Flo was so hot and heavy with Simon. Her two favorite hunks were Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing and Brad Pitt in anything.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d I held onto Richard, stopping him at the door. \u201cWhat are we going to do about Flo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her to sleep it off. I doubt she\u2019ll wake up until tomorrow night. Then you, me, Damian . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOh, hell, I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s going to listen to any of us. Once you\u2019ve got a taste for the Vampire Viagra, it\u2019s almost impossible to give it up. I\u2019ve seen it before. The withdrawal is a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to warn Derek about that too. He and Freddy know most of the paranormals in Austin. Maybe we should call a meeting, spread the word.\u201d Blade usually headed up vamp meetings. I suddenly wanted him beside me with an ache that made me grab my stomach again. Damn that Westwood. Why\u2019d he have to run all the way to Africa?</p><p>\u201cA meeting is a good idea. But if the EVs get wind of it, they\u2019re not going to like your interference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I give a rat\u2019s ass what they like. And what about this king? Simon? Can all the EVs do the Brad Pitt whammy or is he something special?\u201d I dug in my purse for my keys and locked the door once we were out in the hall.</p><p>\u201cSimon Destiny.\u201d Richard shrugged. \u201cStupid name. Not his real one, of course. Special? Obviously women under his influence think so. I met him once and I wasn\u2019t impressed. Of course he didn\u2019t turn into Beyonc\u00e9 for me either.\u201d</p> <p>I stopped and gave him a look. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9?\u201d Could he have picked a woman more opposite from me? Tall, dark, with a body to die for versus short, blond and a body . . .</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Richard grinned for the first time all evening.</p><p>I muttered a comment on his parentage and Richard actually chuckled. Finally, almost at the bottom of the stairs, he stopped and turned me to face him, serious again.</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2019s not going to want to give Flo up. Not till he\u2019s ready to discard her. And he\u2019s got to appear to be a strong leader. He can\u2019t risk angering Honoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo damn bad.\u201d Florence da Vinci discarded? This was so not like my roomie, always the power in any relationship. I wanted to run up and hug her, then wake her and try to reason with her again.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t reason with her, Glory. She thinks she\u2019s hooked Brad Pitt when Simon actually . . .\u201d Richard put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI call him Simon the snake. He\u2019s got the look of a reptile, complete with a forked tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God! I didn\u2019t want to hear that.\u201d I leaned against Richard for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to help Flo understand how dangerous this is.\u201d I inhaled Richard and thought about how nice it was to feel his arms around me. Yeah, I \u2019m an independent woman, but centuries of male companionship have left me with a case of attention deficit disorder. Male attention, got to have it. With Blade gone, Richard was doing nicely.</p><p>I sighed and pushed back. I\u2019d blocked that weak female moment from Richard and he was frowning at me, like he was afraid I\u2019d go off on my own and do something dangerous to get Simon to leave Flo alone. Fat chance. If Simon turned into Johnny Depp for me, I\u2019d probably hop on the altar and hand him the straw myself.</p> <p>We headed to the shop. Outside, I appreciated the cold air on my face before I unlocked the back door. Inside, the dogs were on high alert. I\u2019m sure Valdez at least could tell I was upset about something. Even Derek lost the twinkle in his eyes when he saw our faces. No customers. So we filled Derek in. He was on his cell phone before we finished. He and Frederick decided to call a vamp meeting. At Freddy\u2019s house.</p><p>As soon as she heard what they were talking about, CiCi refused to leave home. I didn\u2019t blame her. A fortress would be nice right now. With a moat, hungry alligators and rabid bats circling overhead.</p><p>I waited on a few customers while Derek and Richard powwowed in the back. I couldn\u2019t quit thinking about Flo. She\u2019d acted so unlike the powerful roomie who\u2019d painted strange things on my wall and taught me my best vamp moves. Hell, she hadn\u2019t even asked me about the TV interview or, gasp, the Louboutin pumps. I\u2019d give her the benefit of the doubt though. Maybe she\u2019d never bothered to check her messages.</p><p>By the time Lacy came in, I was beyond exhausted, mentally and physically. I trudged up the stairs a few minutes before dawn, arguing with Richard that he didn\u2019t need to sleep on my couch. Then I saw the door to the apartment. Wide open.</p><p>\u201cGlory, get back. Let me check things out.\u201d</p><p>I leaped over Valdez and ran down the hall to Flo\u2019s bedroom. I threw open the door. She was gone. I was just going through Flo\u2019s closet to see if she\u2019d taken any clothes with her when my cell phone rang. I pulled it out of my purse I\u2019d dumped on the floor in my panic. I didn\u2019t even bother to look at the caller ID.</p><p>\u201cFlo? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you really need to check your e-mail. I\u2019m waiting to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>I snapped the phone shut and threw it across the room.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d Richard dug the phone out of Flo\u2019s comforter and held it out to me. \u201cObviously not Florence. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Richard was right beside me in a heartbeat. He put his hand on my back. \u201cYou\u2019re even more upset than when you saw Florence had taken off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken off or been kidnapped?\u201d I sank on the side of the messy bed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take any clothes that I can see. Not even shoes.\u201d I gestured toward the usually neatly stacked shoeboxes. Flo is nothing if not meticulous about her wardrobe. And a creature of habit. If she wore a pair of shoes, she set the box on top with the lid off. The only empty shoe -box was from the pair she\u2019d worn out of here last night. The pair she wasn\u2019t wearing when she got home. And then there was the Manolo with the broken heel, the box with its mate casually dumped on the closet floor. Flo really hadn\u2019t been herself. Richard sat beside me and my phone rang again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer that.\u201d I grabbed the phone and shut it off.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s bothering you? Surely you would talk to Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Jerry.\u201d I felt tears welling and blinked them back. \u201cIt\u2019s Westwood. He started calling me. After I sent him that e-mail.\u201d I took a shaky breath. \u201cI think he has a crush on me. I should probably play along, try to get information for Jerry, but I just . . . can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Richard grabbed my phone and ran through the menu. \u201cHe left you a message.\u201d He put the phone to his ear, his frown becoming a cold, stony rage that scared me, even though I knew he wasn\u2019t mad at me.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard won\u2019t get away with this. We need to change your number for one thing. This is harassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. But I won\u2019t change my number. I should get up my nerve and see what I can find out from him. Jerry thinks Westwood may have left Africa. He needs to know where the hunter \u2019s going next.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to listen to know what the message said. Westwood had stuck to one theme, how lovely my dental work would look on the chain around his neck. Or maybe he\u2019d start a charm bracelet. For a future bride. He was thinking of marrying, he owed the world a passel of kids with his superior gray matter. She\u2019d have to be human, of course, and any woman he got serious about would hate vampires as much as he did.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sicko. I don\u2019t know how he made billions.\u201d I pushed off the bed and walked back into the living room. Valdez and Will studied me worriedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Flo?\u201d Valdez nudged my hip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, puppy.\u201d I sat down on the couch and put my feet on the coffee table. I got a good look at my Ferragamo slingbacks. Flo had helped me pick them out during a half -price sale. I burst into tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Noisy sobs. How humiliating, but I couldn\u2019t stop them.</p><p>\u201cGood God, Glory, I\u2019d hoped you weren\u2019t one of those weepy females.\u201d Will bumped my foot. \u201cFlo\u2019s tough, she\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Richard handed me a towel, though I don\u2019t remember him going into the bathroom to get it. I blotted my cheeks and sniffled until I felt like I had the waterworks under control.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guys. I guess I\u2019m on sensory overload. Between Westwood, the EVs and Flo, I feel like I\u2019ve got a full plate.\u201d Another tear ran down my cheek and I wiped it away. Full plate. Stupid. I couldn\u2019t even eat a bag of Cheetos without suffering stomach cramps that would have made the Marquis de Sade whimper.</p><p>\u201cI doubt Flo was kidnapped.\u201d Richard was up again, prowling around the apartment. \u201cShe wanted to be with Simon. I\u2019m sure she woke up from her nap and decided to go back to the EV compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout her shoes?\u201d My voice rose and I jumped to my feet. \u201cDamn it, Richard. Didn\u2019t you learn anything about my roommate while you were sleeping with her?\u201d</p><p>Richard shrugged and I wanted to slap him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t exactly get together to talk. I never had much conversation with the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, \u2018the woman\u2019 is my best friend. I\u2019m worried about her and I\u2019m going to do something about it.\u201d I stalked into Flo\u2019s bedroom and grabbed my purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going? It\u2019s almost dawn.\u201d Richard grabbed my arm, jerking me to a halt.</p><p>\u201cNowhere. I\u2019m exhausted and I\u2019m going to bed. But first\u201d\u2014I dragged a phone out of my purse\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to make a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Westwood.\u201d Richard grabbed for the phone, but I used a vamp move to dodge him.</p> <p>\u201cNope. This isn\u2019t my phone, it\u2019s Greg Kaplan\u2019s. And I just bet . . .\u201d I scrolled through his address book. Lots of women. A guy named Lucky and, oh, yes, Simon. I punched the button and heard the phone start ringing.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I heard a big sigh. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Glory. Simon saw this number on the caller ID and made me answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade you answer. Are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d I shoved at Richard who tried to grab the phone again. Of course he was practically breathing down my neck, listening too.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just decided I had to come back here. I left my new Calvin Klein stretch suede boots. So foolish of me. I shifted into my favorite bird and flew right out here.\u201d She laughed and I heard a male voice in the background. \u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s too close to dawn for me to leave now. So I stay. You go to sleep and quit worrying about me. Tell Richard too. Simon is taking good care of me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hung up.</p><p>\"What do you think?\u201d I snapped the phone shut and looked at Richard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she\u2019s in no danger yet. Obviously Simon is enjoying her company and she\u2019s no worse for wear if she had enough power left to shape-shift.\u201d He gestured and I gave him Greg\u2019s phone. \u201cLet me look at this. I\u2019ll see what I can find out from these numbers.\u201d Richard was looking as exhausted as I felt. Valdez and Will had settled on either side of the door, Will obviously out like a light.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d I took the phone and set it on the coffee table. \u201cYou want to crash on Flo\u2019s bed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather crash on yours.\u201d Richard ran his hand across my cheek to my ear. \u201cJust sleep. Too close to dawn for anything else.\u201d</p><p>I knew it wasn\u2019t a good idea to sleep in the same bed with him. And I sure wasn\u2019t in the mood for sex with anyone, not even Richard who was looking really good to me. Kind of like Spike on Buffy good. Have you seen his calendar?</p><p>\u201cFine. But you\u2019re sleeping in your clothes.\u201d Silly. We\u2019d both be dead to the world as soon as the sun hit the horizon which, according to my body clock, was about three minutes from now. Hey, we both needed to lighten up after all this angst. Richard played along, though he was obviously still worried. \u201cAnd what are you sleeping in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d I strutted to my bedroom and slammed the door. Sexless or sexy? I rummaged in a drawer until I found the perfect thing. By the time I opened the door again, I could hardly keep my eyes open.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed, Richard.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a full-throated belly laugh that made me smile. Who knew this intense, complicated man could laugh until he cried. I liked him even more, especially when he brushed past me, just close enough for me to feel his interest. The man was obviously insane. He\u2019d have to be to make a pass at a woman in Smurfs footie pajamas. Sixteen</p><p>I was hot, stifling, and I couldn\u2019t wiggle my toes. My arms were weighed down, pinned to the bed. Not fair. Not with Johnny Depp just inches away and snoring softly. I wanted to wake him with a surprise. Me, wrapped in nothing but my birthday suit. I pushed and finally managed to get an arm free. If I could just touch him . . .</p><p>\u201cWatch where you put that hand, Glory.\u201d</p> <p>I sprang out of bed like I\u2019d been shot from a cannon. \u201cValdez?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one and only.\u201d My dog lay on top of the covers in the center of the bed. The other pillow, where I could have sworn I\u2019d left Richard when I\u2019d closed my eyes, was empty.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Richard?\u201d</p><p>Valdez jumped off the bed and stretched. \u201cOn the phone.\u201d He trotted across the room and nosed open the door. \u201cCheck it out.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at what had to be the world\u2019s ugliest pajamas and shook my head. \u201cIn a minute.\u201d I headed for the bathroom, taking my makeup bag and a robe with me. I could see Richard, his back to me as he paced the living room, a cell phone to his ear. I wasn\u2019t about to let him see me again until I\u2019d gotten rid of these awful pj\u2019s. Five minutes later I strolled into the living room, the empty living room. I sniffed. Bacon? Had Richard cooked?</p><p>\u201cRichard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d Will came out of the kitchen. Human Will, not dog Will. Naked except for a frilly pink apron tied around his lean middle. Flo had bought the apron for me as a joke after I\u2019d filled the apartment with smoke trying to cook for Valdez. I\u2019d never worn it. And Will . . . Let\u2019s just say it was simply not covering all that it should.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an emergency.\u201d Will grinned, way too charming with his red hair, tanned face and, oh, yeah, bare chest and washboard abs. \u201cThe doodle and I were starving and Mainwaring sure wasn\u2019t going to feed us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill\u2019s a decent cook, Glory. What could it hurt to let him shift some while he\u2019s here?\u201d Valdez emerged from the kitchen smacking his lips.</p><p>I looked past Will to the pile of dirty dishes in the sink. I would not look at his bare bum as I headed for the fridge and a Fangtastic.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Blade\u2019s rules? He\u2019s going to flip when he hears about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he have to know?\u201d Will slung his arm around me. \u201cCome on, Glory, lass. Where\u2019s the harm?\u201d He glanced at the bottle I\u2019d just opened and wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou could at least spring for a better quality hooch. There \u2019s a new brew out of Czechoslovakia that\u2019ll knock your cute little socks off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave the charm for Blade when he hears about this.\u201d I took a swallow. A Czechoslovakian synthetic? Hmm. \u201cAnd I will tell him unless you leave this kitchen spotless then shift back pronto.\u201d I put some space between us. \u201cAnd don\u2019t touch me.\u201d I flashed back to the whole tit-grabbing incident. I\u2019d knocked Will on his ass then. But I\u2019d had the element of surprise. Who knew an</p><p>actress wouldn\u2019t have welcomed the Kilpatrick\u2019s son\u2019s attentions?</p><p>\u201cGlory, lass, now don\u2019t be hasty.\u201d Will was still smiling. I knew that because I simply was not going to look at him below the neck.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck in dog body for weeks at a time and you expect me to wear clothes?\u201d Will turned on the faucet and squirted dish washing liquid into the sink.</p><p>I gave his toned butt a five second, okay, a ten second, appraisal then turned my back to him.</p><p>\u201cAsk Valdez. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s naked under that fur coat. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much information.\u201d Dogs. I had dog bodyguards. Not hunky men who looked like extras in a gladiator movie. \u201cClean up.\u201d</p><p>Oh, what the hell. \u201cDo the bathroom too, then shift back. And stay that way unless I ask you to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever. You\u2019re the boss.\u201d I heard more grumbling as I headed to the bedroom to get dressed for the night.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him shift too often, Glory.\u201d Valdez was right on my heels. \u201cShifting takes a lot of power. He needs to save it for defense.\u201d</p><p>I paused and studied Valdez\u2019s soft brown eyes. What did he look like in human form? Dark haired, with the Latin look the name suggested? But he was the latest in a long line of Valdezes. So the name didn\u2019t have that kind of significance. His eyes gleamed and I knew he was reading my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to shift, Glory? Blade forbids it, but I\u2019m willing to keep it our secret.\u201d He wagged his tail and I swear he grinned. \u201cGot to warn you, though, that Will\u2019s right. I am naked.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the door in his furry face. Not thinking about Valdez. Definitely not thinking about Valdez as naked man. I concentrated on the contents of my closet. What to wear to a vamp meeting? A form-fitting, black, seventies jump suit. Loved the bell-bottoms and it had a cute chain belt I could whack Will with if he dared shift in public. Will was a loose cannon and now he \u2019d given Valdez ideas.</p><p>Should I call Blade and tell him my canines were going cowboy on me? But Blade was busy following Westwood and he really didn\u2019t need to hear me whine about how I couldn\u2019t control my own dogs. Besides, I could always threaten to get Blade to dock Will\u2019s pay. And Will could cook, take on more housework. I should bring a pair of jeans up from the shop for him to wear. He looked like he took a thirty-four long.</p><p>By the time the three of us trooped downstairs, a sulky Will was safely back in dog form and complaining that scrubbing the shower had ruined his hands. I\u2019d convinced myself that having him shift on command might not be a bad thing. He bumped against my leg, dotting the black gabardine with white dog hair. I had visions of Will on his knees with a lint roller. Not a bad thing at all.</p><p>\"You see? I\u2019m fine. Nothing to worry about.\u201d Flo had zipped into the shop a few minutes after I\u2019d taken over from my mortal parttimer. \u201cI finally checked my voice mail. Where are those shoes?\u201d</p><p>So far no customers had mentioned that we\u2019d made the TV news but the weekend roundup was still a possibility. Melanie, the part-timer, had let me know an art student was interested in the mural and wanted permission to photograph it. Something about a dissertation. I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea, but had agreed to meet with the man later. Now I told Flo about the TV interview and the art student right after we made a deal on the suede pumps. She\u2019d loved them and, even after giving her the family discount, I\u2019d made a tidy profit.</p><p>Flo cradled the shoe box to her chest and grinned. \u201cSo my mural will be famous. Edvard would be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the Sistine Chapel. You really think decorating the wall of a vintage clothing shop would please Edvard? \u201d I smiled, though, because Flo did seem like her old self, complete with fresh outfit and matching Stuart Weitzman pumps. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail, showing off her high cheekbones and porcelain skin. One male customer was lingering by the suits just to watch her breathe. I gave him a questioning look and he left. I almost called him back. I didn\u2019t mean to run off a potential customer, but I also didn\u2019t need someone eavesdropping on my conversation with Flo either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEdvard wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d Flo trailed a finger across the wall just where the man\u2019s neck met the vampire\u2019s lips. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mind anything I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of things you do . . .\u201d I checked out another pair of customers flipping through a dress rack. Okay, I had my limits.</p><p>\u201cForget it. I\u2019ve arranged for Lacy to take over at midnight. Will you meet me at the apartment then?\u201d</p> <p>Flo glanced at her watch. \u201cI guess I could watch a DVD for a while, but don\u2019t keep me waiting. I have a date later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Simon?\u201d I wished Flo would move on like she usually did. If she stayed with her normal pattern, Simon probably had only another week or two at the most anyway. But would he let her go? And now there was this whole Brad Pitt thing going on. I kept up a block so Flo couldn\u2019t read my mind and start an argument I didn\u2019t feel like finishing.</p><p>\u201cYes, with Simon.\u201d Flo picked up a pearl necklace, ran it across her teeth, then put it back. \u201cFake. Simon has promised me a special gift. Remember, I told you I wanted a man who would give me good jewelry.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI think I finally found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell.\u201d This was the pits. Of course Simon could afford real pearls, diamonds, whatever. He was a damned drug dealer. I glanced at the women again and was relieved to see them head for the dressing rooms. I grabbed Flo\u2019s arm and pulled her toward the back.</p><p>\u201cHoney, do you remember what happened last night?\u201d</p> <p>Flo looked down at where I gripped her arm. \u201cCareful, Glory, this is my favorite cashmere sweater. Don\u2019t you love the color?</p><p>Apple green.\u201d She smoothed the soft knit. \u201cSimon says it makes my eyes sparkle like emeralds. He is always saying things like that. Sweet compliments. He\u2019ll be sure to notice how these brown suede jeans fit me.\u201d She turned to show me. \u201cWhat do you think?</p><p>Does my butt look too big?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo, a size six butt is not considered big by anyone\u2019s standards other than someone size zero and you know how we feel about</p><p>those people.\u201d I bet Beyonc\u00e9 had a size zero butt and I really didn\u2019t want to think about that now. \u201cPlease concentrate, Flo. You were zonked last night. You acted . . . drugged.\u201d</p><p>Flo just waved her hand. \u201cNonsense. It was near dawn. I was exhausted from a night of very intense lovemaking.\u201d She glanced toward the dressing rooms. \u201cSimon is a stallion. My God. And his tongue . . .\u201d She shivered and I fought back a gag.</p> <p>\u201cDid you take any of that Vampire Viagra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why not? Simon passes it out like it \u2019s candy.\u201d She ran her hand down the pearl buttons on her cardigan, \u201cI surpassed myself.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cI had him weeping, Glory. The king of the EVs. Simon Destiny. Kissing my feet and declaring that I was the best lover he had ever had.\u201d She had a dreamy look that gave me chills. \u201cIsn\u2019t that incredible? You should try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe VV of course.\u201d Flo laughed merrily and patted my cheek. \u201cNot Simon. He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>As if I wanted to go within a mile of the reptilian creep. \u201cAbout Simon.\u201d I poked my roommate in the general location of her navel. \u201cYou\u2019ve been giving him your power, haven\u2019t you? To make the VV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I don\u2019t give my power to anyone.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and pulled up Flo\u2019s sweater. Flat tummy, damn her, but no telltale marks. Obviously the evidence faded with the healing vampire sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for, Glory? I\u2019m not giving him my power. Simon has drones for that. Stupid vampires who are hooked on his drugs. He\u2019s a businessman, Glory. He sells things, just like you do.\u201d Flo jerked down her sweater, careful to smooth it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re comparing me to a drug dealer?\u201d I didn\u2019t appreciate that comparison one damned bit and let her see how much in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory. You know what I meant. We\u2019re best friends. Right?\u201d Flo backed away from me and smoothed her sweater again.</p><p>\u201cI think your customers need you. I\u2019ll see you later. I think I\u2019ll watch Ocean\u2019s Eleven.\u201d She turned on her heel and waved from the door, the bells tinkling as the door closed behind her.</p><p>I just stared. Simon was just like me? I wanted to run after my \u201cbest friend\u201d and drag her back by her cute little ponytail. But she\u2019d disappeared, probably already upstairs using her vamp speed. The fact that at least one pedestrian might have seen her apparently hadn\u2019t slowed her down. Had to get to that Brad Pitt movie.</p><p>Damn it, she was out of control. Valdez and Will gave me a look, but didn\u2019t speak since the mortals were out of the dressing room and whipping out their charge cards.</p><p>After the women left, I seethed. So that was my excuse when I overreacted just a bit at the sight of the art student. Young, academic type, complete with tinted glasses and a stake in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Glory.\u201d Will stood on one side of the body, Valdez on the other.</p><p>Valdez nudged the glasses lying on the floor beside the unconscious man. \u201cI hate to tell you this, but these are regular tinted reading glasses. I read the guy\u2019s mind. Nothing in there but artsie-fartsie stuff. The guy\u2019s really deep into his dissertation on paranormal figures in art.\u201d</p><p>Will bit the wooden handle poking out of the man \u2019s pocket and pulled, dropping the thing at my feet. \u201cHere\u2019s his stake. Disguised as a paint brush.\u201d He grinned. \u201cCheck out the traces of red on the bristles. Might be the blood of all the vampires he\u2019s killed with it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t waste time with a clever comeback. Instead, I ran to the door and locked it, about a minute later than I should have. At least no customers had witnessed me going completely insane. I dragged the man to the back room. He didn\u2019t wake up. I pulled a cold bottle of water from the fridge and dumped some on a paper towel, then knelt down to press it on the man\u2019s closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cHello? Are you okay?\u201d What had Melanie said his name was? Larry. Larry LeFevre. \u201cCome on, Larry. Open your eyes.\u201d The man\u2019s pale blond lashes fluttered. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Wake up, Larry.\u201d I picked up his head and held the water bottle to his trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha . . . What happened?\u201d Larry took the bottle and held it against his forehead where a lump the size of a dime was rapidly swelling to quarter size.</p><p>\u201cFreak accident.\u201d I helped him to his feet and watched him sway for a minute. Right. Glory the impulsive freak had accidentally bopped art boy with an art nouveau bronze titled Reclining Nude.</p><p>\u201cAccident?\u201d Oh, great, he was looking green like maybe he\u2019d puke. I slid a trash can near him, just in case. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Larry groped his face and I remembered to hand him his glasses.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Not broken, thank goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Eye strain. Too much time on the computer. But the dissertation\u2019s due in a few months.\u201d He took a shaky breath and sat on the stool, obviously still wobbly. Him, not the stool. \u201cWhat kind of accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned and you just walked into this lovely work of art.\u201d I pressed the statue I\u2019d used as a weapon into his trembling hands.</p><p>\u201cFortunately the piece is undamaged. I don\u2019t want to think what could have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . good.\u201d He stared at the bronze, his thumb absentmindedly stroking the curve of the woman \u2019s voluptuous hip. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours. In apology. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d I looked into his eyes. Yep. I could read his mind now that I stopped long enough to check. He was still a little dazed. Headache. Confusion. The statue. Wished he had a girlfriend with that kind of figure. Sally didn\u2019t have curves, she had angles. But she gave the best\u2014</p><p>\u201cLarry!\u201d I\u2019d just read way too much. I do hate to intrude that way.</p><p>\u201cUh, the mural . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can use the mural for your dissertation. Come back during the day.\u201d When I\u2019m not here. \u201cI\u2019ll leave word to give you full access.\u201d I kept a hand under his elbow and walked him to the door, then reached to flip open the dead bolt.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d I grabbed a piece of bubble wrap and a bag and had the statue back in his hands before he knew which way was up. \u201cHere. Take it, please. It\u2019s the least I can do after wounding you.\u201d I checked in on his scattered thoughts. The man needed aspirin. He looked down and picked up the paint brush and stuck it in his pocket again. Sally \u2019s paint brush. He was supposed to stop by her place with it. Now he couldn\u2019t wait to show her the statue. It was erotic. Maybe it would inspire her to give him a\u2014</p><p>\u201cLarry! Maybe you should go home. Take an aspirin or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, Ms. St. Clair. Thanks. Really.\u201d Larry pulled open the door and took a deep breath of cold air. His head didn\u2019t hurt so bad that he couldn\u2019t get up for one of Sally\u2019s world class bl\u2014</p><p>\u201cBye, Larry. Take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He hurried out the door before I could change my mind. He knew just where he \u2019d put the statue. Right next to his Ert\u00e9 print. Blah, blah, blah, more art stuff. I slammed the door shut and leaned against it. Way too much information. And who knew academic types thought below their belts just like macho vamps did?</p><p>\u201cGlad that\u2019s over.\u201d I smiled at the dogs. \u201cWhoa. I\u2019ve got to relax. I can\u2019t believe I did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Glory.\u201d Will wagged his tail. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman hiding under the bench in one of the fitting rooms. She ran in there when you turned into a psycho bitch.\u201d Will did a dog version of a chuckle, half bark, half snort.</p><p>\u201cJust do the whammy on her, Glory. She was looking at that black velvet coat over there when the shit hit the fan.\u201d</p><p>Valdez trotted to the curtain and nudged it aside with his nose.</p><p>\u201cYou mean when I hit Larry.\u201d I pulled the wild-eyed, trembling woman out from under the bench. She had on worn jeans and a pink sweater that was only slightly less fuzzy than her over-processed hair. I stared into her pale blue eyes until she was under then led her to the rack where the velvet coat still hung. I looked into her eyes again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy you found the velvet coat you were looking for. And even happier that it\u2019s on sale, half price.\u201d I reached up and touched one of her split ends. \u201cYou\u2019ll use the money you saved to get your hair done by a professional. \u201d The woman nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow shop.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled and pulled the coat off the rack. \u201cThis is just what I was looking for. And half price!\u201d She brought it to the counter and dug in her purse for her wallet. \u201cYou know a good hair dresser?\u201d She nodded toward my shoulder length curls. \u201cI\u2019d love a new look before I go home with my new boyfriend at Thanksgiving.\u201d She made a face. \u201cMeeting his parents.\u201d</p> <p>I pulled out a business card. \u201cHere, tell Reza that Glory sent you.\u201d Reza\u2019s a werecat buddy of Lacy\u2019s who had a beauty shop a few blocks away. \u201cGood luck with the parents.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as the woman left and more customers came in. Business was booming, thank God. I was really glad to see Lacy at midnight. She usually didn\u2019t work at night, but when I\u2019d told her about Flo and the meeting at Freddy\u2019s, she\u2019d insisted I let her fill in for me.</p><p>Now to deal with Flo. I wanted her to go to the meeting with me and GET A CLUE about what she was mixed up in with Simon. I hurried up the stairs, the dogs at my heels. I could hear the television even before I opened the door. And laughter. Flo\u2019s merry tinkle and a deeper laugh.</p><p>I stopped in front of the door, scared that I was about to meet Simon Destiny. Would my dogs be strong enough to keep me from being dragged away into his den of drug dealing tummy-suckers?</p><p>But it was just Damian sitting beside his sister, laughing at an old Seinfeld episode. The one where Jerry and Elaine make a vow of abstinence. They were even worse at abstinence than I was. It was a good episode and if I didn \u2019t have the meeting to go to, I would have enjoyed sinking down on the couch with a cold glass of Fangtastic in my hand and laughing out loud with them.</p> <p>\u201cMeeting tonight. Are you going, Flo?\u201d I kept my purse slung over my shoulder. \u201cWe need to leave in five minutes or less.\u201d</p><p>Damian grabbed the remote from Flo and the TV went dark and silent.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Damian. We\u2019re just getting to the best part. I want to see who caves first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget caving, Florence. Glory and I want to talk to you. About your involvement with Simon.\u201d Damian pulled his sister to her feet. \u201cLook at me, cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Damian. Simon\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. I already told Glory that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did Glory tell you the EVs sent a man for her? That he threatened her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that he actually threatened me.\u201d Sometimes I\u2019m stupidly honest. \u201cBut Greg wanted me to come with him to the EV headquarters. He\u2019s been stalking me. Giving me those headaches. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg. Yes, I have met such a one. A drone. Pay him no attention.\u201d Flo smiled. \u201cHe has no power so he looks for powerful ones to bring to Simon. But Simon would never have him take someone against their will. \u201d Flo looked at Damian. \u201cYou two are getting worked up for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe EVs are drug dealers, Florence. I don\u2019t consider that nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Damian\u201d\u2014Flo patted his cheek\u2014\u201cI remember that you tried the Vampire Viagra yourself before it was called by that silly name. We bought some from Juan Carlos in Madrid. It was not so bad, no? I had my lover El Greco and you.\u201d Flo grinned. \u201cI think you had a harem back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely six or seven . . .\u201d Damian shook his head. \u201cI hated the drug. I was like a bull, mating any female who would bend over for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is that such a bad thing?\u201d Florence actually laughed, while I just stood there with my mouth open. Damian is nothing if not suave and sophisticated, especially when it came to seduction. The VV must have really done a number on him to turn him into a rutting beast.</p><p>\u201cCome to the meeting with us, Flo. With the area vampires. About Westwood and about the EVs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are we forming a posse? Will you run them out of town?\u201d Flo frowned and picked up her purse. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your meeting. And as for Westwood, if you want him terminated, you should talk to Simon. I think he could arrange anything.\u201d</p> <p>And Flo was out the door. Damian and I just looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always out of control.\u201d Damian threw the remote control on the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I told Richard I would drive you to the meeting. The dogs too. I brought the big Mercedes. \u201d He looked down at Valdez. \u201cYou two will ride in the back and you\u2019d better not put paw prints on my leather seats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t park next to a puddle.\u201d Valdez sniffed and followed me out the door. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Flo, Glory. She\u2019s way more into this guy than she usually is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I turned and locked the door after the four of us were in the hall. \u201cBut what can we do about it? She\u2019s an adult. And she didn\u2019t ask for our interference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t ask, but she\u2019s going to get it.\u201d Damian ran down the stairs. \u201cAnd if it takes a posse to get rid of the EVs, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have. Vigilante justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you weren\u2019t watching Seinfeld all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Flo\u2019s got a thing for Brad Pitt. Says Simon reminds her of him. She couldn \u2019t find the movie she wanted so we started with Legends of the Fall.\u201d Damian turned and grinned at me. \u201cDid the posse thing give us away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Over a dozen vampires crowded into Freddy and CiCi\u2019s living room. Damian had dropped the dogs and me off in front while he\u2019d gone in search of a parking place. The house was near enough to the University of Texas that, even at 1:00 a.m., the street was lined with cars. Music and laughter from a house three doors down probably meant students lived there. There was no music or laughter coming from Freddy\u2019s house, but plenty of loud conversation. That stopped when I entered the room, trailed by Will and Valdez.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I checked out the crowd. CiCi looked distressed. Derek and Freddy amused. The silent majority accusing. Or was I being paranoid? I grabbed a Baccarat crystal goblet of Fangtastic from a silver tray and sniffed appreciatively. AB negative, my favorite.</p><p>\u201cThere she goes again. I told you I saw fangs.\u201d Darren, the professor type Valdez had saved from the fire, pointed at me. \u201cRun it again, Derek. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I gingerly touched my tongue to one of my fangs. \u201cSo? I\u2019m among . . . friends. If I can\u2019t show fang here, where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTV, Glory. The station\u2019s Web site has your segment up.\u201d Derek gestured toward his laptop set up on the dining room table visible through an archway. \u201cFang, honey, on TV and on the Internet. We all saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that painting!\u201d A female vamp I\u2019d met a few times before was obviously upset. I\u2019m terrible with names, but I remembered her hair, desperately in need of a trim. I mean, the hippie, \u201chair down to your butt\u201d look was so over.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the painting? My customers love it.\u201d I took a sip and sighed. Times like these, I thought about hooking up with a rich vampire (okay, a rich vampire like Blade) and letting him actually take care of me. Imagine AB neg every night.</p><p>\u201cA vampire painting, Glory.\u201d Another woman, a friend this time, Diana from Mugs and Muffins, chimed in. \u201cI love Flo, but how could you let her paint vampires on your wall? Why not just post a sign? \u2018Stake me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s art. Decoration for the shop. No one takes it seriously. Hey, aren\u2019t we here to discuss the EVs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory\u2019s right.\u201d Freddy looked at Derek. \u201cWe\u2019re here because the EVs have invaded Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an exaggeration, isn\u2019t it, Frederick?\u201d An older vamp who obviously didn\u2019t care that he was playing into the stereotype, stepped forward, one hand in the pocket of his black velvet blazer. He could have been Bela Lugosi\u2019s twin with his dead white skin and slicked back hair. He must have left his cape in the car. \u201cThere are only a dozen EVs. Hardly an invading horde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dozen or one. What they represent is a danger to all of us. And they have plenty of followers.\u201d Freddy glanced at his mother. What was up with CiCi anyway? She\u2019d sunk into a chair, her hand shaking as she drained her goblet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an EV?\u201d Diana, bless her, hadn\u2019t been clued in. It was nice not to be the dumbest blonde in the room for a change.</p><p>\u201cEnergy Vampires.\u201d CiCi shuddered. \u201cThey take a vampire\u2019s power and use it for the most unspeakable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire Viagra. Can you believe it?\u201d I should have known Will had been quiet long enough. Diana laughed, obviously thinking this was a huge joke. But a quick glance around the room made it clear the majority of the vamps knew exactly who and what EVs were and what their main product could do.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Di.\u201d I took pity on her. \u201cFlo\u2019s involved with their leader, Simon Destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d CiCi gasped. \u201cFrederick, you didn\u2019t tell me Simon was here.\u201d She put her hand to her throat and, even across the room, I could see the frantic pounding of her pulse. She was really agitated. Vamp\u2019s hearts usually thump along at about half mortal speed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother, I didn\u2019t. Even if he moved in next door, neither of us needs to see him. \u201d Frederick made a vamp move to his mother\u2019s side and held onto her hand.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s your father.\u201d Richard spoke from the doorway.</p><p>Oh, boy. Talk about your bombshells. I met Richard \u2019s gaze. Forget reading his mind. Everywhere I looked vamps \u2019 minds snapped shut, tight as the lid on a coffin.</p><p>\"EVs can reproduce?\u201d Diana was determined to be the voice of ignorance. \u201cIs Freddy an Energy Vampire?\u201d</p><p>\"EVs must be born vampires. Just like\u201d\u2014CiCi glanced down\u2014\u201cWill here.\u201d CiCi held onto Freddy\u2019s hand, her knuckles white. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTheir special gifts, if you want to call it that, are secrets handed down to members of what they call a council.

CiCi\u2019s like a mother to me, the kind I wish I\u2019d had but never did.</p> <p>\u201cSimon enchanted me. Our affair was brief, very intense. I knew he was vampire. That was part of his allure, of course. \u201d Nods all around. CiCi visibly calmed herself. \u201cI became pregnant. Simon was delighted. Any child of his would be vampire some day. I was merely a convenience for Simon, a worthy vessel.\u201d CiCi\u2019s mouth had a bitter twist. \u201cI was supposed to be honored and happy to give him my child to raise.\u201d</p><p>Freddy squeezed his mother\u2019s hand. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Simon miscalculated when he chose me as his brood mare. Once my enchantment with him wore off, I saw how cruel he could be. I ran away before Frederick was born. And married Count von Repsdorf who was old and desperate for an heir. He loved me and was very kind.\u201d CiCi had a sad smile. \u201cBut he died soon after Frederick was born, set upon by footpads. Simon\u2019s work, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Simon didn\u2019t claim his child then?\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. What a story!</p><p>\u201cI was terrified that he would, but Simon wasn \u2019t really interested in a baby, only in the man Frederick would become, the vampire he would become. So Simon bided his time.\u201d A tear ran down CiCi\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhen Frederick turned, I had to become vampire as well. I couldn\u2019t leave my child alone to live forever with such a father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mother.\u201d</p><p>CiCi smiled at her son. \u201cNo regrets. But I don\u2019t want any of you to underestimate Simon. He\u2019s very powerful. And ruthless. Even then he was involved with the EVs, a mere follower, not yet on the council. He has worked his way up in the group. \u201d She swept the room with an intense gaze and no one looked away. \u201cFrederick and I have managed to live our own lives for centuries, but periodically Simon approaches Frederick again. I think he is almost proud that his son is not easily swayed to follow in his footsteps. But he is convinced Frederick should join the EVs. If you know anything about them, then you know they will do anything for Honoria, their . . . demon.\u201d CiCi shuddered.</p><p>\u201cSee? I was right to be worried. We need to get Flo away from him.\u201d I sent CiCi a mental sympathy card.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. The man works tirelessly to please Honoria. Who do you think invented this\u201d\u2014CiCi wrinkled her elegant nose\u2014</p><p>\u201cVampire Viagra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d Di gave Damian a sideways glance. They had a history, pretty hot to hear her tell it. But Damian had fidelity issues. Enough said. \u201cVampires don\u2019t need Viagra. At least not one I\u2019ve ever slept with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not, my dear.\u201d Bela glided closer. \u201cNot unless they had an unfortunate accident before they were turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn vampires like me never have performance issues.\u201d Will bumped against Diana. \u201cWhen I get through with this gig, we can hook up and I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d Diana\u2019s glance shouted save me!</p><p>I just shrugged. When she saw Will in human form, she\u2019d probably be more than happy to give him a spin on her pillow top. He had Mara\u2019s beauty and a masculine build I\u2019d just recently been reminded rated a ten on the yummy meter. I looked down to where his tail brushed against me. Even his dog form was cute. Not that I\u2019d ever be interested. Will wasn\u2019t through. \u201cWith made vampires\u201d\u2014he sniffed in Bela\u2019s direction\u2014\u201cperformance is a crap shoot.\u201d</p><p>I swear I was getting a muzzle for my number two dog.</p><p>\u201cAre you implying\u2014\u201d Bela\u2019s fangs were suddenly huge in his dead white face. Did he have on lipstick?</p><p>Valdez jumped between them. \u201cAre you going to waste your time on a dog?\u201d He grinned and wagged his tail. \u201cObviously, this one\u2019s talking out of his ass. Look at him.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. I\u2019d never have suspected Valdez would lift a paw to protect Will. Then Valdez looked at me. Oh, yeah, he was doing this for me. Because he felt I needed backup. Hey, I appreciated it. I patted his head when he trotted back to my side. The room filled with loud discussions and it quickly became obvious it was a made versus born standoff. We were about evenly divided. Valdez, being the only shifter, just stayed by my side and I was happy to rub his ears and watch the escalating arguments. At least I wasn\u2019t the cause this time. It was obvious born vamps considered themselves above us \u201cmade\u201d types. No news there. Mara had drilled that into me from day one at the Campbell homestead.</p> <p>Will was nose to nose with Bela again. \u201cYou want to make a bet on that? I got five hundred that says I can knock you flat on your ass even in this dog form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, you two. No pissing contests in CiCi\u2019s living room.\u201d I jumped between them. Maybe not my smartest move, but I was surrounded by friends here.</p><p>\u201cCan we get back to business?\u201d Damian\u2019s raised voice silenced the crowd. \u201cRichard, will you tell them what you know about the EVs and their work?\u201d Damian looked around the room. \u201cRichard has been on their trail for decades. He followed them here from Argentina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Richard smiled apologetically at Freddy and CiCi. \u201cThe EVs will stop at nothing to get the power they need to make their drugs. The Vampire Viagra is the most lucrative, but not the only thing they make. The Demon Honoria has a full bag of tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do they make?\u201d God, could Diana be any more clueless? But I smiled at her because I had the same question. She\u2019d just been faster with it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been working on a daylight drug. Last I knew, he hadn\u2019t succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaylight drug. So a vampire could survive the sun\u2019s rays?\u201d Now this was interesting. The Viagra thing didn\u2019t do it for me\u2014hey, I\u2019m hot enough without it\u2014but to be able to feel the sun on my face for real . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he claims. But more than one vampire has been killed trying to use it. \u201d Richard was beside me, his hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. Vampires have given him fortunes and then expired anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s harsh.\u201d Will stayed close to Diana.</p><p>\u201cBut get this, Diana. The EVs take power from vampires to make their drugs. And they\u2019ve been after me.\u201d I almost fell back as every eye swung my way. Whoa! Nobody can do intense like a vampire.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Diana ran to my side. \u201cWhat happened? Honey, are you all right?\u201d Diana has a southern thing going on. Part of her charm. Will sure thought so. He edged closer and, if he put his shiny black nose under her skirt, it was going to be no shifting and generic dog food for a week. He got my mental message because he eased away from her and gave me a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. But they sent someone to try to persuade me to come see them. Since I don\u2019t shape-shift, the EVs figure I have lots of stored power.\u201d Would I be a greedy slut if I took a third glass of Fangtastic? To hell with it. I picked up a refill and sipped.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Florence tell you that too?\u201d Richard was serious on a stick.</p><p>\u201cYes. Simon taught her how to check a vamp\u2019s power level. I\u2019m off the charts.\u201d I felt Valdez push against my legs. \u201cSo I\u2019m being careful. He won\u2019t get to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho came after you?\u201d Diana was a good friend and she looked really worried.</p><p>\u201cGreg Kaplan.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cWe were . . . together years ago. Now he\u2019s hooked on the Vamp Viagra, so he does jobs for the EVs in exchange for the VV. If any of you know him, don\u2019t let Greg get anywhere near you. He\u2019ll try to lure you back for a little power draining.\u201d There were a few nods. So maybe I wasn\u2019t the only one Greg had approached.</p><p>\u201cAnd, folks, don\u2019t kid yourselves. After a session with the EVs, a vampire can be greatly weakened. No shifting. No preternatural speed.\u201d Richard swept his gaze around the room.</p><p>\u201cHell, you\u2019d be pretty defenseless.\u201d Diana bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Richard nodded. \u201cFrederick, you\u2019re Simon\u2019s son. And I don\u2019t doubt your being here is one reason he chose to come to Austin. Has he approached you to join the council since he got here? I\u2019ve heard they have an opening. Apparently one of the EVs believed his own hype and met the sun with disastrous results.\u201d Richard ignored CiCi\u2019s gasp and focused on Freddy. Darling Freddy, who could make me laugh, was a wonderful friend and had the best mom in the world, didn \u2019t crack a smile. Everyone in the room but Freddy\u2019s mom and me stared at him like he\u2019d morph into a creepy creature with a forked tongue at any moment.</p><p>\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t approached me yet. This time.\u201d Freddy looked at his mother. \u201cAnd if he did, Mother, I\u2019d tell him I\u2019m not interested. Just like I have all the other times he\u2019s tried to play the \u2018father\u2019 card. Why would I want to join a group that obeys a female demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir secrets don\u2019t have to be used for evil, Frederick. If you joined them, you could\u2014\u201d Richard winced when CiCi grabbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t hear any more of this. Frederick will not be your spy. The EVs would kill him, Simon \u2019s son or not, if he betrayed them.\u201d CiCi faced off with Richard. \u201cWage your own war, priest, and leave us out of this.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now Diana was really goggle-eyed. Maybe not everyone knew Richard had been a priest once. Every woman in the room checked out his buff bod, nicely showcased in worn jeans and black T-shirt. He obviously hadn\u2019t taken anyone\u2019s confession in a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cVery well. We\u2019ll keep Frederick\u2019s relationship with his father out of this.\u201d Richard nodded. \u201cBut we have to do something. We know they want Gloriana, but any one of you might be powerful enough to interest them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That made things clear enough. And now I had to sit down. But I jumped up again immediately. The buzz from three glasses of Fangtastic will do that to you.</p><p>\u201cI suppose they would trade power for the VV.\u201d Will pressed on my other side. \u201cNot that anyone in this room actually needs the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to need it, to want it.\u201d Bela spoke up. \u201cI tried it many years ago. Before it took on the trendy name. \u201d He shrugged. \u201cThis Viagra craze is new. The EVs could enhance pleasure long before mortals realized they could do something about performance issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you want it, if you don\u2019t need it?\u201d Thank you, Diana. Now every vamp in the room was on the edge of his or her proverbial seat.</p><p>\u201cIt takes sex to a whole new level. For a man or a woman. I won \u2019t deny it\u2019s an unforgettable experience. I\u2019d definitely try it again with the right woman.\u201d Bela picked up Diana\u2019s hand and I wanted her to jerk it away. His lips brushed her palm and, hello, Damian was right there, between them, before I could blink.</p><p>\"We get it, Ralph.\u201d</p><p>Ralph? Bela Lugosi\u2019s name was Ralph? I hid a smile. There was nothing funny happening in this room. And nothing concrete being done about our problem either. At least we\u2019d put these vampires on alert. Unfortunately, we\u2019d probably also given them reason to run for the nearest VV supplier. I looked at Richard. He wasn\u2019t getting the cooperation he\u2019d hoped for.</p><p>\u201cThe VV can be addictive, people, and is as expensive as hell. I think it \u2019s time to put these drug runners out of business for good. Or at least get them away from here. But I can\u2019t do it alone. I need your help. To find the EV headquarters for starters.\u201d He nodded at several male vamps who maybe were thinking about jumping on the \u201crun the EVs out of town\u201d bandwagon. It was a start anyway. \u201cI know you\u2019ll all spread the word to be careful to any vampire who couldn\u2019t be here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre only vampires at risk? Can the EVs take power from other paranormals?\u201d I was thinking about Lacy or even Valdez.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to prefer vampires. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve taken power from a shifter. But I suppose it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to catch me first.\u201d Valdez showed some teeth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful.\u201d I rubbed the dog\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat do you want us to do, Richard? Maybe if we all promise not to buy from the EVs, they\u2019ll move on.\u201d I checked the crowd for reaction. Hmm. Not exactly a groundswell of support. Addictive drug or not, a vamp, always sensual anyway, would hate to pass up a chance at better sex. The EVs were obviously sitting on a gold mine.</p><p>\u201cHoo-kay.\u201d I\u2019d had about all the vamp togetherness I could take. Even with top drawer refreshments. These meetings weren\u2019t that great without Flo and Blade.</p><p>Richard frowned and looked around the room. When no one stepped forward with an \u201cannihilate the EVs\u201d plan, he nodded. \u201cI guess this meeting was a waste of time. But I thought I owed all of you fair warning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of us appreciate it, Richard.\u201d Damian exchanged hard looks with some of the men. \u201cIgnore this information at your own risk. Richard and I intend to proceed with or without your help. I hope you\u2019ll think about how you would feel without your power. Remember, drugs can make anyone careless. We enjoy Austin and intend to stay here. Anyone risking our lifestyle will be dealt with.\u201d</p><p>That threat was clear enough. I felt antsy, ready to get out of there. Too many vamps together must create a hell of a power surge. Could the EVs sense it? Could they be surrounding the house right now?</p><p>\u201cIf you need to meet again, meet somewhere else.\u201d CiCi must have felt the same way I did. \u201cDamian, they can come to your castle, can\u2019t they? You have such excellent security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Damian exchanged looks with Richard. \u201cBut I see no reason to meet again. Not unless more of you step up.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on Richard\u2019s arm. \u201cYou two be careful. You can\u2019t take on these EVs by yourself. And while Flo didn\u2019t take your power pulse, I bet both of you\u2019ve got more than enough to interest the EVs.\u201d</p><p>Richard squeezed my hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t lived this long by being careless, Gloriana. I will do what I can to keep all of us safe.\u201d He smiled at me and I got a nice warm feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou and Damian won\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d Frederick stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019ll help you, Richard. Stay. Sit down with me. I want to know more about my father\u2019s organization. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Richard clapped Frederick on the shoulder, instantly forgetting all about me.</p> <p>\u201cDamian, will you take me home?\u201d I turned to Damian who, in typical Damian fashion, had morphed from fearless EV fighter to Casanova, to flirt with Diana.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Gloriana. Gather the beasts and I\u2019ll meet you by the door.\u201d Damian whispered something in Di\u2019s ear and she nodded. Making a late date? Not my business. Not Will\u2019s either and he was sulking about it. He really couldn\u2019t compete for Di\u2019s attention in dog form. And Diana wasn\u2019t the only attractive female vampire in the room Will might have liked to hit on. Bela, no,</p><p>Ralph, had moved on to a redhead who looked like she could handle anything. I reached for my cell phone and turned it on again. Messages. I scrolled through the numbers. Jerry. Flo. Unknown, which I was afraid was Westwood. I might not ever listen to that one. But Jerry and Flo . . . Jerry first. Westwood had definitely skipped out on them. He and Mara were headed to Europe. Westwood \u2019s arm wasn\u2019t healing well and he was going to a clinic in Switzerland. Jerry and Mara had cornered one of Westwood\u2019s men and pulled that info out of him. His mind, that is.</p><p>My stomach in knots, I listened to Flo\u2019s message.</p><p>\u201cGlory, Simon is so sorry you\u2019ve been worried about me. And that he might have frightened you with that man coming after you.\u201d Flo sighed. \u201cKaplan\u2019s been punished, Glory. And Simon wants to make it up to you. He\u2019s sent you a case of your favorite Fangtastic. Please keep an open mind about him, Glory. He\u2019s not the villain Richard claims he is. Remember, I dumped Ricardo not so long ago. He\u2019s jealous of Simon. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow night. Ciao.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the phone for a moment. Well, as a peace offering a case of my favorite was a swell start. But I didn\u2019t believe for an instant that Richard was acting out of jealousy. I glanced at him where he stood listening intently to CiCi. Flo needed to hear CiCi\u2019s version of Simon and the EVs. I\u2019d have to see that the two women got together.</p><p>\u201cRichard, I\u2019ll do whatever you need me to.\u201d Damian glanced back at Diana who\u2019d picked up her purse and was saying her good-byes. \u201cCall me tomorrow.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cGloriana?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then stopped to hug CiCi. She was looking overwhelmed. Well, who wouldn\u2019t after finding out that your ex and the father of your only child was in town? The fact that he was Simon, king of the evil EVs, was just the icing on her crappy cake. Then she looked me in the eye and sent me a mental message. She was more than a match for Simon Destiny when it came to protecting her darling boy. Hmm. Made me wonder what kind of power rating the lady had.</p><p>When we got to the car, I told Damian about Flo\u2019s message.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s obviously hitting the VV too hard. After what we heard tonight, I \u2019m even more determined to get her away from that creep.\u201d Damian drove fast and we were at the shop before either of us had come up with any kind of plan to help his sister. Damian stopped and shook his head. \u201cNo parking places. What the hell is going on at\u201d\u2014he glanced at the glowing clock on the dashboard\u2014\u201cfour o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like a block party.\u201d I hopped out and let the dogs out of the back.</p><p>\u201cA block party from hell, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>I scanned the crowd. Lots of black lipstick, black clothes and eyeliner, but none of that scared me. I could have done without all the piercings and tattoos, but, hey, maybe that was jealousy talking since I\u2019d had no luck with either. And, trust me, I\u2019d tried. Three hours for a sexy pair of lips in luscious red puckered up on my left butt cheek. After a day of vamp sleep? Nada. Talk about frustration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll park and then I\u2019m meeting Diana at Mugs and Muffins. Will you be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. These look like potential customers to me.\u201d I smiled and pushed my way through the crowd. I\u2019m nothing if not openminded. I mean, I travel with a shape-shifter and a vampire, both of whom were baring their teeth to clear a path for us to the door of the shop.</p><p>But why wouldn\u2019t these people wear something other than black? Booorrring. I should know. I spent a century or so in black, blending into the night, hiding in the shadows. Trust me, I\u2019m so over the lurking thing. Well, unless an EV or a hunter is on my trail. I heard the music even before the door opened. My usual oldies station? I don\u2019t think so. Not with that bass beat. Obviously the TV Web site got more hits than I\u2019d imagined. Inside, people crowded in front of Flo\u2019s mural. Not everyone was in black either. A pair of women who looked like escapees from a PTA meeting elbowed a man in khakis and a pale blue polo shirt, a man who wore . . . tinted glasses.</p><p>\u201cGlory, thank God. Could you see what\u2019s going on in the dressing room? The same couple has been in the left one for way too long and don\u2019t get me started about the noises coming from there.\u201d Lacy, who had three customers in line, looked pretty frayed around the edges. She probably hadn\u2019t even noticed the man with the glasses.</p><p>I felt a bump against my thigh. My dogs had sure noticed. Valdez nudged me on his way for a closer look, Will right beside him. I moved in to see if I could read the man\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cNo! Stop him!\u201d A scuffle, screams and one of the soccer moms had glasses guy on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHah! I haven\u2019t sat through three boys taking karate lessons without learning something.\u201d She held a can of spray paint she\u2019d plucked from his hand triumphantly over her head. Applause broke out. My dogs barked and leaped on top of the man who had been struggling to get free. Will made a perfect landing and the man squealed and grabbed his privates. When Valdez growled in his face the guy froze, actually teary eyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelp! Get away from me!\u201d The man didn\u2019t get any sympathy.</p><p>\u201cLook at that. Black spray paint.\u201d The crowd was getting agitated.</p><p>\u201cWe should call the cops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, man, I got a little somethin\u2019 in my pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops? I\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was gonna deface that beautiful painting.\u201d Deface. Obviously a college student.</p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you, angel face. We get the dressing room next.\u201d Horny college student. I pushed my way to the man\u2019s side. Several people hurried out the door. That pesky cop rumor. I ripped the glasses off the man\u2019s face and took the paint can from the woman still sitting proudly on his chest. Her friend was taking her picture with her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cDave\u2019s never going to believe what we did at the state library convention. I told you we couldn \u2019t just go to bed after that reception, Pam.\u201d</p> <p>Oops. Not PTA. Two renegade librarians.</p><p>\u201cThis dog\u2019s not going to bite me, is he?\u201d Pam glanced at Valdez uneasily.</p><p>Valdez stopped growling long enough to lick her cheek.</p><p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>Will stepped on the man\u2019s zipper again when he started to move. Another yelp.</p><p>\u201cGood dog.\u201d Pam grinned and threw her arms around both dogs. \u201cGet a picture of this, Sharon.\u201d</p> <p>I locked eyes with the art critic and saw fear and Westwood. I put him under the whammy and reached out to help Pam up.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Wow. You really saved our mural. As for you . . .\u201d I leaned down and got in the man\u2019s face. \u201cGet out of here and don\u2019t come back.\u201d I sent him a mental message that had him pale and shaking. Something about ripping off body parts. Will growled at the guy\u2019s zipper, just in case the fool was unclear on what body part came off first.</p><p>\u201cI ever see you here again, I\u2019ll press charges.\u201d Don\u2019t ask me what charges. Intent to deface, maybe. But my carrying customers weren\u2019t the only ones who wanted to avoid law enforcement. The dogs backed off while the man got shakily to his feet and staggered to the door. My growling dogs provided an escort.</p><p>The crowd booed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lettin\u2019 him off easy. And he\u2019s movin\u2019 like some freakin\u2019 zombie. Me, I\u2019d run like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget him. The dressing room\u2019s empty.\u201d A couple, pale and pierced, hurried toward what had apparently been turned into a love nest.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d I grabbed them by their black sleeves next to the suit rack. \u201cAttention, shoppers.\u201d I raised my voice over the blare of rap music and all heads turned toward me. \u201cOnly one person at a time in the dressing rooms. To try on clothes. Or I\u2019m shutting the rooms down.\u201d There were a few groans and the flushed couple who\u2019d apparently just emerged from the room, the girl\u2019s T-shirt on inside out, high-fived each other.</p><p>Valdez sent me a mental message that Westwood\u2019s man was gone, and I breathed my first easy breath since I\u2019d come inside.</p> <p>\u201cCheck out the vampire.\u201d</p><p>I slapped a hand over my mouth before I realized a new arrival pointed at the wall. I kept an eye on the dressing room situation and offered the librarians a generous discount. After that I helped Lacy sack and ring up sales. Business really was brisk, especially for the sixties skirts and Nehru jackets, black, of course.</p><p>During a short lull, I hit the Internet and the TV station\u2019s Web site. Oh, great, my little segment was featured. Had I really flashed fang at all of Austin? No, scratch that, the Internet is a wonderful thing. I\u2019d flashed fang at the whole damned world. I hit enter and the segment started. They\u2019d reprised the part where Flo and I, wrapped in bed linens, dripped in front of the burned out shop. Flo, my \u201cpartner,\u201d leaned against me while I ranted about a hate crime. Then Donna, looking perky in her green blazer, stood in front of the freshly painted store, the neon Vintage Vamp\u2019s sign above her.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, the store is back in business.\u201d A customer pushed open the door and Donna followed. The camera spent less than thirty seconds panning the racks of clothes, hats, accessories and vintage knickknacks before stopping at the now -famous mural.</p><p>I braced myself. Oh, yeah, there I was, in a skirt and blouse I was selling just as soon as I could run upstairs and get them. Could I look any dumpier? The tiny bit of cleavage helped, but the full skirt did my hips no favors and that print . . . Damn, but I \u2019d never noticed the design was horizontal.</p><p>I handled Donna\u2019s questions okay\u2014my opinion. And that toothy grin was an unfortunate habit when I\u2019m nervous. So when I got a whiff of the cameraman . . . Yep, fang, just a hint, but undeniable. Thank God the whole \u201crat\u201d riot had been cut out. Instead we were back on the sidewalk out front, Donna under the sign again.</p><p>\u201cSo you see, folks, this business may be simply a vintage clothing store where you can find everything from poodle skirts to zoot suits, or a hangout for vampires. No, don\u2019t laugh. Vampires have been the center of bestselling novels\u201d\u2014she waved a hand toward the shop and the mural inside\u2014\u201cart and movies. Why, if they\u2019re just a figment of someone\u2019s overheated imagination? I didn\u2019t see any Dracula capes, but, no matter what the owner claims, you can\u2019t deny the message that mural is sending. Vampires welcome here.\u201d Donna gave the camera a full-on intense \u201cI\u2019m your woman who\u2019ll get the truth\u201d look. \u201cWe\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the situation. You can count on Donna Mitchell, Channel Six News.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d I looked back at Lacy who\u2019d stopped straightening stock to peer over my shoulder. \u201cDid you see . .</p><p>.\u201d I leaned close and whispered, \u201cFang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw. Well, maybe just a glimpse. Almost like a trick of light. The reporter didn\u2019t even mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. And she would have, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I looked around. \u201cNo one\u2019s come in trying to check my bicuspids so that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>Lacy smiled. \u201cGreat publicity. Even the gay angle with you and Flo as \u2018partners.\u2019 How cute was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Flo and I are just precious together. We should change the name of the building. Slingback Mountain. \u201d I sighed, not sure I was ready to be queen of the local vampires. No, wait, Freddy already had that title. Can you tell I was exhausted?</p><p>\u201cThat reporter\u2019s nuts. Dracula capes? So clich\u00e9. My boss is nothing if not fashionable.\u201d Lacy gave me a reassuring smile. She\u2019d been on duty forever and still had all day Saturday ahead of her. Fortunately she seemed tireless. I \u2019d just popped a black crocheted hobo bag into a sack when I finally asked a customer a question that had been bugging me.</p><p>\u201cDid all of you see the mural on the TV Web site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. There was a segment on the tube. The weekend wrap-up at midnight. Right before the Saw film festival. When Saw 3</p><p>came on, I\u2019d had enough. So we decided to check out the mural.\u201d The girl with silver nose, eyebrow and lower lip studs smiled.</p><p>\u201cCool place and I love that you\u2019re open all night. I usually can\u2019t get Ronnie to shop.\u201d She glanced at her boyfriend who wasn\u2019t shopping but had decided to pet a silently suffering Valdez. Will sat in front of the window, staring out with body language that clearly said \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, please come back. I\u2019m sorry you had to wait in line to pay. A crowd this big this late is unusual. \u201d I handed her the sack and the receipt. \u201cMugs and Muffins is open all night too. You can always stash Ronnie next door with a coffee while you shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Maybe I\u2019ll bring my mom back tomorrow. She\u2019d love the old purses too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe close at midnight on Saturday and reopen a little after midnight on Tuesday morning. \u201d I grabbed a paper from a stack that had shrunk considerably during the night. \u201cHere, take a flyer, hours are on there.\u201d</p><p>I checked out the dwindling crowd. It was getting close to dawn and I could feel it in my usual sinking spell. I tapped Lacy on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThink you can handle things alone until Melanie gets here later? \u201d Melanie, our mortal worker, helped Lacy handle the day crowd, especially on Saturdays.</p><p>\u201cSure. Time flies when you\u2019re busy.\u201d Lacy leaned closer. \u201cThat a Westwood goon with the spray paint? I\u2019m sorry but I didn\u2019t even notice the glasses. I was just too busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. We handled him. And busy is good. Great.\u201d I gestured toward the door. \u201cI made sure that particular goon won\u2019t be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. But a lot of the other people here tonight will be. That mural is killer.\u201d Lacy smiled. \u201cFlo\u2019s a genius. I don\u2019t mind the type of customers we\u2019re getting. Daytime, our usuals will still show up. And the commissions are really adding up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You deserve every penny. And as for Flo . . .\u201d I sat down on the stool before I fell down. My Fangtastic had just worn off, big time. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about her. She\u2019s gone off the deep end with this new boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>A customer sighed as she piled a fifties sweater set and pearl collar on the counter. \u201cMy girlfriend\u2019s got a loser boyfriend too. I\u2019m afraid to say anything because I keep thinking she\u2019ll figure it out for herself. And I don\u2019t want to mess up our friendship. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Could our friendship survive if I was part of the posse going after Flo\u2019s beloved Simon? I shuddered thinking about reptilian lovemaking. I had to get her away from him.</p><p>I was dead on my feet, literally, by the time I unlocked my apartment door. I almost stumbled over the case of Fangtastic sitting just inside. AB negative. Okay, so Simon didn\u2019t stint when it came to peace offerings. And I wasn\u2019t going to turn it down. Are you kidding? Do you have any idea what that stuff costs? And Simon owed me for sending Greg Kaplan sniffing after me. I took a moment to wonder what kind of \u201cpunishment\u201d Greg had received. Cool if he\u2019d been denied his VV fix. The guy was a mind-controlling creep. I couldn\u2019t work up any real concern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stuck about half a dozen bottles of the good stuff in the fridge, dumped a bottle of the O positive in a bowl for Will and threw down a half dozen Twinkies for Valdez before I hit the shower. I ignored Will \u2019s wheedling when he tried to get me to share the primo Fangtastic with him. No way. I thought about drinking one myself, but I was just too tired to savor it. So I fell into bed. Lights out in more ways than one.</p><p>I woke to pounding on the door. I glanced at the bedside table clock and realized I\u2019d actually slept a little past sunset. My body keeps track of the daylight hours, but I like to check the exact times on the Internet too. I love the long winter nights. We were only a month away from the max.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming.\u201d I threw a robe over the cotton nightgown I\u2019d worn to bed and staggered to the door.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mainwaring.\u201d Will yawned and stretched.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I threw open the door and saw Richard on the threshold. He looked tired, like he hadn\u2019t slept nearly as well as I had.</p><p>\u201cCome in. What happened last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing but talk.\u201d Richard frowned. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated.\u201d</p><p>Will snorted and I gave him a warning look. \u201cI overslept and I\u2019ve got to go down to the shop. You want to wait while I brush my teeth and throw on some clothes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI should leave . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stick around. Walk me downstairs. You want a Fangtastic? Simon sent me some premium brew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve already fed.\u201d</p><p>I stopped next to Richard, then took a deep breath. Oh, yeah, he\u2019d fed. I started to say something snippy, then let it go. Flo had told me he had this rather primitive habit of feeding from mortals, then praying afterward like that made it all right. Hey, maybe it did. He wouldn\u2019t kill to feed, he gets just enough to take the edge off. Me, I\u2019m usually okay with the bottled substitute. Usually. I felt a pang for Steve the fireman who\u2019d called me three times since our date. To get rid of him, I\u2019d finally had to invent a committed relationship with an old boyfriend. Hey, it could happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you in one piece. When I left the gang at Freddy\u2019s, I was afraid that, if you and Freddy could find it, you\u2019d try to storm the Bastille.\u201d I sounded like an idiot and Richard smiled. \u201cWell, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be all for it with the right plan. Problem is, we haven\u2019t found the Bastille yet.\u201d Richard sank down on the couch and stared at his black loafers. No socks. A sexy look. Hmm.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll hurry. I\u2019ve got to relieve the day crew.\u201d I grabbed a Fangtastic, some of the ordinary O positive, out of the fridge and headed for the bathroom. I wasn\u2019t about to gulp down my dream drink.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He managed a smile and I remembered hot kisses and clever hands. Whatever Richard wanted, I was interested. Purely for stress release you understand. Right after I closed at midnight. With that in mind, I picked out one of my favorite outfits, a deep blue cashmere twin set (from my flush days as a dancer in Vegas) and matching wool slacks. I quickly did my thing with hair and makeup, by feel of course, then sat down to pull on black suede high-heeled boots. I looked back at my butt. Too big? Too bad. I sucked in my tummy and threw open the door.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Gloriana.\u201d Richard jumped to his feet.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Can you wait a sec? Got to feed the dogs.\u201d I checked out the cupboard and found two cans of the chili Valdez had seen advertised on TV. I nuked it, then sucked in a lungful of the delicious smell. Okay, so I stuck a finger in it for a taste. Good, but not worth major pain and suffering. At least not while I had a hunky vamp waiting for me. I divided the stuff evenly and set it on the floor. Both dogs fell face first into their bowls and didn\u2019t even come up for air when I went back into the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo how are you going to find the EVs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a few recruits who are going to start looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone could follow Flo when she leaves here to meet Simon some night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could try. She\u2019s pretty difficult to track and I have a feeling Simon asked her to keep his location a secret.\u201d His face was hard to read, but obviously Richard had tried to follow Flo and failed. Maybe he was jealous.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous of Florence and Simon\u2019s relationship, Glory.\u201d Richard\u2019s pale blue eyes pierced right through any mind shield I might have belatedly thrown up. \u201cI\u2019m worried about her. As a friend. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, me too.\u201d I sat down beside him, though I\u2019d have to leave in just a few minutes. I hoped Derek had gotten there right after sunset to relieve Lacy and Melanie. \u201cI had a feeling Bela, I mean Ralph, would be happy to make a buy of the VV if you think that would help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already offered. I wouldn\u2019t ask anyone to do it, but it may come to that. I keep thinking that it\u2019s only a matter of time before one of their customers leaks their location. They\u2019re probably sworn to secrecy too, but someone will eventually tell the wrong person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is this why you stopped by? To give me a lack of progress report?\u201d I finished my Fangtastic then set the empty bottle on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cNot just that. You close the shop at midnight tonight. Right?\u201d He leaned closer and I could see the gleam of male interest in his eyes. When they skimmed down my sweater and checked out the way it clung to my breasts, the sexy lace bra I wore didn\u2019t hide the bumps of alert nipples.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take you out. Either on the Harley or in my car if you\u2019d rather not\u201d\u2014he brushed my hair back from my face\u2014\u201cmess up your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you like dancing. I\u2019m not exactly Patrick Swayze, but I\u2019ve learned a little over the years. There\u2019s a new club on South Congress. Rock and roll. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I think I love you. I didn\u2019t say it and I sure as hell didn\u2019t let him read it in my mind. Instead I smiled and stood. I picked up my purse, a vintage Chanel bag that Flo had given me to sell, but which couldn\u2019t seem to make it past my own closet.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take the car, then.\u201d I grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet. I\u2019m sure Flo had made him sit through Dirty Dancing more than once, so he probably did know a few dance moves. I twirled around him, then laughed. \u201cAnd midnight can\u2019t come fast enough.\u201d I reached up and kissed him, full on and nothing shy about it. The man had promised dancing.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Aren\u2019t we due downstairs?\u201d Valdez dropped his leash at my feet. I came up for air and loved the way Richard\u2019s eyes stayed half closed. His hands were under the back of my sweater and I felt the warmth of his fingers on my bare skin. He finally opened his eyes and smiled, his hands sliding down to my butt before he released me.</p><p>\u201cPick me up here after the store closes.\u201d I looked down at Valdez, Will right behind him. \u201cThe dogs will stay home. I think you\u2019ll be guard enough, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll guard you with my life.\u201d Richard took my hand and pulled me closer. He hummed a tune, then swung me away from him in a cool move.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Dancing with the Stars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Will.\u201d I smiled as Richard leaned me back over his arm, then jerked me close until we were chest to chest. \u201cWow, Richard, you have some great moves.\u201d</p><p>Valdez growled, but I ignored him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had centuries to perfect my \u2018moves,\u2019 Gloriana.\u201d Richard\u2019s smile sent sizzles right through me. I bit back a sigh. I\u2019m a sucker for a man with a good line. This promised to be a very interesting evening. I was still in the shop when my cell phone rang about eleven. I was deep into a debate with a customer about whether redheads could wear pink. By the time I got to the phone, I saw that I had another message from Flo. Good. She \u2019d be home Sunday night and we\u2019d go to church. Hey, don\u2019t freak out. Vampires aren\u2019t demons from hell, at least not all of them. The congregation of the Moonlight Church of Eternal Life and Joy probably didn\u2019t realize vampires dug their message. It was an upbeat nondenominational place that featured great music, a positive message and nighttime meetings. What\u2019s not to like? Flo and I got a lot out of it and we weren\u2019t the only vamps who attended regularly.</p><p>Would Flo invite Simon to tag along? I couldn \u2019t imagine she would or that Simon would be interested, not with his close association with a demon. I tried to call Flo back, just to give her a heads up about my date with Richard, but no answer. I really didn\u2019t want to think about what Flo might be up to with Simon the slimy snake.</p><p>After we locked the doors at midnight, I left Derek to put the cash away. Two days off. And tonight . . . I carried a dress upstairs with me that a shifter had brought in to sell and I couldn \u2019t resist. Full skirt, one of those stretchy cinch belts, deep vee to show off the girls, and the whole thing in the most fabulous sapphire blue velvet. I grabbed a bottle of the AB negative out of the fridge \u2014 Thank you, Simon\u2014fed the dogs more chili, then headed for the bedroom. I threw off my clothes, took a quick shower using liberal amounts of my lavender shower gel, then found some sexy dark blue underwear to go with the dress.</p><p>I finished the Fangtastic with a sigh. Damn, it was good. I had a craving for another bottle. Nope, my expensive stash had to last. Instead, I slipped into the dress and wished for the hundred thousandth time for a mirror. At least the dress felt amazing, soft, and it fit perfectly, the full skirt disguising my figure issues.</p><p>I spun around, then fell, a little dizzy, on the bed. Umm. Soft. Silky. Cool against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cRichard\u2019s here. Did you know he has a key?\u201d Valdez stared at me from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cFlo probably gave it to him.\u201d I rolled over and wiggled my toes. I\u2019d probably need to wear shoes. Silver pumps? Or black suede?</p><p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Valdez nudged my foot. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid you\u2019ll wrinkle your dress?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I stretched, the velvet moving with me. I loved this dress. To hell with shoes. I\u2019d just lie here and let Richard come to me. \u201cSend Richard in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you sure?\u201d Valdez moved closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I can invite Richard into my bedroom if I want to.\u201d Like I had to explain myself to a dog. I tried to work up a mad, but I felt entirely too relaxed to work up much of anything. \u201cGo out to the hall and close the apartment door. Take Will with you. I\u2019ll let you know when you can come back in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were going out.\u201d Valdez nudged my foot again and I stroked him with my toes. He had the softest fur.</p><p>\u201cDancing? Remember?\u201d</p><p>Dancing. I sat up. Of course. But first . . . \u201cSend him in, V, now.\u201d My answer was a snort. Yeah, Valdez is Blade\u2019s minion and his first loyalty is to his boss. Not that Blade expected me to be exclusive. We \u2019d settled that issue centuries ago. And all the Valdezes had learned to ignore the parade of lovers through my bedroom.</p><p>Okay, honesty here, it was more like a trickle than a parade. This Valdez would just have to ignore the yummy vamp with electric blue eyes and platinum hair who\u2019d planned to take me dancing.</p><p>I smiled when Richard appeared in the doorway. He definitely deserved a reward.</p> <p>\u201cValdez is worried about you.\u201d He grabbed my hand and pulled me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I put his hand on my breast. \u201cDon\u2019t you love this velvet? Isn\u2019t it soft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Richard kept his hand there and the slight pressure suddenly seemed like the most erotic touch ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d I moved his hand to the curve of my breast exposed by the deep vee.</p><p>\u201cEven softer.\u201d He rubbed his thumb between my breasts and I moaned. \u201cThe dogs are out in the hall. Did you tell them to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I popped open the buttons on Richard\u2019s dark green silky shirt. Wow. Had I ever seen a better, wider, more beautiful chest? I couldn\u2019t remember. This one was sculpted by some strenuous exercise, rowing a galley I guess. And his chest had the most precious brown nipples. I leaned in and licked one before pulling it into my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cGood God, Gloriana. Where\u2019s this coming from?\u201d Not that Richard flew across the room to get away from me. Hell, no. He had one hand in my hair, holding me close. The other circled my waist.</p><p>I leaned back and smiled, feeling relaxed, yet antsy too. A weird combo. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from here.\u201d I grabbed his hand and pressed it between my legs. \u201cI want you, Richard.\u201d I was wearing way too much. I undid my stretch belt and it popped loose, hit my chest of drawers on the other side of the room and knocked over a picture of me in one of my Vegas costumes. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and picked up the picture. \u201cLook, Richard. I was one of the Indian maidens. Just a few strategically placed feathers. Cute, huh?\u201d I set the picture back on the chest, then wrapped my arms around Richard\u2019s waist. \u201cYou want to play Columbus? I\u2019ll welcome you to the New World.\u201d I slid my fingers inside his waistband. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a warm welcome. And not a feather in sight.\u201d</p><p>Richard grabbed my hand. \u201cGlory, are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be. Unzip me.\u201d I slipped away from him, turned my back and lifted my hair.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d want to go dancing . . . first.\u201d But, yeah, the zipper came down and the cool air on my back said any dancing tonight was going to be of the horizontal variety. His hands slid inside my dress, pushing it forward and off my shoulders. I turned and looked at him, then wiggled until the dress pooled at my feet. I kicked it away, not even sparing a thought for the delicate vintage fabric.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I held out my hands. My bra was a wonder of engineering that pushed my breasts up and out like gifts waiting to be unwrapped. My matching panties were scraps of lace that only reached halfway to my navel. I shivered, then moved in to press against him.</p><p>\u201cRichard? Answer me. Am I getting to you?\u201d I rubbed my cheek against his chest. I waited for him to move things along. You know, grab my ass, open my bra, something. Instead Richard just stood there. Quiet. Too quiet. I looked up and saw his nostrils flare.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you like what you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Gloriana, of course I do.\u201d He put his hands on my shoulders. \u201cWhat have you gotten into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInto? The mood, baby. Let\u2019s play.\u201d I stepped back then reached for the front clasp of my bra. My breasts are a man pleaser. Guaranteed. Richard was thinking. That had to stop. I wanted him crazed with lust. I let my breasts loose, slung the bra over my head and into a corner of the room. Another crash, this time a vase I\u2019d never really liked anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavender. Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d I trailed my fingers down his chest to his belt buckle. One of my vamp moves and the belt and the button beneath it opened. Another move and his shirt hit the wall next to the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not lavender I smell.\u201d He sniffed again, trapping my hand against his zipper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t use perfume. Defense. Perfume messes up my sense of smell. The lavender doesn\u2019t.\u201d His hand on top of mine. Was he saying stop or harder? I curled my fingers around the bulge underneath the cloth and his hand tightened. I took that as a \u201cgo.\u201d I squeezed, he gasped, then pushed me away to stare into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cBy God, you\u2019ve been in the Vampire Viagra.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>\"Don\u2019t be silly, where would I get that?\u201d I tried another grab, but he eluded me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Simon sent you a sample.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need Viagra, Richard. I\u2019m naturally this hot.\u201d I ran a fingertip across my nipples and shivered. \u201cAnd all Simon sent me was a case of Fangtastic. Want some?\u201d I traced the long length pressing against his zipper. \u201cOr do you want some of this?\u201d I wiggled out of my panties and tossed them aside. His eyes darkened to a midnight blue. I dropped to my knees, took the tab of his zipper in my teeth and pulled.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>I swear, if he crossed himself, I was going to hit him. If he had any priestly hang -ups, Flo sure hadn\u2019t mentioned them. Saint or sinner? Aha. His hands were in my hair again. Sinner was obviously winning. Would I be struck by lightning if I prayed for Richard to take me sooner rather than later? I started going south with his zipper until his cock sprang free into my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou would never need the VV, would you, Richard?\u201d I stroked his erection and kissed its pretty head. \u201cI know you\u2019ll fill me. And when you come\u2014\u201d</p><p>Richard jerked me to my feet and stared into my eyes. \u201cDamn it, Glory, that\u2019s not you talking, that\u2019s the Vamp Viagra. Simon must have drugged your Fangtastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you think I can get hot without some help? Look at you. Strong, virile, all yummy male and ready to go.\u201d I smiled down at his cock and gave it a friendly pat, then pulled Richard toward the bed. \u201cCome on, Richard. Ricky. Maybe I\u2019ll call you that. Flo calls you Ricardo. Doesn\u2019t suit you. You\u2019re not Italian. English, like me. Hey, we\u2019re homies.\u201d I pulled harder when he wouldn\u2019t fall on the bed with me.</p><p>I rubbed his cock. \u201cBig boy. Come on, big boy. Take me.\u201d I pulled his hand to my mouth and sucked his thumb, then bit with just a hint of fang. Oh, yum, his blood was rich, dark and delicious. I sighed and fell back on the bed. Open for him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Richard.\u201d I wiggled my hips. \u201cMake me scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I can\u2019t take advantage\u2014\u201d He tucked in and zipped up.</p><p>\u201cAdvantage? Like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing?\u201d I got up in his face, fighting him off when he tried to wrap me in a robe I\u2019d had slung over a chair. \u201cI thought I knew what I was doing. And don\u2019t lie and say you\u2019re not a little interested. Your cock says you are.\u201d I ran my hands up his bare chest and tweaked his nipples. \u201cAnd cocks don\u2019t lie.\u201d I kissed his chin. \u201cLoosen up, Richard. Don\u2019t play so . . .\u201d I rubbed his zipper again. \u201cHard to get. Let Glory ease your pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d He backed up a step. I stayed right with him.</p><p>\u201cFlo says you\u2019re not a good lover. But she didn\u2019t always say that.\u201d One of my vamp moves should get his pants off of him. I gave it a shot, really concentrating on sending fabric to the floor. No go. He blocked me somehow.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you fighting me, Richard? Is it because I \u2019m not a size six like Florence?\u201d I dropped back on the bed. Sure. Why would he go for me after having cute little Flo? I wiped away a stray tear. How stupid to cry over stuff like that though. I mean, what did I want? A pity screw?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help my size, damn it.\u201d A sob. Hello? Is Gloriana even home? I pulled the sheet up to my chin. Yeah, she was home and pulling out every little trick she had. Glory St. Clair can manipulate with the best of them. Most men couldn\u2019t handle women\u2019s tears. He\u2019d cave, we\u2019d get it on and I\u2019d finally lose this antsy \u201cgot to have it\u201d feeling that made me about to crawl out of my skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a curse.\u201d Sniffle. Sniffle. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything to get skinny. Even thought about liposuction. But you know the vamp sleep would just undo it. All pain, no gain. \u201d I jumped up again, but wrapped the sheet around me. No use giving him an eyeful if he wasn\u2019t going to do something about it. Was he weakening? I swear my skin was on fire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a perfect size. You have a great body.\u201d He reached for me, but I scooted to the light switch by the door.</p><p>\u201cHere. I\u2019ll turn off the light and you can close your eyes. Okay? Just think. Glory\u2019s got all the necessary equipment, just more of it. Wait. Not more actual equipment. I mean what is there, tits, ass, the, um, gate to Heaven, has more padding. \u201d I flipped the switch. Of course we both had vamp vision, so it really didn\u2019t make much of a difference. I got in front of him again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClose your eyes, Richard. Maybe if you pretend I\u2019m Flo on steroids . . .\u201d I brushed against him and dropped the sheet.</p><p>\u201cStop it. You\u2019re beautiful, Gloriana. Perfect. But you\u2019re not yourself.\u201d Richard gave me a good long look, like he was thinking about the gate to Heaven\u2014I knew the religious angle would get to him\u2014then he inhaled again. \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d He stalked into the living room. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d</p><p>I slipped on a nylon robe, but didn\u2019t tie it. \u201cWhen I was a dancer in Vegas I learned some pretty good moves. Check it out.\u201d I picked up the remote and turned on the CD player. I knew just the track I wanted. The slow sultry music filled the apartment, Alicia Keys singing \u201cFallin.\u201d I danced around Richard, ignoring the scratching at the door from the hallway. If those dogs thought I was letting them in now . . . How icky would that be? I stretched, undulated, even tried a high kick. Oops. Something wrong with my balance. Richard grabbed me before I fell and I decided this was a good thing.</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I smiled, clung to him and kind of rubbed myself on him. Then I pushed him away. Obviously he liked the chase. So I took another turn around the room. Seven veils would have been nice, but at least I could play with the robe. I knocked over a pile of DVDs and kicked them out of the way. Dirty Dancing crunched under my feet. Okay, I could do dirty. A bump and grind. I checked my audience. Richard couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>I let the robe slide down my shoulders and fall to the floor and picked up a throw pillow. I held it in front of me like a G -string while I shimmied my boobs. Closer to Richard. Oh, yeah, just brush that hard chest with my nipples. Ooo. My nipples hurt. I dropped the pillow to rub my hands over them.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, Richard. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but I need your mouth on me. Right. Now.\u201d I practically threw him onto the couch. I think I took him by surprise because he didn\u2019t resist. I straddled him and pressed a breast to his lips. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes when he sucked my nipple into his mouth. Good. Now that I had him distracted, I knew where a male \u2019s working parts were by feel. I got him unzipped again then took his cock in my hands. Another inch or two and he\u2019d be inside me. I wiggled my hips into position.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He grabbed my ass and shifted me off his lap.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I tried to pry his hands off me. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you cooperating?\u201d I leaned over and bit his shoulder and not a love bite either. The blood welled up and I licked it clean. Oh, my. Nothing tastes better than an ancient vampire. More. I needed a lot more. Right after we . . .</p><p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d He growled my name, but pushed me off of him.</p><p>I prowled the room, desperate to get things going. I was Gloriana Freakin \u2019 St. Clair, queen of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Didn\u2019t Richard get that? He was off the couch and watching me, eyes gleaming, damned zipper up again. But his shirt was still in the bedroom where I\u2019d flung it. Hah!</p><p>I swept everything off the wooden coffee table, glad I\u2019d sold the old one with its cold marble top. Magazines, re-motes and an empty Fangtastic bottle flew in every direction. I lay back, one leg on either side of the wood, feet on the floor. Could I look any more inviting?</p><p>\u201cCome here, big boy. Give it to me.\u201d I grinned at him and wiggled my hips. Oh, hell. \u201cOw.\u201d I jumped up and looked back at my bum.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Richard turned me and examined my backside.</p> <p>\u201cSplinter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it.\u201d He gently pulled out the sliver of wood, then dropped to one knee and licked the tiny cut.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want. Lick every inch of me, Richard.\u201d I swayed and reached back to thread my fingers through his soft hair. \u201cKeep going, lower.\u201d I held on and spread my legs.</p><p>\u201cNo. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. It was the smell of your blood.\u201d</p><p>I looked back and saw him lick his lips. \u201cGo for it, then. Bite my ass. Though there\u2019s a vein a little lower on my inner thigh that would be a whole lot better.\u201d For both of us. I shivered thinking about his fangs taking me there. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This isn\u2019t right.\u201d He pulled back.</p><p>I whirled and threw myself on him, knocking him back on the rug. \u201cThis is right. Quit teasing me, you son of a bitch.\u201d I found his jugular and sank my fangs into his warm skin, sucking hard.</p><p>His fingers dug into my hair, holding me tightly against his neck. I swallowed, savored the taste for a moment, then decided I \u2019d had enough. I tried to pull away but he kept his hand on my head, refusing to release me. He was too damned strong for me to muscle away from him. I fisted my hands and hit his chest, sign language for let me go.</p> <p>\u201cKeep feeding, Glory. Dilute that poison you\u2019ve got in your system.\u201d</p><p>Poison? Get real. I was flying high, more aroused than I\u2019d ever been in my life. Wasn\u2019t he feeling this chemistry between us? But he still hadn\u2019t taken me. I couldn\u2019t freakin\u2019 believe it. He\u2019d even managed to get his zipper back up for the thousandth time. I hit him again, then tried a little mind control, since my mouth was clamped to his neck.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Richard. Make love to me. Or if that\u2019s too much commitment for you, call it sex. Let\u2019s have hot, no holds barred, sex. We can feed from each other later. Afterward. I\u2019ll do anything you want if you\u2019ll just take me.\u201d</p><p>I groaned and pushed, desperate to put some space between my fangs and his vein. I wasn\u2019t hungry for this. I\u2019d just presented him with an offer that no self-respecting male vampire would ever refuse.</p><p>\u201cNo, Gloriana. No.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned my eyes and I collapsed against him. Still he wouldn \u2019t let me stop feeding, his damned strong hands holding me firmly. I drank and swallowed and drank again. Until I felt sated, bloated, like I \u2019d gag if I had to take in another drop. Finally, finally, he took his hands from my head. I gasped for air. My head, too heavy to support, fell to his shoulder. He cradled me against his chest.</p><p>\u201cBetter, Gloriana?\u201d He stroked my naked back, gently. And wasn\u2019t that a hell of an attitude? I burrowed closer to him anyway.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d I mentally went through a check list. Still aroused, but not quite as desperately. Check. Warm from feeding and the pressure of his bare chest against mine. Check. Naked. Me, not him. Okay, now I was hot with embarrassment. Forget lists. My mental state was a mess, part frustration, part hating like hell that I\u2019d, oh, yes, waved my titties at Richard and given him my best lap dance and still been rejected.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t reject you, Gloriana.\u201d Richard touched my hair, petting me like a favorite cat. \u201cWhat I rejected was the drug you had controlling you. You would have hated me tomorrow if I\u2019d taken you up on your offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHated you? We\u2019ll never know now, will we? At least I think I\u2019ll stop attacking you now. Sorry. And quit reading my mind.\u201d I couldn\u2019t quite open my eyes. I was such a fool. Had Vamp Viagra made me throw myself at him?</p><p>Oh. My. God. That stuff was awesome. I mean horrible. Oh, hell. I still couldn\u2019t think straight. I\u2019d been drugged, damn it. That weasel Simon Destiny. If I ever got my hands on him . . .</p><p>But what about the dancing? Tears burned behind my closed eyelids. Had I messed up any chance of having a regular date with Richard? Had I repulsed him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Richard,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He picked me up and walked to the bedroom, staggering a little because I\u2019d taken him down about a quart or maybe even a gallon. When we got to my bed, I wouldn\u2019t let him go. Surely there was some way I could make this up to him. I pulled him down beside me. I didn\u2019t feel the urgency anymore. Not to mate with him. But I needed his comfort, his warmth and to be close to him. I\u2019d taken so much of his blood, that I felt part of him inside me. Like we breathed with the same breath, touched with the same hands. He traced a path from my breasts to my hip, then pulled me closer. Yeah, I felt that he did want me. I sighed and offered my neck.</p><p>\u201cFeed from me, Richard. Please. I want you to.\u201d I opened my eyes. \u201cAnd I do know what I\u2019m saying this time.\u201d I was finally coming down from whatever astral plane I\u2019d been on. When his fangs pierced my neck, I groaned. I felt the pull and held him close. My tender breasts scraped against his chest and I felt another surge of desire. Vampire Viagra. How long did it last? How long could I last without some kind of big finish?</p><p>I reached down, touched myself and screamed. Yep, screamed, shrieked, blew completely apart in a world class orgasm, wilder, more intense than anything I\u2019d ever felt in my entire centuries long life. Crash! Richard fell on top of me, a vamp sandwich between me and my dogs. You heard me, my dogs.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. Let me go! That\u2019s my leg, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, asshole. Get off of Glory before I rip you apart. Leg first. Head second.\u201d Will had the tough guy act down.</p><p>\u201cGlory, what\u2019s this guy doing to you?\u201d Valdez gave Richard a head butt that knocked him off the bed to hit the floor. \u201cSay something.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the sheet before I exposed myself even more to all and sundry. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Seriously. Will, let him go.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Will until he dropped Richard\u2019s leg. Blood gushed, a guaranteed mood killer. Who was I kidding? I licked my lips. Even after my recent fill-up I still craved another taste. It had been really good.</p><p>\u201cYou screamed, Blondie. Like he was killing you.\u201d Valdez sat on the bed, next to me. He looked me in the eye. \u201cWhat happened? \u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire Viagra. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d I grabbed a pillow, stripped off the case and wrapped it around Richard \u2019s calf. Richard staggered to his feet and wiped at the blood. But he wasn\u2019t an ancient vamp for nothing. The flow had already slowed to a trickle.</p><p>\u201cImpressive defense.\u201d Richard locked eyes with Will, then Valdez. \u201cYour dogs really do take their jobs seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Will jumped up next to Valdez and I had to grip the sheet when it slipped too low. \u201cWe won\u2019t let anyone get to our Glory.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet. And you were both magnificent. Really. But can we end this standoff now and give me some privacy? Please?\u201d I sighed. \u201cI had a VV experience, but I\u2019m better now. Really. Let me get dressed.\u201d I saw Richard grab his shirt and shrug it on. And now I owed him a pair of pants. His were shredded beyond repair.</p><p>\u201cVV? Where\u2019d you get it? Did this asshole drug you?\u201d Valdez jumped off the bed, in warrior mode again, his growl making even me shiver.</p><p>\u201cNo. The Fangtastic Simon sent must have been drugged. It turned me into a horny wild woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a drug for that. Or at least not with the right guy.\u201d Valdez chuffed and gave Richard a \u201cgo to hell\u201d look. Oh, yeah, he\u2019d heard me a time or two or dozen with Blade. Through closed doors, walls, hell, I\u2019ve been know to shatter glass a half block away when in the throes. (Just kidding.)</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot. But you can critique my love life later. Now get out in the hall. Since I don\u2019t have a door now, you\u2019ll have to stand guard. I need to take care of Richard\u2019s wound.\u201d</p><p>It was Will\u2019s turn to snort. \u201cI expect some combat pay after this. To have to listen to Glory get her groove on . . . \u201d He trotted after Valdez toward the hall door. \u201cMan, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve handled it year after year. Valdez, the woman\u2019s a screamer.\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and closed the bedroom door then turned to study Richard. He stared at me, his eyes gleaming, pupils dilated as I\u2019m sure my own were. Oops, still naked. I pulled the sheet off the bed and wrapped it around me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet. Mad at me?\u201d I bent down to check out his leg. A pretty nasty gash, but healing already. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Sit down. You\u2019d already given me blood and now\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel it inside me, Glory. The VV. It plays with your mind and . . . \u201d Richard touched himself. Oh, yes, he was still hard and horny. \u201cHoly Mother of God, but I want you.\u201d He grabbed my arms and hauled me up against him. The sheet hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo, Richard, that\u2019s the drug talking.\u201d</p><p>He shut me up with a kiss that stole my breath. Then he backed me toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cStop it. This isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d I shoved and Richard stopped. But he still had a wild look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, Glory. This feeling. Don\u2019t like that I can\u2019t control it. But I need . . . you. Help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I understand, Richard. But I also know this isn\u2019t the way it should happen between us. If it ever does.\u201d And maybe I did still have some VV in me, because I was almost willing to martyr myself for the \u201chelp Richard get his rocks off\u201d cause. He looked so tempting, standing there with his shirt hanging open and his pants riding low. I held up my hands when he came toward me again. \u201cNo, Richard. I know what you\u2019re feeling. You need release. But I can\u2019t do it for you.\u201d</p> <p>Richard growled and kept coming. I scrambled over the bed, out of reach, and fell against my dresser. A box of powder hit the floor and flew everywhere. I sneezed, then grabbed a lamp and held it over my head.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Richard, or you\u2019ll be wearing a lampshade and not in a fun, party way.\u201d</p><p>Richard finally stopped, took a breath and ran his hands through his hair. \u201cWhat the hell am I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything. The VV is doing it. Drink some Fangtastic, my old stuff, maybe you can dilute the effects. \u201d</p><p>Richard looked down at the erection straining his pants and glanced at the kitchen. \u201cSon of a bitch. I can\u2019t believe that crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess Simon hoped I\u2019d get hooked, so he sent me a sample. Then, when his minion came calling again, I\u2019d be hot to trot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like it.\u201d Richard limped toward the kitchen. \u201cNo wonder people get addicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s all tainted?\u201d I bit back a moan. Primo Fangtastic polluted. What a waste.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d better pour it down the drain.\u201d</p><p>I ran after him. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. Surely not all of the bottles have been tampered with.\u201d</p><p>He twisted the top off a bottle and sniffed, then wrinkled his nose. \u201cSorry, Gloriana, but I don\u2019t think we can take a chance.\u201d He upended it over the sink.</p><p>\u201cWait! Let me see if I can smell the difference. Then I can just do this one at a time. Sniff and drink or sniff and dump. \u201d I grabbed the half empty bottle from him and inhaled. I know I\u2019m a broken record on the subject, but is there anything as intoxicating as AB negative? And that\u2019s all I could smell. No subversive substance. Just delicious, ready to drink\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop it, Gloriana. Obviously you\u2019re too susceptible to this blood type to be objective.\u201d He grabbed the bottle and emptied it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, but I swear I can\u2019t smell that stupid VV.\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cSlow down, Richard. Maybe we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave me a questioning look. \u201cHooked already, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you hooked.\u201d I grabbed a bottle and twisted off the top, then watched the rich red flow down the drain. Twenty-two bottles later and I felt drained. Richard was acting the self-righteous bastard and I wanted to bash him over the head with the empties. He even rinsed out the sink and checked the fridge, like he thought I\u2019d already become an addict and was holding some back for later. Trust me, the VV had really worn off because this Richard was about as appealing as roadkill. He tossed all the bottles into a trash bag and tied the top closed. What? He didn\u2019t trust me not to lick the bottles? Sure enough, he dumped the sack down the garbage chute at the end of the hall.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that to us.\u201d Will had sniffed the sack, then followed Richard all the way to the chute and back. \u201cFirst we have to listen to Glory shouting hallelujah, then you toss all the good stuff without giving me so much as a taste? Man, are you twisted.\u201d</p><p>Valdez nipped Will\u2019s ear. \u201cShut up. Glory\u2019s still not right. That stuff\u2019s poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison. Yeah, the VV sure is. But excuse me if I don\u2019t do a happy dance that all the AB neg is gone. I know it had to be done, but I can have a moment to mourn, can\u2019t I?\u201d I sat on the couch and put my feet up on the coffee table. I had powder between my toes. At least it smelled good, but I\u2019d left footprints from the bedroom to the kitchen and back to the couch. \u201cWill, I hope you know how to run a vacuum.\u201d I put a hand to my suddenly aching head. \u201cAnd Glory\u2019s always right. You\u2019d both do well to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tossed the VV along with the Fangtastic? You have any idea what that Viagra might go for on the open market? \u201d Will trotted into the kitchen like he hoped to find a forgotten bottle, then out again.</p><p>\u201cThere is no open market for that drug. You try peddling it and Simon Destiny will hand you your tail on a platter, my friend. \u201d</p><p>Richard had his hands in front of him, like maybe he could hide that giant erection he still sported. God, it had to hurt. I felt sorry for him. At least my ache was inside, not out there for all of us to see. And I also felt a warm rush of gratitude. Until he\u2019d had the VV himself, he\u2019d been a pillar of moral fiber. I couldn\u2019t imagine any other male vampire turning down a naked woman begging for it. Of course I\u2019d shown some backbone of my own, turning him down. Hah!</p><p>\u201cI could have saved the VV. For when I\u2019m done being dog of the month.\u201d Will sat down and scratched.</p><p>\u201cA month? Is that all you\u2019re signed on for?\u201d I swear Valdez and I would have high-fived if he\u2019d had five. I grinned at him and he wagged his tail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling the love here. \u201d Will looked at the stereo. \u201cAnd what\u2019s with the sad music? Don\u2019t you have any rap or Beyonc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. Was the Beyonc\u00e9 thing a coincidence? I checked out Richard. Yeah, if Beyonc\u00e9 had waved her breasts in his face he probably would have been shouting his own hallelujah. Whatever. My head was killing me.</p><p>\u201cI have a giant headache. A sort of hangover, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, Glory. Let me help you feel better.\u201d Richard stepped behind me and put his hands on my head. I grabbed the remote, which had landed next to the sofa, and turned off the stereo.</p><p>I really was in pain. Both dogs were an interested audience when Richard pressed his fingers over my eyebrows. I sighed as the pain vanished between one breath and the next.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. I wonder how he does that.\u201d Will nudged my knee. \u201cThe headache really gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d I opened my eyes and then reached up to clasp Richard\u2019s fingers. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I forgiven?\u201d he said as he held onto my hands but stayed behind me.</p><p>\u201cFor what? Nothing happened.\u201d I let go of his hands and gave the dogs a mental message to make themselves scarce. They both headed down the hallway to Flo\u2019s bedroom and I heard the door slam.</p><p>\u201cSorry about the dog attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live. Simon has a hell of a nerve, sending his drugs here. I\u2019m sure Florence has no idea what her lover is up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s obviously not thinking straight.\u201d I watched Richard pick up the apartment door and lean it against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get this fixed immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Damian. He can send over his handy man during the day tomorrow. \u201d I shook my head. \u201cAbout the dancing . . . Rain check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Richard slid his hands around me to snug me up against him. Oh, yeah, he still wanted me bad. I looked down. \u201cIs that the VV or\u2014\u201d He kissed me. It was a hungry, demanding kiss. When he tried to move us toward the bedroom, I pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Richard. Is your mind clear? Do you want me or is the drug doing your thinking for you?\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head. \u201cDamn it, Glory. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong answer, Richard.\u201d I shoved him out into the hall and wished I had a door I could slam in his face. Would it have killed him to say \u201cOh, Glory, you\u2019re the hottest woman I\u2019ve ever seen, of course I want you\u201d? He obviously read my mind because he winced and ran his hands through his hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He looked sad, yummy and way too easy to forgive. \u201cOf course you\u2019re desirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Richard. Get out of here before we do something we\u2019ll both regret.\u201d</p><p>Richard reached out and touched my hair. \u201cI\u2019m already regretting it.\u201d Then he turned and headed down the hall, still limping, torn pants flapping.</p> <p>I sagged against the doorframe for a moment, then went to give the dogs the all clear. Two hours until dawn. Maybe I \u2019d call Blade. The VV was still inside me in the form of a damp yearning that made my knees wobbly. This restless urge needed to go somewhere and Blade is my go-to guy. Always. Even an ocean and a continent away. And ain\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>Twenty</p><p>I woke up still feeling slightly hungover and frustrated. I hadn \u2019t called Blade after all. I \u2019d had just enough snap left in my overstimulated brain to figure out that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. Even long distance, he could read me way too well. It had been bad enough having to call Damian about another broken door. He \u2019d wanted explanations I wasn\u2019t about to give. And what about Richard? Would I ever be able to face him again? Oh, God, could I have been a bigger slut?</p><p>\u201cFinally, you\u2019re awake.\u201d Flo sat on the foot of my bed, disgustingly bright-eyed. \u201cWhat happened last night? There\u2019s powder everywhere and I can\u2019t find the remote for the TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard and I had a party. Things got a little wild. \u201d I watched Flo\u2019s face, checking to see if she might still have feelings for Richard. She just shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cRichard and a party? What? Did he actually loosen up for a change?\u201d Flo frowned down at a chipped nail.</p><p>\u201cLoose enough.\u201d I even said it with a straight face. \u201cRichard\u2019s a decent man. I respect him.\u201d</p><p>Flo gave me a searching look. For once I didn\u2019t want to spill my guts. She didn\u2019t press me. A good thing since my anger was on simmer and rapidly coming to a boil.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the Fangtastic Simon sent you? I know you love the AB negative, but Richard doesn\u2019t usually drink it and I doubt you could have finished it off by yourself in one night.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cThough you do look a little ragged around the edges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRagged? Like from a Fangtastic binge? Or maybe I just had a rough night. \u201d I leaped out of bed, glad I\u2019d at least had the presence of mind to put on an old nightgown before I\u2019d finally gone to sleep. Not that I\u2019m overly modest\u2014see previous night\u2014but parading naked in front of my roomie with the cute figure wasn\u2019t on my top ten list.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Too much Fangtastic can\u2019t hurt you. And Richard . . . Yes, he has a temper, but he wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Flo looked startled when I growled.</p><p>\u201cSo says the resident expert on men.\u201d I stomped a circle around the bed to keep from venting all over her. Not her fault. Not her fault. She obviously didn\u2019t have a clue what Simon had done. I took a calming breath and sat on the bed beside her.</p><p>\u201cNo, Richard wouldn\u2019t hurt me, not physically. But he pissed me off when he poured down the drain the Fangtastic Simon sent. I know he did the right thing, but it was hard to take at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe poured it down the drain? Because he hates Simon?\u201d Flo jumped up and stormed to the living room. \u201cHow could you let Richard do that? Simon was making a nice gesture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, really nice. Simon punched it up with a boat-load of that stuff he\u2019s peddling.\u201d I headed to the kitchen and grabbed one of the bottles of O positive.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You had the Vampire Viagra?\u201d Flo shook her head when I offered some of the cheap stuff.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I drank, fought off a gag\u2014God, this was swill\u2014 then sat on the couch. \u201cWhere are the dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Lacy to take them for a walk before we go to church.\u201d Flo sat on a chair across the room. \u201cHow did you like the VV?</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t it wonderful? Did Richard try it too? I can\u2019t get Simon to use it, but I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo, stop.\u201d I took another swallow. I needed to do some kind of whammy on myself so I \u2019d think I was still drinking the wonderful stuff I\u2019d had the night before. \u201cSimon drugged me. I drank a bottle laced with VV and ended up attacking the nearest warm male body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard.\u201d Flo settled back like this was going to be good. Regular roomie dish.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Richard.\u201d I deliberately blocked Flo from reading my mind. I had some really homicidal urges toward her boyfriend in there. Not to mention the fact that I was close to wrapping my hands around Flo \u2019s elegant throat and throttling her for being so clueless.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I give. Did you like it? Wasn\u2019t the rush fantastic? \u201d Flo grinned like the idiot she was turning out to be.</p><p>\u201cNo. I felt like I was crawling out of my skin, for one thing. And it was more screaming frantic than rush. \u201d I sure wasn\u2019t telling Flo that the only satisfaction I\u2019d managed last night had come courtesy of my XTC 3000 vibrator.</p><p>\u201cBut Richard is a wonderful lover.\u201d Flo had the grace to look embarrassed. \u201cI know I said he wasn\u2019t, but I lied. I was mad at him, for being so much more into his business than he was into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s very intense and still hung up on some of his priestly vows.\u201d</p><p>Flo laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s not celibate, Glory. If he told you that, honey, maybe you just don\u2019t do it for him.\u201d</p><p>I paused a moment for a little bitter reflection. Could that be why I\u2019d lost last night\u2019s battle? No, I\u2019d definitely gotten to the guy. He\u2019d struggled with his decision not to take me. I leaned forward. \u201cI know he\u2019s not celibate, Flo, but he has principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrinciples? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he wouldn\u2019t take advantage of a woman under the influence. Even if that woman did everything but chain him down and force herself on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chains are in my closet, you should have used them.\u201d Flo giggled. \u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t resist. You should see your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hand me a mirror.\u201d I picked up the bottle of Fangtastic and drained it. I\u2019d just let my roommate see how pathetic I was.</p><p>\u201cSo Richard played hard to get.\u201d Flo shrugged. \u201cNot surprising now that I think about it. But what happened to the rest of the Fangtastic Simon sent you? Surely not all of it was laced with the VV. That stuff costs the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your lover was extremely generous.\u201d Or didn\u2019t want to take a chance that I wouldn\u2019t sample his drug. He\u2019d probably hoped I\u2019d get hooked and beg him to take my power. Become one of the drones Flo had mentioned. Simon must really be in a power crunch to go to so much trouble. \u201cRichard and I dumped it all out. Maybe it didn\u2019t all have the VV in it, but I wasn\u2019t about to take the chance. Richard even threw away the empty bottles. The man\u2019s obviously not into recycling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have saved it, Glory. For when Blade comes home. I bet he would enjoy it. He\u2019s not the prude Richard obviously has become.\u201d</p><p>I took about a nanosecond to think about the combination of Blade and the VV. \u201cForget it. Blade and I don\u2019t need it, Flo. And, last I heard, you didn\u2019t need help in that department either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I need it. But if I enjoy something new, where\u2019s the harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe harm?\u201d I grappled with the question. \u201cThe harm comes when you take people against their will. Drug them without their knowledge.\u201d Okay, now I was on a roll. \u201cDangle seeing daylight in front of an ancient vampire, take his or her money, then watch the vamp fry when the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah. You\u2019ve been listening to Richard. I have seen none of that with Simon. You should come see for yourself. I told you he wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to meet me so he can drain my power. Even you admit I\u2019m loaded with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see we\u2019re wasting our time discussing this, Glory. We don\u2019t agree. I move on.\u201d Flo crossed her legs. \u201cHow do you like my new outfit?\u201d She wore a black wool pencil skirt and black and white sweater that I hadn\u2019t seen before. I decided I might as well \u201cmove on\u201d too. \u201cNew? It\u2019s cute. Did Simon take you shopping?\u201d I\u2019d gotten the impression the EVs were practically hermits. I couldn\u2019t imagine Simon strolling through a mall with his girlfriend. If Simon did go out with Flo, Richard might have a chance to launch an attack. Of course we\u2019d have to get Flo out of the way first.</p><p>\u201cNo. Simon doesn\u2019t go out much. Typical man. Hates shopping. But he insisted I order something online, then he paid for express shipping. He really is generous.\u201d</p><p>So much for the mall theory. \u201cGenerous? I thought it was a cheap shot, trying to drug me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you like the Vamp Viagra? I mean, it makes you feel . . . amazing.\u201d Flo ran her hands over her breasts. \u201cVery hot.\u201d</p><p>I tried to analyze just how I\u2019d felt the night before. Mainly I\u2019d been out of control. Damian had complained about the same thing. Richard too once he\u2019d had it in his system after barely tasting me. It obviously took iron will to not have sex once you were into the VV. Iron. Oh, boy, speaking of iron . . . Richard had been incredibly hard. Side effect? Or was that typical for him? No assist from VV needed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting a dreamy look, Glory. I think something did happen with Richard last night. Maybe you\u2019re cranky because you feel guilty. Taking a lover while Blade is away. Just blame it on the VV and move on. \u201d Flo bent down to pluck a white dog hair from her skirt. \u201cWill sheds all the time. You should brush him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove on. That\u2019s always your philosophy, Florence.\u201d I saw that I\u2019d upset her. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m hungover. Too much VV</p><p>and not enough action. And I wouldn\u2019t brush Will on a bet. He\u2019s been shifting into human form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Flo looked interested. \u201cIs he handsome?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery. And arrogant. Think Mara as a macho male.\u201d I got up and stopped next to Flo. I put my hand on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I snapped at you. But tell your boyfriend not to do me any more favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Simon thought. That he was doing you a favor. The VV is highly prized. He made a generous gift. \u201d Flo looked around and grabbed the lint roller from the table next to the TV. \u201cI love black, but this is ridiculous. \u201d She attacked her skirt.</p><p>\u201cI should make Will shift and clean this for me.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t going to touch that one. The image of Will, toned muscles flexing while he wielded a lint roller, suddenly got to me. Obviously the VV still lingered in my system. No way was I attracted to him in any form.</p><p>\u201cLet me get dressed or we\u2019ll be late for church.\u201d I headed for my bedroom. \u201cDid you invite Simon to come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. Church would be good for his soul. \u201d I stopped in front of my closet and decided I hated all my choices. I \u2019d remembered to hang up the velvet dress I\u2019d worn the night before. I pulled out the full skirt and rubbed the soft material between my fingers. It would have moved so well on the dance floor.</p><p>If that damned VV hadn\u2019t messed up the evening, would I have ended up in bed with Richard afterward? I knew we had chemistry, even without the VV boost. But I\u2019m not a slave to my hormones. I needed a connection with a man before I allowed him sleepover privileges. And Flo was right about one thing, Richard put his \u201cmission\u201d ahead of everything else. Unusual in a vampire. We\u2019re pretty heavily into self-indulgence. Yeah, even me. Okay, okay, especially me.</p> <p>\u201cPretty dress.\u201d Flo was right behind me. \u201cWhat do you mean, Simon needs church for his soul? I told you Richard is wrong about him. Simon doesn\u2019t send vampires into the sun and the VV is a good thing. What do you know that I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you know, Flo. For example, did you know Simon is Freddy\u2019s father?\u201d I pulled a red corduroy shirtwaist out of the closet and threw it on the bed.</p><p>\u201cFreddy? Frederick von Repsdorf?\u201d Flo sat on the bed, careful not to wrinkle my dress.</p><p>\u201cThe one and only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Simon and CiCi ...\u201d Flo and CiCi have a bit of a rivalry going. Over men naturally.</p><p>\u201cCenturies ago. She knew he was a vampire, but had no idea Simon could give her a baby vampire until after the deed was done. Kind of a nasty trick, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I pulled out some cute black patent peep-toe heels and a patent belt to go with the dress and tossed them on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Simon didn\u2019t intend . . .\u201d Flo picked up the belt and hit her thigh with it. \u201cI\u2019ve heard born vampires are only fertile every hundred years or so after they turn. He probably didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew. He considered CiCi a \u2018worthy vessel,\u2019 and I quote the great man himself.\u201d</p><p>\"CiCi is a countess.\u201d Flo hit the bed this time, a good whack. \u201cSo Freddy\u2019s a born vampire. Simon\u2019s son. And gay.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what Simon thinks of that. Frederick may be the end of his line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? If Simon could get CiCi pregnant, he probably left baby vamps all over the world. Unless the fertility thing is a one shot deal. Maybe you should ask him about it.\u201d I concentrated on accessories, since the idea of baby Simons populating the vampire world seriously creeped me out. Would some be fork-tongued like their father? At least Freddy had dodged that bullet. I shuddered and dug out a black purse. Nope. I was getting into dowdy territory. I settled on a black and red tapestry. Definitely more interesting.</p><p>\u201cGlory, look at me for a minute, will you?\u201d Flo nudged me with the toe of her black suede boot.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked back, saw her expression and shoved the stuff aside to sit next to her. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m focused. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon. He\u2019s really important to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d I took my belt out of her hands so she wouldn\u2019t have a weapon. \u201cIs he important or is it the drug he\u2019s plying you with night after night that\u2019s important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You think I\u2019m . . . addicted?\u201d She looked indignant, then thoughtful. \u201cI could skip a night without the drug. Maybe not even make love at all one night.\u201d Flo made this sound like the worst kind of depravation. Frankly, coming off my own dry spell except for the virtual variety, I didn\u2019t get it. Hey, I\u2019d gone years without sex. Don\u2019t get me started about my life during Queen Victoria\u2019s mourning period. And I look great in black. Really. I\u2019d gone back to England for a little trip down memory lane and got stuck there for decades. It\u2019s not easy going transatlantic when you won\u2019t shape-shift.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to the EV compound after church. Come out with me. We\u2019ll do something fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Flo was actually wringing her hands at the thought.</p><p>I wracked my brain. Fun. What did we do for fun besides shop? And the kind of stores we liked closed early on Sunday nights. We could watch a DVD or two or six, but even a chick flick filmfest can get old. In Vegas I could always catch a show or, before the intervention, play poker. No gambling in Austin.</p><p>\u201cWe can troll the Sixth Street clubs. Maybe pick up some guys to dance with.\u201d Even I could hear my lack of enthusiasm for that prospect.</p><p>Flo grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to deal with mortals. And I thought you still had Westwood \u2019s people after you. Jeremiah wouldn\u2019t like you going out without the dogs. And I\u2019m really not in the mood to drag those two around to the clubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and what if Simon sent Greg Kaplan out with reinforcements to get me? Jerry really wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to fight about Simon all night?\u201d</p><p>I could tell I was stressing Flo out. Was it because I\u2019d suggested she avoid Simon for a night? Hey, she didn\u2019t have to avoid him.</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s your boyfriend. You sure don\u2019t need my permission to go see him. But do us both a favor and tell him you\u2019re taking a night off from the VV. See if he can think of something fun you can do together. Does he ever go out? \u201d He must, he\u2019d met Flo hadn\u2019t he? And come to think of it . . . \u201cHow\u2019d you meet Simon anyway? Where were you?\u201d I made sure I was still blocking any mind probe Flo might try. This info could be useful to Richard and the EV posse.</p><p>\u201cWe met in the park one night. I was a beautiful bird, just enjoying the fresh night air and he landed next to me. \u201d Flo sighed. \u201cI knew he was a vampire immediately of course. He smells delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich park? Do you ever go there together?\u201d I had to make this interrogation seem casual, so I looked at the clock and jumped up. \u201cWow. I\u2019d better get moving if we\u2019re going to make the opening hymn.\u201d We both loved the music at Moonlight. Flo watched me gather underwear and head toward the bathroom. \u201cNo, we never have gone back there. It\u2019s the one by Barton Springs. Very quiet at night. Maybe I\u2019ll have him take me there tonight. It will be romantic. We won\u2019t need the VV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not need it, but are you sure Simon doesn\u2019t need for you to be under the influence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. He never uses it himself and he \u2019s certainly never insisted I take it.\u201d Flo smiled and headed for the living room.</p><p>\u201cHe has an amazing capacity without it. Of course so do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it for a minute, Flo. Why does Simon avoid it? Could it be because it\u2019s addictive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll prove to you that I\u2019m not addicted. Tonight.\u201d Flo grabbed her purse and pulled out her cell phone. \u201cI\u2019m calling Simon right now to set up our date. I\u2019ll meet him in the park after church. No VV. Just a romantic setting and us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I went into the bathroom. Maybe I should call Richard with this information. If he was determined to put Simon out of business, this would be a prime opportunity to get the king of the EVs alone. Of course he wouldn \u2019t be alone, Flo would be with him. And she\u2019d probably defend him, since that seemed to be her knee-jerk reaction lately. It wasn\u2019t like me to rat out a friend. But if telling Richard where he could ambush Simon would get Flo away from the EV, I could deal with the guilt. I jumped in the shower still not sure what I should do. Maybe just finding out if Flo was addicted to the VV would be enough for tonight.</p><p>When I came out of the bedroom, dressed and ready to go, Lacy was back with the dogs.</p><p>\u201cNo way am I splitting it with you fifty -fifty. My money, my human form buying the tickets. \u201d Lacy was eating some of the Cheetos I\u2019d bought for Valdez after the fire. I\u2019d gotten a little carried away with gratitude and had sprung for a case of Big Grabs. She was tossing every other bite into Valdez\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cMy idea, sweetheart. We hit, we split.\u201d Will paced around the living room.</p><p>\u201cWould someone clue me in?\u201d I picked up my purse and checked to make sure I had my cell phone. \u201cWhat are you arguing about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLottery tickets, Blondie.\u201d Valdez caught another Cheetos with a snap of his jaws. \u201cSomeone here seems to have a little gambling problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Will put his head on Lacy\u2019s knee. He frowned when she tried to give him a Cheetos. \u201cI don\u2019t want your cheap snacks. I want champagne, caviar, a winning lottery ticket.\u201d</p><p>Lacy grinned and looked at me. \u201cHe talks me into going into the mini-mart around the corner and buying a few tickets, then he thinks I\u2019m going to split the fortune with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you actually think you have a chance of winning? I don \u2019t waste my money on such as that.\u201d Flo came up behind me and slung an arm around my shoulders, like she wanted to forget our earlier fight. Which was good for me. I hate living in a war zone. And Simon was bound to be a temporary blip on the Florence Da Vinci radar. No man lasted long with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI gave her my lucky numbers. And she bought quick picks with the rest. I say we have a pretty good shot.\u201d Will nudged Lacy\u2019s knees. \u201cCome on, pretty lady. Agree to a split and I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d I swear if a dog could leer, Will was doing it with a wiggle of his furry eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d be interested, dog boy?\u201d Lacy grinned at me. \u201cWhat do you say, Glory? Is the fur face here worth half a jackpot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself, lass.\u201d Will was suddenly in human form, naked, of course, and too close to Lacy.</p> <p>\u201cWill! You know that\u2019s against the rules.\u201d I looked, of course. A fine looking male body is always a treat, even if it is a Kilpatrick male.</p><p>Flo\u2019s arm dropped off my shoulders. \u201cDio mio. You are in excellent shape, William.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. That\u2019s why Blade asked me to do this gig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade is doing you a favor, asshole. Get back in dog form before I tell him to dock your pay.\u201d Valdez looked like he was itching to take a chunk out of Will\u2019s well-toned ass.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019d be a bloody snitch, now, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Will strutted around the room, not the least bit self-conscious while three women looked him over. I tossed him a throw pillow.</p> <p>\u201cCover yourself. Valdez is right. You\u2019re supposed to stay in dog form for the duration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust giving Lacy here a preview of things to come.\u201d Will grinned and held the pillow over his impressive package. \u201cAnd if we win together, Lacy my love, there\u2019s a little boutique hotel in Paris that has a rooftop hot tub. You and me and the Eiffel Tower in the background, baby.\u201d He dropped to his knees in front of Lacy. She was flushed and no longer smiling. \u201cWhat do you say, lass?</p><p>Fifty-fifty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf of nothing is nothing.\u201d Flo had lost interest since Lacy was getting the male attention. \u201cYou won\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Fifty-fifty.\u201d Lacy reached out to touch Will\u2019s handsome face, like to check if she was really seeing what she was seeing. Then Will was back in dog form. \u201cGod, but you\u2019re fast at that. It takes me a full minute to shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the knack, baby. Wait until Paris. You\u2019ll see what else I\u2019ve got the knack for.\u201d Will trotted up to me, a grin on his furry face. \u201cAs for Blade, his little paycheck won\u2019t matter if I hit the jackpot.\u201d</p> <p>Valdez was by my side, his leash in his mouth. \u201cWill\u2019s lying low, Glory. Gambling debts. Like someone else we know, he\u2019s got a serious problem. We need to take him to a GA meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured that out.\u201d Gamblers Anonymous. I\u2019d spent a lot of time in those meetings. I hadn\u2019t even checked them out since I\u2019d arrived in Austin, but talk of winning the lottery reminded me of the lure of easy money. Not that money had ever come easy to me.</p><p>I clipped on the leash, then grabbed another one for Will. \u201cBehave, Will. Lacy, you want to go to church with us?\u201d</p><p>Lacy was still a little bemused. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was Will\u2019s shifting speed or his human form that had her that way. \u201cNo, thanks, I\u2019m staying home and catching some things. I mean catching up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, cat girl, you do what you got to do to survive. Right, Valdez?\u201d Will looked at Flo. \u201cAnd, Florence, if Paris doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ve got a line on a villa on Capri that you and I could check out together.\u201d</p><p>Flo looked thoughtful. \u201cI love Capri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you women snap out of it? The guy\u2019s a loser, in debt to some serious muscle, and shedding fur on your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Valdez chuffed and bumped against me. \u201cGlory, tell me you\u2019re not falling for Prince Charming here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Blame it on VV hangover, but Will\u2019s naked body was burned into my brain. A hot tub in Paris, a villa in Capri. He did have interesting ideas. \u201cI say Will needs an intervention and a twelve-step program. And I should know.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>The entrance to the church was crowded as always. Flo and I nodded to acquaintances, sniffed out a few fellow vampires, then settled into seats near the back. I have an unfortunate habit of levitating when I get into singing along with the choir. It\u2019s like Heaven is calling me. I rise, literally. A female vampire about CiCi\u2019s age sat next to me. She\u2019d helped me before when I\u2019d had liftoff during a song. She was English, wore pretty hats and expensive suits, and smelled vaguely familiar and not just in a vampire way. I pondered the smell during the first songs, then forgot all about it.</p><p>Flo and I dig this church because of the message. Happiness, making the most of life, the fact that God loves you no matter what you might have done in the past. The hunky charismatic Pastor John seemed to look right at us even from the big screen TVs placed around the huge sanctuary. He exhorted us to look forward, not back, for the source of satisfaction in our life. Good idea. Back was not so great.</p><p>I glanced at Flo and wondered what her forward looked like. The preacher asked us to bow our heads and try to focus on what we really wanted in our future. I closed my eyes and saw a successful shop, good friends and Blade. Richard drifted in there too. Probably because we\u2019d seen so much of each other the night before. He did have an incredible body and\u2014</p><p>The woman next to me gave me a sharp elbow in the ribs. Oh, yeah, one of those damned, excuse me, darned mind reading vampires. She sent me a mental message to remember where I was. Church. Not the place for thoughts of hot male bodies and\u2014</p><p>Oops. Another elbow. Flo looked over at me and grinned. She hadn\u2019t missed the byplay. She met the woman\u2019s eyes, lost her smile, but nodded. Like maybe she really did know her. I tried to read elbow lady\u2019s mind, but had no luck. The music started again and I was off and running. I fought the urge to fly up toward the ceiling and had to concentrate to stay down and inconspicuous. The service was over and we were shaking hands with those around us when elbow lady finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, I\u2019m Sarah Mainwaring.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI believe you know my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Richard\u2019s mother?\u201d My mouth dropped open. Wow. If Richard had been a crusader and this was his mother . . .</p><p>\u201cA lady never reveals her age, right, Florence?\u201d Sarah smiled at Flo who wasn\u2019t looking all that thrilled.</p><p>\u201cSignora.\u201d Flo bobbed her head and made a move like she was ready to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait! I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t seen you at some of the vampire meetings, Mrs. Mainwaring. Or with Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Sarah, Gloriana. I\u2019m afraid my son and I don\u2019t always agree on things.\u201d Sarah gave Flo a look, like maybe his fling with the Italian bombshell had been one of those not agreeing issues. \u201cWe usually go our separate ways.\u201d She gestured, her hands graceful. \u201cYou don\u2019t see him here, for example. I think he\u2019s worried I\u2019ve become a heretic. We were Catholics so very long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we all.\u201d Flo muttered, putting her hand on my elbow. \u201cWe left Glory\u2019s dogs outside, Sarah. See you around. \u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease come by my shop sometime.\u201d When I\u2019d first seen this lady, I\u2019d felt drawn to her. Like CiCi, she was a motherly type, one of the few female vampires not still twentysomething. I know, I\u2019m hopeless thinking I could have a mother figure in my life, but Sarah was English, from the feather in her black felt hat, to the tips of her sensible leather pumps. She reminded me of my roots.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gloriana. You\u2019re most gracious.\u201d Sarah held out her hand and I took it. Whoa. What kind of trick was this? I felt the zing from my palm to my toes as Sarah probed my mind, digging in my dark corners like a miner looking for gold. I was afraid all she\u2019d find was bat guano. I threw up a block, but it crashed against a brick wall. Finally I managed to wrench my hand from hers. I breathed a sigh of relief when the connection was broken.</p><p>\u201cThat was intense. Next time you drive your back hoe into my brain, try asking permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d never learn anything interesting, Gloriana.\u201d Sarah ignored Flo and focused on me.</p><p>\u201cDid you see what you were looking for?\u201d Behind me, Flo said something under her breath about nosy bitches.</p><p>\u201cWhat I found, was that you don\u2019t know your own heart, my dear. I saw Jeremiah Campbell.\u201d I gaped at her and she smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I know him and his parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you.\u201d Now it was my turn to mutter nasties.</p><p>\u201cI like to think so. But my son is not so lucky. He has a habit of becoming attached to unavailable women.\u201d She lasered a look at Flo that could have melted steel. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll think long and hard before you lead him to believe you could have real feelings for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve had one date, Sarah. I hardly think you need to jump in and do the \u2018mommie dearest\u2019 thing yet.\u201d Obviously Flo had been on the receiving end of that treatment.</p><p>Sarah just smiled. \u201cRichard never allows my interference. And in your case, Florence, dear, it was hardly necessary. He saw through your tricks soon enough.\u201d</p><p>I stepped between Flo and Sarah and prayed for some kind of distraction. It came in the form of my dog, one of them anyway. Will, trailing his leash, staggered into the sanctuary, an absolute no-no, and fell at my feet.</p><p>\u201cWill! What happened? Are you hurt?\u201d I dropped to my knees and put my arm around him. Then I sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine Scotch whiskey, lassie.\u201d Will licked my cheek, then rested his head on his paws. \u201cMy lucky day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Valdez?\u201d I jumped up and looked around. No sign of him.</p><p>\u201cGone. Told me left a message. On cell phone. Don\u2019t know how. Dumb dog.\u201d Will snorted, then fell into a stupor. I dug in my purse and found my phone. I\u2019d turned it off in church of course. Now I switched it on and saw I had a message.</p><p>\u201cBlade\u2019s called me off, Glory. Guess he\u2019s decided Mara does it for him and you can take care of yourself. Sorry to stick you with Will, but he\u2019s paid till the end of the month. I figure I\u2019m due some vacation time and I\u2019m more than ready to be out of this dog body. See ya.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This voice was smoother, more hip than the Valdez who talked in my head. It didn\u2019t fit with what I\u2019d imagined he\u2019d really sound like. I hit a button and listened to it again. Blade was dumping me? Like this? I didn\u2019t believe it. Something was off here. Had to be.</p><p>\u201cFlo, listen to this.\u201d</p><p>My roomie held the phone, then reared back like someone had spit in her ear. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. That doesn\u2019t sound like Valdez anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe never heard Valdez\u2019s real voice. Blade likes to play tricks. The Valdez before this one sounded like the Taco Bell Chihuahua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. This voice does sound familiar. Maybe . . .\u201d Flo handed back the phone. \u201cCall Jeremiah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to.\u201d I hit speed dial but went straight to Blade\u2019s voice mail.</p><p>\u201cJerry, Valdez is missing. If you called him off I need to know. Call me back immediately. \u201d I broke the connection, then my insecurities hit me like a body blow. I\u2019d been after Jerry for decades to let me live my own life. To take away the guards and trust me to survive on my own. Had he finally decided to take me seriously? I felt hollow and wanted to throw up. I hit speed dial again. \u201cUh, Jerry, I\u2019m okay with it, if you\u2019ve moved on. Just do me the courtesy of telling me to my face, okay?\u201d</p><p>Not okay. The enormous sanctuary blurred and I sank down on one of the pews.</p> <p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. Blade would never dump you like this. \u201d Flo stomped her foot and got in Will\u2019s face. \u201cLook at me, you worthless hound. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>Will raised red-rimmed eyes to her face. \u201cHey, beautiful. Let\u2019s you and me hook up after this is over. I\u2019ve been watching you. I think we could be good together. Que bella. S\u00ec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrate on the problem, signor.\u201d Flo pulled back her foot like she was going to kick him then realized where she was.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Valdez? What have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 I tell ya.\u201d His head sagged again.</p><p>\u201cWill, where did you get the booze?\u201d I squatted next to him and raised his muzzle to look him in the eye. \u201cDid you shift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaw. Some guy put a big bowl of Glenlivet down in front of me.\u201d Will belched, then reached out to lick my face. I jumped back out of range. \u201cSomeone wanted you out of the way. What did he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrown shoes.\u201d Hiccup. \u201cI never looked higher than that beautiful bowl of fine Scot\u2019s whiskey.\u201d Snort. Snore. Sarah had her cell phone to her ear. \u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re at the Moonlight church. Valdez has disappeared. Gloriana\u2019s . . . bodyguard.\u201d Sarah looked at me as she snapped the phone shut. \u201cRichard\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we need him? We haven\u2019t even gone outside to look for Valdez yet.\u201d I grabbed a showy flower arrangement, tossed the flowers on a nearby pew and dumped water on Will\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019d I do?\u201d Will staggered to his feet, then shook water all over us. An usher hurried up.</p><p>\u201cLadies, ladies, please respect the sanctuary. And the dog, unless he\u2019s a Seeing Eye dog, should stay outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I grabbed Will\u2019s leash and dragged him toward the door. I\u2019d played blind a time or two and still felt guilty about it. Will was dead weight, barely able to walk. Finally, I picked him up. And didn\u2019t that raise some eyebrows. Will\u2019s no lightweight. Outside, I dumped him on the grass. Where was Valdez? I looked around, called him. He couldn\u2019t have come up with a bowl of fine Scotch or brown shoes. I figure if he shape -shifted he\u2019d still be naked and there would have been at least some kind of commotion, even at this liberal church. So I asked strangers if they \u2019d seen a black Labradoodle with a red and white bandana around his neck, his church attire. Okay, that did it. Tears filled my eyes again and I sat on a stone bench in the garden in front of the church.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t just leave like that, Glory. He\u2019s really attached to you.\u201d Flo sat beside me and put her arm around me.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I thought so. We\u2019ve been together for years.\u201d I took the pristine white hanky Sarah pressed into my hand and dabbed at my eyes. \u201cAnd what\u2019s with Jerry? If he wanted to cut me loose, all he had to do was say so. I\u2019m not going to force myself on him.\u201d</p> <p>At least not unless I\u2019d had a good dose of the Vamp Viagra when he was in the room.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s Richard.\u201d Sarah smiled at her tall son.</p><p>I felt warmth in my cheeks, remembering the fiasco from last night, how I \u2019d exposed myself in more ways than one to Richard. But any embarrassment could take a backseat today. Valdez was missing. He had to be my first priority. I looked up and met Richard\u2019s gaze. I could see his resemblance to his mother now that they were side by side. Sarah \u2019s hair wasn\u2019t nearly as white blond as Richard\u2019s but she was fair. And they both had the same aristocratic air about them. Richard had probably shifted somewhere else then just walked up. He obviously hadn\u2019t arrived that fast by car or motorcycle unless he\u2019d been following me.</p><p>Nope. He had better things to do, like obsess over finding the EV stronghold. That obsession just might come in very handy. I had that hollow feeling again, this time because the problem with Valdez had EV trick written all over it. I had no proof of course, just my gut.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Valdez when you came in?\u201d I jumped up and grabbed Richard\u2019s hands. I glanced around and saw more people come out of the sanctuary.</p><p>\u201cNo sign of him.\u201d Richard squeezed my hands. \u201cI see you\u2019ve met my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A pleasant surprise.\u201d I ignored Flo\u2019s snort. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find Valdez. He left a kiss-off message on my phone, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s him talking. Not that I have a clue what his real voice sounds like, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me hear it.\u201d</p><p>I hit the button then handed Richard the phone. He listened then handed it back. \u201cBlade dumping you? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>He watched me carefully. I really didn\u2019t want this to turn into a drama all about my broken heart, which wasn \u2019t, by the way, broken. Okay, maybe slightly cracked. \u201cNo way. Jerry and I have a complicated relationship, but we\u2019re always honest with each other. Jerry would never let one of his minions do his talking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Valdez either. He seems loyal. I can\u2019t see him taking off like that.\u201d Richard squeezed my hand holding the phone.</p><p>\u201cTry Blade again. Let\u2019s spread out and see if we can find the dog.\u201d</p><p>Richard approached a small group of people while I re-dialed Blade. More voice mail. I hung up and looked inside the sanctuary again. The place was huge. I ran down the aisles until that same long-suffering usher stepped in front of me.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am? Can I help you with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dog. I lost my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big one that came in here?\u201d The usher looked toward the hastily rearranged flowers and the wet spot on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cNo, this was a black dog, with a bandana tied around his neck. He always waits for me right outside the sanctuary, by the door.\u201d I felt a tear run down my cheek and the usher patted my back.</p><p>\u201cCheck over by the fellowship hall. They always have cake and coffee after the service. Maybe he smelled the food and headed that way.\u201d The man smiled and I wanted to wail against his starched white shirt. Instead, I sniffed. Ordinary human, who definitely needed his cholesterol checked. \u201cGo see a doctor. Get some blood work.\u201d</p><p>The man stared at me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh . . .\u201d What had I seen on the Health Channel? \u201cI\u2019m a medical empath. I sense a thickening in your blood. Take care of yourself or you\u2019re going to have a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You sense that? Just by looking at me?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a sniff than a look. Take care.\u201d I patted his hand then raced to the door.</p><p>\u201cWait! What\u2019s your name? I want you to look at my wife and my mother. Not my mother-in-law, the heck with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe next Sunday.\u201d I didn\u2019t look back, afraid he would follow me. I sure wasn\u2019t waiting around to find out. I scooted to a stop next to Flo who stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cFellowship Hall. They have cake and you know how Valdez is about sweets.\u201d I headed down the sidewalk, pulling Flo along behind me.</p><p>\u201cCake. Yeah, he\u2019d go for that.\u201d Flo hurried to keep up with me.</p><p>I can run pretty damn fast in heels. We rounded the corner and saw a crowd coming out of the square building dubbed Fellowship Hall. Many of them were laughing and one woman was dabbing at her skirt. Pink and white icing.</p><p>\u201cWho let that dog in there, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I pushed through the crowd. What had been a nice sheet cake lay in clumps on the tile in front of the long table. A pretty tablecloth had obviously been used to pull the cake off the table. Valdez had his mouth full, oblivious to the dirty looks people were giving him.</p><p>\u201cValdez! Come here! Bad dog!\u201d I dove for his leash. He danced away then shook his head. Frosting and cake flew everywhere.</p><p>\u201cStop it! Come here.\u201d I stomped my foot, slipped on icing and almost sat in the middle of it. He ignored me to take another bite of cake. While he chewed, I grabbed the leash. I tugged, but he just sat down and started licking pink icing off one paw. I finally knelt down and put my hand on his head.</p><p>\u201cValdez, puppy. I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>He barked and leaped, paws landing on my shoulders, raking pink and white frosting down my corduroy dress. I pushed him back and sent him a mental message to cool it. My answer was a tail wag, another bark and a lick in the direction of my face.</p><p>\u201cSit. Sit. Bad dog.\u201d I pushed him until he sat in front of me. A stranger handed me a pile of paper towels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not invited back to Sunday service, miss, unless you can tie him up somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! The Lord loves dogs.\u201d A woman with a broom and dustpan in her hand spoke up. Several parishioners nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe need a dog park, a fenced area where we can leave our pets while we worship.\u201d A man knelt down and held the dustpan while the woman swept chunks of cake into it.</p><p>\u201cYou bet we do.\u201d Another man whipped out his cell phone. \u201cI\u2019m calling Pastor John right now. He\u2019ll love the idea. Maybe we could have a bake sale\u201d\u2014laughter from the crowd\u2014\u201cto raise funds for it.\u201d</p><p>I guess the church\u2019s happiness message worked because no one threatened to call the dogcatcher. And Valdez had made a huge mess.</p> <p>I plucked a pink frosting rose from the top of his head and, sue me, but I tasted it. What, you think I worry about germs? Mmm. Sweet. I resisted downing the whole thing, especially when I felt someone watching me. I turned and saw Richard standing in the doorway, his mother right beside him. Flo stayed on the other side of the room, as far away from flying frosting as she could get.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m really, really sorry. My dog is usually very well behaved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, honey. If you\u2019re single, you should join the group in the Twilight Room. After you clean up the dog, that is. The singles are enjoying a late supper. Nice group of folks, some men and women about your age and some older.\u201d</p><p>My age? If she only knew. \u201cThanks, maybe next week.\u201d</p><p>Richard was beside me in a flash. \u201cWe\u2019re both really sorry about the mess.\u201d He slung an arm around me, implying we were a couple. Hmm.</p> <p>The woman wadded up the dirty tablecloth and shook her head. \u201cA shame about the cake, though. It was going to be dessert for the singles later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Let me pay\u2014\u201d I dug in my purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Gloriana.\u201d Richard\u2019s mother pressed a wad of cash into the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease. Accept a donation for the group. For future desserts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Thanks.\u201d The dazed woman\u2019s eyes widened when she realized what she held. \u201cNext week I\u2019ll order chocolate cake. That\u2019s the group\u2019s favorite. Just don\u2019t let the dog in here. I\u2019ve heard chocolate is bad for dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The dog should stay in the car, shouldn\u2019t he?\u201d Sarah gave Richard a speaking look and he dragged Valdez out the door.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d Flo was by my side.</p> <p>\u201cI really need to wash my hands.\u201d I headed for the door clearly marked \u201cLadies\u201d near the back wall. Once inside, I dabbed at pink and white frosting until I finally gave up and just licked my fingers. Delicious.</p><p>\u201cWhat a disaster.\u201d Flo pushed inside, then looked around the bathroom to make sure we were alone while I washed my hands.</p><p>\u201cThose people were giving you the evil eye out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Wonder if there\u2019s another church with night services. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll be blackballed after this.\u201d I dried my hands on a paper towel then stared at the large mirror in front of me. Of course I wasn\u2019t seeing either one of us.</p><p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Flo put her hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cValdez. What\u2019s wrong with him? Do you think he really left that message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if Blade told him to.\u201d Flo reached up and pulled a piece of cake out of my hair. She sniffed, then dropped it in the trash can.</p><p>The very possibility hit me like a body blow. \u201cWhat? And then Blade said \u2018Let them eat cake\u2019?\u201d I rubbed at a spot on my skirt.</p> <p>\u201cDid you see the mess Valdez just made? Our Valdez knows we try to keep a low profile.\u201d I gave up on the skirt.</p><p>\u201cBut, Glory, if Valdez didn\u2019t leave that message, who did? And why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s pulling my chain, Flo. Who and why? One guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go again. Simon, always Simon.\u201d Flo put her hands on her hips. \u201cI won\u2019t hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that dog is your bodyguard?\u201d Sarah Mainwaring swept into the room, white frosting paw prints on her skirt.</p><p>\u201cRichard says Valdez is not himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. This is totally out of character. \u201d I wasn\u2019t just worried about my dog. I was getting frantic. Sure, we \u2019d been surrounded by people, but he was acting like a . . . dog. I handed Sarah a paper towel. \u201cThanks, Sarah, for taking care of the cake. I insist on reimbursing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. I\u2019m quite able to afford it. Who knows? Maybe I\u2019ll check out the singles group myself some Sunday night.\u201d Sarah smiled at me, turning at Flo\u2019s barely stifled snicker. \u201cPerhaps you should try it as well, Florence. Richard seems to feel that your current \u2018friend\u2019 is an unsavory character. \u201d Sarah wet the paper towel and carefully dabbed at her skirt. Flo jerked her chin up. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you care who I see, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, of course. But Richard has shared his concerns about the company you\u2019ve been keeping.\u201d Sarah sniffed. \u201cNot that it should be his concern.\u201d</p><p>Flo muttered something in Italian. Sarah muttered something back in the same language and I stepped between them.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should ask Simon about Valdez. If he wants to get my attention, Flo, taking out one of my guards would be a heck of a start.\u201d</p><p>Flo turned her back on Sarah. \u201cYou always blame Simon for everything. Maybe Jeremiah tires of you. That she-devil Mara has probably been throwing herself at him. You should shape-shift. Go after your man, if you want to keep him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, say what you think, why don\u2019t you?\u201d This was my best friend? Where was the support? But then I\u2019d done nothing but slam Simon since Flo had started going out with him. Maybe it was time for me to get smart, use some psychology. I put my hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my role model, Flo. I don\u2019t see you chasing after a man to keep him. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes shimmered and I thought she might be working up to shed a tear or two. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I bitched at you about this. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m worried about Valdez too. The phone call. Then going so crazy. This is not our Valdez. Something\u2019s wrong with him. And if Simon did this\u2014\u201d Tears gone, she clenched her fists and turned to face Sarah again. \u201cI\u2019ll find out if Simon had anything to do with this. And if he did, he\u2019ll make things right. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d Flo turned back to me. \u201cWill you be okay, Glory, if I leave you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Flo was going to confront Simon? Was this a good idea? What if he punished her like he\u2019d punished Greg Kaplan? \u201cBut, Flo, be careful.\u201d We stepped out of the bathroom and I looked around. The place was clean again, and didn\u2019t that make me feel guilty? It was deserted, but I could hear laughter coming from the Twilight Room. Sarah frowned down at her damp skirt. \u201cI\u2019m late for my book club and, after wading through that boring literary novel, I\u2019m not going to miss it. Richard can give you my telephone number, Gloriana. Call me sometime and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBook club?\u201d Flo and I stared after her as she breezed out the door.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Lady Sarah Mainwaring has a club for everything. \u201d Flo shook her head. \u201cThat woman\u2019s a barracuda, Glory. She\u2019ll take a chunk out of you if she thinks you\u2019re hurting her baby boy.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Now that I had my dog back, a dog who\u2019d probably just been indulging his food obsession, I felt like I could deal with anything.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Flo. Richard doesn\u2019t strike me as a mama\u2019s boy.\u201d The idea of Richard being anyone\u2019s baby boy was ludicrous.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. But Sarah can afford to spring for a few cakes. While Richard goes around saving the world from bad vampires, who do you think pays the bills? She has an investment club too.\u201d Flo sighed. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is a disaster.\u201d She ran a hand through her hair. \u201cI\u2019d better not have cake in my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. What about my hair?\u201d Not that I really cared. For once how I looked meant zilch. Flo knew it too. She put her own dress at risk to give me a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou look good considering what you\u2019ve just been through. The dog has much to answer for. But if Simon did something to him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go throwing around accusations, Flo.\u201d I grabbed her arm. \u201cBe careful how you handle Simon. He\u2019s got some powerful stuff going on out there. He ever mention Honoria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother woman?\u201d Flo laughed. \u201cOf course not. Relax, Glory. I\u2019ve been handling men for centuries.\u201d Flo pulled a lipstick from her purse and expertly reapplied it. \u201cI will get the truth from him.\u201d She winked. \u201cOne way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo VV tonight?\u201d I know, I know. I\u2019m not her mother. But I have a little experience with addiction. And my best bud was showing some signs . . .</p><p>\u201cI said I would do without it, didn\u2019t I?\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing you worried about Jeremiah. Do you really think he would just dump you? Get real, Glory. And for Mara, the ice queen? That woman would freeze a man\u2019s balls off.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. If Blade had dumped me for Mara, I hoped his balls spent eternity in permafrost. My stomach rumbled and I didn\u2019t think it was from icing. None of this added up. No way did Valdez leave that message. Someone else had to have done it. Otherwise, why was there still a black Labradoodle outside waiting for me?</p><p>\u201cI think it was a prank. Someone\u2019s trying to upset me. The last time we talked, Jerry and I were getting along very well. \u201d Like orgasmically well.</p><p>\u201cNow you make sense. No silly doubts about Jeremiah. He adores you.\u201d Flo looked down at my skirt and frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll miss this church. Nice people. I think I saw a vampire in the singles group too.\u201d She pulled open the door and headed out. I followed her. Richard stood outside the door, a subdued Valdez beside him. A few people still talked nearby, single smokers who wanted a last drag before they went inside to mix and mingle.</p><p>\u201cBad dog. You know how to stay.\u201d I said this for our audience. \u201cLet\u2019s go. No treat for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky if he doesn\u2019t toss his cookies, I mean cake, when he\u2019s in the car.\u201d The smokers laughed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry for ruining social hour, folks. I\u2019d better get this dog home.\u201d I took the leash from Richard and pulled Valdez along to the car. When we got there, Richard opened the back door and Valdez hopped in to settle beside a snoring Will. I grabbed Richard\u2019s arm. \u201cDid Valdez talk to you while I was inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I tried to send him a mental message, but he either ignored it or didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t understand . . . ?\u201d My stomach rolled over. I opened the back door again, picked up Valdez\u2019s head and stared into his brown eyes. \u201cValdez! Say something.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing. Not even a whimper. He did lick my fingers though, as if hoping for some more frosting. I grabbed both his ears and stared harder, like I could make him respond. \u201cPlease, puppy. Say something. Anything. Call me Blondie.\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head like he was ready for me to let him go if I wasn\u2019t going to pet him. I released him and turned to Richard.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with my dog?\u201d</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>We were back at my place before I remembered to tell Richard about Flo\u2019s meeting with Simon in the park.</p> <p>\u201cThis is huge, Glory. Maybe we can catch him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to him, Richard? Try to take him out?\u201d In other words, stake him. I shuddered just thinking about it. I knew Simon was a bad man, but killing any vampire seemed almost sacrilegious to me. And Flo. Would she ever forgive me for sending the troops in after her lover? I hoped once she \u2019d had time to think about how she\u2019d been acting, she\u2019d realize she\u2019d needed to move on.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m being too tough on him? Roll Valdez over, Glory.\u201d Richard stared down at my pair of dogs, both snoring near the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at his tummy, Glory. See if the reason he won\u2019t talk is because he can\u2019t.\u201d Richard didn\u2019t wait. He knelt down and rolled a snoozing Valdez over until we could see his swollen stomach. Sure enough there were two angry red marks on his belly. I gasped. \u201cYou think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat an EV did this? Yes, I do. I\u2019d say that while you were in church and Will was nose deep in whiskey someone conveniently put in front of him, Valdez had an encounter with Simon or another EV and he obviously lost the fight and his power.\u201d</p> <p>I sat down hard on the floor and rubbed Valdez\u2019s tummy. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean right now Valdez is just a dog. Not a shape-shifter. Unless there\u2019s some way for the EVs to reverse the process, Valdez may never be able to shift again.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over and rubbed my face against the dog\u2019s soft fur. He smiled and licked a tear from my face. I breathed in his scent, a scent I knew as well as my own.</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I knew there was something wrong with Valdez when he didn\u2019t ask for ice cream with his cake.\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled and patted my shoulder. \u201cHe would, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d He left me sitting there and started to work his phone, calling on fellow vamps and making plans to ambush Simon at the park.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, Glory.\u201d Richard dropped a kiss on the top of my head. Yeah, I was still on the floor, Valdez\u2019s head in my lap.</p><p>\u201cWait. Simon has to be behind Valdez\u2019s condition. If there\u2019s any hope of getting my dog restored to his old pain-in -the-butt self, Simon or Honoria holds the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise not to destroy Simon if I get the chance, Glory. I\u2019ve been after him for a long time.\u201d He rubbed Valdez\u2019s ear.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Valdez will recover his power on his own. Eventually. \u201d Richard looked at me and wiped away a tear that had leaked down my cheek. \u201cI know you love him. I\u2019ll do what I can to find out how to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I held on to his hand for a moment. \u201cI know what getting Simon means to you. Do what you have to.\u201d</p><p>He stood, tall, powerful and determined. If he got a chance at Simon, he\u2019d take it. And Valdez . . . ? He would have cheered Richard on.</p><p>I sat there on the floor for a long time after Richard left, stroking Valdez \u2019s soft fur. An EV had done this. Which meant Jerry hadn\u2019t dumped me after all. I was so relieved I would have laughed, if I hadn\u2019t felt more like crying. Was there any hope of getting the old Valdez back? I had to find out.</p><p>The phone rang. I got up and pulled my cell phone out of my purse. I glanced at the caller ID and caught my breath. Blade.</p><p>\"Hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, what the hell is going on there? Why do you think I called Valdez off?\u201d Jerry was shouting, like maybe I couldn\u2019t hear him across the ocean. Or like maybe he was really upset.</p><p>\u201cValdez is here. I found him. But he or someone left a message that you\u2019d called him off. Because you\u2019d hooked up with Mara. Which is allowed, of course. We do our own thing when we\u2019re apart, always have.\u201d I took a breath and looked at Valdez, snoring softly by the door. The old Valdez would have been up at the first notes of \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d my ring tone. He\u2019d have been listening in, like that was in his job description. He really was just a nosy . . . I sobbed.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch! Gloriana, tell me everything. And I \u2019m not hooked up with anyone. I\u2019m living like a monk outside a clinic in Switzerland so I can watch Westwood. He\u2019s more vulnerable here, outside of his own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I took a watery breath. A monk, huh? Good news for me, bad for Mara. \u201cI mean, you should stay there. That bastard is a threat to every vampire.\u201d If Simon was allowed to just suck power from anyone or thing he wanted, then he was an enormous threat too. God, when did my life get so complicated?</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s happened. What about Valdez?\u201d Blade\u2019s calm voice soothed me.</p><p>I took a breath then filled him in on recent events at the church. By the time I got through with the story, Blade was cursing and swearing to be by my side by morning.</p><p>\u201cNo, you should stay there. Flo and Richard are looking into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of Simon Destiny and his EV crew. I had a friend who tried their daylight drug. \u201d Blade was silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cLiam paid them a fortune. He was so excited to see the sun again. But it was the last thing he saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jerry. Maybe he thought it was worth it.\u201d I\u2019d had those yearnings.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the answer to that, now, will we? Thanks to Simon Destiny.\u201d Jerry cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about Valdez, Jerry. He\u2019s a . . . dog. What if he\u2019s lost all his powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafael is a very strong shape-shifter. That\u2019s why I hired him. He may be temporarily out of commission, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s permanent.\u201d Jerry said something to someone else and I heard a female voice in the background.</p><p>\u201cIs Mara with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just came in. I\u2019m going to leave her here and come home to you, Glory. I don\u2019t like the fact that Simon\u2019s been trying to lure you to his den of drug dealers. Or that he\u2019s managed to temporarily take out one of your guards. We will resolve this and Simon Destiny will get what he deserves once and for all.\u201d Jerry sounded so damned sure of himself. That kind of confidence made me actually hope that things would come out all right.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t come. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I looked at Valdez, then at Will who was still sleeping off his bender. Well, I\u2019d always said I could look out for myself. Time to test that theory.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve made up my mind. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>Of course I was relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to leave there tonight. Wait until tomorrow night. It\u2019s a long, long way from Switzerland to Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a long way. But I\u2019ll leave here tonight, see how far I get, then spend the day somewhere safe and be there sometime tomorrow night. Wait for me, Gloriana, before you do anything about Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear and obey, master.\u201d I knew he was just being cautious. It was sweet. Dictatorial, but sweet.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart. Humor me. I\u2019m so damned far away. I want to hold you and tell you that everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cThen do it. Like you did the other night. Hold me. Put your arms around me and your lips on my hair. \u201d I concentrated. \u201cAnd I\u2019m holding onto you, Jerry. Just breathing, not trying to get you naked or anything like that.\u201d Though now that I thought about it, there was nothing more comforting than lying skin to skin in Jerry\u2019s strong arms.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Glory. What did you say? Mara was telling me we have an opportunity to get to Westwood later tonight. He\u2019s going into surgery in the morning to try to get his arm fixed. He\u2019ll be in a regular hospital room. If we can get inside, we might have a shot at him.\u201d</p><p>I gave up. The mood wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cThen go get him. I\u2019ll be fine. Will\u2019s going to sober up. Flo\u2019s investigating Simon and maybe Richard and his vigilantes will manage to get to Simon anyway. \u201d I hung up before I said something bitchy. Trust Mara to come up with a plan just when Jerry was ready to fly to my side.</p><p>I sat down beside Valdez again. \u201cYou never told me your name is Rafael. Rafe. I like it. Wonder what your last name is. Is it Spanish too? Are you tall, dark and handsome out of that dog body?\u201d I patted his head, but he just stared up at me with big brown eyes, his tail thumping on the hardwood floor.</p><p>I sighed and got up. A few hours until dawn. Did I just sit here and wait for something to happen? Would Flo call me? Would Richard? Will snored, obviously still useless. What good would it do Valdez if I ran off and did something foolish, like storm the park myself? I sat on the couch and picked up my latest book, a bestseller on assertiveness. Half a page and I was heaving it across the room. What did a mortal know about the kind of assertiveness I needed? I wasn \u2019t thinking about asking the boss for a raise or a boyfriend to commit. Hell, I just wanted the leader of the EVs to restore my dog \u2019s powers. Assertiveness in this situation would get me nothing but trouble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But then I\u2019m a badass vampire. I don\u2019t run from trouble, I start it.</p><p>When the phone rang close to dawn, I almost jumped out of my skin. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d actually dozed off on the couch.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlory, it\u2019s Flo. I\u2019m with Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoying your date?\u201d I glanced at my dogs, sleeping peacefully.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo, honey, are you in trouble?\u201d I couldn\u2019t sit still and carried the phone to the fridge for a bottle of Fangtastic. \u201cWhere are you two?\u201d I hoped at the park surrounded by angry vamps with stakes. They wouldn\u2019t hurt Flo and surely she wouldn\u2019t risk her own life for Simon. Unless he\u2019d done some kind of whammy on her . . . I leaned against the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at Simon\u2019s headquarters. We didn\u2019t go to the park after all.\u201d Flo took a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory, but Simon is the one who took Valdez\u2019s power. He says if you want your dog back like he used to be, you\u2019ll have to come here and give the EVs something they need.\u201d Flo sobbed. \u201cDon\u2019t do it, Glory! We\u2019ll figure something out. He\u2019ll make you a drone.\u201d There was a crash.</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, your friend is hysterical. Please understand that no lasting harm will come to either you or Florence if you follow my instructions.\u201d The male voice was smooth, unaccented, with a mesmerizing quality that I felt even over the phone. The room swam and I staggered back to the couch. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt Florence, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorence is my lover. Why would I hurt her? We don\u2019t need to play those games.\u201d He actually chuckled. I wanted to throw up. \u201cWhy did you hurt my dog, Simon? \u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get to you, Gloriana. I think you have an enormous amount of power just going to waste. I can take what I need and then I will happily restore your \u2018dog\u2019 to his former abilities. \u201d He laughed again. \u201cThis foolish attachment amuses me. Even Florence is moved to tears over the animal\u2019s plight. I found him to be quite ordinary. Shifters are never as interesting as ancient vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shifter was my shifter. And by vamp standards I\u2019m not ancient. I\u2019m practically a kid. Born way after the Crusades. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re old enough to have developed some interesting power. Florence has told me how you\u2019ve been experimenting with it. You\u2019ve been delightfully original.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the compliments, Simon. I don\u2019t see how you can be so sure I have the kind of power you need.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t shape-shift, my dear. Sad for you, but excellent for my purposes. Shifting really drains a lot of power from a vampire. And your . . . dog. He hardly provided enough to make one dose of the VV. Pathetic, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez, pathetic? Listen, Destiny. That shifter is worth a dozen of you. I can\u2019t tell you how many times he\u2019s saved my butt over the years.\u201d My voice cracked and I swiped at tears. Will was up and had his head in my lap. Valdez still sat near the door, ew, licking himself. That did it. I couldn\u2019t hold back a sob.</p><p>\u201cNow, Gloriana. Calm yourself. You can take care of Mr. Valdez\u2019s problem. Come see me and I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I possibly trust you to keep your word?\u201d I found a tissue and blew my nose. Weeping could wait. I had to do something. But I could see it now. Valdez and I would head out to the EV stronghold, wherever that was, and become zombielike creatures, tubes hanging out of our belly buttons for easy access. I gripped the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the king of the EVs, Gloriana. Of course you can trust me.\u201d The very arrogance of that statement convinced me he\u2019d lie like a cheap watch if it suited his purposes. Or to get what he wanted. And what he wanted was, gulp, my power.</p><p>\u201cNo freakin\u2019 way. Maybe I can figure out how to give power to my pup without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible, my dear. Exchanging power is an ancient art that only an Energy Vampire has mastered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ancient art? Get over yourself, Destiny. Flo can tell you about real art. Sucking tummies doesn\u2019t qualify. Does Honoria think you\u2019re an artist?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will not speak the Demoness\u2019s name, woman.\u201d</p><p>Boy, had I struck a nerve. \u201cMaybe she\u2019d be disappointed in how you\u2019re handling things here in Austin. You\u2019ve got the whole vampire community stirred up against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re being foolish. Vampires are my customers. Honoria is well pleased with my progress here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Then swear on her name that you\u2019ll restore my dog and let me go after you get what you want from me. I won \u2019t turn into a drone for you, Simon.\u201d I jumped up and went to sit on the floor next to Valdez. There had to be a way to help Valdez without going through the EVs. The marks where his power had been drained were gone. And even if I bit him on his hairy belly\u2014</p><p>ew\u2014I would be taking blood, not giving him anything. And Valdez wasn\u2019t a vampire. Biting me would provide him with nothing but a creepy snack.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t swear on the Demoness\u2019s name for such trivial matters. I know you \u2019re distraught or you wouldn\u2019t try issuing orders when I hold all the cards here. Do you really want to alienate the one person who can give you what you want? I \u2019ll hang up now. Perhaps you\u2019ll be more rational tomorrow. \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d I had to deal with this creep-a-zoid, he was the only game in town. \u201cSend Flo home, let her tell me about your operation. Maybe we can work something out. I don\u2019t have a lot of money, but I have friends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not in a position to bargain, Gloriana. Florence stays here. I believe you\u2019re quite attached to her as well. And your dog is useless to you as he is. If you want your roommate and your dog restored to you in good . . . condition, I suggest you do as I ask.\u201d</p><p>I heard a scuffle in the background. You can bet Flo didn\u2019t like being used as a bargaining chip. I hope she\u2019d flown out of there while she had the chance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you time to think this over. I\u2019ll call back tomorrow night at sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! I don\u2019t even know how to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Someone will pick you up, if you decide your friends are worth the effort.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d hung up. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Worth the effort? Flo and Valdez were worth everything to me. But I dreaded the whole idea of even meeting Simon, much less dealing with him. One thing was certain. I wasn \u2019t about to get within a hundred yards of Simon Destiny alone. I was taking a freakin\u2019 army with me.</p><p>\"You will come alone, Gloriana, except for the dog. The car is outside as we speak. Try any tricks and you \u2019ll never see Florence again.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Double crap. Did I dare go see the EVs alone? I looked up at Richard who \u2019d arrived before sunrise and slept on my couch. No hanky-panky had been attempted or even mentioned. We were both too wrung out by the thought that Flo could be drained dry, then left out in the sun by that ruthless bastard Simon Destiny.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to Flo, make sure she\u2019s all right. Otherwise, no deal.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded and put his hand on my shoulder. He didn\u2019t need to lean closer to hear my phone conversation, vamp hearing and all. He was really grim, like destroyed grim. Poor guy obviously still had feelings for Flo. Of course I had feelings for my roomie too. If Simon hurt her . . .</p><p>\u201cGlory.\u201d Flo sounded weak.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, honey? Is that bastard mistreating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Just tired. Simon won\u2019t give me any Vamp Viagra. I need it.\u201d She sobbed and the phone rattled, like maybe she\u2019d dropped it.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Gloriana, Florence is just suffering from withdrawal. I haven\u2019t hurt her, she hurt herself when she got dependent on my product.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour product. Gee, you know Flo thinks you and I are alike, Simon. Both businesspeople. But at least what I sell doesn\u2019t turn my customers into addicts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d Simon chuckled. \u201cAnd how many shoes does Florence own? How many handbags? Sounds like shopping can be an addiction to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d had just about enough of this chitchat. Flo was suffering, Valdez was a dog and Richard was practically foaming at the mouth. But we\u2019d agreed I\u2019d handle this. Simon wouldn\u2019t deal with a man he knew had been after him for years.</p><p>\u201cYou say the car\u2019s already downstairs?\u201d I walked over to lift the blackout drapes and saw a Honda Accord idling at the curb with its lights on. \u201cA silver Honda? Business must be bad if that \u2019s the best you can do. Where\u2019s the Mercedes, Simon? The Beemer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake your jokes, Gloriana. Obviously Florence and Valdez mean little to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, I\u2019m coming. Just give me a few minutes to get dressed. Tell your driver I\u2019ll be down in ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. But no more than ten minutes, Gloriana, or he\u2019ll leave and you\u2019ll have lost your chance to save your friends.\u201d</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>I looked at Richard. \u201cNow what? I need a weapon, a nice sharp stake. But what do you bet the driver searches me before he lets me in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he will. I have a plan.\u201d Richard pulled a bottle out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to drug someone? What will that do? I need the driver to take me to the EV hideout. \u201d I\u2019d dressed in jeans and running shoes, my hot pink \u201cWeird Austin\u201d T-shirt and a hoodie. \u201cI\u2019ve got pockets in my jeans, but . . .\u201d I knew from experience that only a credit card could fit in that space. I know, but I like them tight.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfume. Smell.\u201d He uncapped the bottle and I didn\u2019t need to move closer to get a whiff.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! I told you, I don\u2019t wear perfume because it messes up my sense of smell, but that smells wonderful. Where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s Joy, I think. It was the strongest-smelling perfume she had.\u201d He dipped the stopper inside and then waved it around. \u201cSexy. Which is deeply disturbing on so many levels.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, so Mummy has excellent taste. Why\u2019d you bring it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going with you, Glory. And I don\u2019t want any of the other vampires to smell me on you.\u201d He reached forward and dabbed it behind my ears.</p><p>I inhaled. Absolutely delicious. \u201cWait. You can\u2019t go with me. I have to go alone. Or alone except for Valdez. You know he has to come with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming too. I\u2019m shifting into something very small. I\u2019ll be where they won\u2019t see me and now they won\u2019t be able to smell me either.\u201d</p><p>Before I knew what he was going to do, he lifted my T-shirt and exposed my Kevlar bra. My Wonder Woman bra had a bright yellow \"W\u201d on gray since Kevlar didn\u2019t come in red. Kevlar was good defense and just about impenetrable. The Wonder Woman thing had been Blade\u2019s idea. And wearing the bra always reminded me that I was powerful. Maybe too powerful since Simon wanted a piece of me.</p><p>\u201cI approve. You\u2019re well prepared.\u201d He ripped open the Velcro fastening between my breasts and they sprang free.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re in the middle of something serious here, Romeo. Get a grip.\u201d I grabbed the edges of the bra.</p><p>\u201cLet me put some perfume here.\u201d He slid the cold stopper between my breasts, then leaned forward and sniffed. \u201cA little more, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, this was ridiculous. I needed to focus and his little games were wearing on my last nerve. \u201cHand me the stopper, Richard. I can do it.\u201d I grabbed the stopper, dipped it in the pretty bottle, then swabbed my cleavage. Oh, boy, now I felt surrounded by a cloud of expensive scent. Too much, because my head started to throb. I pulled my bra back together.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me help.\u201d Richard took the stopper and set the bottle on a table. Then he moved behind me to press his hands on my temples. \u201cRelax, Gloriana. Focus on what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d</p><p>The pressure in my head eased, but I sure couldn\u2019t relax. \u201cWhat is this plan, Richard? I\u2019m not going to just give up my power, or let Valdez spend eternity as a dick-licking\u2014 sorry fella, but that\u2019s all you\u2019ve been doing lately\u2014dog.\u201d I put my hand on Valdez\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you. When the time is right, I\u2019ll shift into my human form and we\u2019ll take care of Simon. And I know you want Valdez restored. I\u2019ll try to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe. You. I\u2019m the one with the most at stake here, Richard. And I want to handle Simon. Maybe I \u2019ll give him some power. You said it can come back. I\u2019ll recover.\u201d I pulled down my T-shirt. \u201cAnd where you think you can hide, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re going to search my purse. My hoodie has pockets, but they\u2019ll check those too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Glory.\u201d Richard pulled up my shirt and touched the cleavage bulging over the top. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here. Over your heart. After I change, you can put me between your breasts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPervert. What could you possibly turn into\u2014\u201d I gasped when Richard disappeared. Poof. Just like that. Valdez growled and I looked down. A mouse. A little white, albino mouse. Valdez leaped and the race was on. The mouse, uh, Richard ran under the table and Valdez knocked over the lamp trying to get at him. I shouted at Valdez to stop, but he wasn\u2019t listening. I grabbed his collar and worked on hauling him into the bedroom. At least without power he didn \u2019t have his super strength. I dragged him, still barking, into the bedroom and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cYou can come out now.\u201d</p><p>The mouse crawled out from under the couch and hurried to sit next to my left foot. I shuddered, but leaned down to put out my hand. He crawled onto my palm.</p><p>\u201cThanks for not becoming a cockroach. I don\u2019t think I could have handled that between my boobs.\u201d I have a thing about bugs, go figure.</p><p>\u201cLoosen the Velcro, Glory. And see if you can push your breasts apart a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServe you right if you suffocated in there.\u201d But of course I did what he said. I made a nice little cave. His nose twitched and his little beady eyes, blue, of course, didn\u2019t miss a thing. But I finally got the Velcro closed without damaging either him or my boobs. This was a good, if awkward, thing. I needed backup. Richard was powerful. And a cute little mouse.</p><p>\u201cI have to warn you right now, Glory. You\u2019ve got to keep up your mind shield. I can read you so easily. Simon will be able to read you, too. Block everyone but me. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, now I\u2019ll really have a headache.\u201d I hoped to hell I could manage it. Selective blocking is quite a trick. Of course I \u2019d blocked before, but now I\u2019d have to be really careful. Another headache bloomed when I tried. It didn\u2019t help that Valdez was still barking behind the bedroom door. He was making a mess, too. I heard paws scratching at the wood, then breaking glass.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him out yet, Glory. And don\u2019t block me. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I get it. You\u2019re talking in my mind. Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything after we go downstairs. In case the person they send can hear me. Here\u2019s the plan.\u201d His whiskers tickled and I fought the urge to scratch.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s crowded in here.\u201d Another wiggle. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019ve been searched, I\u2019ll crawl out of your bra and hide somewhere else under your T-shirt. For God\u2019s sake keep your shirt on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I get it. And once we get to the EV headquarters promise you won\u2019t do anything rash. Let me handle things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. But if you\u2019re in danger, all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the T-shirt neckline and peeked. His cute little head was hardly visible. Poor guy. Riding in my bra and not even a whisker of a chance at a sexy outcome.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Richard. Time\u2019s running out. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I picked up my purse and Valdez\u2019s leash. When I let him out of the bedroom, he raced around the room, sniffing and carrying on like he was on rat patrol. I guess my perfume was working because he didn\u2019t even pause next to me. \u201cWe\u2019d better get downstairs. Are we going to have other backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamian, Derek and some others are going to follow the car. They know to be careful and stay out of sight. I\u2019m afraid Simon must know you\u2019ll be followed, though, so there might be some kind of security along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity? Like stake wielding thugs who\u2019ll hurt my friends?\u201d I was so going to take out this damned Simon Destiny if it was the last thing I did. Gulp. Tough talk.</p><p>The hall door opened and I jumped a foot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going with you.\u201d Will was in human form and had on jeans and a University of Texas T -shirt that I knew Lacy slept in. Lacy had on a fierce look but I could tell she wasn\u2019t as into the \u201csave Flo\u201d thing as Will was.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go. Simon was very specific. If I have any chance of getting to the EV hideout, I\u2019ve got to go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mainwaring?\u201d Will sniffed. \u201cWhat did you do? Bathe in perfume? Not very smart, Glory. How\u2019re you going to use your sense of smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about my sense of anything. If you want to go with me, you \u2019ll have to shape-shift and just follow the car. At a respectful distance. I don\u2019t want the driver turning around and coming back because he sees he\u2019s being tailed.\u201d I patted my chest gently. \u201cLacy, you don\u2019t need to come. Your cat would be too easy to spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help. Diana\u2019s going. Damian called her to meet him and the rest of the rescue squad.\u201d Lacy put her hand on Will\u2019s muscular forearm, obviously more than a little interested in him. Not surprising. She had a history for falling hard and fast for goodlooking and impossibly wrong men.</p><p>\u201cBut I told Will my cat probably can\u2019t keep up with the vampires.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cDo I smell mouse?\u201d She flipped her long red hair over her shoulder and stalked around the room. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be one within a mile of this building. \u201d She sniffed again. \u201cThat damned perfume is screwing with my senses, Will\u2019s right about that. You should go wash it off.\u201d</p><p>We all turned when we heard a horn honk down below.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d I grabbed my purse and Valdez\u2019s leash. \u201cDo what you want, just don\u2019t interfere with what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory!\u201d Will put his hand on my arm. \u201cBe careful, lass. Blade\u2019s on his way. You should wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting. Simon\u2019s got Flo. And Valdez needs his power back.\u201d I frowned down at Will\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd Blade\u2019s going to have your hide for breaking his rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that anyway.\u201d I ran down the stairs, Valdez at my side.</p><p>\u201cGood work, Glory. Neither of them figured out I was there and your block must have held up pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and I\u2019ve got the headache to prove it.\u201d I pushed open the outer door and stepped out into the chilly night air. It had rained earlier and the pavement was wet and glistening under the streetlight. The driver \u2019s door to the Honda popped open and Greg Kaplan got out.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>\"Glory, sweetheart. Glad you could make it.\u201d Greg came up to me, glanced meaningfully at a couple window shopping in front of my store, then put his arms around me. I stiffened.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGot to check you for any concealed weapons.\u201d He ran his hands under my T-shirt and around my middle, then patted me down from my rump to my hips. \u201cGood girl.\u201d He stepped back and opened the backseat passenger door.</p><p>\u201cPut the dog back here and then hand me your purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValdez, hop in.\u201d The dog actually obeyed, seemingly happy to go for a ride. Greg slammed the door, took my purse, then opened the front passenger door.</p><p>\u201cGet in.\u201d He glanced at the coffee shop two doors down. A man had come out and looked at us curiously. Both of us sniffed. Mortal. Tinted glasses. Oh, hell. What a great time for one of Westwood\u2019s goons to make a move. I jerked away from Greg and checked out the man. To my relief I could read his mind through the glasses. Seems he didn\u2019t like the way Greg had almost pushed me into the car. I smiled and nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, honey.\u201d I turned to Greg. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see your surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised all right.\u201d Greg waited until I was in, then slammed the car door. I felt Richard move inside my shirt. At least my loose T -shirt kept me well covered. Greg got in the car and quickly and efficiently went through my purse. He tossed it back in my lap after keeping my cell phone and his own. He turned mine off, then stuck it in the glove compartment. He looked his over.</p><p>\u201cBattery\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t have your charger. What about my phone? Will I get it back?\u201d Not that I cared, but with Richard moving under my shirt, I had to keep Greg focused on something besides my chest.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. After this is over, if you play your cards right.\u201d He pulled a thing that looked like a flashlight out of the compartment and ran it up and over me. \u201cScanning for listening and tracking devices. Good girl, you\u2019re clean.\u201d He tossed it back inside and slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m clean. I don\u2019t want to take any chances with my friends in danger. How\u2019s Flo? What has Simon done to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as okay as she can be without her VV. Simon\u2019s got her locked up for her own safety. He could put her out of her misery with a shot of antidote, but\u201d\u2014Greg shrugged\u2014 \u201cit obviously suits him to let her suffer a while. I hear she demanded he fix the dog here. Baby, nobody demands anything of Simon Destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real tyrant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Making Flo suffer . . . A grade A son of a bitch.</p> <p>\u201cHoney, he\u2019s the boss. He can give the orders.\u201d Greg put the car in gear, then checked the rearview mirror. \u201cI\u2019d better not see anyone tail us or back we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Flo and my dog restored to the way they belong. I wouldn\u2019t let anyone screw that up.\u201d I looked back at Valdez. He was checking out the scenery. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you crack the back window so he can get some air back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That perfume\u2019s pretty hot, by the way. I don\u2019t remember you wearing perfume in New York.\u201d Greg glanced at me. \u201cOr shapeless T-shirts.\u201d He reached out and touched the cotton. \u201cDid I feel one of your Kevlar bras under there? Flo told Simon all about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m not stupid, Greg. I\u2019ve had some hunters after me. The kind with stakes, not just siphons. So I never go out without my protective gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt. Let me see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I sniffed like he reeked of sewage. \u201cYou\u2019re just a drone, Greg. Your job is to take me to Simon. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to get in trouble with your boss again and get \u2018punished.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Greg laughed. \u201cKnow how Simon punished me? He let me spend a night in his special room. Wait till you see it, Glory. You may want to just stay out there and become a drone yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial room?\u201d I felt Richard\u2019s whiskers twitch. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about it? Is it like a torture chamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d Greg reached over to pat my knee. He was on the freeway, headed south. There were a lot of isolated areas outside of town in that direction. As long as we were still surrounded by suburbs, I felt pretty safe, but as the subdivisions turned into stretches of dark undeveloped land, I got more and more uneasy.</p><p>\u201cTell me about this special room.\u201d I was afraid any contingent of vamps following us might be spotted. We were off the freeway now and on a highway that wound through hills. We bumped through a low water crossing, mud splashing as Greg drove through it.</p><p>\u201cDaylight, Glory. You\u2019d swear you were on a beach on a tropical island.\u201d Greg sighed. \u201cI would do anything for time in that room.\u201d He looked at me and winked. \u201cYou\u2019d love it. Special lights that are just like the sun, only not lethal. White sand, a pool and palm trees.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou and I could have a lot of fun on a towel on the sand.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and felt Richard warm against my skin. \u201cSun? Sand? Palm trees?\u201d I looked back at Valdez. \u201cAnd a lizard sunning himself on a rock. That\u2019s you, Greg. Get a clue. I\u2019ve moved on from my New York days. My men don\u2019t conspire to suck the life out of me.\u201d</p><p>Greg just laughed. \u201cYeah, right. Except at the old neck or thigh, huh, baby? I remember what you like.\u201d</p><p>I felt a flush heat my chest and cheeks and Richard stirred. He wasn\u2019t sending me any messages and I knew that was the deal. I had my own block up and a probe of Greg\u2019s mind yielded zilch.</p> <p>The car pulled onto a scenic overlook and Greg stopped. \u201cWe get out here.\u201d He walked around and opened both passenger doors. Valdez hopped out and rushed to the edge of the brush to take care of business. I fought tears. He never would have been that blatant about using a tree around me if he\u2019d been himself.</p><p>The overlook had a pretty view of Austin in the distance. I could see the moonlight reflecting off a lake, but no lights anywhere close to where we were. I flinched when a man stepped out of the shadows. He silently got in the Honda and drove off. I hoped my followers realized I wasn\u2019t in the car.</p><p>\u201cOur ride\u2019s here.\u201d Greg picked up Valdez\u2019s leash and led him to a black Hummer parked under a tree. He shoved the dog in the backseat and waited for me to get in, then quietly shut the door.</p><p>\u201cGee, this is really spylike, Greg. I\u2019ve never been in a Hummer before. It\u2019s huge. And black like the night. Is Simon scared I\u2019ll lead a few angry friends to his place?\u201d I\u2019d said it all out loud in case someone up above us could hear.</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2019s not scared of anything, Glory. You\u2019d do well to remember that. He\u2019s king of the EVs, Honoria\u2019s right-hand man.\u201d</p><p>Greg put the car in gear, but didn\u2019t turn on the headlights, just used his vamp night vision to steer the car down a rough road that ran through a tunnel of trees. Someone flying high overhead would have a hell of a time spotting us. I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cSounds like Simon\u2019s stuck in some earlier centuries. When monarchies were the thing. Where are we going, to some feudal castle in the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon has respect for old traditions, but he\u2019s also hip to new technology. Brent Westwood\u2019s got nothing on Simon. The king can afford to buy whatever he needs. You\u2019ll see at headquarters.\u201d Greg shifted a gear and we bumped up a rocky hill, well off the road now. \u201cI probably should have blindfolded you, but I doubt you\u2019d ever be able to retrace our path anyway. As I remember, you were too much into blending to hone your vamp skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d I felt a tickle on my chest and tried to scratch without hurting Richard or alerting Greg. It wasn \u2019t easy. \u201cBack then, I\u2019d say you were right, but I\u2019ve been surrounded by strong vampires lately. I\u2019d have to be stupid not to pick up a few tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave them, Glory. Tricks like shifting sap your power. Simon will do what you want to your furry friend back there, as long as he feels you\u2019ve got something he wants. Waste it, and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have lost your bargaining chip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Flo?\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine my roomie slobbering somewhere in the throes of drug withdrawal. A sex drug. I had visions of her lusting after the handle of her hairbrush and shuddered. Richard had crawled out of his cave and was on my shoulder under my T-shirt. Valdez stuck his head between the seats and growled.</p><p>\u201cFlo\u2019s okay. Simon can cure her with a shot of the antidote. \u201d Greg glanced at Valdez. \u201cCall off your dog or I dump him right here, in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDump my dog and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d I reached out and grabbed Greg\u2019s crotch. Yeah, right there. \u201cSqueeze this puppy until you hit high C.\u201d I tightened my grip. \u201cWant to test my vamp strength?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Glory!\u201d Greg slammed on the brakes and the car fishtailed then rocked to a stop. He looked down, his face pale. \u201cLet go. Right. Now.\u201d He pulled a gun from a pocket in the door and aimed it at Valdez\u2019s head. \u201cNow or I blow fur face here to hell.\u201d</p><p>I let go, sorry I hadn\u2019t really hurt Greg when I had the chance. Unfortunately, I needed him to find the EV stronghold.</p><p>\u201cNow kiss it and make it better.\u201d Greg kept the gun in his left hand and grabbed my hand with his right. He tried to pull me closer.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, asshole. Isn\u2019t your boss waiting?\u201d I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \u201cWe\u2019ve already wasted over an hour getting wherever we\u2019re going. Is Simon a patient man? Would he like to hear that we were late so you could get your rocks off?\u201d</p><p>Greg dropped my hand and stuck the gun back in the door. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Or I would make you kiss it.\u201d Greg gave me a warning look. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to make either of us mad. I can help you, if you\u2019ll let me. Once Simon has your power, you\u2019ll need someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather lie in the sun, waiting to die, than let you help me, Gregory. And, news flash, since New York I\u2019ve learned to help myself.\u201d</p><p>Greg glanced back at Valdez, then hit me with his best \u201cI\u2019m a rough, tough vampire\u201d look. \u201cLast warning, Glory. Don\u2019t screw around like this with Simon or anyone here, or you\u2019ll regret it. And so will Valdez and Florence. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, I\u2019d definitely heard Greg. So I was fighting terror and a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach as I followed Greg down a path, Valdez at my side. When we finally came to a clearing, I stopped and gawked. A gold dome sparkled in the light from a full moon. Yep, a genuine dome with a spire pointing toward Heaven, like on a cathedral or mosque or some other holy place.</p><p>\u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gloriana.\u201d A man strolled out of the shadows.</p><p>\u201cSimon? Or should I curtsy and call you \u2018Your majesty\u2019?\u201d I held onto the leash when Valdez started barking and lunged. Brad Pitt? I think not. I did a double take. If it hadn\u2019t been for his voice, I would have sworn . . . Obviously Simon really could make you think . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShow a little respect, Glory.\u201d Greg backed away at a look from Simon. \u201cBut not my business. Call me when you need me to drive her home, sir.\u201d Simon just stared and Greg scurried away.</p><p>\u201cSo this is the dog you\u2019re so attached to.\u201d Simon turned his attention to Valdez. The dog whimpered, tucked his tail between his legs and lay next to my feet. And wasn\u2019t that a creep-out?</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the man Florence is so attached to. Funny, but you don\u2019t look like Brad Pitt to me. More like Jeremy Blade.\u201d</p> <p>Simon smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my many gifts, Gloriana. I can sense a woman\u2019s hidden desires and become the man she wants.\u201d He stared at me for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re very busy blocking your thoughts, Glory. Hiding something?\u201d He walked closer and touched my shirt. \u201cTake this off. Kaplan might have missed something.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and tore the T-shirt off over my head and tossed it aside. I knew from the tiny movements under it, that I \u2019d flung Richard away with it. He was a vamp. He\u2019d land on his feet and figure out what to do.</p><p>\u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Simon actually licked his lips and I got a glimpse of forked tongue that made me shudder. \u201cI\u2019d enjoy a little hand-to-hand with a superheroine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand-to-hand?\u201d I felt strangely disconcerted, talking to a Jerry clone, a man I \u2019d lusted for since my Globe days. Hidden desires? I\u2019d need to mull that over later. \u201cOr did you have something a little more personal in mind?\u201d</p><p>Simon laughed and took my arm. \u201cCome now, you wouldn\u2019t think to barter your body for your dog\u2019s power, would you?\u201d He led me toward the mosque. \u201cI have much more interesting uses for you than sex.\u201d He stopped and looked me over. \u201cThough I like a woman with curves. That Kevlar definitely piques my interest.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled and I almost threw up on his brown suede loafers. Another way I knew it wasn \u2019t Jerry. Jerry didn\u2019t own a pair of Gucci loafers. Yet. I looked back at my dog lying with his head on his paws. Worth it? I hoped to hell I didn\u2019t have to find out.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Gloriana. I\u2019ve plenty of willing women if I\u2019m in the mood to indulge my . . . appetites.\u201d He focused on my chest and I wondered if he had X-ray vision. \u201cLike your friend Florence. A most interesting woman. But troublesome. She\u2019s convinced me I\u2019d be wise to pay more attention to my business and less to my own urges for a while. Come along. \u201d He pulled me toward a gold door.</p><p>\u201cWait! How troublesome? I want to be sure Flo\u2019s all right.\u201d Smiling Simon was seriously creeping me out and that gold door looked like the portal to hell or a little shop of horrors or something. No way was I going inside. I just bet that Honoria was in there, ready to gobble my power, then snack on my lifeless body for dessert.</p><p>Simon squeezed my arm and smiled. \u201cI can sense it, Glory. All your untapped power. You will be a wonderful source. Because you won\u2019t shape-shift.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Valdez who\u2019d stayed on the ground next to my shirt. Now he was sniffing it and rooting around like he\u2019d got a whiff of mouse.</p><p>Simon rubbed my arm, tightening his grip when I tried to wrench it away. \u201cI understand your fear of shifting. What if you were injured while in another form? Or\u201d\u2014he nodded toward Valdez\u2014\u201cmet with an unfortunate accident and lost your power.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019d be stuck forever as something less than human.\u201d</p> <p>I shuddered and looked away from Simon\u2019s gleaming eyes. He had a mesmerizing voice and a knack for ferreting out my deepest desires and fears. And\u2014hell\u2019s bells\u2014I felt a pull. Oh, God. I\u2019d almost leaned toward him.</p><p>\u201cI want to see Flo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I admire your loyalty.\u201d He snapped his fingers and a man emerged from one of the smaller buildings on the edge of the clearing. Flo sagged against him.</p><p>\u201cGlory?\u201d She shoved away from the man and ran to me. \u201cHoney, what are you doing here? I\u2019d hoped you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She turned on Simon. \u201cBastard! Why are you doing this? Leave my friend alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel bad, Florence? Do you want something from me, perhaps?\u201d Simon reached out the hand not gripping me. Flo whimpered, sounding way too much like Valdez had a few moments before. \u201cSimon, honey, please. I\u2019m hurting.\u201d She actually ran to his side and clutched his hand. \u201cI can make you feel good, baby.\u201d She leaned close and whispered, then rubbed herself against him.</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d He released me and snapped his fingers again. The man who\u2019d stood silently by came forward to drag Flo off of him.</p><p>\u201cSimon! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bore me, Florence.\u201d Simon smiled at me. \u201cI have someone more interesting here now. We\u2019re about to arrange a trade.\u201d</p> <p>Flo screeched. Yep, like a smoke detector during a four alarm. In her vocabulary Simon had just insulted her in the worst possible way. \u201cBore you? Why, I\u2019ll rip out your heart, bastardo. I hate you.\u201d Flo sank to the ground, sobbing and muttering in Italian. Obviously she didn\u2019t have enough strength to rip out anything.</p><p>I wanted to run to her and comfort her, but one look at Simon and I knew what I had to do.</p><p>\u201cLike I should trust you to make a fair trade.\u201d I looked around. More men had come out of the scattered outbuildings. Women too. Even Greg had made an appearance. Some were armed too. With stakes sharpened to a chilling point.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to trust me, Glory. Now that you\u2019re here, you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I concentrated. Shape-shifting. I hated it. Was terrified of it. And the last time I\u2019d tried it, I\u2019d failed miserably. But the stakes were higher this time. Every other vampire I knew did it without a second thought. I had to concentrate. Will myself to change. If ever I was going to do it, now was the time. And not some puny bird or bat. Nope. I needed to go for broke. Something enormous. That would drain my power and keep me safe from EV siphons and give me some leverage with Simon the</p><p>bastardo.</p><p>I concentrated harder. With a scream that made even me flinch, I morphed into . . . a creature I \u2019d seen on the Discovery Channel.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve done it, Gloriana. You\u2019ll never see your friend cured or your dog restored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, won\u2019t I?\u201d I flapped my wings\u2014got to love that wing span\u2014and rose in the air above Simon. Before he could move, I had him in my talons and carried him high above that shiny gold dome of his.</p><p>\u201cBad choice of homestead, Simon. That pointy thing on the top is gilded wood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me down. Help!\u201d</p><p>His army stared up at us, then a veritable bat brigade swooped in from the night sky. My shirt jumped. Richard was a man again and beside Flo, pulling her into his arms. One by one, the bats became men and women I recognized. With the advantage of surprise, they managed to disarm Simon\u2019s band.</p><p>\u201cCowards. Take them down. Don\u2019t just stand there.\u201d Simon was trying to grab my claws. \u201cDo you want to feel Honoria\u2019s wrath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Simon. Look down. If I drop you now, you\u2019ll be skewered. I don\u2019t think EV power means much if you have a stake through the heart, does it?\u201d</p><p>He stopped moving. I had him by his jacket. A nice Versace that would have sold in my shop in a heartbeat. That is if it didn \u2019t have those rips where my talons were clutching it. I felt it rip some more.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. I may drop you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty, my dear. I can help your dog friend, you know. And I doubt anyone else can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d I swooped over the clearing, then hovered over the dome again. I could see Valdez next to Flo. She\u2019d calmed down, Richard\u2019s arms around her. One by one, I identified my friends who had come to help. No sign of Frederick. But Derek was there, Bela, Will, Damian, Diana and . . . Blade, the real one, not the Blade look-alike. He stood by the gold doors and looked up at me like he wanted to throttle me or kiss me or both.</p><p>\u201cKaplan. Get your ass out here and give Valdez your power.\u201d Simon in command mode was apparently hard if not impossible to resist.</p><p>\u201cYou sure, boss? What\u2019s to keep Glory from dropping you anyway?\u201d</p><p>Simon looked up at me. He didn\u2019t look like Jerry now. More like a weasel with a receding hairline. \u201cGood question. I want some guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d I made another swoop, this time letting the top of the spike brush Simon\u2019s loafers.</p><p>\u201cI guarantee to give Florence the antidote and to release her.\u201d Simon looked down. \u201cI think her former lover may be willing to take her back.\u201d</p><p>Richard was holding Flo like he\u2019d never let her go and she seemed to be taking a lot of comfort from him. He looked up at me and sent me a mental message to be careful. Yeah, right. Now he remembered me.</p><p>\u201cAnd Valdez? I want a show of faith. Have Greg fix him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, drop him. I\u2019ll take care of the worthless bastard. \u201d Blade stared up at me, his hands fisted by his sides. I checked out the area. I couldn\u2019t believe it, Mara wasn\u2019t with him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got to get Valdez back to normal.\u201d I swooped again, but I felt tired, like this really had drained me in a new and notso-nice way. I wiggled a talon and Simon shrieked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drop me!\u201d He looked up and tried to whammy me. I could tell. I just brushed past the dome again.</p><p>\u201cFix Valdez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaplan, do it.\u201d</p><p>Greg grabbed Valdez\u2019s leash and pulled him into the domed building. I heard a humming sound. God knows what kind of device the EVs had in there. A fistfight broke out between Blade and one of Simon\u2019s followers. Maybe an EV. I didn\u2019t know or care, but I was relieved when Blade managed to knock out the other guy.</p><p>Obviously the EVs were so busy turning their power into saleable commodities, they didn \u2019t reserve a whole lot of power for themselves. Take Simon, for instance. No way could I have held a vamp like Jerry this way. No matter what form I took, he \u2019d have managed to do me one better and overpower me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door opened and Valdez pranced out.</p><p>\u201cShit, Glory. Look at you. That a pterodactyl?\u201d Got to love a dog who\u2019ll watch the Discovery Channel with you.</p><p>\u201cYes, puppy.\u201d The ground blurred and I heard Simon yelp. I\u2019d swooped a little too low and he\u2019d scraped his leg on the spire. I saw blood drip on the gold dome. I sniffed. Sarah\u2019s perfume had been swept away in my change and I could smell Simon\u2019s very rich, very potent blood. For a moment I wavered, feeling a pull deep in my gut. Feed from Simon? No way. No how.</p> <p>\u201cFinal guarantee, Simon. You let us all leave here, safe and in one piece, power intact.\u201d I swooped again, this time shredding his pants. More blood. God, the smell. This was a bad idea. My fangs were full out and I could almost taste him.</p><p>\u201cPut me down, Gloriana. I\u2019ll let you taste me. You can feed from me. It will give you a rush unlike any you\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>I jerked when something brushed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Glory.\u201d Blade was in blackbird form, flying next to me. \u201cHe\u2019s a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear a solemn oath. You capable of that, Simon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrop him, Glory. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Flo had managed to pull herself together. She stared up at me. \u201cBut he has to keep his word if he swears in Honoria\u2019s name or no one will follow him. These people will do anything for that demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan. Swear away, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUngrateful, bitch!\u201d Simon shouted down at Flo. \u201cYou were never as great as you thought you were. I\u2019ve had better sex with a were-duck.\u201d</p><p>Flo screamed and hurled herself into the air. No power though. Instead of changing as she\u2019d obviously planned, she fell to the ground at Richard\u2019s feet. He picked her up and cradled her against his chest.</p><p>That did it for me. I swooped again. \u201cI think I\u2019d do better to skewer you here and now. Honoria would probably be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t anger Honoria if I were you. And I have fellow EVs on the Council. Kill me and they \u2019ll never stop hunting you. You\u2019ll not live long enough to enjoy your mangy dog.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, asshole. I\u2019m not mangy. I could whip your skinny ass.\u201d</p><p>I grinned to hear Valdez back in top form. Blade hovered near me.</p><p>\u201cDrop him, sweetheart. We\u2019ll figure things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we can make a deal.\u201d Simon said it quietly, like he didn\u2019t want the guys down below to know he was scared.</p><p>\u201cDeal? Flo needs an antidote and we need to be able to get the hell out of here in one piece. \u201d I was so damned tired. These leathery wings were unbelievably heavy and every flap took a lot out of me. I barely scraped above the top of the dome.</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged. First, call off your people. We don\u2019t need a war now, do we?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my friends, seemingly in control of any ground war. My people. Like I was in charge? I felt a surge of energy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Simon? You afraid Honoria will gobble you up if you lose too many men? I \u2019ll get my people to back off if you\u2014\u201d Simon tried to grab one of my talons and I saw his coat rip some more. \u201cKeep squirming and this discussion won\u2019t matter. You\u2019re hanging by a shred, King.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right. Name your terms. But keep it quiet. There \u2019s no reason the peasants need to hear our agreement.\u201d His voice was barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cThis whole deal is really bad for your image, isn\u2019t it? Wonder if the \u2018peasants\u2019 know that\u2019s how you think of them.\u201d God, but I was exhausted. I felt Blade beside me, willing me to be strong. It helped and I gained altitude. \u201cSwear that you will leave me, my friends and my dog alone from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear that I will not harm you, your friends or your dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouder.\u201d I swept my beak toward the crowd gawking up at us.</p><p>\u201cHonoria won\u2019t like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew Honoria.\u201d Oh, boy. Thunder clapped, lightning sizzled nearby and the golden dome actually glowed. Most of the</p><p>\u201cpeasants\u201d fell to their knees and started praying frantically. I felt the electricity in the air and was tempted to skewer Simon and fly out of there as fast as my leathery wings could carry me.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Simon. Loud and proud. You will not harm me, my friends or my dog. Not now, not ever. And swear it on Honoria \u2019s sacred bible.\u201d More thunder. Wind whipped around me, making it hard to keep altitude. I flapped my wings, gripped Simon tighter and felt him shaking. Maybe Honoria would gobble him up for making such a poor showing here. I couldn\u2019t stress over it, I had a little thing like survival on my mind.</p><p>\u201cI swear that I will not harm you, your friends or your dog. Not now and not ever. I swear it on Honoria \u2019s sacred bible.\u201d Twin bolts of lightning shot from the dome, barely missing both of us.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019d say the lady\u2019s pissed. But it works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put me down now, you bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotty mouth.\u201d I looked at Blade. \u201cWhat do you think? Is it a done deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to drop him, then end this. Put him down, Glory, and let\u2019s get you the hell back to human form.\u201d Blade dove toward the ground.</p><p>Oh, shit. Back to human form. All my old fears rushed right past the adrenaline that had helped me change in the first place. I dropped toward the ground, so hard and fast that Simon actually bounced when we landed.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d He gestured and two of his men ran to help him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cConcentrate, Glory. You can do it. Change back.\u201d Blade, Flo, Richard, all my friends crowded around me. Or as close to me as they could get with my twenty-foot wing span. Some faced out, like they were guarding me. Sweet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d My wings lay on the ground and I felt mud beneath my cheek. A pterodactyl. If I got stuck with a beak that made Cyrano de Bergerac look snub-nosed, I\u2019d . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Gloriana St. Clair, a blood-sucking vampire. Let me see you, Blondie.\u201d Valdez licked my cheek. My cheek. My human cheek. \u201cI did it!\u201d I laughed, sat up and looked down. Yep, I was back to my old, slightly chubby self, complete with muddy running shoes instead of some really wicked talons. Wonder Freakin\u2019 Woman. Simon Destiny had disappeared inside his domed building. I heard the sound that probably meant he was being powered up. His word or not, I wasn\u2019t waiting around to find out.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I grabbed my T-shirt, but Blade took it and gently wiped mud off my cheek before he handed it to me again.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you look in the Kevlar, Gloriana. Today you proved you really are amazing.\u201d</p><p>I soaked in the praise, then looked around. \u201cThanks, love, but would someone drive us the hell out of here?\u201d I was all for the juicy reunion thing, but not while surrounded by EVs giving me the hairy eyeball. I hopped in the Hummer, Valdez right behind me. He leaped into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI can drive us, Glory.\u201d Richard helped Flo into the back. \u201cI saw the way we came in, I can get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! What about Flo\u2019s antidote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d Flo leaned against Valdez. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Simon to give me the right thing anyway. Let\u2019s go. I can beat this by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in, Jerry.\u201d I hopped out again. \u201cFlo can ride up here. We can sit in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to make sure you\u2019re well away from here before Simon comes out. I\u2019ll meet you back at your place, Glory.\u201d Blade leaned into the car and gave me a soul searching, heart melting kiss.</p><p>God, but I\u2019d missed him. I grabbed his hair and kissed him back, letting him read that. Then I glanced around the clearing.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll go ahead and leave here. Don\u2019t try to do anything stupid, like take on these EVs and their drones.\u201d</p><p>Blade frowned. \u201cThey need to pay, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously outnumbered. Even if their power levels are low, they\u2019re bound to launch a counterattack as soon as they get over their shock at being invaded. Get our friends to safety.\u201d Yep, I\u2019d read him right. It wasn\u2019t like Jerry just to let a woman save the day. And I had, hadn\u2019t I? I looked at him for a long moment, until he nodded and gestured toward the rest of the troops.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. Now get out of here.\u201d He slammed the car door. Richard put the car in gear and we lurched forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory. This is all my fault.\u201d Even Flo\u2019s voice was weak.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, Florence. Simon came to Austin to be with his son. You didn \u2019t see Frederick there just now, did you, Glory?\u201d</p><p>Richard kept his eyes on the rough track, expertly driving the Hummer through mud and over rocks. I was glad he knew how to get home, because I was totally lost.</p><p>\u201cNo, Freddy wasn\u2019t there. But I can\u2019t say I blame him. His father is a powerful man. He\u2019d probably be reluctant to declare open war on him. And we did okay without him. We had plenty of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure as shit glad to be back. What the hell happened to me? One minute I\u2019m outside the church, eyes peeled for trouble and then zilch.\u201d Valdez sighed and laid his head on Flo\u2019s lap. \u201cI woke up with that machine stuck on me. Like a freakin\u2019 shop vac, only more like a leaf blower. Whomp! I\u2019m me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, puppy.\u201d Flo rubbed his ears and looked at me. \u201cWill you ever forgive me, Glory? You had to change! I know you hated that.\u201d Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. \u201cI got us all into this because of my involvement with Simon. I think . . . \u201d She stared at the back of Richard\u2019s head. \u201cI think he did a, what you call, whammy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. You acted totally out of character.\u201d I reached back and squeezed Flo\u2019s hand. \u201cI felt it, the pull. And then there\u2019s the whole Brad Pitt thing. I know he\u2019s your dream guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Simon\u2019s very handsome.\u201d Flo pulled her hand away. \u201cAnd sometimes generous.\u201d She showed me a nice size emerald ring on her left hand. \u201cI have a souvenir at least.\u201d She held out her hand, which was shaking, by the way, and admired the beautiful green stone. \u201cI guess I should have thrown it in his face as a \u2018screw you\u2019 gesture. But he picked out my fantasy ring. Hard to give up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Throw it in his face? Yeah, right. Ever read \u201cThe Girl\u2019s Guide to Immortality\u201d? A book I really should write someday. Rule number one: Never return gifts, especially expensive jewelry. A woman who may have to support herself forever needs all the help she can get. Okay, so I\u2019d turned down that Mercedes Blade kept dangling in front of me. For purely practical reasons. Do you know what the insurance and upkeep would have cost me?</p><p>I smiled at Flo. \u201cYou should definitely keep it. Or sell it and keep the money if looking at it creeps you out.\u201d</p><p>Flo slipped it off her finger and put it in my hand. \u201cSell it. I don\u2019t want anything to remind me of that gut-sucking bastard. And I\u2019ll use the money to buy something completely different.\u201d</p> <p>I jammed the ring into my pocket. \u201cHow are you feeling, Flo? Still in VV withdrawal?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m really, really weak, like I want to just lie down and die. And yet when I lie down, I crave \u2014\u201d She looked at Richard again. \u201cI hope this gets out of my system soon. I can\u2019t stand feeling so out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help you, Florence. Won\u2019t we, Glory?\u201d Richard turned the car onto a paved road. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home in about an hour, with a few minutes to spare before sunrise. Lie back and close your eyes. Rest. You too, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I was glad to close my eyes. Shape-shifting had really taken it out of me. Like I was drained, energy wise. Well, that was a good thing. Vow or not, it was okay to be too powerless for Simon to want me. I heard a soft snore. Valdez? I grinned. No, it was Flo. And wouldn\u2019t she be mortified to know that? I closed my eyes and dreamed of Blade waiting for me at home. It had been a hell of a day.</p><p>Twenty-four</p> <p>\"I think Kelly must have had an EV lover.\u201d Flo lay on the couch, a soft throw over her.</p><p>\u201cKelly?\u201d Blade looked at me.</p><p>I nodded toward the stereo. \u201cKelly Clarkson, American Idol Season One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to this CD. The lyrics. \u2018You\u2019re like a drug . . .\u2019 Not to mention \u2018Beautiful Disaster.\u2019 Simon. She must know Simon.\u201d Flo picked up a bottle of Fangtastic, frowned, then put it back on the coffee table without tasting it. \u201cWhere\u2019s Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s googling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Flo sat up.</p> <p>\u201cHe bought a new laptop, Flo. He took it home to do research on that building where the EVs are headquartered.\u201d I picked up a map. \u201cHe\u2019s found out a lot so far. It used to be a compound. A maharishi something or other built it. His group pulled out of Texas after the disaster at Waco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah! This is a disaster. Ricardo should be here. Comforting me.\u201d Flo laid a dramatic hand on her forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about Simon or the EVs. Maybe they will go back to Brazil where they belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgentina.\u201d Blade grinned. \u201cYou want a cold cloth for your forehead, Florence?\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him. I knew good and well who\u2019d have to soak the wash cloth in ice water. Again.</p><p>\u201cFlo, honey, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you got off the couch? It\u2019s been three days. Time to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days?\u201d Flo sighed. \u201cIt seems like three centuries. How did I ever let myself get so caught up\u2014\u201d She shuddered. \u201cThank God the withdrawal is over.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re all glad it\u2019s over. We hated seeing you suffer that way.\u201d</p><p>Valdez bumped Flo\u2019s arm with his nose. \u201cYou tore up your room pretty bad. I think I saw one of your fancy silver sandals under the bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy God!\u201d Flo sat up. \u201cI really was out of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen. I\u2019ve got to go down to the shop tonight. The art student\u2019s coming back to study the mural for his dissertation. He would love to meet the artist.\u201d I was perched on the arm of Jerry\u2019s chair, leaning against him. His hand landed on my thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing mural. He really admires your technique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d Flo touched her hair, then sniffed and wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt will take me at least an hour to pull myself together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Flo tossed the throw on the floor and hurried toward her bedroom, muttering something about her shoe collection.</p><p>I picked up the remote and turned off the stereo.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Flo\u2019s played that same CD over and over again ever since we got back.\u201d Valdez jumped up on the couch and settled into her place.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Will, Gloriana?\u201d Blade grabbed the bottle of Fangtastic, sniffed it, then took a swallow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he hasn\u2019t worked out better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s across the hall. He and Lacy are whipping up a Thanksgiving dinner. Can\u2019t you smell it?\u201d Not working out? He\u2019d made it to the EV showdown, but that was about all I could say he\u2019d done right. Will was a persistent source of irritation with his shapeshifting and cooking. Producing delicious smells for foods that I couldn \u2019t taste. I\u2019d even tried the virtual eating with him. No luck yet. He\u2019d taste, I\u2019d probe his brain and yet I couldn\u2019t quite pull it off.</p><p>\u201cToday was Thanksgiving. I guess the holiday doesn\u2019t mean much to me.\u201d Blade rubbed my arm. I threw up a block and remembered a certain Thanksgiving Day parade . . . Wrong man, wrong time. I hadn\u2019t even bothered to tape the parade this year, like I\u2019d done every year for decades so I could watch it when I woke up. Now that I knew why I\u2019d been so hooked on it, I was over it. No withdrawal necessary.</p><p>\u201cWhat it means to me is a big shopping day. The day after Thanksgiving. That\u2019s why I\u2019m opening at midnight. The holiday\u2019s late this year, close to Christmas. We\u2019re going to have a big after-Thanksgiving sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve become quite a businesswoman, Gloriana.\u201d Blade pulled me down to his lap and sent Valdez a mental message because he jumped off the couch and disappeared into my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cAny word from Mara? Is she any closer to taking out Westwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I\u2019ve told her she\u2019d be wise to give up for now. It \u2019s become an obsession with her. I\u2019m afraid it will make her careless.\u201d Blade ran his hand up under my short plaid skirt and rubbed my knee through my tights.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going after her, are you?\u201d I wished we had more time and I had on fewer clothes. I could feel Blade\u2019s need for me against my hip. Our juicy reunion had been postponed because of Flo\u2019s illness, some intense meetings with Frederick and CiCi and Blade\u2019s own business interests, which had needed some attention after his long absence.</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019ll probably visit her family in Scotland when she gets tired of stalking Westwood. Which should be soon. The man \u2019s impossible to get to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny word on Simon and the EVs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made a powerful enemy there, Gloriana. I\u2019m worried about you. You humiliated him and Simon\u2019s obviously a proud man.\u201d Jerry\u2019s hand wandered even higher. \u201cFrederick and Richard believe Simon will keep his word for now. Seems swearing on Honoria\u2019s bible means more than you\u2019d think. He breaks that vow and the EVs will be looking for a new leader.\u201d Jerry frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut he left a loophole, the way he worded it. It didn\u2019t hit me until after we had cleared out of there. He said \u2018I\u2019 not \u2018We\u2019 when he was swearing, like maybe he could send a hit squad out after you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we ever just get to live peacefully? No threats, no problems?\u201d I deliberately put my fear on the back burner. Loophole. Of course. Simon hadn\u2019t risen to king by being stupid. But I was not about to let EV worries ruin my reunion with Jerry. I ran my hand over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWe can dream.\u201d He held me close and I felt the slow thud of his heart under my hand.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of dreams, Will is upset. Seems he and Lacy didn \u2019t win the lottery last night. Did you really saddle me with an addicted gambler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good fighter. And in a way, I was desperate. Hard to find a man who\u2019ll play dog these days. And Rafael only has a few more months on his contract. I was hoping Will would work out. He has some serious debt and needs the money.\u201d</p><p>My stomach churned. I was going to lose my latest Valdez? Do you have any idea how hard it is to break in a new bodyguard?</p><p>Not to mention that I\u2019d grown really, really fond of my current furry friend.</p><p>\u201cWell, my next Valdez will not be William Kilpatrick. For one thing, he won\u2019t stay in dog form.\u201d</p><p>Jerry frowned. \u201cYes, I noticed that. And have docked his pay accordingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I also don\u2019t fancy having Mara\u2019s brother underfoot. He\u2019s a wild card. Unpredictable. I need a Valdez I can bond with. I don\u2019t see that happening with a man I\u2019ve seen . . . as a man. Valdez, I mean Rafael . . .\u201d I still had trouble with that name, but it did seem to fit. \u201cRafael\u2019s just a dog with attitude to me because I\u2019ve never seen him in any other form. I can deal with that.\u201d I looked up at Blade. \u201cOf course now that I\u2019ve demonstrated my own awesome powers, maybe you\u2019ll accept that I can take care of myself. No bodyguard necessary.\u201d</p><p>Jerry shifted me until I sat facing him. \u201cThis body should always be guarded carefully.\u201d He ran his hands up my hips and around my waist.</p><p>\u201cWhen I think I could have been stuck as a pterodactyl . . .\u201d I shuddered. \u201cThose things are damned ugly. Good defense or not, shape-shifting is still not anything I want to do on a regular basis. Not unless there\u2019s a dire need for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you made an awesome winged dinosaur. Everyone who was there has talked of nothing but your magnificence when you dangled Simon over the dome. I know I\u2019ll never forget the sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid Simon will never forget it either, you\u2019re right about that.\u201d I pushed myself off Jerry\u2019s lap and held out my hand.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s something to worry about another night.\u201d I glanced at the clock. \u201cValdez, get your furry butt out here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou called?\u201d Valdez came out with an empty Twinkie wrapper stuck to his paw. He\u2019d been heavily into the junk food since his return to normal. And I sure wasn\u2019t denying him anything.</p><p>\u201cGo across the hall and stay with Will and Lacy until time to go downstairs. Tell Will to give you some turkey and dressing. I \u2019ll get you both on my way down.\u201d I threw open the door and knocked on the one across the hall. I didn\u2019t wait for an answer, just slammed my apartment door and locked it. I\u2019d heard the shower go on and knew Flo would be in there at least twenty minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Gloriana?\u201d Blade grinned, because he always could read me.</p> <p>\u201cA juicy reunion. I think we both deserve one. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes was a good start, but not nearly enough time. I was grinning though, when I threw on my clothes again, Jerry a well satisfied and interested observer. I had less than five minutes to get downstairs.</p><p>\u201cUm, Jerry. When you looked at Simon, who did you see?\u201d Okay, a shot in the dark. Maybe Simon had to consciously make a person see him that way. But if Jerry said, \u201cI saw you, Gloriana.\u201d Well, wouldn\u2019t that be cool?</p><p>\u201cI saw an ordinary man, Glory. No one special.\u201d He sat up and pulled me to him. \u201cWhy? Did he have a power I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget him and his powers.\u201d I kissed Jerry and turned to go.</p> <p>\u201cWait. I have a present for you.\u201d Jerry rolled out of bed and picked up his pants. \u201cI know you lost your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that damned Greg Kaplan took it.\u201d I grinned when I saw what Jerry held in his hand. \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new phone. The latest technology including . . .\u201d He pulled me close again. \u201cA camera. It even takes videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I sighed and leaned against him. \u201cHmm. You got one too?</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d He rubbed my back.</p><p>\u201cCall me later?\u201d I grinned, my mind whirling with endless possibilities.</p> <p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d Jerry kissed me and pushed me toward the door.</p><p>I stopped in the doorway and gave him my best sultry look. \u201cCall me, Jerry. And don\u2019t be surprised if a pterodactyl answers.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
