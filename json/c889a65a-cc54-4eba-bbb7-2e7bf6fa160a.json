Approximately.</p><p>All my life I\u2019ve been told about how my father wrote it the day I was born. He was on the road somewhere in Texas, already split from my mom. The story goes that he got word of my birth, sat down with his guitar, and just came up with it, right there in a room at a Motel 6. An hour of his time, just a few chords, two verses and a chorus. He\u2019d been writing music all his life, but in the end it would be the only song he was known for. Even in death, my father was a one-hit wonder. Or two, I guess, if you count me.</p> <p>Now, the song was playing overhead as I sat in a plastic chair at the car dealership, in the first week of June. It was warm, everything was blooming, and summer was practically here. Which meant, of course, that it was time for my mother to get married again.</p><p>This was her fourth time, fifth if you include my father. I chose not to. But they were, in her eyes, married-if being united in the middle of the desert by someone they\u2019d met at a rest stop only moments before counts as married. It does to my mother. But then, she takes on husbands the way other people change their hair color: out of boredom, listlessness, or just feeling that this next one will fix everything, once and for all. Back when I was younger, when I asked about my dad and how they\u2019d met, when I was actually still curious, she\u2019d just sigh, waving her hand, and say, \u201cOh, Remy, it was the seventies. You know.\u201d</p><p>My mother always thinks I know everything. But she\u2019s wrong. All I knew about the seventies was what I\u2019d learned in school and from the History Channel: Vietnam, President Carter, disco. And all I knew about my father, really, was \u201cThis Lullaby.\u201d Through my life I\u2019d heard it in the backgrounds of commercials and movies, at weddings, dedicated long-distance on radio countdowns. My father may be gone, but the song-schmaltzy, stupid, insipid-goes on. Eventually it will even outlive me.</p><p>It was in the middle of the second chorus that Don Davis of Don Davis Motors stuck his head out of his office and saw me. \u201cRemy, honey, sorry you had to wait. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>I got up and followed him. In eight days, Don would become my stepfather, joining a not-so-exclusive group. He was the first car salesman, the second Gemini, the only one with money of his own. He and my mother met right there in his office, when we came in to buy her a new Camry. I\u2019d come along because I know my mother: she\u2019d pay the list price right off the bat, assuming it was set, like she was buying oranges or toilet paper at the grocery store, and of course they\u2019d let her, because my mother is somewhat well known and everyone thinks she is rich.</p> <p>Our first salesman looked right out of college and almost collapsed when my mother waltzed up to a fully loaded new-year model, then poked her head inside to get a whiff of that new-car smell. She took a deep gulp, smiled, and announced, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d with characteristic flourish.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said, trying not to grit my teeth. But she knew better. The entire ride over I\u2019d been prepping her, with specific instructions on what to say, how to act, everything we needed to do to get a good deal. She kept telling me she was listening, even as she kept fiddling with the air-conditioning vents and playing with my automatic windows. I swear that was what had really led to this new-car fever: the fact that I had just gotten one.</p><p>So after she\u2019d blown it, it was up to me to take over. I started asking the salesman direct questions, which made him nervous. He kept glancing past me, at her, as if I was some kind of trained attack dog she could easily put into a sit. I\u2019m used to this. But just as he really started to squirm we were interrupted by Don Davis himself, who made quick work of sweeping us into his office and falling hard for my mother in a matter of about fifteen minutes. They sat there making googly eyes at each other while I haggled him down three thousand bucks and got him to throw in a maintenance plan, a sealant coat, and a changer for the CD player. It had to be the best bargain in Toyota history, not that anyone noticed. It is just expected that I will handle it, whatever it is, because I am my mother\u2019s business manager, therapist, handyman, and now, wedding coordinator. Lucky, lucky, me.</p><p>\u201cSo, Remy,\u201d Don said as we sat down, him in the big swiveling leather throne behind the desk, me in the just-uncomfortable-enough-to-hurry-the-sale chair opposite. Everything at the dealership was manufactured to brainwash customers. Like memos to salesmen encouraging great deals just casually \u201cstrewn\u201d where you could read them, and the way the offices were set up so you could easily \u201coverhear\u201d your salesman pleading for a good deal with his manager. Plus the fact that the window I was now facing opened up to the part of the lot where people picked up their brand-new cars. Every few minutes, one of the salesmen would walk someone right to the center of the window, hand them their shiny new keys, and then smile benevolently as they drove off into the sunset, just like in the commercials. What a bunch of shit.</p><p>Now, Don shifted in his seat, adjusting his tie. He was a portly guy, with an ample stomach and a bit of a bald spot: the word doughy came to mind. But he adored my mother, God help him. \u201cWhat do you need from me today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, reaching into my back pocket for the list I\u2019d brought. \u201cI double-checked with the tux place and they\u2019re expecting you this week for the final fitting. The rehearsal dinner list is pretty much set at seventy-five, and the caterer will need a check for the rest of the deposit by Monday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d He opened a drawer and pulled out the leather binder where he kept his checkbook, then reached into his jacket pocket for a pen. \u201cHow much for the caterer?\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at my paper, swallowed, and said, \u201cFive thousand.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and started writing. To Don, five thousand bucks was hardly any money at all. This wedding itself was setting him back a good twenty, and that didn\u2019t seem to faze him either. Add to it the renovation that had been done on our house so we could all live together like one happy family, the debt Don was forgiving on my brother\u2019s truck, and just the day-to-day maintenance of living with my mother, and he was making quite an investment. But then again, this was his first wedding, first marriage. He was a rookie. My family, however, had long been of pro status.</p><p>He ripped out the check, slid it across the desk, and smiled. \u201cWhat else?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>I consulted my list again. \u201cOkay, just the band, I think. The people at the reception hall were asking-\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s under control,\u201d he said, waving his hand. \u201cThey\u2019ll be there. Tell your mother not to worry.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at this, because he expected me to, but we both knew she wasn\u2019t worrying at all about this wedding. She\u2019d picked out her dress, decided on flowers, and then pushed the rest off on me, claiming she needed absolutely every free second to work on her latest book. But the truth was, my mother hated details. She loved to plunge into projects, tackle them for about ten minutes, and then lose interest. All around our house were little piles of things that had once held her attention: aromatherapy kits, family tree software, stacks of Japanese cookbooks, an aquarium with four sides covered in algae and one sole survivor, a fat white fish who had eaten all the others.</p><p>Most people put off my mother\u2019s erratic behavior to the fact that she was a writer, as if that explained everything. To me that was just an excuse. I mean, brain surgeons can be crazy too, but no one says it\u2019s all right. Fortunately for my mother, I am alone in this opinion.</p><p>\u201c... is so soon!\u201d Don said, tapping his finger on the calendar. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, wondering what the first part of his sentence had been. I added, \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, then glanced back down at the calendar, where I now saw the wedding day, June 10, was circled several times in different colors of pen. I guess you couldn\u2019t blame him for being excited. Before he met my mother, Don was at the age where most of his friends had given up on him ever getting married. For the last fifteen years he\u2019d lived alone in a condo right off the highway, spending most of his waking hours selling more Toyotas than anyone else in the state. Now, in nine days, he would get not only Barbara Starr, romance novelist extraordi naire, but also, in a package deal, my brother Chris and me. And he was happy about it. It was amazing.</p><p>Just then the intercom on his desk buzzed, loudly, and a woman\u2019s voice came on. \u201cDon, Jason has an eight fifty-seven on deck, needs your input. Should I send them in?\u201d</p><p>Don glanced at me, then pushed down the button and said, \u201cSure. Give me five seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight fifty-seven?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cJust dealership lingo,\u201d he said easily, standing up. He smoothed down his hair, covering the small bald spot I only noticed when he was seated. Behind him, on the other side of the window, a ruddy-faced salesman was handing a woman with a toddler the keys to her new car: she took them as the kid tugged on her skirt, trying to get her attention. She didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cHate to push you out, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d I told him, tucking the list back in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate all you\u2019re doing for us, Remy,\u201d he said as he came around the desk. He put one hand on my shoulder, Dad-style, and I tried not to remember all the stepfathers before him that had done the same thing, that same weight, carrying the same meaning. They all thought they were permanent too.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I said as he moved his hand and opened the door for me. Waiting for us out in the hallway was a salesman, standing with what had to be that eight fifty-seven-code for an on-the-fence customer, I assumed-a short woman who was clutching her handbag and wearing a sweatshirt with an ap pliqu\u00e9d kitten on it.</p><p>\u201cDon,\u201d the salesman said smoothly, \u201cthis is Ruth, and we\u2019re trying our hardest to get her into a new Corolla today.\u201d</p><p>Ruth looked nervously from Don to me, then back to Don. \u201cI just-\u201d she sputtered.</p> <p>\u201cRuth, Ruth,\u201d Don said soothingly. \u201cLet\u2019s just all sit down for a minute and talk about what we can do for you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the salesman echoed, gently prodding her forward. \u201cWe\u2019ll just talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ruth said, somewhat uncertainly, and started into Don\u2019s office. As she passed she glanced at me, as if I were part of this, and it was all I could do not to tell her to run, fast, and not look back.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Don said, quietly, as if he\u2019d noticed this, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I told them, then watched as Ruth made her way inside. The salesman steered her to the uncomfortable chair, facing the window. Now, an Asian couple was climbing into their new truck. Both of them were smiling as they adjusted the seats, admired the interior: the woman flipped down the visor, checking her reflection in the mirror there. They were both breathing deep, taking in that new-car smell, as the husband stuck the key in the ignition. Then they drove off, waving to their salesman as they went. Cue that sunset.</p><p>\u201cNow Ruth,\u201d Don said, settling into his chair. The door was closing on them, and I could barely see his face now. \u201cWhat can I do to make you happy?\u201d</p><p>I was halfway across the showroom when I remembered that my mother had asked me to please, please remind Don about cocktails tonight. Her new editor was in town for the evening, ostensibly just passing through from Atlanta and wanting to stop in and be social. Her true motivation, however, was that my mother owed her publisher a novel, and everyone was starting to get a little antsy about it.</p><p>I turned around and walked back down the hallway to Don\u2019s office. The door was still closed, and I could hear voices murmuring behind it.</p> <p>The clock on the opposite wall was the school kind, with big black numbers and a wobbly second hand. It was already one-fifteen. The day after my high school graduation and here I was, not beach bound or sleeping off a hangover like everyone else. I was running wedding errands, like a paid employee, while my mother lay in her king-size Sealy Posturepedic, with the shades drawn tight, getting the sleep she claimed was crucial to her creative process.</p><p>And that was all it took to feel it. That slow, simmering burn in my stomach that I always felt when I let myself see how far the scale had tipped in her favor. It was either resentment or what was left of my ulcer, or maybe both. The Muzak overhead was growing louder, as if someone was fiddling with the volume, so that now I was getting blasted with a rendition of some Barbra Streisand song. I crossed one leg over the other and closed my eyes, pressing my fingers into the arms of my chair. Just a few weeks of this, I told myself, and I\u2019m gone.</p><p>Just then, someone plopped down hard into the chair on my left, knocking me sideways into the wall; it was jarring, and I hit my elbow on the molding there, right in the funny bone, which sent a tingly zap all the way up to my fingers. And suddenly, just like that, I was pissed. Really pissed. It\u2019s amazing how all it takes is one shove to make you furious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell, \u201d I said, pushing off the wall, ready to take off the head of whatever stupid salesperson had decided to get cozy with me. My elbow was still buzzing, and I could feel a hot flush creeping up my neck: bad signs. I knew my temper.</p><p>I turned my head and saw it wasn\u2019t a salesman at all. It was a guy with black curly hair, around my age, wearing a bright orange T-shirt. And for some reason he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d I snapped, rubbing my elbow.</p> <p>\u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just slammed me into the wall, asshole.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cGoodness,\u201d he said finally. \u201cSuch language. \u201d</p><p>I just looked at him. Wrong day, buddy, I thought. You caught me on the wrong day.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d he said, as if we\u2019d been discussing the weather or world politics, \u201cI saw you out in the showroom. I was over by the tire display?\u201d</p> <p>I was sure I was glaring at him. But he kept talking.</p><p>\u201cI just thought to myself, all of a sudden, that we had something in common. A natural chemistry, if you will. And I had a feeling that something big was going to happen. To both of us. That we were, in fact, meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got all this,\u201d I said, clarifying, \u201cat the tire display?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I did, however, feel you slamming me into the wall,\u201d I said evenly.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, lowering his voice and leaning closer to me, \u201cwas an accident. An oversight. Just an unfortunate result of the enthusiasm I felt knowing I was about to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>I just looked at him. Overhead, the Muzak was now playing a spirited version of the Don Davis Motors theme song, all plinking and plunking.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He smiled again, running a hand through his hair. The Muzak was now building to a crescendo over us, the speaker popping, as if close to short-circuiting. We both glanced up, then at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he said, pointing up at the speaker, which popped again, louder this time, then hissed before resuming the theme song at full blast. \u201cFrom now on, forever\u201d-he pointed up again, jabbing with his finger-\u201c this will be our song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d I said, and right then I was saved, hallelujah, as Don\u2019s office door swung open and Ruth, led by her salesman, came out. She was holding a sheaf of papers and wore that stunned, recently-depleted-of-thousands look on her tired face. But she did have the complimentary fake-gold-plated key chain, all hers.</p><p>I stood up, and the guy beside me leapt to his feet. \u201cWait, I only want-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon?\u201d I called out, ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cJust take this,\u201d the guy said, grabbing my hand. He turned it palm up before I could even react, and pulled a pen out of his back pocket, then proceeded-I am not joking-to write a name and phone number in the space between my thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>\u201cYou are insane,\u201d I said, jerking my hand back, which caused the last digits to get smeared and knocked the pen out of his hand. It clattered to the floor, rolling under a nearby gumball machine.</p><p>\u201cYo, Romeo!\u201d someone yelled from the showroom, and there was a burst of laughter. \u201cCome on man, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, still incredulous. Talk about not respecting a person\u2019s boundaries. I\u2019d dumped drinks on guys for even brushing against me at a club, much less yanking my hand and actually writing on it.</p><p>He glanced behind him, then back at me. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d he said, and grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d I replied, but then he was already going, dodging the truck and minivan in the showroom and out the front glass door, where a beat-up white van was idling by the curb. The back door flung open and he moved to climb in, but then the van jerked forward, making him stumble, before stopping again. He sighed, put his hands on his hips, and looked up at the sky, then grabbed the door handle again and started to pull himself up just as it moved again, this time accompanied by someone beeping the horn. This sequence repeated itself all the way across the parking lot, the salesmen in the showroom chuckling, before someone stuck a hand out the back door, offering him a hand, which he ignored. The fingers on the hand waggled, a little at first, then wildly, and finally he reached up and grabbed hold, hoisting himself in. Then the door slammed, the horn beeped again, and the van chugged out of the lot, bumping its muffler on the way out.</p><p>I looked down at my hand, where in black ink was scrawled 933-54somethingsomething, with one word beneath it. God, his handwriting was sloppy. A big D, a smear on the last letter. And what a stupid name. Dexter.</p><p>When I got home, the first thing I noticed was the music. Classical, soaring, filling the house with wailing oboes and flowing violins. Then, the smell of candles, vanilla, just tangy sweet enough to make you wince. And finally, the dead giveaway, a trail of crumpled papers strewn like bread crumbs from the foyer, through the kitchen, and leading to the sunporch.</p><p>Thank God, I thought. She\u2019s writing again.</p><p>I dropped my keys on the table by the door and bent down, picking up one balled-up piece of paper by my feet, then un-crumpled it as I walked toward the kitchen. My mother was very superstitious about her work, and only wrote on the beat-up old typewriter she\u2019d once dragged around the country when she did freelance music articles for a newspaper in San Francisco. It was loud, had a clanging bell that sounded whenever she reached the end of a line, and looked like some remnant from the days of the Pony Express. She had a brand-new top-of-the-line computer too, but she only used that to play solitaire.</p><p>The page in my hand had a 1 in the upper right-hand corner, and started with my mother\u2019s typical gusto.</p><p>Melanie had always been the type of woman who loved a challenge. In her career, her loves, her spirit, she lived to find herself up against something that fought her back, tested her resolve, made the winning worthwhile. As she walked into the Plaza Hotel on a cold November day, she pulled the scarf from her hair and shook off the rain. Meeting Brock Dobbin hadn\u2019t been in her plans. She hadn\u2019t seen him since Prague, when they\u2019d left things as bad as they\u2019d started them. But now, a year later, with her wedding so close, he was back in the city. And she was here to meet him. This time, she would win. She was</p><p>She was... what? There was only a smear of ink after the last word, trailing all the way down the page, from where it had been ripped from the machine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I continued picking up discarded papers as I walked, balling them into my hand. They didn\u2019t vary much. In one, the setting was in L.A., not New York, and in another Brock Dobbin became Dock Brobbin, only to be switched back again. Small details, but it always took a little while for my mother to hit her stride. Once she did, though, watch out. She\u2019d finished her last book in three and a half weeks, and it was big enough to function effectively as a doorstop.</p><p>The music, and the clanging of the typewriter, both got louder as I walked into the kitchen, where my brother, Chris, was ironing a shirt on the kitchen table, the salt and pepper shakers and napkin holder all pushed to one side.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, brushing his hair out of his face. The iron hissed as he picked it up, then smoothed it over the edge of the collar of the shirt, pressing down hard.</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s she been at it?\u201d I asked, pulling the trash can out from under the sink and dumping the papers into it.</p> <p>He shrugged, letting some steam hiss out and stretching his fingers. \u201cA couple of hours now, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I glanced past him, through the dining room to the sunporch, where I could see my mother hunched over the typewriter, a candle beside her, pounding away. It was always weird to watch her. She really slammed the keys, throwing her whole body into it, as if she couldn\u2019t get the words out fast enough. She\u2019d keep it up for hours at a time, finally emerging with her fingers cramped, back aching, and a good fifty pages, which would probably be enough to keep her editor in New York satisfied for the time being.</p><p>I sat down at the table and flipped through a stack of mail by the fruit bowl as Chris turned the shirt over, nudging the iron slowly around one cuff. He was a really slow ironer, to the point that more than once I\u2019d just jerked it away, unable to stand how long it took him to do just the collar. The only thing I can\u2019t stand more than seeing something done wrong is seeing it done slowly.</p><p>\u201cBig night tonight?\u201d I asked him. He was leaning close to the shirt now, really focusing on the front pocket.</p><p>\u201cJennifer Anne\u2019s having a dinner party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s smart casual.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmart casual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means,\u201d he said slowly, still concentrating, \u201cno jeans, but not quite a sport jacket event either. Ties optional. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Six months ago, my brother wouldn\u2019t have been able to define smart much less casual. Ten months earlier, on his twenty-first birthday, Chris had gotten busted at a party selling pot. It wasn\u2019t his first brush with the law, by any means: during high school he\u2019d racked up a few breaking and enterings (plea-bargained), one DWI (dismissed), and one possession of a controlled substance (community service and a big fine, but just by the skin of his teeth). But the party bust did him in, and he did jail time. Only three months, but it scared him enough to shape up and get a job at the local Jiffy Lube, where he\u2019d met Jennifer Anne when she\u2019d brought her Saturn in for a thirty-thousand-mile checkup.</p><p>Jennifer Anne was what my mother called \u201ca piece of work,\u201d which meant she wasn\u2019t scared of either of us and didn\u2019t care if we knew it. She was a small girl with big blond hair, whip smart-though we hated to admit it-and had done more with my brother in six months than we\u2019d ever managed in twenty-one years. She had him dressing better, working harder, and using proper grammar, including wacky new terms like \u201cnetworking\u201d and \u201cmultitasking\u201d and \u201csmart casual.\u201d She worked as a receptionist for a conglomerate of doctors, but referred to herself as an \u201coffice specialist.\u201d Jennifer Anne could make anything sound better than it was. I\u2019d recently overheard her describing Chris\u2019s job as a \u201cmultilevel automotive lubrication expert,\u201d which made working at Jiffy Lube sound on a par with heading up NASA.</p><p>Now Chris lifted the shirt off the table and held it up, shaking it slightly as the typewriter bell clanged again from the other room. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks okay,\u201d I said. \u201cYou missed a big crease on the right sleeve, though.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced down at it, then sighed. \u201cThis is so freaking hard,\u201d he said, putting it back on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t see why people bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you bother,\u201d I said. \u201cSince when do you need to be wrinkle free, anyway? You used to consider wearing pants dressing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d he said, making a face at me. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Excuse me, Eggbert, I keep forgetting you\u2019re the smart one.\u201d</p><p>He straightened the shirt, not looking at me. \u201cWhat I mean,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cis that you\u2019d just have to know what it\u2019s like to want to do something nice for somebody else. Out of consideration. Out of love. \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He picked up the shirt again. The wrinkle was still there, not that I was going to point it out now. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Compassion. Relationships. Two things you are sadly, and sorely, lacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the queen of relationships,\u201d I said indignantly. \u201cAnd hello, I just spent the entire morning planning our mother\u2019s wedding. That is so freaking compassionate of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, folding the shirt neatly over one arm, waiter-style, \u201chave yet to experience any kind of serious commitment-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c-and you have bitched and moaned so much about the wedding I\u2019d hardly call that compassionate.\u201d</p><p>I just stood there, staring at him. There was no reasoning with him lately. It was like he\u2019d been brainwashed by some religious cult. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying,\u201d he replied, quietly, \u201cis that I\u2019m really happy. And I wish you could be happy too. Like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d I snapped, and I meant it, although it sounded bitter just because I was so pissed off. \u201cI am,\u201d I repeated, in a more level voice.</p><p>He reached over and patted my shoulder, as if he knew better. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he said, turning and heading up the kitchen stairs to his room. I watched him go, carrying his still-wrinkled shirt, and realized I was clenching my teeth, something I found myself doing too often lately.</p><p>Bing! went the typewriter bell from the other room, and my mother started another line. Melanie and Brock Dobbin were probably halfway to heartbreak already, by the sound of it. My mother\u2019s novels were the gasping romantic type, spreading across several exotic locales and peopled with characters that had everything and yet nothing. Riches yet poverty of the heart. And so on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked over to the entrance of the sunroom, careful to be quiet, and looked in at her. When she wrote she seemed to be in another world, oblivious of us: even when we were little and screaming and squawking, she\u2019d just lift her hand from where she was sitting, her back to us, the keys still clacking, and say, \u201cShhhhhhh.\u201d As if that was enough to shut us up, making us see into whatever world she was in at that moment, at the Plaza Hotel or some beach in Capri, where an exquisitely dressed woman was pining for a man she was sure she had lost forever.</p><p>When Chris and I were in elementary school, my mom was pretty broke. She hadn\u2019t published anything yet except newspaper stuff, and even that had petered out once the bands she was writing about-like my dad\u2019s, all 1970s stuff, what they call \u201cclassic rock\u201d now-began to die out or drop off the radio. She got a job teaching writing at the local community college, which paid practically nothing, and we lived in a series of nasty apartment complexes, all with names like Ridgewood Pines and Lakeview Forest, which had no lakes or pines or forests anywhere to be seen. Back then, she wrote at the kitchen table, usually during the evenings or late at night, and some afternoons. Even then, her stories were exotic; she always picked up the free brochures from the local travel agency and fished Gourmet magazine out of the stacks at the recycling center to use as research. While my brother was named after my mother\u2019s favorite saint, my name was inspired by an expensive brand of cognac she\u2019d seen advertised in Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Never mind that we were living on Kraft macaroni and cheese while her characters favored Cristal and caviar, lounging in Dior pantsuits while we shopped at the thrift store. She always loved glamour, my mother, even if she\u2019d never seen it up close.</p><p>Chris and I constantly interrupted her while she was working, which drove her crazy. Finally, at a flea market, she found one of those gypsy curtains, the kind that are made up of long strings of beads, and attached it above the entryway to the kitchen. It became our understood symbol: if the curtain was pulled aside, out of the way, the kitchen was fair game. But if it was hanging there, my mother was working, and we had to find our snacks and entertainment elsewhere.</p><p>I was about six then, and I loved to stand there and brush my fingertips over the beads, watching them swish back and forth. They made the softest sound, like little bells. I could peer through them and still see my mother, but now she looked almost exotic, like a fortune-teller or a fairy, a maker of magic. Which was what she was, but I didn\u2019t know it then.</p> <p>Most of the remnants of our apartment years had been long lost or given away, but the beaded curtain had made the trip to the Big New House, as we\u2019d called it when we moved in. It was one of the first things my mother hung up, before even our school pictures or her favorite Picasso print in the living room. There was a nail so it could be pulled back out of sight, but now it was down, a little worse for wear, but still doing the job. I leaned closer, peering in at my mother. She was still hard at work, fingers flying, and I closed my eyes and listened. It was like music I\u2019d heard all my life, even more than \u201cThis Lullaby.\u201d All those keystrokes, all those letters, so many words. I brushed my fingers over the beads and watched as her image rippled, like it was on water, breaking apart gently and shimmering before becoming whole again.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>It was time to dump Jonathan.</p><p>\u201cTell me again why you\u2019re doing this?\u201d Lissa asked me. She was sitting on my bed, flipping through my CDs and smoking a cigarette, which was fast stinking up my room even though she\u2019d sworn it wouldn\u2019t, since she had it halfway out the window. Even before I quit I\u2019d hated the stink of smoking, but with Lissa I always let things slide more than I should have. I think everyone has at least one friend like that. \u201cI mean, I like Jonathan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like everybody,\u201d I told her, leaning closer to the mirror and examining my lip liner.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she said, picking up a CD and turning it over to examine the back. \u201cI never liked Mr. Mitchell. He always looked at my boobs when I went up to do theorems on the board. He looked at everybody\u2019s boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissa,\u201d I said, \u201chigh school is over. And besides, teachers don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d I went on as I lined my lips, turning the pencil slowly, \u201cthat it\u2019s summer now, and I\u2019m leaving for school in September. And Jonathan... I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s just not a keeper. He\u2019s not worth working my schedule around if we\u2019re only going to break up in a few weeks anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you might not break up.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back, admiring my handiwork, and smudged a bit along my top lip, evening it out. \u201cWe\u2019ll break up,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to Stanford with any other entanglements than absolutely necessary.\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip, then tucked a springy curl behind one ear, ducking her head with the hurt expression she always got lately when we talked about the end of the summer. Lissa\u2019s safe zone was the eight weeks left before we all split for different directions, and she hated to think past that. \u201cWell, of course not,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI mean, why would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissa,\u201d I said, sighing. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean you. You know that. I just mean\u201d-I gestured to the bedroom door, slightly ajar, beyond which we could hear my mother\u2019s typewriter still clacking, with violins drifting in the background-\u201cyou know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. But in truth I knew she didn\u2019t understand. Lissa was the only one of us who was even slightly sentimental about high school being over. She\u2019d actually cried at graduation, great heaving sobs, ensuring that in every picture and video she\u2019d be red-eyed and blotchy, giving her something to complain about for the next twenty years. Meanwhile, me, Jess, and Chloe couldn\u2019t wait to get across that stage and grab our diploma, to be free at last, free at last. But Lissa had always felt things too deeply. That was what made us all so protective of her, and why I worried most about leaving her behind. She\u2019d gotten accepted into the local university with a full scholarship, a deal too good to pass up. It helped that her boyfriend, Adam, was going there too. Lissa had it all planned out, how they\u2019d go to freshman orientation together, live in dorms that were in close proximity, share a couple of classes. Just like high school, but bigger.</p><p>The very thought of it made me itch. But then, I wasn\u2019t Lissa. I\u2019d powered through the last two years with my eyes on one thing, which was getting out. Getting gone. Making the grades I needed to finally live a life that was all my own. No wedding planning. No messy romantic entanglements. No revolving door of stepfathers. Just me and the future, finally together. Now there was a happy ending I could believe in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lissa reached over and turned up the radio, filling the room with some boppy song with a la-la-la chorus. I walked over to my closet, pulling open the door to examine my options.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you wear to dump somebody?\u201d she asked me, twirling a lock of hair around one finger. \u201cBlack, for mourning? Or something cheerful and colorful, to distract them from their pain? Or maybe you wear some sort of camouflage, something that will help you disappear quickly in case they don\u2019t take it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally,\u201d I told her, pulling out a pair of black pants and turning them in my hands, \u201cI\u2019m thinking dark and slimming, a bit of cleavage. And clean underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wear that every night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is every night,\u201d I replied. I knew I had a clean red shirt I liked somewhere in my closet, but I couldn\u2019t find it in the shirt section. Which meant somebody had been in there, picking around. I kept my closet the way I kept everything: neat and tidy. My mother\u2019s house was usually in chaos, so my room had always been the only place I could keep the way I chose. Which was in order, perfectly organized, everything where I could easily find it. Okay, so maybe I was a little obsessive. But so what? At least I wasn\u2019t a slob.</p><p>\u201cNot for Jonathan,\u201d she said, and when I glanced at her she added, \u201cI mean, this is a big night for him. He\u2019s getting dumped. And he doesn\u2019t even know it yet. He\u2019s probably eating a cheese-burger or flossing or picking up his dry cleaning, and he has no idea. No inkling.\u201d</p><p>I gave up on the red shirt, pulling out a tank top instead. I didn\u2019t even know what to say to her. Yes, it sucked getting dumped. But wasn\u2019t it better to just be brutally honest? To admit that your feeling for someone is never going to be powerful enough to justify taking up any more of their time? I was doing him a favor, really. Freeing him up for a better opportunity. In fact, I was a practically a saint, if you really thought about it.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>A half hour later, when we pulled up to the Quik Zip, Jess was waiting for us. As usual, Chloe was late.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, walking over to her. She was leaning against her big tank of a car, an old Chevy with a sagging bumper, and sucking on an Extra Large Zip Coke, our drug of choice. They were the best bargain in town, at $1.59, and served a multitude of uses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting Skittles,\u201d Lissa called out, slamming her door. \u201cAnybody want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZip Diet,\u201d I told her, and reached for my money, but she shook me off, already heading inside. \u201cExtra large!\u201d</p><p>She nodded as the door swung shut behind her. She even walked perkily, hands jauntily in her pockets as she headed for the candy aisle. Lissa\u2019s sweet tooth was infamous: she was the only person I knew who could discern between Raisinets and chocolate-covered raisins. There was a difference.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chloe?\u201d I asked Jess, but she just shrugged, not even taking her lips off the straw of her Zip Coke. \u201cDid we not say seven-thirty sharp?\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cCalm down, anal retentive,\u201d she said, shaking her drink. The ice rattled around, sloshing in what was left of the liquid. \u201cIt\u2019s just six right now.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed, leaning back against her car. I hated when people were late. But Chloe always ran five minutes behind, on a good day. Lissa was usually early, and Jess was Jess: solid as a rock, there right on the dot. She\u2019d been my best friend since the fifth grade, and was the only one I knew I could always depend on.</p><p>We\u2019d met because our desks sat side by side, per Mrs. Douglas\u2019s alphabet system. Mike Schemen the nose picker, then Jess, then me, with Adam Struck, who had bad adenoids, on my other side. It was practically required that we be best friends, seeing as we were surrounded by the booger twins.</p><p>Jess was big, even then. She wasn\u2019t fat, exactly, just like she wasn\u2019t fat now. More just large, big-boned, tall and wide. Thick. Back then, she was larger than any of the boys in our class, brutal at dodgeball, able to hit you hard enough with one of those red medicine balls before school that it left a mark that lasted through final bell. A lot of people thought Jess was mean, but they were wrong. They didn\u2019t know what I knew: that her mom had died that summer, leaving her to raise two little brothers while her dad worked full-time at the power plant. That money was always tight, and Jess didn\u2019t get to be a kid anymore.</p><p>And eight years later, after making it through some hellish middle school and decent high school years, we were still close. Mostly because I did know these things about her, and Jess still kept most stuff to herself. But also because she was one of the only people who just didn\u2019t take my shit, and I had to respect that.</p><p>\u201cLooky look,\u201d she said now in her flat voice, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cThe queen has arrived.\u201d</p><p>Chloe pulled up beside us, cutting the engine on her Mercedes and flipping down the visor to check her lipstick. Jess sighed, loudly, but I ignored her. This was old news, her and Chloe, like background music. Only if things were really quiet or dull did the rest of us even notice it anymore.</p><p>Chloe got out, slamming her door, and came over to us. She looked great, as usual: black pants, blue shirt, cool jacket I hadn\u2019t seen before. Her mom was a flight attendant and a compulsive shopper, a deadly combination that resulted in Chloe always having the newest stuff from the best places. Our little trendsetter.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, tucking her hair behind her ear. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lissa?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded toward the Quik Zip, where Lissa was now at the counter, chatting up the guy behind the counter as he rang up her candy. We watched as she waved good-bye to him and came out, a bag of Skittles already opened in one hand. \u201cWho wants one?\u201d she called out, smiling as she saw Chloe. \u201cHey! God, great jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Chloe said, brushing her fingers over it. \u201cIt\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that surprising?\u201d Jess said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cIs that diet?\u201d Chloe shot back, eyeing the drink in Jess\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d I said, waving my hand between them. Lissa handed me my Zip Diet, and I took a big sip, savoring the taste. It was the nectar of the gods. Truly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to meet Adam at Double Burger at six-thirty,\u201d Lissa said, popping another Skittle into her mouth. \u201cThen we\u2019ll catch up with you guys at Bendo or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s at Bendo?\u201d Chloe asked, jangling her keys.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Lissa said. \u201cSome band. There\u2019s also a party we can go to in the Arbors, Matthew Ridgefield has a keg somewhere and, oh, and Remy has to dump Jonathan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, everyone looked at me. \u201cNot necessarily in that order,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cSo Jonathan\u2019s out.\u201d Chloe laughed, pulling a pack of cigarettes out of her jacket pocket. She held them out to me, and I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cShe quit,\u201d Jess said to her. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always quitting,\u201d Chloe replied, striking a match and leaning into it, then shaking it out. \u201cWhat\u2019d he do, Remy? Stand you up? Declare undying love?\u201d</p> <p>I just shook my head, knowing what was coming.</p><p>Jess grinned and said, \u201cHe wore a nonmatching outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmoked in her car,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Lissa offered, pinching my arm, \u201che made a major grammatical error and was fifteen minutes late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the horror!\u201d Chloe shrieked, and all three of them burst out laughing. I just stood there, taking it, realizing not for the first time that they only seemed to get along when ragging on me as a group.</p> <p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I said finally. Okay, so maybe I did have a bit of history with expecting too much from relationships. But God, at least I had standards. Chloe only dated college guys who cheated on her, Jess avoided the issue by never dating anyone, and Lissa-well, Lissa was still with the guy she lost her virginity to, so she hardly counted at all. Not that I was going to point this out. I mean, I was all about the high road.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Jess said finally. \u201cHow are we doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissa goes to meet Adam,\u201d I said. \u201cYou, me, and Chloe hit the Spot and then go on to Bendo. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lissa said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys later.\u201d As she drove off, and Chloe moved her car to the church parking lot next door, Jess lifted up my hand, squinting at it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked me. I glanced down, seeing the black letters, smudged but still there, on my palm. Before leaving the house I\u2019d meant to wash it off, then got distracted. \u201cA phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said. \u201cJust this stupid guy I met today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heartbreaker,\u201d she said.</p><p>We piled into Jess\u2019s car, me in front, Chloe in back. She made a face as she pushed aside a laundry hamper full of clothes, a football helmet, and some knee pads of Jess\u2019s brothers, but she didn\u2019t say anything. Chloe and Jess may have had their differences, but she knew where to draw the line.</p><p>\u201cThe Spot?\u201d Jess asked me as she cranked the engine. I nodded, and she put the car in reverse, backing up slowly. I reached forward and turned on the radio while Chloe lit another cigarette in the backseat, tossing the match out the window. As we were about to pull out onto the road, Jess nodded toward a big metal trash can by the gas pumps, about twenty feet away.</p><p>\u201cBet me?\u201d she asked, and I craned my neck, judging the distance, then picked up her mostly empty Zip Coke and shook it, feeling its weight.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cTwo bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Chloe said from the backseat, exhaling loudly. \u201cNow that we\u2019re out of high school, can we please move on from this?\u201d</p><p>Jess ignored her, picking up the Zip Coke and pressing her hand around it, flexing her wrist, then stuck her arm out the driver\u2019s-side window. She squinted, lifted her chin, and then, in one smooth movement, threw her arm up and released the Zip Coke, sending it arcing over our heads and the car. We watched as it turned end over end in the air, a perfect spiral, before disappearing with a crash, top still on and straw engaged, in the trash can.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d I said to Jess. She smiled at me. \u201cI never have been able to figure out how you do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan we go now?\u201d Chloe asked.</p><p>\u201cLike everything else,\u201d Jess said, turning out into traffic, \u201cit\u2019s all in the wrist.\u201d</p><p>The Spot, where we always started our night, really belonged to Chloe. When her dad and mom divorced back in the third grade, he\u2019d left town with his new girlfriend, selling off most of the property he\u2019d amassed in town while working as a developer. He only kept one lot, out in the country past our high school, a grassy field with nothing on it but a trampoline he\u2019d bought for Chloe on her seventh birthday. Chloe\u2019s mom had banished it quick from the backyard-it didn\u2019t match her English garden decor, all sculpted hedges and stone benches-and it ended up out on the land, forgotten until we were all old enough to drive and needed someplace of our own.</p><p>We always sat on the trampoline, which was set up in the middle of the pasture, with the best view of the stars and sky. It still had some good bounce to it, enough so that any sudden movement by anybody jostled the rest. Which was good to remember whenever you were pouring something.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Chloe said to Jess, her arm jerking as she poured some rum into my Zip Coke. It was one of those little airplane bottles, which her mom regularly brought home from work. Their liquor cabinet looked like it was designed for munchkins.</p><p>\u201cOh, settle down,\u201d Jess replied, crossing her legs and leaning back on her palms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always like this when Lissa isn\u2019t here,\u201d Chloe grumbled, opening up another bottle for herself. \u201cThe balance of weight gets all out of whack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d I said. \u201cGive it a rest.\u201d I took a sip of my Zip Coke, now spiked, tasting the rum, and offered it to Jess purely out of politeness. She never drank, never smoked. Always drove. Being a mom for so long to her brothers made it a given she\u2019d be the same to us.</p><p>\u201cNice night,\u201d I said to her now, and she nodded. \u201cHard to believe it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Chloe said, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. \u201cNot a second too soon, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s drink to that,\u201d I said, and leaned forward to press my cup against her tiny bottle. Then we just sat there, suddenly quiet, no noise except the cicadas starting up in the trees all around us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so weird,\u201d Chloe said finally, \u201cthat it doesn\u2019t feel different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, this is what we\u2019ve been waiting for, right? High school\u2019s over. It\u2019s a whole new thing but it feels exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because nothing new has started yet,\u201d Jess told her. She had her face tipped up, eyes on the sky above us. \u201cBy the end of the summer, then things will feel new. Because they will be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chloe pulled another tiny bottle-this time gin-out of her jacket pocket and popped the top. \u201cIt sucks to wait, though,\u201d she said, taking a sip of it. \u201cI mean, for everything to begin.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of a horn beeping, loud and then fading out as it passed on the road behind us. That was the nice thing about the Spot: you could hear everything, but no one could see you.</p><p>\u201cThis is just the in-between time,\u201d I said. \u201cIt goes faster than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Chloe said, and I eased back on my elbows, tilting my head back to look up at the sky, which was pinkish, streaked with red. This was the time we knew best, that stretch of day going from dusk to dark. It seemed like we were always waiting for nighttime here. I could feel the trampoline easing up and down, moved by our own breathing, bringing us in small increments up and back from the sky as the colors faded, slowly, and the stars began to show themselves.</p> <p>By the time we got to Bendo, it was nine o\u2019clock and I had a nice buzz on. We pulled up, parked, and eyed the bouncer standing by the door.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I said, pulling down the visor to check my makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s Rodney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my ID?\u201d Chloe said, digging through her jacket. \u201cGod, I just had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it in your bra?\u201d I asked her, turning around. She blinked, stuck her hand down her shirt, and came up with it. Chloe kept everything in her bra: I.D., money, extra barrettes. It was like sleight of hand, the way she just pulled things from it, like quarters from your ear, or rabbits out of a hat.</p><p>\u201cBingo,\u201d she said, sticking it in her front pocket.</p> <p>\u201cSo classy,\u201d Jess said.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d Chloe shot back. \u201cAt least I wear a bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least I need one,\u201d Jess replied.</p><p>Chloe narrowed her eyes. She was a Bcup, and a small one at that, and had always been sensitive about it. \u201cWell at least-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As we walked up, Rodney eyed us from where he was sitting on a stool propping the door open. Bendo was an eighteen-and-up club, but we\u2019d been coming since sophomore year. You had to be twenty-one to drink, though, and with our fakes Chloe and I usually could get our hand stamped. Especially by Rodney.</p> <p>\u201cRemy, Remy,\u201d he said as I reached into my pocket, pulling out my fake. My name, my face, my brother\u2019s birthday, so I could quote it quick if I had to. \u201cHow\u2019s it feel to be a high school graduate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I said, smiling at him. \u201cYou know I\u2019m a junior at the university.\u201d</p><p>He hardly glanced at my ID but squeezed my hand, brushing it with his fingers as he stamped it. Disgusting. \u201cWhat\u2019s your major?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish lit,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019m minoring in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got some business for you,\u201d he said, taking Chloe\u2019s ID and stamping her hand. She was quick though, pulling back fast, the ink smearing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d Jess told him, but he just shrugged, waving us in, his eyes on the next group of girls coming up the steps.</p><p>\u201cI feel so dirty,\u201d Chloe sighed as we walked in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after you have a beer.\u201d</p> <p>Bendo was crowded already. The band hadn\u2019t come on yet, but the bar was two deep and the air was full of smoke, thick and mixed with the smell of sweat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a table,\u201d Jess called out to me, and I nodded, heading for the bar with Chloe behind me. We pushed through the crowd, dodging people, until we got a decent spot by the beer taps.</p><p>I\u2019d just hoisted myself up on my elbows, trying to wave down the bartender, when I felt someone brush up against me. I tried to pull away, but it was packed where I was standing, so I just drew myself in a bit, pulling my arms against my sides. Then, very quietly, I heard a voice in my ear.</p><p>It said, in a weird, cheesy, right-out-of-one-of-my-mother\u2019s-novels way, \u201cAh. We meet again.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head, just slightly, and right there, practically on top of me, was the guy from the car dealership. He was wearing a red Mountain Fresh Detergent T-shirt-NOT JUST FRESH: MOUNTAIN FRESH!-it proclaimed, and was smiling at me. \u201cOh, God,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Dexter,\u201d he replied, offering me his hand, which I ignored. Instead I glanced around behind me for Chloe, but saw she had been waylaid by a guy in a plaid shirt I didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cTwo beers!\u201d I shouted at the bartender, who\u2019d finally seen me.</p><p>\u201cMake that three!\u201d this Dexter yelled.</p><p>\u201cYou are not with me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, not technically,\u201d he replied, shrugging. \u201cBut that could change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said as the bartender dropped three plastic cups in front of me, \u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you still have my number,\u201d he said, interrupting me and grabbing one of the beers. He also slapped a ten down, which redeemed him a bit but not much.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to wash it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be impressed if I tell you I\u2019m in a band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all?\u201d he said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cGod, I thought chicks loved guys in bands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, I\u2019m not a chick,\u201d I said, grabbing my beer. \u201cAnd second, I have a steadfast rule about musicians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>I turned my back to him and started to elbow my way through the crowd, back to Chloe. \u201cNo musicians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could write you a song,\u201d he offered, following me. I was moving so fast the beers I was carrying kept sloshing, but damn if he didn\u2019t keep right up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody wants a song!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d I tapped Chloe on the shoulder and she turned around. She had on her flirting face, all wide-eyed and flushed, and I handed her a beer and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you,\u201d she replied, waggling her fingers at the guy she\u2019d been talking to. But crazy musician boy kept after me, still talking.</p><p>\u201cI think you like me,\u201d he decided as I stepped on somebody\u2019s foot, prompting a yelp. I kept moving.</p><p>\u201cI really do not,\u201d I said, finally spying Jess in a corner booth, head propped on one elbow, looking bored. When she saw me she held up both hands, in a what-the-hell gesture, but I just shook my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho is this guy?\u201d Chloe called out from behind me.</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDexter,\u201d he replied, turning a bit to offer her his hand while still keeping step with me. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, a bit uneasily. \u201cRemy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust keep walking,\u201d I called behind me, stepping around two guys in dreadlocks. \u201cHe\u2019ll lose interest eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ye of little faith,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m just getting started.\u201d</p><p>We arrived at the booth in a pack: me, Dexter the musician, and Chloe. I was out of breath, she looked confused, but he just slid in next to Jess, offering his hand. \u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m with them.\u201d</p><p>Jess looked at me, but I was too tired to do anything but plop into the booth and suck down a gulp of my beer. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201c I\u2019m with them. But I\u2019m not with you. How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s actually an interesting story.\u201d</p> <p>No one said anything for a minute. Finally I groaned and said, \u201cGod, you guys, now he\u2019s going to tell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d he began, leaning back into the booth, \u201cI was at this car dealership today, and I saw this girl. It was an across-a-crowded-room kind of thing. A real moment, you know?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Chloe said, \u201cAnd this would be Remy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Remy,\u201d he said, repeating my name with a smile. Then, as if we were happy honeymooners recounting our story for strangers he added, \u201cDo you want to tell the next part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he went on, slapping the table for emphasis, making all our drinks jump, \u201cthe fact is that I\u2019m a man of impulse. Of action. So I walked up, plopped down beside her, and introduced myself.\u201d</p> <p>Chloe looked at me, smiling. \u201cReally,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCould you go away now?\u201d I asked him just as the music overhead cut off and there was a tapping noise from the stage, followed by someone saying \u201ccheck, check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuty calls,\u201d he said, standing up. He pushed his half-finished beer over to me and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then! We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d And then he pushed off, into the crowd, and was gone. We all just sat there for a second. I finished my beer, then closed my eyes and lifted the cup, pressing it to my temple. How could I already be exhausted?</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Chloe said finally in her clever voice. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt was just this stupid thing. I\u2019d forgotten all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe talks too much,\u201d Jess decided.</p> <p>\u201cI liked his shirt,\u201d Chloe told her. \u201cInteresting fashion sense.\u201d</p><p>Just then Jonathan slid in beside me in the booth. \u201cHello, ladies,\u201d he said, sliding his arm around my waist. Then he picked up crazy musician boy\u2019s beer, thinking it was mine, and took a big sip. I would have stopped him, but just the fact that he did it was part of our problem. I hated it when guys acted proprietary toward me, and Jonathan had done that from the beginning. He was a senior too, a nice guy, but as soon as we\u2019d started dating he wanted everyone to know it, and slowly began to encroach on my domain. He smoked my cigarettes, when I still smoked. Used my cell phone all the time to make calls, without asking, and got very comfortable in my car, which should have been the ultimate red flag. I cannot abide anyone even changing my station presets or dipping into my ashtray change, but Jonathan charged right past that and insisted on driving, even though he had a history of fender benders and speeding tickets as long as my arm. The stupidest part was that I let him, flushed as I was with love (not likely) or lust (more likely), and then he just expected I\u2019d ride shotgun, in my own car, forever. Which just led to more Ken behavior-as in ultraboyfriend-like always grabbing onto me in public and drinking, without asking, what he thought was my beer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go back to the house for a sec,\u201d he said now, leaning close to my ear. He moved his hand from around my waist, so it was now cupping my knee. \u201cCome with me, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and he finished off the beer, slapping the cup down on the table. Jonathan was a big partier, another thing I had trouble dealing with. I mean, I drank too. But he was sloppy about it. A puker. In the six months we\u2019d been together I\u2019d spent a fair amount of time at parties outside the bathroom, waiting for him to finish spewing so we could go home. Not a plus.</p><p>He slid out of the booth, moving his hand off my knee and closing his fingers around mine. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d I said to Jess and Chloe as someone brushed past, and Jonathan finally had to cease contact with me as the crowd separated us.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you let him drink that guy\u2019s beer.\u201d</p><p>I turned and saw Jonathan looking back at me, impatient. \u201cDead man walking,\u201d Jess said in a low voice, and Chloe snorted.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I said, and pushed through the crowd, where Jonathan\u2019s hand was extended, waiting to take hold of me again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look,\u201d I said, pushing him back. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, then sat back on the bed, letting his head bonk against the wall. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, as if he were agreeing to a root canal, \u201cgo ahead.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my knees up on the bed, then straightened my tank top. \u201cRunning in for something\u201d had quickly morphed into \u201cmaking a few phone calls\u201d and then he was all over me, pushing me back against the pillows before I could even begin my slow easing into the dumpage. But now, I had his attention.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d I began, \u201cthings are really starting to change for me now.\u201d</p><p>This was my lead-up. I\u2019d learned, over the years, that there was a range of techniques involved in breaking up with someone. You had your types: some guys got all indignant and pissed, some whined and cried, some acted indifferent and cold, as if you couldn\u2019t leave fast enough. I had Jonathan pegged as the last, but I couldn\u2019t be completely sure.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway,\u201d I continued, \u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking that-\u201d</p><p>And then the phone rang, an electronic shriek, and I lost my momentum again. Jonathan grabbed it. \u201cHello?\u201d Then there was a bit off umm-hmming, a couple of yeahs, and he stood up, walking across the room and into his bathroom, still mumbling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled my fingers through my hair, hating that my timing seemed to be off all night long. Still listening to him talking, I closed my eyes and stretched my arms over my head, then curled my fingers down the side of the mattress closest to the wall. And then I felt something.</p><p>When Jonathan finally hung up, checked himself in the mirror, and walked back into the bedroom, I was sitting there, cross-legged, with a pair of red satin bikini panties spread out on the bed in front of me. (I\u2019d retrieved them using a Kleenex: like I\u2019d touch them.) He came strolling in, all confident, and, seeing them, came to a dead, lurching stop.</p><p>\u201cUmmpthz,\u201d he said, or something like that, as he sucked in a breath, surprised, then quickly steadied himself. \u201cHey, um, what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d I said, my voice level, \u201care these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the ceiling, shaking my head. Like I\u2019d wear cheap red, polyester panties. I mean, I had standards. Or did I? Look who I\u2019d wasted the last six months on.</p><p>\u201cHow long,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been sleeping with someone else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long,\u201d I repeated, biting off the words.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, and for a second it was the only sound in the room. Then he said, \u201cJust a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>I sat back, pressing my fingers to my temples. God, this was just great. Now not only was I cheated on, but other people had to know it, which made me a victim, which I hated most of all. Poor, poor Remy. I wanted to kill him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d I said. He was all flushed, quaky, and I realized that he might have even been a whiner or weeper, had things gone differently. Amazing. You just never knew.</p><p>\u201cRemy. Let me-\u201d He reached forward, touching my arm, but for once, finally, I was able to do what I wanted and yank it back as if he\u2019d burned me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I snapped. I grabbed my jacket, knotting it around my waist, and headed for the door, feeling him stumbling behind me. I slammed door after door as I moved through the house, finally hitting the front walk with such momentum I was at the mailbox before I even realized it. I could feel him watching me from the front steps as I walked away, but he didn\u2019t call out or say anything. Not that I wanted him to, or would have reconsidered. But most guys would have at least had the decency to try.</p><p>So now I was walking through this neighborhood, full-out pissed, with no car, in the middle of a Friday night. My first Friday night as a grown-up, out of high school, in the Real World. Welcome to it.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Chloe asked me when I finally got back to Bendo, with the help of City Transit, about twenty minutes later.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to believe-\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d She took my arm, pulling me through the crowd and back outside, where I saw Jess was in her car, the driver\u2019s door open. \u201cWe have a situation.\u201d</p><p>When I walked up to the car, I didn\u2019t even see Lissa at first. She was balled up in the backseat, clutching a wad of those brown school-restaurant-public-bathroom kind of paper towels. Her face was red and tear streaked, and she was sobbing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d I asked, yanking open the back door and sliding in beside her.</p><p>\u201cAdam b-b-broke up with m-m-me,\u201d she said, her voice gulping in air. \u201cHe just d-d-dumped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I said as Chloe climbed in the front seat, slamming the door behind her. Jess, already turned around facing us, looked at me and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Lissa took in another breath, then burst into tears again. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she mumbled, wiping her face with a paper towel. \u201cI can\u2019t e-e-ven-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, when she picked him up from work,\u201d Chloe said to me. \u201cShe took him back to his house so he could take a shower and he did it there. No warning. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to walk p-p-past his p-p-parents, \u201d Lissa added, sniffling. \u201cAnd they knew. They looked at me like I was a kicked d-d-dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cHe told her,\u201d Chloe said, clearly in her spokesperson role, \u201cthat he needed his freedom because it was summer and high school was over and he didn\u2019t want either of them to miss any opportunities in college. He wanted to make sure that they-\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-m-made the most of our lives,\u201d Lissa finished, wiping her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJerk,\u201d Jess grumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re better off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI l-l-love him!\u201d Lissa wailed, and I reached over, sliding my arm around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I had no idea,\u201d she said, taking in a deep breath, which shuddered out, all bumpy, as she tossed aside the paper towel she was holding, letting it fall to the floor. \u201cHow could I not even have known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissa, you\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Chloe told her, her voice soft.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m Jonathan,\u201d she sobbed, leaning into me. \u201cWe were just living our lives, picking up the dry cleaning-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jess said.</p><p>\u201c... unaware,\u201d Lissa finished, \u201cthat t-t-tonight we\u2019d be d-d-dumped. \u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of,\u201d Chloe said to me, \u201chow\u2019d that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d I said.</p><p>Lissa was full-out crying now, her face buried in my shoulder. Over Chloe\u2019s head I could see Bendo was fully packed, with a line out the door. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d I said to Jess, and she nodded. \u201cThis night has sucked anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chloe dropped down into the front passenger seat, punching in the car lighter as Jess cranked the engine. Lissa blew her nose in the paper towel I handed her, then settled into small, quick sobs, curling against me. As we pulled out I patted her head, knowing how much it had to hurt. There is nothing so bad as the first time.</p><p>Of course we had to have another round of Zip Drinks. Then Chloe left, and Jess pulled back out into traffic to take me and Lissa to my house.</p><p>We were almost to the turnoff to my neighborhood when Jess suddenly slowed down and said, very quietly, to me, \u201cThere\u2019s Adam.\u201d</p><p>I cut my eyes to the left, and sure enough, Adam and his friends were standing around in the parking lot in front of the Coffee Shack. What really bugged me was that he was smiling. Jerk.</p><p>I glanced behind me, but Lissa had her eyes closed, stretched out across the backseat, listening to the radio. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPull in,\u201d I said to Jess. I turned around in my seat. \u201cHey Liss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBe still, okay? Stay down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said uncertainly.</p> <p>We chugged along. Jess said, \u201cYou or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d I told her, taking a last sip of my drink. \u201cI need this tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jess pushed the gas a little harder.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>I nodded, my Zip Diet balanced in my hand. Perfect.</p> <p>Jess gunned it, hard, and we were moving. By the time Adam looked over at us, it was too late.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t my best. But it wasn\u2019t bad either. As we whizzed by, the cup turned end over end in the air, seeming weightless. It hit him square in the back of the head, spilling Diet Coke and ice in a wave down his back.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d he yelled after us as we blew past. \u201cLissa! Dammit! Remy! You bitch!\u201d</p><p>He was still yelling when I lost sight of him.</p><p>After a sleeve and a half of Oreos, four cigarettes, and enough Kleenex to pad the world, I finally got Lissa to go to sleep. She was out instantly, breathing through her nose, legs tangled around my comforter.</p><p>I got a blanket, one pillow, and went into my closet, where I stretched out across the floor. I could see her from where I was, and made sure she was still sleeping soundly as I pushed aside the stack of shoe boxes I kept in the far right corner and pulled out the bundle I kept there, hidden away.</p> <p>I\u2019d had such a bad night. I didn\u2019t do this all the time, but some nights I just needed it. Nobody knew.</p><p>I curled up, pulling the blanket over me, and opened the folded towel, taking out my portable CD player and headphones. Then I slipped them on, turned off the light, and skipped to track seven. There was a skylight in my closet, and if I lay just right, the moonlight fell in a square right across me. Sometimes I could even see stars.</p><p>The song starts slowly. A bit of guitar, just a few chords. Then a voice, one I knew so well. The words I knew by heart. They did mean something to me. Nobody had to know. But they did.</p><p>This lullaby is only a few words</p><p>A simple run of chords</p><p>Quiet here in this spare room</p><p>But you can hear it, hear it</p><p>Wherever you may go</p> <p>I will let you down</p><p>But this lullaby plays on...</p><p>I\u2019d fall asleep to it, to his voice. I always did. Every time.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cAiiiieeeeeee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother of pearl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, suuuugggaaarrr!\u201d</p><p>In the waiting room, the two ladies on deck for manicures looked at each other, then at me.</p><p>\u201cBikini wax,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said one, and went back to her magazine. The other just sat there, ears perked like a hunting hound, waiting for the next shriek. It wasn\u2019t long before Mrs. Michaels, enduring her monthly appointment, delivered.</p><p>\u201c H-E- double-hockey-sticks!\u201d Mrs. Michaels was the wife of one of the local ministers, and loved God almost as much as having a smooth, hairless body. In the year I\u2019d worked at Joie Salon, I\u2019d heard more cussing from the back room where Talinga worked her wax strips than all the other rooms combined. And that included bad manicures, botched haircuts, and even one woman who was near perturbed about a seaweed body wrap that turned her the color of key lime pie.</p><p>Not that Joie was a bad place. It was just that you couldn\u2019t please everyone, especially women, when it came to their looks. That\u2019s why Lola, who owned Joie, had just given me a raise in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, I\u2019d turn my back on going to Stanford and stay at her reception desk forever, keeping people under control.</p><p>I\u2019d gotten the job because I wanted a car. My mother had offered to give me her car, a nice Camry, and buy herself a new one, but it was important to me that I do this on my own. I loved my mother, but I\u2019d learned long ago not to enter into any more agreements with her than I had to. Her whims were legendary, and I could just see her taking the car back when she decided she no longer was happy with her new one.</p><p>So I emptied out my savings account-which consisted mostly of baby-sitting and Christmas money I\u2019d hoarded forever-got out Consumer Reports, and did all the research I could on new models before hitting the dealerships. I wrangled and argued and bluffed and put up with so much car-salesman bullshit it almost killed me, but in the end I got the car I wanted, a new Civic with a sunroof and automatic everything, at a price way off the manufacturer\u2019s suggested rip-off retail. The day I picked it up, I drove over to Joie and filled out an application, having seen a RECEPTIONIST WANTED sign in their front window a week or so earlier. And just like that, I had a car payment and a job, all before my senior year even began.</p><p>Now, the phone rang as Mrs. Michaels emerged from the waxing room. At first I\u2019d been startled by how bad people looked right afterward: like war victims, or casualties of a fire. She was walking stiffly-bikini waxes were especially brutal-as she came up to my desk.</p><p>\u201cJoie Salon,\u201d I said into the phone. \u201cRemy speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy, hello, this is Lauren Baker,\u201d the woman on the other end said in a rushed voice. Mrs. Baker was always all wispy sounding and out of breath. \u201cOh, you just have to fit me in for a manicure today. Carl\u2019s got some big client and we\u2019re going to La Corolla and this week I restripped the coffee table and my hands are just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne second please,\u201d I said, in my clipped, oh-so-professional voice, and hit the hold button. Above me, Mrs. Michaels grimaced as she pulled out her wallet, sliding a gold credit card across to me. \u201cThat\u2019s seventy-eight, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and I swiped the card, handing it back to her. Her face was so red, the area around her eyebrows practically raw. Ouch. She signed the slip, then glanced at herself in the mirror behind me, making a face.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t go to the post office looking like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Talinga, the waxer, said as she breezed in, ostensibly for some good reason but actually to make sure Mrs. Michaels\u2019s tip was big enough and made it into her envelope. \u201cNo one will even notice. I\u2019ll see you next month, okay?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Michaels waggled her fingers, then walked out the door, still moving stiffly. Once she hit the curb Talinga grabbed her envelope, leafed through the bills there, and made a hmmph kind of noise before flopping down in a chair and crossing her legs to await her next appointment.</p><p>\u201cMoving on,\u201d I said, hitting the button for line one. I could hear Mrs. Baker panting before I even started talking. \u201cLet\u2019s see, I could squeeze you in at three-thirty, but you have to be here right on the dot, because Amanda\u2019s got a firm four o\u2019clock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThree-thirty?\u201d Mrs. Baker said. \u201cWell, you see, earlier would be better, actually, because I have this-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree-thirty,\u201d I repeated, clipping my vowels. \u201cTake it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, some anxious breathing, and then she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p> <p>As I hung up the phone, penciling her in, Talinga looked at me and said, \u201cRemygirl, you are such a hard-ass.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. The truth was, I could deal with these women because most of them had that used-to-having-everything, me-me-me mentality, in which I was well versed because of my mother. They wanted to bend the rules, to get things for free, to run into other people\u2019s appointments and still have everyone love them just so much. So I was good at this job, if only because I had a lifetime of previous experience.</p><p>In the next hour I got the two women waiting to their manicures, ordered lunch for Lola, did the receipts from the day before, and between two eyebrow waxings and an underarm job I heard every gory detail about Talinga\u2019s most recent disastrous blind date. But by two o\u2019clock, things had slowed down a bit, and I was just sitting there at the desk, drinking a Diet Coke and staring out at the parking lot.</p><p>Joie was located in a glorified strip mall called Mayor\u2019s Village. It was all concrete, right on the highway, but there were some nice landscaped trees and a fountain to make it look more upscale. To our right was Mayor\u2019s Market, which sold expensive organic food. There was also Jump Java, the coffee place, as well as a video store, a bank, and a one-hour photo.</p><p>As I was staring out, I saw a beat-up white van pull into the parking lot, taking a space by Gone to the Birds, the specialty bird feeder store. The front and side doors of the van opened and three guys got out, all about my age, all in dress shirts and ties and jeans. They huddled for a second, discussing something, then split up, each heading into a different store. A short guy with red curly hair came toward us, tucking in his shirt as he got closer.</p> <p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d I said. \u201cHere come the Mormons.\u201d Although we had a very nice sign in the window that read PLEASE-NO SOLICITING, I was always having to chase away people selling candy bars or Bibles. I took a sip of my Diet Coke, readying myself as the door chime clanged and he came in.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, walking right up. He was mighty freckled, which I guess a lot of red-headed guys are, but his eyes were a nice deep green and he had a decent smile. His dress shirt, upon closer inspection, had a stain on the pocket, however, and looked decidedly thrift store-esque. Plus, the tie was a clip-on. I mean, it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if perhaps you were hiring?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. No men worked at Joie: it wasn\u2019t a conscious thing on Lola\u2019s part, just that frankly the work didn\u2019t appeal to most men. We\u2019d had one male stylist, Eric, but he\u2019d jumped to Sunset Salon, our biggest competition, earlier in the year, taking one of our best manicurists with him. Since then it was all estrogen, all the time.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem convinced, but he was still smiling. \u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, all charming, \u201cif perhaps I could fill out an application in case an opening became available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, pulling open the bottom drawer of the desk, where we kept the pad of applications. I ripped one off, handed it to him, along with one of my pens.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much,\u201d he said, taking a seat in the corner by the window. I watched from where I was as he wrote his name across the top in neat block letters, then wrinkled his brow, contemplating the questions.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Lola called out, walking into the waiting area, \u201cdid we ever get that shipment from Redken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I told her. Lola was a big woman who wore tight, bright clothes. She had a huge laugh to match her huge frame and inspired such respect and fear in her clients that no one even came in with a picture or anything when they had a hair appointment: they just let her decide. Now, she glanced over at the guy in the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>He looked up, hardly startled. I had to admire that. \u201cApplying for a job,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She looked him up and down. \u201cIs that a clip-on tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, nodding at her. \u201cIt sure is.\u201d</p><p>Lola looked at me, then back at him, then burst into laughter. \u201cOh, Lord, look at this boy. And you want to work for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I sure do.\u201d He was so polite I could see him gaining points, quickly. Lola was big on respect.</p><p>\u201cCan you give a manicure?\u201d</p><p>He considered this. \u201cNo. But I\u2019m a fast learner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you bikini wax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I sure can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, smiling at him. \u201cHoney,\u201d she said finally, \u201cyou\u2019re useless.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy mother always said that,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut I\u2019m in this band and we all have to get jobs today, so I\u2019m trying anything.\u201d</p><p>Lola laughed again. It sounded like it came all the way from her stomach, bubbling up. \u201cYou\u2019re in a band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. We just came down from Virginia, for the summer. And we all have to get day jobs, so we came here and split up.\u201d</p><p>So they\u2019re not Mormons, I thought. They\u2019re musicians. Even worse.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you play?\u201d Lola asked.</p><p>\u201cDrums,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLike Ringo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He grinned, then added, in a lower voice, \u201cYou know they always put the redheaded guy in the back. Otherwise all the ladies would be on me.\u201d</p><p>Lola exploded in laughter, so loudly that Talinga and one of the manicurists, Amanda, poked their heads around the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world?\u201d Amanda asked.</p><p>\u201cGood God, is that a clip-on tie?\u201d Talinga said.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Lola said, catching her breath, \u201cwe\u2019ve got nothing for you here. But you come down to the coffee place with me and I\u2019ll get you a job. That girl owes me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut come on. I don\u2019t have all day.\u201d</p><p>He leapt up, the pen he was holding clattering to the floor. He bent down to get it, then brought the application back to me. \u201cThanks anyway,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ringo!\u201d Lola yelled from the door.</p><p>He jumped, grinning, then leaned a little closer and said to me, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s still talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDexter.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Just my luck. He\u2019s not just in a band, he\u2019s in that band. \u201cWhy?\u201d I said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019re officially a challenge. He\u2019ll never give up now.\u201d</p><p>I just sat there, shaking my head. Ridiculous.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to notice, instead just patted his hand on the desk, as if we\u2019d made a deal or something, before walking over to Lola.</p> <p>Once they\u2019d left, Talinga looked at me and said, \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, grabbing the phone as it rang again. Small world, small town. It was just a coincidence. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>In the week since Jonathan and I had split, I\u2019d hardly thought about him or Dexter the musician or anything else other than my mother\u2019s wedding. It was a distraction I needed, not that I\u2019d ever have admitted it aloud.</p><p>Jonathan had called a bunch, at first, but after a while he just stopped, knowing I\u2019d never get back to him. Chloe pointed out that I\u2019d gotten what I wanted, really: my freedom. Just not exactly the way I wanted it. But it still burned at me that I\u2019d been cheated on. It was the kind of thing that woke me up at night, pissed, unable to remember anything I\u2019d been dreaming.</p><p>Luckily, I had Lissa to deal with too. She\u2019d spent the last week completely in denial, sure Adam would change his mind. It was all we could do to thwart her calling/driving by/going to his work impulse, which we all knew never led to any good in a dumping situation. If he wanted to see her, he\u2019d find her. If he wanted to get back together, she should make him work for it. And so on.</p><p>And now, the wedding was here. I got off work early, at five, and drove home to get ready for the rehearsal dinner. As I walked up to the front door, I realized the house was just as I\u2019d left it. In chaos.</p> <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s just no way they\u2019ll get here in time!\u201d my mother was shrieking as I walked in and dropped my keys on the table. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be here in an hour or we won\u2019t be able to make the dinner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I called out, instantly recognizing her close-to-meltdown voice. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that,\u201d she said, her voice still shrill. \u201cBut this is my wedding!\u201d</p><p>I glanced into the living room, which was empty except for Jennifer Anne, already dressed for the dinner, sitting on the couch reading a book entitled Making Plans, Making Dreams, which had a picture of a woman looking pensive on its cover. She glanced up at me, turning a page.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe limo service is having some problems.\u201d She fluffed her hair. \u201cIt seems one of their cars was in an accident and the other is stuck in traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just not acceptable! \u201d my mother yelled.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chris?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at the ceiling. \u201cIn his room,\u201d she said. \u201cApparently, there\u2019s been some sort of hatching.\u201d Then she made a face and went back to her book.</p><p>My brother bred lizards. Upstairs, next to his room in what had once been a walk-in closet, he kept a row of aquariums in which he raised monitor lizards. They were hard to describe: smaller than iguanas, bigger than geckos. They had snakelike tongues and ate tiny crickets that were forever getting loose in the house, bouncing down the stairs and chirping from where they hid in shoes in the closets. He even had an incubator, which he kept on the floor of his room. When he had eggs in it, it ran in cycles all day, softly clicking to maintain the temperature needed to bring the babies to maturity.</p><p>Jennifer Anne hated the lizards. They were, in fact, the one sticking point of her transformation of Chris, the one thing he would not give up for her. As a result, she refused to go anywhere near his room, instead spending her time at our house on the couch, or at the kitchen table, usually reading some motiva tional self-help book and sighing loud enough for everyone-except Chris, who was usually upstairs, tending to his animals-to hear her.</p><p>But now, I had bigger problems.</p><p>\u201cI understand that,\u201d my mother said, her voice now wavering close to tears, \u201cbut what you\u2019re not hearing is that I have a hundred people that are going to be waiting for me at the Hilton and I will not be there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa,\u201d I said, coming up behind her and gently closing my hand over the phone. \u201cMom. Let me talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just ludicrous!\u201d she sputtered, but she let me take it. \u201cIt\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said quietly, \u201cgo finish getting dressed. I\u2019ll handle this. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She just stood there for a second, blinking. She already had on her dress and was carrying her pantyhose in her hand. No makeup, no jewelry. Which meant another good twenty-five minutes if we were lucky.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay,\u201d she said, as if she were doing me a favor. \u201cI\u2019ll be upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I watched as she walked out of the room, brushing her fingers through her hair. When she was gone, I put the phone to my ear. \u201cIs this Albert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the voice said, warily. \u201cThis is Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Albert there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d There was a muffled noise, someone\u2019s hand covering the receiver. Then, \u201cHello, Albert speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbert, this is Remy Starr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Remy! Look, this thing with the cars is just messed up, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is approaching meltdown, Albert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But look, this is what Thomas was trying to tell her. What we\u2019ll do is...\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, I went up the stairs and knocked on my mother\u2019s door. When I came in, she was sitting in front of her vanity. She looked no different except that she had changed her dress and now sat dabbing at her face with a makeup brush. Ah, progress.</p><p>\u201cAll fixed,\u201d I told her. \u201cA car will be here at six. It\u2019s a Town Car, not a limo, but we\u2019re set for tomorrow and that\u2019s what really matters. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, placing one hand over her chest, as if this, finally, calmed her racing heart. \u201cWonderful. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I sat down on her bed, kicking off my shoes, and glanced at the clock. It was five-fifteen. I could be ready in eighteen minutes flat, including drying my hair, so I lay back and closed my eyes. I could hear my mother making her getting-ready noises: perfume bottles clinking, brushes dabbing, small containers of face cream and eye gel being moved around on the mirrored tabletop in front of her. My mother was glamorous long before she had reason to be. She\u2019d always been small and wiry, full of energy and prone to dramatic outbursts: she liked to wear lots of bangle bracelets that clanked as she waved her arms around, sweeping the air as she talked. Even when she taught at the community college and most of her students were half asleep after working full days, she dressed for class, with full makeup and perfume and her trademark swishy outfits in bright colors. She kept her hair dyed jet black now that it was graying, and wore it in a short, blunt cut with thick bangs cut straight across. With her long, flowing skirts and the hair she almost could have been a geisha, except that she was way too noisy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemy, honey,\u201d she said suddenly, and I jerked up, realizing I\u2019d almost fallen asleep. \u201cCan you come do my clasp?\u201d</p><p>I stood up and walked over to where she was sitting, taking the necklace she handed to me. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d I told her. It was true. Tonight, she was wearing a long red dress with a drop neckline, amethyst earrings, and the big diamond ring Don had given her. She smelled like L\u2019Air du Temps, which, when I was little, I thought was the most wonderful scent in the world. The whole house reeked of it: it clung to the drapes and rugs the way cigarette smoke does, stubbornly and forever.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart,\u201d she said as I did the clasp. Looking at us reflected in the mirror I was struck again by how little we resembled each other: me blond and thin, her darker and more voluptuous. I didn\u2019t look like my father, either. I didn\u2019t have many early pictures of him, but in the ones I had seen he always looked grizzled, in that 1960s rock kind of way, with a beard and long hair. He also looked permanently stoned, which my mother never disputed when I pointed it out. Oh, but he had such a beautiful voice, she\u2019d say, now that he was gone. One song, and I was a goner.</p><p>Now, she turned around and took my hands in hers. \u201cOh, Remy,\u201d she said, smiling, \u201ccan you believe this? We\u2019re going to be so happy. \u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she said, turning around, \u201cit\u2019s not like this is my first time going down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I agreed, smoothing her hair down where it was poking up slightly in the back.</p><p>\u201cBut it just feels real this time. Permanent. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I knew what she wanted me to say, but still I hesitated. It seemed like a bad movie, this ritual we\u2019d gone through twice already that I could remember. At this point, the other bridesmaids and myself considered the ceremonies more like class reunions, where we stood off to the side and discussed who had gotten fat or gone bald since my mother\u2019s last wedding. I had no illusions about love anymore. It came, it went, it left casualties or it didn\u2019t. People weren\u2019t meant to be together forever, regardless of what the songs say. I would have been doing her a favor dragging forth the other wedding albums she kept stacked under her bed and pointing at the pictures, forcing her to take in the same things, the same people, the same cake/champagne toast/first dance poses we\u2019d be seeing again in the next forty-eight hours. Maybe she could forget, push those husbands and memories out of sight and out of mind. But I couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>She was still smiling at me in the mirror. Sometimes I thought if she could read my mind it would kill her. Or both of us.</p><p>\u201cDifferent,\u201d she said, convincing herself. \u201cIt\u2019s different this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom,\u201d I said, putting my hands on her shoulders. They felt small to me, somehow, from where I stood. \u201cSure it is.\u201d</p><p>On my way down to my room, Chris jumped out at me.</p><p>\u201cRemy! You\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my watch-five-thirty-and then followed him into the lizard room. It was cramped, and he had to keep it hot all the time, which made being in there feel like a really long elevator ride to nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, grabbing my hand and yanking me down beside him, next to the incubator. The top was off and inside there was a small Tupperware container, filled with what looked like moss. On top of it were three little eggs. One was broken open, one kind of mushed, and the other had a little hole in the top.</p><p>\u201cCheck it out,\u201d Chris whispered, and pointed at the one with the hole.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d I said, looking at my watch again. \u201cI haven\u2019t even taken a shower yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait,\u201d he told me, poking at the egg again. \u201cThis is worth it.\u201d</p><p>We crouched there, together. My head was starting to hurt from the heat. And then, just as I was about to get up, the egg stirred. It wobbled a bit, and then something poked out of the hole. A tiny little head, and as the egg tore, it was followed by a body. It was slippery and slimy and so small it could have fit on the tip of my finger.</p><p>\u201cVaranus tristis orientalis,\u201d Chris said, as if he was casting a spell. \u201cFreckled monitor. He\u2019s the only one that survived.\u201d</p><p>The little lizard still seemed a bit dazed, blinking its eyes and moving in a stuttered kind of way, jerkily. Chris was beaming, as if he\u2019d just single-handedly created the universe.</p><p>\u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d he said as the lizard moved again on his tiny webbed feet. \u201cWe\u2019re the first thing he\u2019s ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>The lizard stared up at us, and we stared back, taking each other in. He was little and defenseless, I felt sorry for him already. This was a screwed-up place he\u2019d just come into. But he didn\u2019t have to know that. Not yet, anyway. There in that room, where it was hot and cramped, the world probably still seemed small enough to manage.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cAnd finally, please lift your glasses and toast Barbara\u2019s daughter, Remy, who planned and organized this entire event. We couldn\u2019t have done it without her. To Remy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Remy!\u201d everyone echoed, glancing at me before sucking down more champagne.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d my mother said, smiling at Don, who hadn\u2019t stopped grinning since the organist had started the \u201cPrelude\u201d for the ceremony two hours earlier, \u201cplease, enjoy yourselves!\u201d</p><p>The string quartet began playing, my mother and Don kissed, and finally I let out a breath. The salads had been served, everyone seated. Cake: check. Table centerpieces: check. Bartender and liquor: check. This and a million other details completed meant that now, after six months, two days, and approximately four hours, I could relax. At least for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said to Chloe, \u201c now I will have some champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d she said, pushing a glass at me. She and Lissa were past tipsy, red faced and giggly enough to have attracted attention to our table more than once already. Jennifer Anne, who was sitting on my left with Chris, was drinking seltzer water and watching us, a pinched look on her face.</p><p>\u201cGreat job, Remy,\u201d Chris said, spearing a tomato from his salad and stuffing it in his mouth. \u201cYou really made this a good day for Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter this,\u201d I told him, \u201cshe\u2019s on her own. Next time, she can go to Vegas and get married by an Elvis impersonator. I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Jennifer Anne let her mouth drop open. \u201cNext time?\u201d she said, shocked. Then she looked over at my mother and Don, who were now at the head table, managing to eat and hold hands concurrently. \u201cRemy, this is marriage. In front of God. It\u2019s forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chris and I just looked at her. Across the table, Lissa burped.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said as Chloe began snorting with laughter. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>Jennifer Anne rolled her eyes, clearly offended at sharing a table with a bunch of peons and cynics. \u201cChristopher,\u201d she said, and she was the only one who ever called him that, \u201clet\u2019s get some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m eating my salad,\u201d Chris said. He had dressing on his chin.</p> <p>Jennifer Anne just picked up her napkin, folding it delicately. She\u2019d finished her salad already and left her utensils in that neat cross in the middle, signaling to the server that she was done.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Chris said, standing up. \u201cAir. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Once they were gone, Chloe hopped over two seats, with Lissa following along behind her clumsily. Jess was missing, having had to stay home with her little brother when he came down with a sudden case of strep throat. Quiet as she was, I always felt things were out of balance when she wasn\u2019t around, as if Lissa and Chloe were too much for me to handle alone.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d Lissa said as Jennifer Anne led Chris out into the lobby, talking the whole way, \u201cshe hates us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, taking another gulp of my champagne, \u201cshe just hates me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, stop,\u201d Chloe said, picking through her salad.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she hate you?\u201d Lissa asked as she tipped up her glass again. Her lipstick was smudged, but in a cute way.</p><p>\u201cBecause she thinks I\u2019m a bad person,\u201d I told her. \u201cI go against everything she believes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not true!\u201d she said, offended. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful person, Remy.\u201d</p><p>Chloe snorted. \u201cNow, let\u2019s not get crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is!\u201d Lissa said, loud enough so that a couple of people at the next table-Don\u2019s dealership coworkers-glanced over at us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not wonderful,\u201d I said, squeezing Lissa\u2019s arm. \u201cBut I am a bit better than I used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Chloe said, tossing her napkin down on her plate, \u201cI can agree with. I mean, you don\u2019t smoke anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd I hardly get falling down drunk at all.\u201d</p><p>Lissa nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd finally,\u201d I said, finishing my drink, \u201cI don\u2019t sleep around nearly as much as I used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d Chloe said, lifting up her glass so I could tap mine against it. \u201cWatch out Stanford,\u201d she said, smiling at me. \u201cRemy\u2019s practically a saint now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Remy,\u201d I said, trying it out. \u201cI think I like that.\u201d</p><p>The dinner was good. No one else seemed to think the chicken was a little rubbery besides me, but then I\u2019d lobbied hard for the beef and lost, so I might have just been sore. Jennifer Anne and Chris never returned to our table; later, on my way to the rest room, I saw they\u2019d defected to one where I\u2019d put several of the local bigwigs Don was friendly with from the chamber of commerce. Jennifer Anne was talking away to the town manager, waving her fork as she made a point, while Chris sat beside her, a stain now on his tie, shoveling food in his mouth. When he saw me he smiled, apologetically, and just shrugged, as if this, like so many other things, was completely out of his hands.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at our table, the champagne was flowing. One of Don\u2019s nephews, who went to Princeton, was busy hitting on Chloe, while Lissa, in the ten minutes I\u2019d been gone, had crossed over from happily buzzing to completely maudlin, and was now well on her way to flat-out weepy drunk.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d she said, leaning into me, \u201cI really thought that Adam and I would get married. I mean, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, feeling relieved as I saw Jess, in one of her few dresses, heading toward us. She looked uncomfortable, as she always did in anything but jeans, and as she sat down she made a face.</p><p>\u201cPantyhose,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cStupid things cost me four bucks and feel like freaking sandpaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Jessica,\u201d Chloe said, her voice high and giggly. \u201cDon\u2019t you own any dresses from this decade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Jess told her, and Don\u2019s nephew raised his eyebrows. Chloe, hardly bothered, went back to her champagne and some long story she\u2019d been telling about herself.</p><p>\u201cJess,\u201d Lissa whispered, falling off my shoulder and onto hers, her head nudging Jess\u2019s ear, \u201cI\u2019m drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d Jess said flatly, pushing her back to me. \u201cGosh,\u201d she said brightly, \u201cI\u2019m so glad I came!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d I told her. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had some tuna fish at home,\u201d she said, squinting at the cen terpiece.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d I stood up, easing Lissa back against her own chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I was just on my way back to the table, plate of chicken and asparagus and pilaf in hand, when I heard the microphone up front crackle, a few guitar chords jangling behind it.</p><p>\u201cHi everyone,\u201d a voice said as I ducked between two tables, sidestepping a server clearing plates, \u201cwe\u2019re the G Flats, and we\u2019d like to wish Don and Barbara the best of happiness together!\u201d</p><p>As everyone applauded this, I stopped where I was standing, then turned my head. Don had insisted on handling the band, claiming he knew someone who owed him a favor. But now, I wished more than anything that I\u2019d just hired the local Motown group, even if they had played two of my mother\u2019s previous receptions.</p><p>Because of course it was Dexter, the musician boy, standing in front of the microphone in a black suit that looked a size too big. He said, \u201cWhat do you say, folks? Let\u2019s get this party going!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I said, as the band-a guitar player, someone on keyboards, and in the back, the red-haired Ringo I\u2019d met the day before-burst into a rousing rendition of \u201cGet Ready.\u201d They were all wearing thrift shop suits, Ringo in the same clip-on tie. But already people were crowding onto the dance floor, shuffling and shimmying, my mother and Don in the middle of it all, whooping it up.</p><p>I went back to the table and gave Jess her plate, then flopped down into my seat. Lissa, as I\u2019d expected, was now teary-eyed, dabbing at her face with a napkin while Jess patted her leg, mechanically. Chloe and the nephew were gone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBelieve what?\u201d Jess asked, picking up her fork. \u201cMan, this smells great. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThe band-\u201d I began, but that was as far as I got before Jennifer Anne appeared beside me, Chris in tow.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s asking for you,\u201d Chris said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be dancing,\u201d Jennifer Anne, queen of etiquette, informed me, gently nudging me out of my seat. \u201cThe rest of the wedding party is already up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d I said, looking at the dance floor, where of course my mother was now staring right at me, smiling beatifi cally and waggling her fingers in that come-here-now kind of way. So I grabbed Lissa up with one arm-damned if I was going out there alone-and dragged her with me, through the maze of tables, and into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like dancing,\u201d she sniffled.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cOh, Remy, Lissa!\u201d my mother shrieked as we came closer, reaching out her arms to pull us both in close. Her skin was warm, the fabric of her dress slippery and smooth as she brushed against me. \u201cIsn\u2019t this just so fun?\u201d</p> <p>We were right in the middle of the crowd, people dancing all around us. The band segued cleanly into \u201cShout,\u201d accompanied by a whoop from someone behind me. Don, who had been dipping my mother wildly, now grabbed my arm and spun me out, hurling me into a couple doing the bump. I almost felt my arm disconnect from my body before he yanked me back, gyrating his pelvis wildly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d Lissa said from behind me, having seen this. But then I was flying out again, this time in the opposite direction. Don danced with such vigor I feared for the rest of us. I kept trying to send him back to my mother, but she was distracted dancing with one of Don\u2019s little nephews.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d I hissed at Lissa as I whizzed past her, Don\u2019s hand still clamping my wrist. Then he pulled me close for a weird, jitterbug kind of hopping that made my teeth knock together, but not enough to distract me from seeing Chloe, who was standing off to the side of the dance floor, laughing hysterically.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great dancer!\u201d Don said, pulling me in close and dipping me wildly. I was sure my cleavage would bust out of my dress-the fittings, while many, had not quite done the trick-but then he pulled me back up, lickety-split, and I got a mean head rush. \u201cI love to dance,\u201d Don yelled at me, throwing me out into another spin. \u201cI don\u2019t get to do it enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do,\u201d I grumbled, as the song finally began to wind down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he said, cupping his hand over his ear.</p> <p>\u201cI said,\u201d I told him, \u201cthat you really can move.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, wiping his face. \u201cYou too,\u201d he said, as the band finished up with a crashing of cymbals. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I escaped as everyone was applauding, pushing my way to the bar, where my brother was standing nibbling on a piece of bread, alone for once.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cGod, it looked like some wild tribal ritual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, folks,\u201d I heard Dexter say from the stage as the lights dimmed a bit, \u201cfor your listening pleasure... a little slow song.\u201d</p><p>The opening strains of \u201cOur Love Is Here to Stay\u201d began, a bit clumsily, and people who\u2019d been avoiding the dance floor during the faster numbers started getting up from their chairs and pairing off. Jennifer Anne appeared next to me, smelling of hand soap, and slid her fingers over Chris\u2019s, dislodging the bread he was holding.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she murmured, tactfully dropping the bread onto a nearby table. Whatever I felt for her personally, I had to admire her technique. Nothing stopped this girl. \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Chris agreed, and wiped his mouth as he followed her, glancing back at me as they reached the floor. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cFine,\u201d I said. The room had grown quieter as the music did, people\u2019s voices more hushed as they moved together, cheek to cheek. Onstage, Dexter sang on while the keyboardist looked bored, glancing at his watch. I could relate.</p><p>What was it about slow dancing, anyway? Even in junior high I\u2019d hated the moment the music stalled, screeching to a halt so that someone could press their sweaty body to yours. At least with real dancing you weren\u2019t trapped, forced to rock back and forth with a total stranger who now, simply because of proximity, felt it was perfectly all right to grab your ass and anything else within reach. What a bunch of crap.</p><p>And it was crap. Totally. Because all slow dancing was really only about getting close to someone you wanted close or being forced to be close to someone you wished was far, far away. Okay, so my brother and Jennifer Anne looked totally smitten, and yeah, okay, the words to the song were nice and romantic. I mean, it wasn\u2019t a bad song or anything. It just wasn\u2019t my thing.</p><p>I grabbed a glass of champagne off a passing tray, taking a sip and wincing as the bubbles worked their way up my nose. I was fighting off a coughing fit when I felt someone come up beside me. I glanced over to see a girl who worked with Don-her name was Marty, or Patty, something with a middle t. She had long, permed hair, big bangs, and was wearing too much perfume. She smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cI love this song,\u201d she said, taking a sip of her drink and sighing. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI guess,\u201d I said as Dexter leaned into the microphone, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey look so happy,\u201d she went on, and I followed her gaze to my mother and Don, who were laughing and doing dips as the song wound down. She sniffled, and I realized she was near tears. How weird that weddings do that to some people. \u201cHe\u2019s really happy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201che is.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes, then waved her hand at me apologetically, shaking her head. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cforgive me. I just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, if only to save her from whatever she was about to say. I\u2019d had all the sentimental stuff I could handle for one day.</p><p>Finally the last verse came to an end. Marty/Patty took a deep breath, blinking as the lights came up again. Under closer scrutiny I could see she was actually crying: red eyes, face red, the whole deal. Her mascara, which I could not help but notice was applied a bit too plentifully, was beginning to streak.</p><p>\u201cI should...\u201d she said shakily, touching her face. \u201cI need to freshen up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood to see you,\u201d I told her, the same way I\u2019d told everyone who I was forced to talk to all night long, in the same cheery hey wedding-ho! voice.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she said, with less enthusiasm, and then she was gone, bumping against a chair on her way out.</p><p>Enough, I thought. I need a break.</p><p>I walked past the cake table and out a side door to the parking lot, where a couple of guys in waiter\u2019s jackets were smoking cigarettes and picking at some leftover cheese puffs.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said to them, \u201ccan I bum one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The taller guy, whose hair was kind of model-poofy, shook a cigarette out of his pack, handing it to me. He pulled out a lighter and held it for me as I leaned into it, taking a few puffs. He lowered his voice and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d I said, pulling back from him. \u201cThanks.\u201d I eased away around the corner, even as he was calling after me, finding a spot by the Dumpsters on the wall. I kicked off my shoes, then looked down at the cigarette in my hand. I\u2019d done so well: eighteen days. It didn\u2019t even taste that good, really. Just a weak crutch on a bad night. So I tossed it down, watching it smolder, and leaned back on my palms, stretching out my back.</p><p>Inside, the band stopped playing, to scattered applause. Then the canned hotel music came on, and a few seconds later a door farther down the wall banged open and out came the G Flats, their voices loud.</p><p>\u201cThis is of the suck, \u201d the guitar player said, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shaking one out. \u201cAfter this, no more weddings. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s money,\u201d Ringo the drummer said, taking a sip of a bottled water he was holding.</p><p>\u201cNot this one,\u201d the keyboard guy muttered. \u201cThis is a gimme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dexter said, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThis is the bail money. Or have we all forgotten that? We owed Don, remember?\u201d</p><p>There was a grumbling acquiescence, followed by silence. \u201cI hate doing covers,\u201d the guitarist said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do our own stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this crowd?\u201d Dexter said. \u201cBe serious. I don\u2019t think Uncle Miltie from Saginaw wants to dance to your various versions of \u2018The Potato Song.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not called that,\u201d Ted snapped. \u201cAnd you know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSettle,\u201d the redheaded drummer said, waving his arm in a peacemaking gesture I recognized. \u201cIt\u2019s only a couple more hours, okay? Let\u2019s just make the best of it. At least we get to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get to eat?\u201d the keyboardist said, perking up. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Don said,\u201d the drummer replied. \u201cIf there\u2019s enough left over. How much longer of a break do we have?\u201d</p><p>Dexter glanced at his watch. \u201cTen minutes.\u201d</p><p>The keyboardist looked at the drummer, then the guitarist. \u201cI say food. Food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood,\u201d they replied in unison. The keyboardist said, \u201cYou in, Dexter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just nab me some bread or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Gandhi,\u201d Ringo said, and somebody snorted. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in there.\u201d</p> <p>The guitarist tossed down his cigarette, Ringo threw his water bottle toward the Dumpster-and missed-and then they went inside, the door slamming shut behind them.</p><p>I sat there, watching him, knowing for once he couldn\u2019t see me first. He wasn\u2019t smoking, instead just sitting there on the wall, drumming his fingers. I\u2019d always been a sucker for dark-headed boys, and from a distance his suit didn\u2019t look so tacky: he was almost cute. And tall. Tall was good.</p><p>I stood up and brushed my hands through my hair. Okay, so maybe he was really annoying. And I hated the way he\u2019d bumped me against the wall. But I was here now, and it seemed only fitting that I take a few steps toward him, show myself, if only to throw him off a bit.</p><p>I was about to come around the Dumpster and into full sight when the door opened again and two girls-daughters of some cousin of Don\u2019s-came out. They were younger than me, by a couple of years, and lived in Ohio.</p><p>\u201cI told you he\u2019d be out here!\u201d one of them, the blond, said to the other. Then they both giggled. The taller one was hanging back, hand on the door, but her sister walked right up, plopping down beside Dexter. \u201cWe were looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Dexter said, and smiled politely. \u201cWell, hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello yourself,\u201d the blond said, and I made a face, in the dark. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d</p><p>Dexter patted his pockets. \u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d the blond said, hitting him in the leg. \u201cI thought all guys in bands smoked.\u201d The taller girl, still by the door, glanced back behind her, her face nervous. \u201cI smoke,\u201d the blond said, \u201cbut my mother would kill me if she knew. Kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Dexter replied, as if this was actually interesting.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d the blond said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cMeghan!\u201d her sister hissed. \u201cGod!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking,\u201d Meghan said, sliding a little closer to Dexter. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dexter said, \u201cactually...\u201d</p><p>And at that, I turned around and headed back the way I\u2019d come, already pissed at myself. I\u2019d come close to doing something really stupid-way lowering my standards, which judging by Jonathan were rock bottom already. This was the way the old me worked, living just for the next second, hour, wanting only to have a boy want me for a night, no more. I\u2019d changed. I\u2019d quit that, along with smoking-okay, with one lapse-and drinking-for the most part. But the sleeping around thing, that I\u2019d held true to. Completely. And I\u2019d been ready to throw it away, or at least bend it a bit, for a Frank Sinatra wanna-be who would have easily settled for Meghan from Ohio. God.</p><p>Back inside, the cake was out on the dance floor, with my mother and Don posing beside it, their hands intertwined over the cake knife as the photographer moved all around them, flash popping. I stood on the edge of the crowd, watching as Don fed my mother a piece, carefully easing it into her mouth. Another flash popped, capturing the moment. Ah, love.</p><p>The rest of the night went pretty much as I expected. My mother and Don left in a shower of birdseed and bubbles (with much of the hotel cleaning staff standing by looking hostile), Chloe ended up making out with Don\u2019s nephew in the lobby, and Jess and I got stuck in the bathroom, holding Lissa\u2019s head while she alternately puked up her fifteen-dollar-a-head dinner and moaned about Adam. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you just love weddings?\u201d Jess asked me, passing over another wad of wet paper towels, which I pressed against Lissa\u2019s forehead as she stood up.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Lissa wailed, missing the sarcasm. She patted the towels to her face. \u201cI really, really, do.\u201d</p><p>Jess rolled her eyes at me, but I just shook my head as I led Lissa out of the stall and to the sinks. She looked in the mirror at herself-smeared makeup, hair wild and curly, dress with a questionable brown stain on the sleeve-and sniffled. \u201cThis has to be the worst time of my life,\u201d she moaned, blinking at herself.</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d I told her, taking her hand, \u201cyou\u2019ll feel better tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Jess said, getting the door. \u201cTomorrow, you\u2019ll have a wicked hangover and feel even worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut the next day,\u201d she went on, patting Lissa\u2019s shoulder, \u201cthe next day you\u2019ll feel much better. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>So we were a bedraggled bunch as we made our way out into the lobby, with Lissa held up between us. It was one in the morning, my hair was flat, and my feet hurt. The end of a wedding reception is always so goddamn depressing, I thought to myself. And only the bride and groom are spared, jetting off into the sunset while the rest of us wake up the next morning to just another day.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chloe?\u201d I asked Jess as we struggled through the revolving doors. Lissa was already falling asleep, even as her feet were moving.</p> <p>\u201cNo idea. Last I saw her she was all over what\u2019s-his-bucket back there by the piano.\u201d</p><p>I glanced behind me into the lobby, but no Chloe. She always seemed to be elsewhere when anyone else was puking. It was like she had a sixth sense or something.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a big girl,\u201d Jess told me. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>We were hoisting Lissa into Jess\u2019s front seat when there was a rattling noise, and the white van I now recognized as belonging to Dexter\u2019s band pulled up in front of the hotel. The back doors popped open and out jumped Ringo, now without the clip-on tie, with the guitarist hopping out from the driver\u2019s seat and following him. Then they disappeared inside, leaving the engine running.</p><p>\u201cYou need a ride?\u201d Jess asked me.</p><p>\u201cNope. Chris is in there waiting for me.\u201d I shut the door, closing Lissa in. \u201cThanks for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She pulled her keys out of her pocket, jangling them. \u201cIt went okay, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>As she drove off, beeping the horn once, I started back to the hotel to find my brother. When I passed the white van, Ringo and the keyboardist were coming back out, hauling equipment and bickering.</p><p>\u201cTed never helps,\u201d the keyboardist said, hoisting some big speaker into the back of the van, where it landed with a crash. \u201cThis vanishing act is getting old, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here,\u201d Ringo replied. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dexter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey get five minutes,\u201d the keyboardist said. \u201cThen they can walk.\u201d Then he reached in the open driver\u2019s-side window and planted his palm on the horn, letting it blare out, loud, for a good five seconds.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Ringo said sarcastically. \u201c That\u2019ll go over well.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later the guitarist-the elusive Ted-came out the revolving doors, looking irritated.</p> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d he yelled, coming around the van. \u201cReal classy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in or walk home,\u201d the keyboardist snapped. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>Ted got in, the horn sounded one more time, and then they waited. No Dexter. Finally, after what seemed like a bit of bickering from the front seats, the van chugged away, taking a right onto the main road. The turn signal, of course, was busted.</p><p>Back in the hotel, the cleaning crew was at work on the reception hall, clearing glasses and pulling off tablecloths. My mother\u2019s bouquet-eighty bucks of flowers-sat abandoned on a tray table, still as fresh as when she\u2019d first picked it up at the church over nine hours earlier.</p><p>\u201cThey left you,\u201d I heard someone say. I turned around. Dexter. God help me. He was sitting at a table next to the ice sculpture-two swans intertwined and quickly melting-a plate in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWho did?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cChris and Jennifer Anne,\u201d he replied, as if he\u2019d known them forever. Then he picked up a fork, taking a bite of whatever he was having. It looked like wedding cake, from where I was.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cThey left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were tired.\u201d He chewed for a second, then swallowed. \u201cJennifer Anne said she had to go because she had an early seminar tomorrow at the convention center. Something about achievement. She\u2019s very bright, that girl. She thinks I might have a future in the corporate and private leisure activity sector. Whatever that means.\u201d</p><p>I just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he went on, \u201cI said it was fine, because when you showed up we\u2019d just give you a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cMe and the guys.\u201d</p><p>I considered this. And I\u2019d been so close to being scot-free, home by now care of Jess. Great. \u201cThey\u2019re gone too,\u201d I said finally.</p><p>He looked up, his fork midway to his mouth. \u201cThey what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey left,\u201d I repeated slowly. \u201cThey beeped the horn first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, I thought I heard the horn,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cTypical.\u201d</p><p>I looked around the mostly empty room, as if a solution to this and all my other problems might be lurking behind, say, a potted plant. No luck. So I did what seemed, by now, inevitable. I walked over to the table where he was sitting, pulled out a chair, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, with a smile. \u201cFinally, she comes around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited,\u201d I said, dropping my bag onto the table. I felt tired in every part of my body, as if I\u2019d been stretched thin. \u201cI\u2019m just getting the energy up to call a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try some of this cake first.\u201d He pushed the plate at me. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good. It doesn\u2019t taste chalky at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably didn\u2019t even get any, right?\u201d He wiggled the fork at me. \u201cJust try it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d He poked at it with the fork, gently. \u201cSo tasty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said finally, \u201care really pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as if he\u2019d heard this before, then pulled the plate back toward himself, dipping the fork in for another bite. The cleaning crew was chattering away in the front of the room, stacking chairs. One woman with her hair in a long braid picked up my mother\u2019s bouquet, cradling it in her arms.</p><p>\u201cDa-da-da-dum,\u201d she said, and laughed when one of her coworkers yelled at her to stop dreaming and get back to work.</p><p>Dexter put down the fork, the tasty, non-chalklike cake gone, and pushed the plate away. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, looking at me, \u201cthis your mom\u2019s first remarriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourth,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s made a career of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot you beat,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy mom\u2019s on her fifth.\u201d</p><p>I had to admit, I was impressed. So far I\u2019d never met anyone with more ex-steps than me. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut you know,\u201d he said sarcastically, \u201cI really think this one\u2019s going to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cEspecially in my mom\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter, honey,\u201d someone called out from behind me, \u201cdid you get enough to eat?\u201d</p> <p>He sat up, then raised his voice and said, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I sure did. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bit more of this chicken dish left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Linda. I\u2019m full. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cDo you know everybody? \u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI just bond easily. It\u2019s part of the whole repeating-stepfather thing. It makes you more mellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you have to just go with the flow. Your life is not your own, with people coming in and out all the time. You get mellow because you have to. I mean, you know exactly what I\u2019m saying, I bet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I said flatly, \u201cI am just so easygoing. That is precisely the word that describes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d And then I stood up and got my bag, feeling my feet ache as they settled into my shoes. \u201cI have to go home now.\u201d</p><p>He got to his feet, taking his jacket off the back of the chair. \u201cShare a cab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>I walked to the door, thinking he\u2019d be behind me, but when I glanced back he was across the room, going out the other way. I had to admit I was surprised, after such intense pursuit, that he had given up already. The drummer had been right, I supposed. The conquest-getting me alone-was all that mattered, and once he saw me up close I wasn\u2019t so special after all. But I, of course, knew that already.</p><p>There was a cab parked out front, the driver dozing. I climbed into the backseat, sliding off my shoes. It was, by the green numbers on the dashboard, exactly 2 A.M. At the Thunderbird Hotel across town, my mother was most likely fast asleep, dreaming of the next week she\u2019d spend in St. Bart\u2019s. She\u2019d come home to finish her novel, to move her new husband into the house, to take another stab at being a Mrs. Somebody, sure that this time, indeed, it would be different.</p><p>As the cab turned onto the main road, I saw a glint of something through the park, over to my right. It was Dexter, on foot, turning into a neighborhood, and in his white shirt he stood out, almost as if he were glowing. He was walking down the middle of the street, the houses dark on either side of him, quiet in sleep. And watching him head home, for a second it was like he was the only one awake or even alive in all the world right then, except for me.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cRemy, really. He\u2019s just wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLola, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. I do. But this is different. I wouldn\u2019t do you like that. Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>I put down the stack of checks I\u2019d been counting and looked up at her. She was leaning on her elbow, chin cupped in her hand. One of her earrings, a huge gold hoop, was swinging back and forth, catching the sunlight streaming through the front window.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do blind dates,\u201d I told her, again.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t blind, honey, I know him,\u201d she explained, as if this made some kind of difference. \u201cA nice boy. He\u2019s got great hands too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>She held up her hands-impeccably manicured, naturally-as if I needed a visual aid for this basic part of human anatomy. \u201cHands. I noticed it the other day, when he came to pick his mother up from her sea salt scrub. Beautiful hands. He\u2019s bilingual.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, trying to process the connection between these two characteristics. Nope. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cLola?\u201d a voice called out tentatively from inside the salon, \u201cmy scalp is burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the dye working, sugar,\u201d Lola called back, not even turning her head. \u201cAnyway, Remy, I really talked you up. And since his mother is coming back this afternoon for her pedicure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d I told her, going back to the checks, \u201cis perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLola?\u201d Now the voice sounded more nervous, less polite. \u201cIt\u2019s really hurting...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to find love, Remy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you, girl! You\u2019re about to make a big mistake.\u201d Lola always got loud when she felt passionate about something: now, her voice was booming around the small waiting room, rattling the sample nail polishes on the shelf above my head. A few more active vowels and I\u2019d be concussed, and as quick to sue as the woman whose hair was burning off, ignored, in the next room.</p><p>\u201cLola!\u201d The woman, now shrieking, sounded like she was on the verge of tears. \u201cI think I smell burning hair-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Lola bellowed, angry at both of us, and whirled around, stomping out of the room. As a purple nail polish crashed onto my desk, missing me by inches, I sighed, flipping open the calendar. It was Monday. My mother and Don would be back from St. Bart\u2019s in three days. I turned another page, running my finger down past the days, to count again how many weeks I had before I left for school. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stanford. Three thousand miles away from here, almost a direct shot across the country. An incredible school, my top choice, and I\u2019d been accepted by five out of the six others I\u2019d chosen to apply to. All my hard work, AP classes, honors seminars. Finally it meant something.</p><p>Freshman year, when such decisions are made, my teachers had me pegged for the state party school, if I was lucky-someplace where I could do an easy major, like psych, with a minor in frat parties and makeup. As if just because I was, okay, blond and somewhat attractive with an active social life (and, okay, not the best of reputations) and didn\u2019t do the student council/debate team/cheerleader thing, I was destined for the sub-par. Grouped with the burnouts and the barely graduating, where just making it down from the parking lot after lunch was far exceeding expectations.</p><p>But I\u2019d proved them wrong. I used my own money to pay for a tutor in physics, the class that almost killed me, as well as a prep class for the SAT, which I took three times. I was the only one of my friends in AP classes except for Lissa, who as the daughter of two Ph.D.\u2019s had always been expected to be brilliant. But I always worked harder when I was up against something, or when someone assumed I couldn\u2019t succeed. That\u2019s what drove me, all those nights studying. The fact that so many figured I couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>I was the only one from our graduating class going to Stanford. Which meant I could begin my life again, fresh and new, so far from home. All the money I had left from my salon paycheck after my car payment I\u2019d stuck in my savings account, to cover the dorm fees and books and living expenses. The tuition I\u2019d gotten out of my part of the trust left to me and Chris in our father\u2019s estate. It had been set aside, by some lawyer who I wished I could thank personally, until we were twenty-five or for school, which meant that even during the lean times my mother couldn\u2019t touch it. It also meant that no matter how she burned through her own money, my four years in college were safe. And all because each time \u201cThis Lullaby\u201d (written by Thomas Custer, all rights reserved) played in the background of a commercial, or on lite radio, or was performed by some lounge singer in Vegas, it bought me another day of my future.</p> <p>The chimes over the door sounded and the UPS man came in, carrying a box, which he put down on the desk in front of me. \u201cPackage for you, Remy,\u201d he said, whipping out his clipboard.</p><p>I signed on the screen, then took the box. \u201cThanks, Jacob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and this too,\u201d he said, handing me an envelope. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. The envelope wasn\u2019t stamped-weird-or sealed. I opened the flap and reached in, pulling out a stack of three pictures. They were all of the same couple, both in their seventies, probably, posing in some seaside setting. The man had on a baseball hat and a T-shirt that read WILL GOLF FOR FOOD. The woman had a camera strapped to her belt and was wearing sensible shoes. They had their arms around each other and looked wildly happy: in the first picture they were smiling, the next laughing, the third kissing, sweetly, their lips barely touching. Like any couple you\u2019d see on vacation who would ask you to take a picture, please, of the two of us.</p><p>Which was all fine and dandy, except who the hell were they? And what was this supposed to mean, anyway? I stood up, looking outside for the UPS truck, but it was already gone. Was I supposed to know these people, or something? I glanced back at the pictures, but the couple just grinned back at me, caught in their tropical moment, offering no explanation.</p> <p>\u201cRemy, honey, get me some cold water, would you?\u201d Lola yelled from the other room, and I could tell by her voice-cheerful but loud -she meant do it now, stat. \u201cAnd some of that Neosporin from the cabinet beneath the cash drawer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d I yelled back just as cheerfully, shoving the pictures into my purse.</p><p>I yanked the Neosporin out of the cabinet, adding some gauze and a few bandages, which from previous experiences, I thought we might need. Hair emergencies happened all the time, and the truth was, you just knew to be prepared.</p><p>Three hours later, when the drama had finally subsided and Lola\u2019s customer had left with a bandaged scalp, a hefty gift certificate, and a written promise of eyebrow waxing for life, I finally got to lock the cash drawer, get my purse, and walk outside.</p><p>It finally felt like summer. Heavy heat, totally humid, and everything just smelled kind of smoky and thick, as if close to boiling. Lola kept the salon ice cold, so walking outside was like leaving an arctic freeze. I always got goose bumps as I walked to my car.</p><p>I got in, cranked the engine, and turned the AC on full blast to get it going. Then I picked up my cell phone and checked my messages. One from Chloe, asking what we were doing tonight. One from Lissa saying she was fine, just fine, but sounding all sniffly, which she knew I was getting sick of by now. And lastly my brother, Chris, reminding me that Jennifer Anne was cooking us dinner tonight, six sharp, don\u2019t be late.</p> <p>I deleted this last message with an angry jab of my finger. I was never late. And he knew it. Further evidence of brainwash ing by Jennifer Anne, who, unlike my brother, knew me not at all. I mean, I was the one who got him up each morning when he started for that Jiffy Lube job, otherwise, he would have slept through all three of his alarms, which he had set in various positions around the room, all requiring him to get up out of the bed to hit the snooze button. I made sure he wasn\u2019t late, didn\u2019t get fired, was out the door by 8:35 at the latest, in case he hit traffic down main street, which he always-</p><p>I was interrupted, suddenly, by a thwacking sound as something hit my windshield. Not hard: more like a slap. I looked up, heart jumping, and saw yet another snapshot of the old vacationing couple. Same WILL GOLF FOR FOOD T-shirt, same crinkly smiles. Now staring down at me, pressed against the glass, held there by someone\u2019s hand.</p><p>And I knew. It was ridiculous I hadn\u2019t figured it out earlier.</p><p>I hit the button for my window and it went down. Standing there, right by my side mirror, was Dexter. He took his hand off the windshield and the picture slid down the glass, lodging itself under one of my wipers.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d he said. He was wearing a white T-shirt under a uniform I recognized: polyester shirt, green with black piping. Right over the front pocket was neatly stitched FLASH CAMERA, the name of the one-hour photo place directly across the street from the salon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalking me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like the pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Golf for Food? How stupid is that?\u201d I said, putting my car in reverse. \u201cIs it supposed to mean something?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo musicians, no golfers,\u201d he said, ticking these off on his fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s left? Lion tamers? Accountants?\u201d</p><p>I just looked at him, then put my foot on the gas. He had to jump out of the way to avoid my tire flattening his foot.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, putting his hand on my open window, \u201cin all seriousness. Can you give me a ride?\u201d I must have looked skeptical, because he added quickly, \u201cWe have a band meeting in fifteen minutes. And we instituted this new policy, so the repercussions for being late are brutal. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late too,\u201d I said, which was a lie, but I wasn\u2019t a freaking taxi service.</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He squatted down, so we were eye to eye. Then he lifted up his other hand, exposing a grease-stained bag from Double Burger. \u201cI\u2019ll share my fries with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I said, hitting the button to put up my window. \u201cBesides, I have a no-food policy in my car. Repercussions are brutal.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at this, stopping the window with his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll behave,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d And then, he started around the front of the car, as if I had said yes, grabbing the picture off my windshield and tucking it into his back pocket. The next thing I knew he was sliding in beside me, settling into the seat, the door swinging shut behind him.</p><p>What was it about this guy? Resistance was futile. Or maybe I was just too tired and hot to pursue another argument.</p><p>\u201cOne ride,\u201d I told him in my stern voice. \u201cThat\u2019s it. And if you get even a speck of food in this car you\u2019re out. And I won\u2019t slow down to do it, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d he said, reaching for his seat belt, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to coddle me, really. Be blunt. Don\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>I ignored this as I pulled out of the shopping center and onto the road. We weren\u2019t half a block when I caught him sneaking a French fry. He thought he was being slick, cupping it in his hand and faking a yawn, but I was a pro at this. Lissa was always testing my limits.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say about food?\u201d I said, hitting the brake for a red light.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hmphrgy,\u201d he mumbled, then swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. No food in the car, period. I\u2019m trying to keep it nice.\u201d</p><p>He turned around, glancing at the backseat, then at the dashboard and floor mats. \u201cNice?\u201d he said. \u201cThis thing is like a museum. It still smells new.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I said as the light changed.</p><p>\u201cTake this left here.\u201d He pointed, and I changed lanes, glancing behind me. \u201cI bet you\u2019re a real control freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, I can tell.\u201d He ran a finger across the dash, then glanced at it. \u201cNo dust,\u201d he reported. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve cleaned this windshield from the inside, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d he hooted. \u201cI bet it would drive you crazy if something was out of place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d He reached into the bag, carefully withdrawing a French fry. It was long and rubbery looking, bending as he held it between two fingers. \u201cIn the interest of science,\u201d he said, waving it at me, \u201ca little experiment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo food in the car,\u201d I repeated, like a mantra. God, how far away was his house? We were back over near the hotel where we\u2019d had the reception, so it had to be close.</p><p>\u201cLeft here,\u201d he said, and I hooked us onto the street, scaring a couple of squirrels into the trees. When I next glanced over at him, his hands were empty and the French fry, now straightened, was lying on the gearshift console. \u201cNow, don\u2019t panic,\u201d he said, putting his hand on my arm. \u201cBreathe. And just appreciate, for a minute, the freedom in this chaos.\u201d</p><p>I moved my arm out from under his hand. \u201cWhich house is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not messy at all, see? It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s nature in all its simplicity...\u201d</p><p>Then I saw it: the white van, parked crookedly in the front yard of a little yellow house about a hundred feet up. The porch light was on, even though it was broad daylight, and I could see the redheaded drummer, Ringo, coffee shop employee, sitting on the front steps with a dog beside him. He was reading a newspaper; the dog was just panting, its tongue out.</p><p>\u201c... the natural state of things, which is, in fact, utter imperfection,\u201d he finished as we jerked into the driveway, spraying gravel. The French fry slid off the console, leaving a grease trail like a slug, and landed in my lap. \u201cWhoops,\u201d he said, grabbing it. \u201cNow, see? That was a first, good step in conquering-\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, then moved my hand, hitting the automatic lock: click, and the button on his door shot up.</p><p>\u201c-your problem,\u201d he finished. He opened the door and got out, taking his bag o\u2019 grease with him. Then he bent down, poking his head back in quickly, so that we were almost face-to-face. \u201cThanks for the ride. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. He didn\u2019t move for a second, which threw me off: just us, there together, eye to eye. Then he blinked and pulled away, ducking out of the car and shutting the door. I watched as the dog on the porch suddenly got up and made its way down the steps, tail wagging wildly, when it saw Dexter coming. Meanwhile, I was noticing that my car now stank of grease, another bonus. I put down the window, hoping the air freshener hanging from my rearview was up to the job.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d the drummer said, folding his newspaper. I put the car in reverse, then made sure Dexter\u2019s back was still turned before brushing my finger over the gearshift console, checking for grease. My dirty little secret.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not six yet,\u201d Dexter said, reaching down to pet the dog, who was now circling him, tail thwacking against the back of his legs. He had a white muzzle and moved kind of creakily, in that old-dog way.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t have my key,\u201d the drummer said, standing up.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Dexter told him. I started to back out then had to stop to let a bunch of cars pass. \u201cWhat about the back door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocked. Plus you know Ted moved that bookcase in front of it last night.\u201d</p><p>Dexter stuck his hands in his pockets, pulling them out. Nothing. \u201cWell, I guess we just have to break a window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the drummer said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Dexter said in that offhand way I already recognized. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick a small one. Then you can wriggle through it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo way,\u201d the drummer said, crossing his arms over his chest as Dexter started up the stairs, moving to check out the windows on the front side of the house. \u201cWhy do I always have to do the stupid shit, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a redhead,\u201d Dexter told him, and the drummer made a face, \u201cplus, you have slim hips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>By now I wasn\u2019t even waiting for a gap in traffic anymore. Instead I was watching as Dexter found a rock around the side of the house, then came back and squatted down in front of a small window on the far end of the porch. He studied it, then the rock, readying his technique while the dog sat down beside him, licking his ear. The drummer stood behind, still looking miffed, his hands in his pockets.</p> <p>Call it rampant control issues, but I couldn\u2019t stand to watch this. Which was why I found myself pulling back up the driveway, getting out of my car, and walking up the steps just as Dexter was pulling his arm back, rock in hand, to break the window.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d he was saying, \u201ctwo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I called out, and he stopped, the rock tumbling from his hand and landing on the porch with a thunk. The dog jumped back, startled, with a yelp.</p><p>\u201cI thought you left,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t do it, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a credit card?\u201d I asked him.</p> <p>He and the drummer exchanged looks. Then Dexter said, \u201cDo I look like I have a credit card? And what, exactly, do you need purchased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to unlock the door, idiot,\u201d I told him, reaching into my own pocket. But my wallet was in the backseat, buried in my purse.</p><p>\u201cI have one,\u201d the drummer said slowly, \u201cbut I\u2019m only supposed to use it for emergencies.\u201d</p><p>We looked at him, and then Dexter reached up and smacked him on the back of the head, Three Stooges style. \u201cJohn Miller, you\u2019re a moron. Just give it to her.\u201d</p><p>John Miller-his real name, although to me he was still somehow Ringo-handed over a Visa. I opened the screen door, then took the card and slid it between the lock and the doorjamb, wiggling it around. I could feel them behind me, watching.</p><p>Every door is different, and the weight of the lock and the thickness of the card are all factors. This skill, like the perfect toss of an Extra Large Diet Zip, was acquired over time, with lots of practice. Never to break and enter, always just to get into my own house, or Jess\u2019s, when keys were lost. My brother, who had used it for evil at times, had taught me this when I was fourteen.</p> <p>A few pulls to the left, then the right, and I felt the lock give. Bingo. We were in. I handed John Miller back his card.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d he said, smiling at me in that way guys do when you surprise them. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with me,\u201d Dexter explained, and I just sighed at this and walked off the porch, the dog now trailing along behind me. I bent down and petted him, scratching his ears. He had cloudy white eyes, and horrible breath, but I\u2019d always had a soft spot for dogs. My mother, of course, was a cat person. The only pets I\u2019d ever had were a long line of big, fluffy Himalayans with various health problems and nasty temperaments who loved my mother and left hair everywhere.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Monkey,\u201d Dexter called. \u201cHim and me, we\u2019re a package deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad for Monkey,\u201d I replied, and stood up, walking to my car.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad ass, Miss Remy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re intrigued now. You\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer this, instead just stood there, leaning against a porch post as I pulled out of the driveway. Monkey was sitting next to him, and together they watched me drive away.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Chris opened the door to Jennifer Anne\u2019s apartment. He was wearing a tie.</p><p>\u201cLate,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>I glanced at my watch. It was 6:03, which, according to Chloe and Lissa and everyone else who had always made me wait, meant I was well within the bounds of the official within-five-minutes-doesn\u2019t-count-as-late rule. But something told me maybe I shouldn\u2019t point this out just now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d Chris called out over his shoulder, then shot me the stink eye as I walked in, shutting the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right out,\u201d Jennifer Anne replied, her voice light. \u201cOffer her something to drink, would you, Christopher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Chris started into the living room. As we walked, our shoes made swishy noises on the carpet. It was the first time I\u2019d been to Jennifer Anne\u2019s, but I wasn\u2019t surprised by the decor. The sofa and the love seat were both a little threadbare and matched the border of the wallpaper. Her diploma from the community college hung on the wall in a thick gold frame. And the coffee table was piled with thick, pretty books about Provence, Paris, and Venice, places I knew she\u2019d never been, arranged with great care to look as though they were stacked casually.</p><p>I sat down on the couch, and Chris brought me a ginger ale, which he knew I hated but thought I deserved. Then we sat down, him on the couch, me on the love seat. Across from us, over the fake fireplace, a clock was ticking.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize this was a formal occasion,\u201d I said, nodding at his tie.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he replied.</p><p>I glanced down at myself: I had on jeans, a white T-shirt, with a sweater tied around my waist. I looked fine, and he knew it. There was a clang from the kitchen, which sounded like an oven closing, and then the door swung open and Jennifer Anne emerged, smoothing her skirt with her hands.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d she said, coming over and bending down to kiss my cheek. This was new. It was all I could do not to pull back, if only from surprise, but I stayed put, not wanting another dirty look from my brother. Jennifer Anne settled down beside him on the couch, crossing her legs. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could join us. Brie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie,\u201d she repeated, lifting a small glass tray from the end table and extending it toward me. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft cheese, from France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said. I just hadn\u2019t heard her, but now she looked very pleased with herself, as if she actually thought she\u2019d brought some foreign culture into my life. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>We were not given the opportunity to see if the conversation would progress naturally. Jennifer Anne clearly had a list of talking points she had culled from the newspaper or CNN she believed would allow us to converse on a level she deemed acceptable. This had to be a business tactic she\u2019d picked up from one of her self-improvement books, none of which, I noticed, were shelved in the living room on public display. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, after we\u2019d all had a cracker or two, \u201cwhat do you think about what\u2019s happening with the elections in Europe, Remy?\u201d</p><p>I was taking a sip of my ginger ale, and glad of it. But finally I had to reply. I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been following the news lately, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d she told me. \u201cChristopher and I were just discussing how the outcome could affect our global economy, weren\u2019t we, honey?\u201d</p><p>My brother swallowed the cracker he\u2019d been eating, cleared his throat, and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>And so it went. In the next fifteen minutes, we had equally fascinating discussions about genetic engineering, global warming, the possibility of books being completely obsolete in a few years because of computers, and the arrival at the local zoo of a new family of exotic, nearly extinct Australian birds. By the time we finally sat down for dinner, I was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cGreat chicken, sweetheart,\u201d my brother said as we all dug into our plates. Jennifer Anne had prepared some complicated-looking recipe involving chicken breasts stuffed with sweet potatoes topped with a vegetable glaze. They looked perfect, but it was the kind of dish where you just knew someone had to have been pawing at your food for a long while to get it just right, their fingers all in what now you were having to stick in your mouth.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jennifer replied, reaching over to pat his hand. \u201cMore rice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Chris smiled at her as she dished food onto his plate, and I realized, not for the first time, that I hardly recognized my brother anymore. He was sitting there as if this was the life he was used to, as if all he\u2019d ever known was wearing a tie to dinner and having someone fix him exotic meals on what clearly were the good plates. But I knew differently. We\u2019d shared the same childhood, were raised by the same woman, whose idea of a home-cooked meal involved Kraft dinner, Pillsbury biscuits, and a pea-and-carrot combo from a can. My mother couldn\u2019t even make toast without setting off the smoke detector. It was amazing we\u2019d even made it past grade school without getting scurvy. But you wouldn\u2019t know that now. The transformation of Chris, my stoner brother with a police record, to Christopher, man of culture, ironing, and established career of lubrication specialist was almost complete. There were only a few more kinks to work out, like the lizards. And me.</p><p>\u201cSo your mother and Don get back Friday, correct?\u201d Jennifer Anne asked me.</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said, nodding. And maybe it was those meticulously made chicken rolls, or the fakeness of the entire evening thus far, but something suddenly kicked up my evil side. I turned to Chris and said, \u201cSo we haven\u2019t done it yet, you know.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me, his mouth full of rice. Then he swallowed and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wager.\u201d I waited for him to catch up, but either he didn\u2019t or was pretending not to.</p><p>\u201cWhat wager?\u201d Jennifer Anne asked, gamely allowing this divergence from her scripted dinner conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Chris mumbled. He was trying to kick me under the table, but hit a leg instead, rattling Jennifer Anne\u2019s butter dish.</p><p>\u201cYears ago,\u201d I said to Jennifer Anne, as he took another swipe, barely nicking the sole of my shoe, \u201cwhen my mother married for the second time, Chris and I started a tradition of laying bets on how long it would last.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis bread is just great,\u201d Chris said quickly to Jennifer Anne. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris was ten, and I must have been six or so,\u201d I continued. \u201cThis was when she married Harold, the professor? The day they left for the honeymoon, we each sat down with a pad of paper and calculated how long we thought they\u2019d stay together. And then, we folded up our guesses and sealed them in an envelope, which I kept in my closet until the day my mother sat us down to tell us Harold was moving out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Chris said in a low voice, \u201cthis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just mad,\u201d I told her, \u201cbecause he\u2019s never won yet. I always do. Because it\u2019s like blackjack: you can\u2019t go over. Whoever comes closest to the actual day wins. And we\u2019ve had to really be specific about the rules over the years. Like it\u2019s the day she tells us it\u2019s over, not the official separation day. We had to establish that because when she and Martin split Chris tried to cheat.\u201d</p><p>Now, Chris was just glaring at me. Sore loser.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think,\u201d Jennifer Anne said, her voice high, \u201cthat is just horrible. Just horrible. \u201d She put down her fork carefully and pressed her napkin to her lips, closing her eyes. \u201cWhat an awful way to look at a marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d Chris said quickly, putting his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d I said, shrugging, \u201cit\u2019s like a family tradition.\u201d</p> <p>Jennifer Anne pushed out her chair and picked up the chicken dish. \u201cI just think that your mother deserves better,\u201d she snapped, \u201cthan for you to have so little faith in her.\u201d And then she walked into the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind her.</p><p>Chris was across the table at me so quickly I didn\u2019t even have time to put down my fork: he almost pierced his own eyeball. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he hissed at me. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you, Remy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, Christopher, \u201d I said. \u201cSuch language. You better not let her hear you, she\u2019ll make you stay after school and write a report on those Australian blue-footed boobies.\u201d</p><p>He sat back down in his chair, getting out of my face at least. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, spitting out the words, \u201cI can\u2019t help it if you\u2019re a bitter, angry bitch. But I love Jennifer Anne and I won\u2019t let you play your little games with her. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he snapped. \u201cBecause dammit, Remy, you make it really hard to love you sometimes. You know that? You really do.\u201d And then he pushed out his chair, threw his napkin down, and pushed through the door into the kitchen.</p><p>I sat there. I honestly felt like I\u2019d been slapped: my face even felt red and hot. I\u2019d just been messing around with him, and God, he\u2019d just freaked. All these years Chris was the only one who\u2019d ever shared my sick, cynical view on love. We\u2019d always told each other how we\u2019d never get married, no way, shoot me if I do it. But now, he\u2019d turned his back on everything. What a chump.</p><p>I could hear them in the kitchen, her voice quiet and tremulous, his soothing. On my plate my food was cold, just like my hard, hard heart. You would have thought I\u2019d feel brittle too, being such a bitter, angry bitch. But I didn\u2019t. I felt nothing, really, just the sense that now the circle I\u2019d always kept small was a little smaller. Maybe Chris could be saved that easily. But not me. Never me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After much whispered discussion in the kitchen, an uneasy peace was negotiated. I apologized to Jennifer Anne, trying to make it sound genuine, and suffered through some more talking points over chocolate souffl\u00e9 before finally being allowed to leave. Chris still wasn\u2019t really speaking to me, and didn\u2019t even try to make it sound like he wasn\u2019t slamming the door at my back when I left. I shouldn\u2019t even have been surprised, actually, that he\u2019d caved so easily to love. That was why he\u2019d lost our marriage bet every time: his guess was always over, way over, the last time by a full six months.</p><p>I got in my car and drove. Going home seemed depressing, with just me there, so I cut across town, into Lissa\u2019s neighborhood. I slowed down in front of her house, turning off my lights and idling by the mailbox. Through the front window I could see into the dining room, where she and her parents were eating dinner. I thought about going up and ringing the bell-Lissa\u2019s mom was always quick to pull a chair and another plate up to the table-but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for parental talk about college, or the future. In fact, I felt like I was primed for a little backsliding. So I went to Chloe\u2019s.</p><p>She answered the door holding a wooden spoon, her brow furrowed. \u201cMy mom\u2019s due home in forty-five minutes,\u201d she informed me, holding the door open so I could come in. \u201cYou can stay thirty, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Chloe\u2019s mom, Natasha, had a strict policy of no uninvited guests, which meant that as long as I\u2019d known Chloe there\u2019d always been a set time limit of how long we could hang out at her house. Her mom just didn\u2019t seem to like people that much. I figured this was either a really bad reason to choose a career as a flight attendant or a natural reaction to having become one. Either way, we hardly ever saw her.</p> <p>\u201cHow was dinner?\u201d she asked me over her shoulder as I followed her into the kitchen, where I could hear something sizzling on the stove.</p><p>\u201cUneventful,\u201d I told her. I wasn\u2019t lying as much as I just didn\u2019t feel like getting into it. \u201cCan I score a couple of minibottles from you?\u201d</p><p>She turned around from the stove, where she was stirring something in the pan. It smelled like seafood. \u201cIs that why you came over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially.\u201d That was the thing about Chloe: I could always shoot it straight with her. In fact, she preferred it that way. Like me, she wasn\u2019t into bullshitting around.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p> <p>I pulled a stool over and stepped up, opening the cabinet. Ah, the mother lode. Tiny bottles her mom had filched from the drink cart lined the shelf, arranged neatly by height and category: clear liquors on the left, dessert brandies on the right. I grabbed two Barcardis from the back, readjusted the rows, then glanced at Chloe to make sure it looked okay. She nodded, then handed me a glass of Coke, into which I dumped the contents of one bottle, shaking it around with some ice cubes. Then I took a sip. It was strong, and burned going down, and I felt this weird twinge, like I knew this wasn\u2019t the way to react to what had happened at Jennifer Anne\u2019s. It passed, though. That was the bad thing. It always passed.</p><p>\u201cWant a sip?\u201d I asked Chloe, holding out my glass. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said, adjusting the flame under the pan, \u201cthat\u2019s just what I need. She comes home to my first tuition bill and I smell like rum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s she been this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZurich, I think.\u201d She leaned closer to the pan, sniffing it. \u201cWith a layover in London. Or Milan.\u201d</p><p>I took another sip of my drink. \u201cSo,\u201d I said, after a few seconds of quiet, \u201cI\u2019m an angry, bitter bitch. Right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, without turning around.</p><p>I nodded. Point proved. I supposed. I drew in the dampness left by my glass on the black countertop, stretching out the edges.</p><p>\u201cAnd you bring this up,\u201d Chloe said, turning around and leaning against the stove, \u201cbecause...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I told her, \u201cChris suddenly believes in love and I don\u2019t and therefore, I am a terrible person.\u201d</p><p>She considered this. \u201cNot altogether terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have some good points.\u201d</p><p>I waited, raising my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cSuch as,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have really nice clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I told her, and she laughed, putting her hand over her mouth, so I laughed too. Really, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d expected. I would have said the same thing to her.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t let me drive when I left. She moved my car around the corner-if it was parked out front her mom would be pissed-then drove me to Bendo, where I had to swear I would only have one more beer and then call Jess for a ride home. I promised. Then I went inside, had two beers, and decided not to bug Jess just yet. Instead I set myself up at the bar, with a decent view of the room, and decided to stew for a while.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long it was before I saw her. One minute I was arguing with the bartender, a tall, gangly guy named Nathan, about classic rock guitarists, and the next I turned my head and caught a glimpse of her in the mirror behind the bar. Her hair was flat, her face a little sweaty. She looked drunk, but I would have known her anywhere. It was everybody else who always liked to think she was gone for good.</p><p>I wiped off my face, ran my fingers through my hair, trying to give it some life. She stared back at me as I did this, knowing as well as I that these were just smoke and mirrors, little tricks. Behind her and me the crowd was thickening, and I could feel people pressing up against me, leaning forward for drinks. And the sick thing? In a way, I was almost happy to see her. The worst part of me, out in the flesh. Blinking back at me in the dim light, daring me to call her a name other than my own.</p><p>Truth be told, I used to be worse. Much worse.</p><p>I hardly ever drank much anymore. Or smoked pot. Or went off with guys I didn\u2019t know that well into dark corners, or dark cars, or dark rooms. Weird how it never worked in the daylight, when you could actually see the topography of someone\u2019s face, the lines and bumps, the scars. In the dark everyone felt the same: the edges blurred. When I think of myself then, what I was like two years ago, I feel like a wound in a bad place, prone to be bumped on corners or edges. Never able to heal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the drinking or the smoking that was really the problem. It was the other thing, the one harder to admit out loud. Nice girls didn\u2019t do what I did. Nice girls waited. But even before it happened, I\u2019d never counted myself as a nice girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was sophomore year, and Lissa\u2019s next-door neighbor Albert, a senior, was having a party. Lissa\u2019s parents were out of town, and we were all sleeping over, sneaking into their liquor cabinet and mixing anything we found together, then chasing it with Diet Coke: rum, vodka, peppermint schnapps. To this day I couldn\u2019t stomach cherry brandy, not even in the torts my mother loved from Milton\u2019s Market. The smell of it alone made me gag.</p><p>We never would have been invited to Albert\u2019s, being sophomores, and weren\u2019t bold enough to even consider crashing. But we did go out on Lissa\u2019s back porch with our spiked Diet Cokes and sneaked cigarettes we\u2019d stolen from Chloe\u2019s grandmother, who smoked menthols. (Which also, to this day, made me gag.) Some guy, who was already drunk and slurring, waved us over. After a bit of whispered conferring, which consisted of Lissa saying we couldn\u2019t and me and Chloe overruling her, we went.</p><p>That was the first night I ever got really drunk. It was a bad start with the cherry brandy, and an hour later I found myself making my way across Albert\u2019s living room, clutching an easy chair for support. Everything was spinning, and I could see Lissa and Chloe and Jess sitting on a couch in the living room, where some girl was teaching them how to play quarters. The music was really loud, and someone had broken a vase in the foyer. It was blue, and the pieces were still scattered everywhere, strewn across the lime carpet. I remember thinking, in my blurry state, that it looked like sea glass.</p><p>It was one of Albert\u2019s friends, a really popular senior guy, who I bumped into on the stairs. He\u2019d been flirting with me all night, pulling me into his lap while we played Asshole, and I\u2019d liked it, felt vindicated, like it proved I wasn\u2019t just some stupid sophomore. When he said we should hang out and talk, alone, I knew where we were going and why. Even then, I wasn\u2019t new to this.</p> <p>We went into Albert\u2019s bedroom and started kissing, there in the dark, as he fumbled for a light switch. Once he found it I could make out a Pink Floyd poster, stacks of CDs, Elle McPher son on the wall with December beneath her. He was easing me back, toward the bed, and then we were lying down, all so quick.</p><p>I\u2019d always prided myself on having the upper hand. I had my patented moves, the push offs and casual squirm, easily utilized to slow things down. But this time, they weren\u2019t working. Every time I moved one of his hands another seemed to be on me, and it seemed like all my strength had seeped down to my toes. It didn\u2019t help that I was so drunk that my balance was off, my equilibrium shot. And it had felt so good, for a while.</p><p>God. The rest comes in bursts when I do reach that far back, always these crazy sharp details: how fast it was all happening, the way I kept coming in and out of it, one second vivid, the next lost. He was on me and everything was spinning and all I could feel was this weight, heavy, pushing me backward until I feel like Alice, being sucked into the rabbit hole. It was not how I wanted my first time to be.</p><p>When it was over, I told him I felt sick and ran for the bathroom, locking the door with my hands shaking, unable at first to perform even that easiest of operations. Then I gripped the sink, gasping hard into it, my own breath coming back at me, amplified, rattling my ears. When I lifted my head up and looked in the mirror, it was her face I saw then. Drunk. Pale. Easy. And scared, unsteady, still gasping as she looked back at me, wondering what she had done.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d The bartender shook his head, plunking a cup of coffee in front of me. \u201cShe\u2019s cut off.\u201d</p> <p>I wiped my face with my hand and looked at the guy beside me, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. Or slurred. Maybe. \u201cI only had a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. They don\u2019t know anything.\u201d We\u2019d been talking for about an hour now, and this was what I knew: his name was Sherman, he was a junior at some college I\u2019d never heard of in Minnesota, and in the last ten minutes he\u2019d progressively slid his leg closer and closer to mine while trying to pass it off as just the crowd jostling him. Now he shook a cigarette out of the pack in his hand, then offered it to me. I shook my head and he lit it, sucking down smoke and then blowing it straight up in the air. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201ca girl like you must have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said, poking at my coffee with the spoon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he said, picking up his drink. \u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. This entire scenario was like the default talk-to-a-girl-at-a-bar script, and I was only playing along because I wasn\u2019t entirely sure I could get off my bar stool without stumbling. At least Jess was coming. I\u2019d called her. Hadn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m really just such a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>He looked surprised at this, but not necessarily in a bad way. In fact, he looked kind of intrigued, as if I\u2019d just admitted I wore leather panties or was double-jointed. \u201cNow, who told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something that\u2019ll cheer you up,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI bet you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really.\u201d He raised his eyebrows at me, then pantomimed holding a joint between two fingers. \u201cOut in the car. Come with me and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Like I was that stupid. Anymore. \u201cNope. I\u2019m waiting for a ride.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer to me: he smelled like aftershave, something strong. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get home. Come on.\u201d And then he put his hand on my arm, curling his fingers around my elbow.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d I said, trying to tug my arm back.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d he said, almost affectionately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I told him, jerking my elbow. He held on. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Emmy,\u201d he said, finishing his drink. He couldn\u2019t even get my stupid name right. \u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>Then he started to tug me off my stool, which normally I would have made more difficult, but again, my balance wasn\u2019t exactly right on just then. Before I knew it I was on my feet, then getting yanked through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI said let go, you fucking asshole!\u201d I pulled my arm loose, hard, and it flew up, smacking him in the face and sending him stumbling, just slightly, backward. Now people were looking at us, in that mildly-interesting-at-least-until-the-music-starts-again kind of way. How had I let this happen? One nasty remark from Chris and I\u2019m bar trash, fighting in public with some guy named Sherman? I could feel the shame rising up in me, flushing my face. Everyone was looking at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, okay, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d That was Adrian, the bouncer, too late as usual for the real commotion but always up for a chance to throw his little bit of power around.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just talking at the bar and we go to go outside and she freaks,\u201d Sherman said, pulling at his collar. \u201cCrazy bitch. She hit me.\u201d</p><p>I was standing there, rubbing my arm, hating myself. I knew if I turned around I\u2019d see that girl again, so weak and screwed up. She\u2019d go to the parking lot, no problem. After that night at the party, she\u2019d gotten a reputation for it. I hated her for that. So much I could feel a lump rising in my throat, which I pressed down because I was better than that, much better. I wasn\u2019t Lissa: I didn\u2019t trot my pain out to show around. I kept it better hidden than anyone. I did.</p><p>\u201cGod, this is swelling,\u201d Sherman whined, rubbing his eye. What a wuss. If I\u2019d hit him on purpose, well, then that would have been different. But it was an accident. I didn\u2019t even really have my arm in it.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to call the police?\u201d Adrian asked.</p><p>I was suddenly so hot, and I could feel my shirt sticking to my back with sweat. The room tilted, just a bit, and I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d I heard someone say, and suddenly there was a hand enclosing mine, squeezing slightly. \u201cThere you are! I\u2019m only fifteen minutes late, honey, no need to cause a commotion.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to see Dexter standing beside me. Holding my hand. I would have yanked it away, but honestly I thought better of it, after what had just happened.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d Adrian said to Dexter.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, though,\u201d Dexter replied in that quick, cheery way of his, as if we were all friends who met coincidentally on a street corner. \u201cIt is. See, I was late. And that makes my sweetums so foul tempered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>\u201cSweetums?\u201d Sherman repeated.</p><p>\u201cShe clocked him,\u201d Adrian told Dexter. \u201cMight have to call the cops.\u201d</p><p>Dexter looked at me, then at Sherman. \u201cShe hit you?\u201d</p><p>Now Sherman didn\u2019t seem so sure, instead pulling at his collar and glancing around. \u201cWell, not exactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney!\u201d Dexter looked at me. \u201cDid you really? But she\u2019s just a little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get arrested?\u201d he said back, just as low. Then, back in cheery mode, he added, \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve seen her get mad before, but hit somebody? My Remy? She\u2019s not even ninety pounds soaking wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither I call the cops or I don\u2019t,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cBut I got to get back to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Sherman told him. \u201cI\u2019m out of here.\u201d And then he slunk off, but not before I noticed that yes, his eye was swelling. Wimp.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Adrian pointed at me. \u201cGo home. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cAnd thank you so much for your cordial, professional handling of this situation.\u201d</p><p>We left Adrian there, mulling over whether he\u2019d been insulted. As soon as we were outside, I yanked my hand loose from Dexter\u2019s and started down the stairs, toward the pay phone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, no thank-you?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m not some weak woman who needs to be saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just almost got arrested for assault.\u201d</p><p>I kept walking.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, darting ahead of me and walking backward so I had no choice but to look at him, \u201cI saved your butt. So you, Remy, should be a little more grateful. Are you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped, although I may or may not have just tripped over something. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just want to call for a ride and go home, okay? I had a really shitty night.\u201d</p><p>He dropped back beside me, sticking his hands in his pockets. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>We were at the phone now. I reached into my pockets: no change. And suddenly it just seemed to hit me all at once-the argument with Chris, the fight in the bar, my own pity party, and, right on the tails of that, all the drinks I\u2019d consumed in the last few hours. My head hurt, I was deadly thirsty, and now I was stuck. I put my hand over my eyes and took a few good, deep breaths to steady myself.</p><p>Don\u2019t cry, for God\u2019s sakes, I told myself. This isn\u2019t you. Not anymore. Breathe.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t working. Nothing was working tonight.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sniffled, and hated the way it sounded. Weak. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d he replied. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. How did I know this would be any different? The story could have been the same, easily: me drunk, in a deserted place. Someone there, reaching out for me. It had happened before. Who could blame me for my cold, hard heart?</p><p>And that did it. I was crying, so angry at myself, but I couldn\u2019t stop. The only time I ever allowed myself to be this weak was at home, in my closet, staring up at those stars with my father\u2019s voice filling my ears. And I wished so much that he was here, even though I knew it was stupid, that he didn\u2019t even know me to save me. He\u2019d said it himself, in the song: he\u2019d let me down. But still.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Dexter said quietly. He wasn\u2019t touching me, but his voice was very close, and very soft. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>Later, it would take me a minute to remember how exactly it happened. If I turned around and moved forward first, or he did. I just knew we didn\u2019t meet halfway. It was just a short distance really, not worth squabbling over. And maybe it didn\u2019t matter so much whether he took the step or I did. All I knew was that he was there.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>I woke up with my mouth dry, my head pounding, and the sound of guitar music coming from the direction of the door across the room. It was dark, but there was a slant of light stretching right to where I was, falling across the end of a bed in which I had apparently, up until now, been sleeping.</p><p>I sat up quick, and my head spun. God. This was familiar. Not the place but this feeling, waking up in a strange bed, completely discombobulated. Moments like this, I was just glad no one was there to witness my absolute shame as I verified that yes, my pants were still on and yes, I was still wearing a bra and yes, okay, nothing major had happened because, well, girls just know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jesus. I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath.</p><p>Okay, okay, I told myself, just think for a second. I looked around me for any distinguishing details that might clarify what, exactly, had happened since the last thing I remembered, which was me and Dexter at the phone booth. There was a window to my left, along the sill of which there was what appeared to be a series of snow globes. A chair across the room was covered with clothes, and there was a bunch of CDs stacked in piles beside the door. Finally, at the end of the bed, in a pile, were my sandals, the sweater I\u2019d been wearing around my waist, and my money and ID. Had I put them there? No way. Even drunk, I would have folded them. I mean, please.</p><p>Suddenly I heard someone laugh, and then a few guitar chords, playing softly.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a potato,\u201d someone sang, as there was another snort of laughter, \u201c but I wanted a kumquat... I asked you for lovin\u2019... You said -hey, wait, is that my cottage cheese?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d someone protested. \u201cAnd the only other thing in here is relish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen eat the relish,\u201d another voice said. \u201cThe cottage cheese is off limits. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHouse rules, John Miller. You don\u2019t buy food, you don\u2019t eat. Period.\u201d</p><p>A refrigerator door slammed, there was a second of silence, and then the guitar started up again. \u201cHe\u2019s such a baby,\u201d someone said. \u201cOkay. So where were we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKumquat.\u201d This time I recognized the voice. It was Dexter.</p><p>\u201cKumquat,\u201d the other voice repeated. \u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you for lovin\u2019,\u201d Dexter sang. \u201cYou said, do what?\u201d</p><p>I pushed off the blankets that were covering me, got out of the bed, then put on my shoes. For some reason, this made me feel better, more in control. Then I stuck my ID back in my pocket, slipped on my sweater, and sat down to think.</p><p>First off: the time. No clock, but I could see what looked like a tangled phone cord poking out from under the bed, half buried under a couple of shirts. This place was a mess. I dialed the time and temperature number, listened to the five-day forecast, and then found out it was, at the tone, 12:22 A.M. Beep.</p><p>It was really bothering me that the bed wasn\u2019t made. But it wasn\u2019t my problem. I needed to get home.</p> <p>I dialed Jess\u2019s number and bit my pinky nail, awaiting the inevitable wrath.</p><p>\u201cMmmpht.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy Starr. I am so going to kick your fucking ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, okay, but listen-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d She was wide awake now, managing to sound totally pissed and keep her voice down at the same time. Jess was multitalented. \u201cDo you know that Chloe has been on me for the entire night about you? She said she dropped you at Bendo for one beer at eight-thirty, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, see, I ended up staying a little bit longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly. And I ended up driving there to look for you, hearing that you were not only drunk but also in a fight and, to top it off, had left with some guy and completely disappeared. What the hell are you thinking, Remy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand that you\u2019re mad, okay? But right now I just need to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I enjoy repeated phone calls from Chloe telling how if you\u2019re dead or something it\u2019s my fault because, obviously, I was supposed to have some kind of psychic connection that would enable me to know I was supposed to pick you up without the benefit of a phone call?\u201d</p><p>This time, I was quiet.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, whispering. \u201cI screwed up. Big time. But right now I\u2019m at this guy\u2019s house and I need out and please can you just help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me where you are.\u201d</p><p>I did. \u201cJess, I really-\u201d</p><p>Click. Okay, well, now we could both be pissed at me. But at least I was getting home.</p><p>I walked to the door and leaned against it. The guitar music was still going, and I could hear Dexter singing that line about the potato and kumquat, again and again, as if waiting for inspiration to strike. I inched the door open a little more, then peered through the crack. I could see right into the house\u2019s kitchen, where there was a beat-up Formica table with a bunch of mismatched chairs, a fridge covered with pictures, and a brown-and-green-striped couch pulled up against the back window. Dexter and the guy I recognized as Ted, the guitarist, were sitting at the table, a couple of cans of beer between them. The dog I\u2019d met earlier, Monkey, was asleep on the couch.</p><p>\u201cMaybe kumquat isn\u2019t the right word,\u201d Dexter said, leaning back in his chair-a wooden one painted yellow-exactly the way your teachers in school always told you not to, balancing on the back legs. \u201cMaybe we need another kind of fruit.\u201d</p><p>Ted picked at the guitar\u2019s strings. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Dexter sighed, pulling both hands through his hair. It was so curly this just added volume, springing loose as he let his arms drop. \u201cWhat about pomegranate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNectarines?\u201d</p><p>Ted cocked his head to the side, then strummed another chord. \u201cYou gave me potato but I wanted a nectarine...\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other. \u201cTerrible,\u201d Dexter decided.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door back, wincing as it made a tiny click. It would have been bad enough to face Dexter after what had-or hadn\u2019t-happened. But the thought of there being someone else there was enough to make a full-on window escape necessary.</p><p>I crawled up on the bed and pushed the snow globes-God, who over the age of ten collected snow globes?-aside, then undid the latch. It stuck at first, but I put some shoulder in it and up it went, rattling slightly. Not much space, but enough.</p><p>One arm through, about to start wriggling, I had a small but noticeable pang of guilt. I mean, he had gotten me to a safe place. And, judging by the taste in my mouth and past experience, it was highly likely that I had puked at some point. Since I didn\u2019t remember getting there, he must have had to drag me. Or carry me. Oh, the shame.</p><p>I dropped back down on the bed. I had to do something decent here. But Jess was on her way and I didn\u2019t have many options. I looked around me: not enough time to straighten up the room, even though my fast cleaning skills were legendary. If I left a note, that was an open invitation to get back in touch with me, and honestly I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted that. There was nothing else to do but make the bed. Which I did, quickly and thoroughly, with hospital corners and the pillow trick that was my trade secret. Even at the Four Seasons they couldn\u2019t do better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So it was with a less heavy conscience that I pushed myself through the (small) window, trying to be stealthy, and pretty much succeeding until I kicked the back of the house on my dismount, leaving a scuff mark by the electric meter. No biggie. Then I cut through the side yard to find Jess.</p><p>There was a time when I\u2019d been famous for my window escapes. It was my preferred way to exit, always, even if I had a mostly clear path to the door. Maybe it was a shame thing, a punishment I chose to inflict upon myself because I knew, in my heart, that what I had done was bad. It was my penance.</p><p>Two streets over, on Caldwell, I stepped off the curb by the stop sign and held up my hand, squinting in Jess\u2019s headlights as she came closer. She reached over, pushed open the passenger door, and then stared straight ahead, impassive, as I got in.</p><p>\u201cJust like old times,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. It was too late to go into details, even with her. \u201cOld,\u201d I said.</p><p>She turned up the radio and we cut through a side street, then passed Dexter\u2019s house on our way out of the neighborhood. The front door was open, the porch dark, but from the light inside I could see Monkey sitting there, his nose pressed against the screen. Dexter probably didn\u2019t even know I was gone yet. But just in case, I slid down, dropping out of sight, although I knew in the dark, and at this speed, he couldn\u2019t have found me if he tried.</p><p>This time, I awoke to tapping.</p><p>Not normal tapping: tapping in a rhythm that I recognized. A song. It sounded, in fact, like \u201cOh, Tannenbaum.\u201d</p><p>I opened one eye, then looked around me. I was in my room, my bed. Everything in place, the floor clean, my universe just as I liked it. Except for the tapping.</p> <p>I rolled over, burying my face in my pillow, assuming it was one of my mother\u2019s cats, which were all having minor breakdowns in her absence, attacking my door in an effort to get me to feed them more Fancy Feast, which they devoured by the case.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I mumbled into my pillow. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>And then, just then, the window right over my bed suddenly opened. Slid up, smooth as silk, scaring me to death, but not quite as much as Dexter shooting through it, head first, limbs flailing. One of his feet hit my bedside table, sending my clock flying across the room to crash into a closet door with a bang, while his elbow clocked me right in the gut. The only thing slightly redeeming about any of this was that he had so much momentum behind him he missed the bed entirely, instead landing with a thunk, belly-flop style, on the throw rug by my bureau. The whole commotion, while seemingly complicated, was over in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Then it was very quiet.</p><p>Dexter lifted up his head, glanced around, then put it back on the carpet. He still seemed a little stunned by the impact. I knew how he felt: I had a second-floor window, and climbing in off the trellis, as I had many times, was a bitch. \u201cYou could at least,\u201d he said, eyes closed, \u201chave said good-bye.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, pulling my blanket up to my chest. It was so surreal, him splayed out on my carpet like he was. I wasn\u2019t even sure how he\u2019d found my house. In fact, the entire trajectory of our relationship, all the way back to the day we\u2019d met, was like one long dream, bumpy and strange, full of things that should have made sense but didn\u2019t. What had he said to me that first day? Something about natural chemistry. He claimed he\u2019d noticed it right from the start, and maybe it was an explanation, of sorts, of why we kept coming together, again and again. Or maybe he was just too fucking persistent. Either way, I felt that we were at a cross-roads. A choice had to be made.</p> <p>He sat up, rubbing his face with one hand. Not much the worse for wear: at least nothing was broken. Then he looked at me, as if now it was my turn to say or do something.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get involved with me,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stood up then, wincing a bit, and walked over to the bed, sitting down. Then he leaned in to me, sliding his hand up my arm around the back of my neck, pulling me nearer to him, and for a second we just stayed like that, looking at each other. And I had a sudden flash of the night before, a part of memory opening up and falling into my hands again, where I could see it clearly. It was like a picture, a snapshot: a girl and boy standing in front of a phone booth. The girl had her hands over her eyes. The boy stood in front of her, watching. He was speaking, softly. And then, all of a sudden, the girl stepped forward, pressing her face into his chest as he lifted his hands to stroke her hair.</p><p>So it had been me. Maybe I\u2019d known that all along, and that was why I had run. Because I didn\u2019t show weakness: I didn\u2019t depend on anyone. And if he\u2019d been like the others, and just let me go, I would have been fine. It would have been easy to go on conveniently forgetting as I kept my heart clenched tight, away from where anyone could get to it.</p><p>Now, Dexter sat as close to me as I could remember him being. It seemed like this day could go in so many directions, like a spiderweb shooting out toward endless possibilities. Whenever you made a choice, especially one you\u2019d been resisting, it always affected everything else, some in big ways, like a tremor beneath your feet, others in so tiny a shift you hardly noticed a change at all. But it was happening.</p><p>And so, while the rest of the world went on unaware, drinking their coffee, reading the sports page, and picking up their dry cleaning, I leaned forward and kissed Dexter, making a choice that would change everything. Maybe somewhere there was a ripple, a bit of a jump, some small shift in the universe, barely noticeable. I didn\u2019t feel it then. I felt only him kissing me back, easing me into the sunlight as I lost myself in the taste of him and felt the world go on, just as it always had, all around us.</p><p>July</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you give me no rotten tomato, cause all I ever wanted was your sweet potato.\u201d Dexter stopped as the music did. Now, all we could hear was the fridge rattling and Monkey snoring. \u201cOkay, so what else rhymes with potato? \u201d</p><p>Ted strummed his guitar, looking at the ceiling. On the couch by the refrigerator, John Miller rolled over, his red head bonking the wall.</p><p>\u201cAnybody?\u201d Dexter asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lucas said, crossing his legs, \u201cit depends on if you want a real rhyme, or a pseudo rhyme.\u201d</p><p>Dexter looked at him. \u201cPseudo rhyme,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cA real rhyme,\u201d Lucas began, in what I already recognized as his eggbert voice, \u201cis tomato. But you could easily tack an o onto another word and make a rhyme of it, even if it\u2019s not grammatically correct. Like, say, relate-o. Or abate-o.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you give me no rotten tomato,\u201d Dexter sang, \u201cjust \u2019cause to your crazy shit I cannot relate-o.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Ted plucked out another chord, then tightened a string.</p><p>\u201cNeeds work,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re getting somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you all just please shut up,\u201d John Miller moaned from the couch, his voice muffled. \u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep. \u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s two in the afternoon, and this is the kitchen,\u201d Ted told him. \u201cGo someplace else or quit bitching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, boys,\u201d Dexter said.</p><p>Ted sighed. \u201cPeople, we need to focus on this. I want \u2018The Potato Opus\u2019 to be ready for that show next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Potato Opus\u2019?\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIs that what it\u2019s called now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you think of something better?\u201d</p> <p>Lucas was quiet for a second. \u201cNope,\u201d he said finally. \u201cSure can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen shut the hell up.\u201d Ted picked up the guitar. \u201cFrom the top, first verse, with feeling.\u201d</p><p>And so it went. Another day at the yellow house, where I\u2019d been spending a fair amount of my free time lately. Not that I liked the setting, particularly; the place was a total dump, mostly because four guys lived there and none of them had ever been introduced formally to a bottle of Lysol. There was rotting food in the fridge, something black and mildewy growing on the shower tiles, and some sort of unidentifiable rank smell coming from beneath the back deck. Only Dexter\u2019s room was decent, and that was because I had my limits. When I found a pair of dirty underwear under a couch cushion, or had to fight the fruit flies in the kitchen that were always swarming the garbage can, I at least could take comfort in the fact that his bed was made, his CDs stacked alphabetically, and the plug-in air freshener was working its pink, rose-shaped little heart out. All of this work on my part was a small price to pay, I figured, for my sanity.</p><p>Which, in truth, had been sorely tested lately, ever since my mother had returned from her honeymoon and set up her new marriage under our shared roof. All through the spring we\u2019d had workmen passing through, hauling drywall and windows and tracking sawdust across the floors. They\u2019d knocked out the wall of the old den, extending it into the backyard, and added a new master suite, complete with a new bathroom featuring a sunken tub and side-by-side sinks separated by blocks of colored glass. Crossing over the threshold into what Chris and I had named \u201cthe new wing\u201d was like entering an entirely different house, which was pretty much my mother\u2019s intention. It was her matched set, with a new bedroom, a new husband, and new carpet. Her life was perfect. But as was often the case, the rest of us were still adjusting.</p><p>One problem was Don\u2019s stuff. Being a lifelong bachelor, he had certain objects that he\u2019d grown attached to, very little of which fit my mother\u2019s decorating scheme for the new wing. The only thing that even remotely reflected Don\u2019s taste in their bedroom, in fact, was a large Moroccan tapestry depicting various biblical tableaus. It was enormous and took up most of a wall, but it did match the carpet almost perfectly, and therefore constituted a compromise of taste that my mother could live with. The remainder of his belongings were exiled to the rest of the house, which meant that Chris and I had to adjust to living with Don\u2019s decor.</p><p>The first piece I noticed, a couple of days after their return, was a framed print by some Renaissance painter of a hugely buxom woman posing in a garden. Her fingers were big, pudgy, and white, and she was stretched across a couch, buck naked. She had huge breasts, which were hanging down off the couch, and she was eating grapes, a fistful in one hand, another about to drop into her mouth. It might have been art-a flexible term, in my opinion-but it was disgusting. Especially hanging on the wall over our kitchen table, where I had no choice but to look at it while I ate breakfast.</p> <p>\u201cMan,\u201d Chris said to me the first morning it was there, about two days after Don had moved in. He was eating cereal, already dressed in his Jiffy Lube uniform. \u201cHow much you think a woman like that weighed?\u201d</p><p>I took a bite of my muffin, trying to concentrate on the newspaper in front of me. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAt least two-fifty,\u201d Chris decided, slurping down another spoonful. \u201cThose breasts alone have to be five pounds. Maybe even seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not?\u201d he said. \u201cGod. It\u2019s right there. It\u2019s like trying to ignore the sun or something.\u201d</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t just the picture. It was the modern art statue that now stood in the foyer that looked, frankly, like a big penis. (Was there a theme here? I\u2019d never pegged Don for that type, but now I was starting to wonder.) Add to that the fancy set of Cal phalon pots that now hung over our kitchen island and the red leather sofa in the living room, which just screamed Single Man on the Make to me, and it was no wonder I was feeling a little out of place. But then again, this house wasn\u2019t really mine to claim anymore. Don was now permanent-supposedly-while I was of temporary status, gone come fall. For once, I was the one with an expiration date, and I was finding I didn\u2019t like it much.</p><p>Which explained, in some ways, why I was over at Dexter\u2019s so much. But there was another reason, one I wasn\u2019t so quick to admit. Even to myself.</p><p>For as long as I\u2019d been dating, I\u2019d had a mental flow chart, a schedule, of how things usually went. Relationships always started with that heady, swoonish period, where the other person is like some new invention that suddenly solves all life\u2019s worst problems, like losing socks in the dryer or toasting bagels without burning the edges. At this phase, which usually lasts about six weeks max, the other person is perfect. But at six weeks and two days, the cracks begin to show; not real structural damage yet, but little things that niggle and nag. Like the way they always assume you\u2019ll pay for your own movie, just because you did once, or how they use the dashboard of their car as an imaginary keyboard at long stoplights. Once, you might have thought this was cute, or endearing. Now, it annoys you, but not enough to change anything. Come week eight, though, the strain is starting to show. This person is, in fact, human, and here\u2019s where most relationships splinter and die. Because either you can stick around and deal with these problems, or ease out gracefully, knowing that at some point in the not-too-distant future, there will emerge another perfect person, who will fix everything, at least for six weeks.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I knew this pattern even before my first real boyfriend, because I\u2019d seen my mother go through it several times already. With marriages, the pattern is stretched out, adjusted, like working with dog years: the six weeks becomes a year, sometimes two. But it\u2019s the same. That was why it was always so easy to figure out how long my stepfathers would last. It all comes down to math.</p><p>If I did the math with Dexter, on paper it was perfect. We\u2019d come in well under the three-month mark, with me leaving for college just as the shine was wearing off. But the problem was that Dexter wasn\u2019t cooperating. If my theories of relationships were plotted geographically, Dexter wasn\u2019t even left of center or far out in right field. He was on another map altogether, rapidly approaching the distant corner and headed into the unknown.</p><p>First, he was very gangly. I\u2019d never liked gangly guys, and Dexter was clumsy, skinny, and always in motion. It was not surprising to me now that our relationship had started with him crashing into me in various ways, since I now knew he moved through the world with a series of flying elbows, banged knees, and flailing limbs. In the short time we\u2019d been together, he\u2019d already broken my alarm clock, crushed one of my beaded necklaces underfoot, and managed, somehow, to leave a huge scuff mark on my ceiling. I am not joking. He was always jiggling his knees, or drumming his fingers, as if revving up, just waiting for the checkered flag to drop so he could spin out at full speed. I found myself constantly reaching over and trying to quiet him, covering his knee or fingers with my hand, thinking it would silence them, when instead I would be caught up in it with him, jangling along, as if whatever current charged him was now flowing through me.</p><p>Point two: he was a slob. His shirttail was always out, his tie usually had a stain, his hair, while curly and thick, sprung out from his head wildly in a mad-scientist sort of fashion. Also, his shoelaces were continually untied. He was all loose ends, and I hated loose ends. If I could ever have gotten him to stand still long enough, I knew I would have been unable to resist tucking, tying, smoothing, organizing, as if he were a particularly messy closet just screaming for my attention. But instead I found myself gritting my teeth, riding the wave of my natural anxiety, because this wasn\u2019t permanent, me and him, and to think so would only hurt both of us.</p> <p>Which led to point three: he really liked me. Not in an only-until-the-end-of-the-summer way, which was safest. In fact, he never talked about the future at all, as if we had so much time, and there wasn\u2019t a definite end point to our relationship. I, of course, wanted to make things clear from the start: that I was leaving, no attachments, the standard spiel I repeated in my head finally spoken aloud. But whenever I tried to do this, he evaded so easily that it was as if he could read my mind, see what was coming, and for once move gracefully to sidestep the issue entirely.</p><p>Now, as work on \u201cThe Potato Song\u201d broke up so that Ted could go to work, Dexter came over and stood in front of me, stretching his arms over his head. \u201cTotal turn-on seeing a real band at work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c Relate-o is a lame rhyme,\u201d I said, \u201cpseudo or not.\u201d</p><p>He winced, then smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d he explained.</p><p>I put down my crossword puzzle-I\u2019d finished about half of it-and he picked it up, glancing at what I\u2019d finished. \u201cImpressive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd of course, Miss Remy does her crosswords in ink. What, you don\u2019t make mistakes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, though,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I admitted, \u201cmaybe one.\u201d</p><p>He grinned again. We\u2019d only been seeing each other for a few weeks now, but this easy give-and-take still surprised me. From that very first day in my room, I felt like we\u2019d somehow skipped the formalities of the Beginning of a Relationship: those awkward moments when you\u2019re not all over each other and are still feeling out the other person\u2019s boundaries and limits. Maybe this was because we\u2019d been circling each other for a while before he finally catapulted through my window. But if I let myself think about it much-and I didn\u2019t-I had flashes of realizing that I\u2019d been comfortable with him even at the very start. Clearly, he\u2019d been comfortable with me, grabbing my hand as he had that first day. As if he knew, even then, that we\u2019d be here now.</p><p>\u201cI bet you,\u201d he said to me, \u201cthat I can name more states by the time that woman comes out of the dry cleaners than you can.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. We were sitting outside of Joie, both of us on our lunch break, me drinking a Diet Coke, him snarfing down a sleeve of Fig Newtons. \u201cDexter,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s hot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, sliding his hand over my leg. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, no.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, then squeezed my knee. His foot, of course, was tapping. \u201cLet\u2019s go. She\u2019s about to walk in. When the door shuts behind her, time\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring. And too easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTen bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. And you have to buy dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>We watched as the woman, who was wearing pink shorts and a T-shirt and carrying an armful of wrinkled dress shirts, pulled open the door to the cleaners. As it swung shut, I said, \u201cMaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth Dakota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelaware.\u201d I was keeping track on my fingers: he\u2019d been known to cheat but denied it with great vehemence, so I always had to have proof. Challenges, to Dexter, were like those duels in the old movies, where men in white suits smacked each other across the face with gloves, and all honor was at stake. So far, I hadn\u2019t won them all, but I hadn\u2019t backed down either. I was, after all, still new at this.</p><p>Dexter\u2019s challenges, apparently, were legendary. The first one I\u2019d seen had been between him and John Miller. It was a couple of days after Dexter and I had gotten together, one of the first times I\u2019d gone over to the yellow house with him. We found John Miller sitting at the kitchen table in his pajamas, eating a banana. There was a big bunch of them on the table in front of him, seemingly out of place in a kitchen where I now knew the major food groups consisted of Slurpees and beer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the bananas?\u201d Dexter asked him, pulling out a chair and sitting down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John Miller, who still looked half asleep, glanced up and said, \u201cFruit of the Month Club. My nana gave it to me for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotassium,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cYou need that every day, you know.\u201d</p><p>John Miller yawned, as if used to this kind of stupid information. Then he went back to his banana.</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d Dexter said suddenly, in the voice I later would come to recognize as the one that always preceded a challenge, deep and game show host-like, \u201cthat you can\u2019t eat ten bananas.\u201d</p> <p>John Miller finished chewing the bite in his mouth, then swallowed. \u201cI bet,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Dexter said. Then he nudged out a chair, with a knee that was already jiggling, for me, and said, in the same low, slow voice, \u201cWill you take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor ten bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not eating ten bananas for ten bucks,\u201d John Miller said indignantly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dollar a banana!\u201d Dexter said.</p><p>\u201cAnd furthermore,\u201d John Miller went on, tossing the now-empty peel at an overflowing garbage can by the back door, and missing, \u201cthis double-dare shit of yours is getting old, Dexter. You can\u2019t just go around throwing down challenges whenever you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you passing on the challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop using that voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty bucks,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cTwenty bucks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John Miller told him.</p> <p>\u201c-and I\u2019ll clean the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>This, clearly, changed things. John Miller looked at the bananas, then at Dexter. Then at the bananas again. \u201cDoes the one I just ate count as one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>John Miller slapped the table. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not even to my stomach yet, for godsakes!\u201d</p><p>Dexter thought for a second. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll let Remy call this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. They were both looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an unbiased view,\u201d Dexter explained.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your girlfriend,\u201d John Miller complained. \u201cThat\u2019s not unbiased!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is not my girlfriend.\u201d Dexter looked at me, as if this might upset me, which was evidence that he didn\u2019t know me at all. He said, \u201cWhat I mean is, we may be seeing each other\u201d-and here he paused, as if waiting for me to chime in with something, which I didn\u2019t, so he went on-\u201cbut you are your own person with your opinions and convictions. Correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his girlfriend,\u201d I told John Miller.</p><p>\u201cShe loves me,\u201d Dexter said to him, as an aside, and I felt my face flame. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, moving on breezily, \u201cRemy? What do you think? Does it count or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI think it should count somehow. Perhaps as half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf!\u201d Dexter looked at me as if he was just so pleased, as if he had carved me out of clay himself. \u201cPerfect. So, if you choose to accept this challenge, you must eat nine and a half bananas.\u201d</p><p>John Miller thought about this for a second. Later, I would learn that money was always scarce at the yellow house, and these challenges provided some balance of cash flow from one person to another. Twenty bucks was food and beer money for at least a couple of days. And it was really only nine bananas. And a half.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d John Miller said. And they shook on it.</p><p>Before the challenge could happen, witnesses had to be gathered. Ted was brought in from the back deck, along with a girl he\u2019d been seeing, introduced to me as Scary Mary (I chose not to ask), and, after a futile search for the keyboardist, Lucas, Dexter\u2019s dog Monkey was agreed upon as a suitable replacement. We all gathered around the table, or on the long, ugly brown couch that was next to the refrigerator, while John Miller did some deep breathing and stretching, as if preparing for a fifty-yard dash.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ted, the only one with a working watch and therefore timekeeper, said, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>If you\u2019ve never seen someone take on a food challenge, as I had not at that point, you might expect it to actually be exciting. Except that the challenge was not to eat nine and a half bananas quickly: it was just to eat nine and a half bananas. So by banana four or so, boredom set in, and Ted and Scary Mary went to the Waffle House, leaving me, Dexter, and Monkey to wait out the next five and a half bananas. It turned out we didn\u2019t have to: John Miller conceded defeat in the middle of banana six, then carefully got to his feet and went to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d I told Dexter as the door shut behind him, the lock clicking.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he said easily, stretching back in his chair. \u201cYou should have seen him last month, when he ate fifteen eggs in a row. Then we were worried. He turned bright red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cfunny how it\u2019s never you having to eat vast quantities of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. I just moved on after completing the master of all challenges back in April.\u201d</p><p>I hated to even ask what would earn such a title, but curiosity got the better of me. \u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two ounces of Miracle Whip,\u201d he said. \u201cIn twenty minutes flat.\u201d</p><p>Just the thought of this made my stomach twist. I hated mayonnaise, and any derivation thereof: egg salad, tuna salad, even deviled eggs. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He said it proudly. \u201cI could never top it, even if I tried.\u201d</p><p>I had to wonder what kind of person got such satisfaction from constant competitiveness. And Dexter would make challenges about anything, whether it was in his control or not. Some recent favorites included I Bet You a Quarter the Next Car That Passes Is Either Blue or Green, Five Bucks Says I Can Make Something Edible Out of the Canned Corn, French-Fried Potato Sticks, and Mustard in the Pantry, and, of course, How Many States Can You Name While That Woman Picks Up Her Dry Cleaning?</p><p>I, personally, was up to twenty. Dexter was at nineteen and experiencing a bit of a brain cramp.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia,\u201d he said finally, casting a nervous look at the front of the cleaners, where we could see the woman talking to someone behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cAlready said it,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWisconsin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth Carolina.\u201d</p><p>The door opened: it was her. \u201cGame over,\u201d I said. \u201cI win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not!\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I held up my fingers, where I\u2019d been keeping track. \u201cI win by one,\u201d I said. \u201cPay up.\u201d</p><p>He started to reach into his pockets, sighing, then instead pulled me closer, spreading his fingers around my waist, burying his face in my neck.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said, putting my hands on his chest, \u201cwon\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your slave,\u201d he said into my ear, and I felt a chill run up my back, then cast it off just as quickly, reminding myself again that I always had a boyfriend in summer, someone that caught my eye after school was finished and usually lasted right up until the beach trip my family took each August. The only difference this time was that I was going west instead of east. And I liked being able to think about it that way, in terms of a compass, something set in stone that would remain, unchanged, long after I was gone.</p> <p>Besides, I knew already we would never work long-term. He was so imperfect already, his cracks and fissures apparent. I could only imagine what structural damage lay beneath, deep in the foundation. But still, it was hard to keep my head clear as he kissed me there, in July, with another challenge behind me. After all, I was up now, and it still seemed like we had time.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, has he been given The Speech yet?\u201d Jess asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chloe told her. \u201cThe question is, have you slept with him yet?\u201d</p><p>They all looked at me. It wasn\u2019t rude for them to ask, of course: usually this was common knowledge-once, common assumption. But now I hesitated, which was unnerving.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said finally. There was a quick intake of breath-shock!-from somebody, then silence.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Lissa said finally. \u201cYou like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d I said, not refuting this exactly, which set off another round of silence and exchanged looks. Out at the Spot, with the sun going down, I felt the trampoline bounce lightly beneath me and leaned back, spreading my fingers over the cool metal of the springs.</p><p>\u201cNo Speech, no sex,\u201d Jess said, summing up. \u201cThis is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s different,\u201d Lissa offered, stirring her drink with one finger.</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s different,\u201d Chloe told her. \u201cRemy knows that better than any of us.\u201d</p><p>It says something about my absolute adherence to a plan concerning relationships that my best friends had terms, like outline headings, detailing my actions. The Speech usually came right as the heady, romantic, fun-new-boyfriend phase was boiling to full steam. It was my way of hitting the brakes, slowly downshifting, and usually involved me pulling whatever Ken was in my life at that time aside to say something like: hey, I really like you and we\u2019re having fun, but you know, I can\u2019t get too serious because I\u2019m going to the beach/really going to focus on school come fall/just getting over someone and not up to anything long-term. This was the summer speech: the winter/holiday one was pretty much the same, except you inserted I\u2019m going skiing/really going to have to rally until graduation/dealing with a lot of family crap for the last part. And usually, guys took it one of two ways. If they really liked me, as in wear-my-class-ring-love-me-always, they bolted, which was just as well. If they liked me but were willing to slow down, to see boundaries, they nodded and saved face by saying they felt the same way. And then I was free to proceed to the next step, which-and I\u2019m not proud-usually involved sleeping with them.</p> <p>But not right away. Never right away, not anymore. I liked to have enough time invested to see a few cracks and get rid of anyone whose failings I knew I couldn\u2019t deal with in the long term, i.e., more than the six weeks that usually encompassed the fun-new-boyfriend phase.</p><p>Once, I was easy. Now, I was choosy. See? Big difference. And besides, something was different about Dexter. Whenever I tried to revert to my set outline, something stopped me. I could give him the talk, and he\u2019d probably be fine with it. I could sleep with him, and he\u2019d be fine-more than fine-with that too. But somewhere, deep in my conscious mind, something niggled me that maybe he wouldn\u2019t, that maybe he\u2019d think less of me, or something. I knew it was stupid.</p><p>And besides, I\u2019d just been busy. That was probably it, really.</p><p>Chloe opened her bottled water, took a swig, then chased it with a sip from the tiny bottle of bourbon in her hand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked me, point blank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just having fun,\u201d I replied, taking a swig of my Diet Zip. It seemed easy to say this, having just run through it in my head. \u201cHe\u2019s leaving at the end of the summer too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you given him The Speech?\u201d Jess asked.</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d I said, and then shook my cup, stalling. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>They looked at one another, considering the implications of this. Lissa said, \u201cI think he\u2019s really nice, Remy. He\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s clumsy,\u201d Jess grumbled. \u201cHe keeps stepping on my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Chloe said, as if it was just occurring to her, \u201cyou just have big feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jess replied, \u201cyou should shut up.\u201d</p><p>Lissa sighed, closing her eyes. \u201cYou guys. Please. We\u2019re talking about Remy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about Remy,\u201d I said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t. Let\u2019s talk about somebody else.\u201d</p><p>There was silence for a second: I sucked down some more of my drink, Lissa lit a cigarette. Finally Chloe said, \u201cYou know, the other night Dexter said he\u2019d give me ten bucks if I could stand on my head for twenty minutes. What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>They all looked at me. I said, \u201cJust ignore him. Next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Adam\u2019s seeing someone else,\u201d Lissa said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cNow, see, this is interesting.\u201d</p><p>Lissa ran her finger over the rim of her cup, her head down, one curl bouncing slightly with the movement. It had been about a month since Adam had dumped her, and she\u2019d moved through her weepy stage to just kind of sad all the time, with occasional moments when I actually heard her laugh out loud, then stop, as if she\u2019d forgotten she wasn\u2019t supposed to be happy.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Chloe asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She drives a red Mazda.\u201d</p><p>Jess looked at me, shaking her head. I said, \u201cLissa, have you been driving by his house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and then looked up at us. We, of course, were all staring back at her, knowing she was lying. \u201cNo! But the other day there was construction on Willow and then I-\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you want him to think you\u2019re weak?\u201d Jess asked her. \u201cDo you want to give him that satisfaction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can he already be with somebody else?\u201d Lissa asked her, and Jess just sighed, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m not even totally okay yet, and he\u2019s with someone else? How can that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a jerk,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a guy,\u201d Chloe added. \u201cAnd guys don\u2019t get attached, guys don\u2019t ever give themselves over completely, and guys lie. That\u2019s why they should be handled with great trepidation, not trusted, and held at arm\u2019s length whenever possible. Right, Remy?\u201d</p> <p>I looked at her, and there it was again: that shifting of her eyes that meant she\u2019d seen something in me lately she didn\u2019t recognize, and it worried her. Because if I wasn\u2019t cold, hard Remy, then she couldn\u2019t be the Chloe she was, either.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, and smiled at Lissa. I had to lead the way here, of course. She\u2019d never make it out otherwise. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>The band wasn\u2019t called the G Flats at all. That was just their wedding persona, the one they had been forced to take on because of an incident involving the van, some authorities in Pennsylvania, and Don\u2019s brother Michael, who was an attorney there. Apparently playing at my mother\u2019s wedding had been some kind of payback, but it had also seemed like the right time to relocate, as the band-whose real name was Truth Squad-did every summer.</p><p>For the past two years, they\u2019d worked their way across the country, always following the same process: find a town with a decent local music scene, rent a cheap apartment, and start playing the clubs. In the first week they all got day jobs, preferably at the same place, since they shared one mode of transportation. (So now, Dexter and Lucas worked at Flash Camera, while John Miller fixed lattes at Jump Java, and Ted bagged groceries at Mayor\u2019s Market.) Although most of the guys had some college, or, in Ted\u2019s case, a diploma, they always got easy jobs that didn\u2019t require much overtime or thinking. Then they\u2019d hit the local club scene, hoping to land a regular weekly gig, as they had at Bendo. Tuesday nights, which were the slowest there, were now all theirs.</p><p>They\u2019d only been in town for a couple of days when I\u2019d first met Dexter at Don\u2019s Motors: they were sleeping in the van then, in the city park, until they found the yellow house. Now it seemed they\u2019d stick around until they were run out of town for owing money or small legal infractions (it had happened before) or just got bored. Everything was planned to be transitory: they boasted that they could pack up and be gone in an hour flat, already drawing a finger across the wrinkled map in the van\u2019s glove box, seeking out a new destination.</p> <p>So maybe that was what kept me from giving The Speech, this idea that his life was just as impermanent at this moment as mine. I didn\u2019t want to be like other girls that were probably in other towns, listening to Truth Squad bootlegs and pining for Dexter Jones, born in Washington, D.C., a Pisces, lead singer, thrower of challenges, permanent address unknown. His history was as murky as mine was clear, with his dog seeming to be the only family in which he had interest. I was soon to be Remy Starr, formerly of Lakeview, now of Stanford, undecided major, leaning toward economics. We were only converging for a few weeks, fleeting. No need to follow protocol.</p><p>That night me, Chloe, Jess, and Lissa got to Bendo around nine. Truth Squad was already playing, and the crowd was thin but enthusiastic. I noted, then quickly made a point of not noting, that it was mostly made up of girls, a few of them crowded up close, next to the stage, holding their beers and swaying to the music.</p><p>The music, in fact, was a mix of covers and originals. The covers were, as Dexter put it, \u201ca necessary evil\u201d-required at weddings, and useful at clubs, at least at the beginning of sets, to prevent being beaned with beer caps and cigarette butts. (This, apparently, had happened as well.) But Dexter and Ted, who had started the band during their junior year of high school, preferred their original compositions, the biggest and most ambitious of which were the potato songs.</p><p>By the time we sat down, the band was finishing the last verse of \u201cGimme Three Steps\u201d as the assembled girls clapped and whoo-whooed. Then there was a few seconds of practice chords, some conferring between Ted and Dexter, and then Dexter said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do an original song for you all now, an instant classic. Folks, this is \u2018The Potato Song.\u2019\u201d</p><p>More cheering from the girls, one of whom-a buxom redhead with broad shoulders I recognized from the perpetual lines for the ladies\u2019 room-moved closer to the stage, so that she was practically at Dexter\u2019s feet. He smiled down at her, politely.</p><p>\u201cI saw her in the produce section,\u201d he began, \u201clate last Saturday. It hadn\u2019t been but seven days since she went away...\u201d</p> <p>Another loud whoop, from someone who was, apparently, already fond of \u201cThe Potato Song.\u201d Good thing, I thought. There were dozens where that came from.</p><p>\u201cOnce she\u2019d loved my filet mignon, my carnivore inklings,\u201d Dexter continued, \u201cbut now she was a vegan princess, living off of beans. She\u2019d given up the cheese and bacon, sworn off Burger King, and when I wouldn\u2019t do the same she gave me back my ring. I stood there by the romaine lettuce, feeling my heart pine\u201d -and here he put a hand over his chest, and looked mournful, to which the crowd cheered- \u201cwishing that this meatless beauty still would be all mine. She turned around to go to checkout, fifteen items or less. And I knew this was the last go-round, so this is what I said...\u201d</p><p>He stopped here, letting the music build, and John Miller drummed a bit faster, the beat picking up. I could see some people in the crowd already mouthing the words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever give me no rotten tomato, \u2019cause all I ever wanted was your sweet potato,\u201d Dexter sang. \u201cMashed, whipped, creamed, smothered, chunked, and diced, anyway you fix it baby sure tastes nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a song?\u201d Jess asked me, but Lissa was laughing now, clapping along.</p><p>\u201cThis is many songs,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s an opus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d she said, but I didn\u2019t even repeat it, because now the song was reaching its climax, which was basically a recitation of every possible kind of vegetable. The crowd was shouting things out, and Dexter was singing hard, winding up the song: when they finished, with a crashing of cymbals, the crowd burst into loud applause. Dexter leaned into the microphone, said they\u2019d be back in a few minutes, and then got down off the stage, grabbing a plastic cup off a speaker as he did so. I watched as the redheaded girl walked up to him, zeroing in, effectively cutting off his path as he started across the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOoh, Remy,\u201d Chloe said, noticing this too, \u201cyour man has a groupie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my man,\u201d I said, taking a sip of my beer.</p><p>\u201cRemy\u2019s with the band,\u201d Chloe told Jess, who snorted. \u201cSo much for that no-musicians rule. Next thing you know she\u2019ll be on the bus and selling T-shirts in the parking lot, showing off her boobs to get in the stage door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least she has boobs to show,\u201d Jess said.</p> <p>\u201cI have boobs,\u201d Chloe said, pointing to her chest. \u201cJust because they\u2019re not weighing me down doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not substantial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, B cup,\u201d Jess said, taking a sip of her drink.</p><p>\u201cI have boobs!\u201d Chloe said again, a bit too loudly-she\u2019d already had a couple of minibottles at the Spot. \u201cMy boobs are great, goddammit. You know that? They\u2019re fantastic! My boobs are amazing. \u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d I said, but of course then it was too late. Not only were two guys standing nearby now completely absorbed in checking out her chest, but Dexter was sliding in beside me, a bemused look on his face. Chloe flushed red-rare for her-while Lissa patted her sympathetically on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSo it is true,\u201d Dexter said finally. \u201cGirls do talk about boobs when they\u2019re in groups. I always thought so, but I never had proof.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChloe was just making a point,\u201d Lissa explained to him.</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Dexter said, and Chloe brushed a hand through her hair and turned her head, as if she was suddenly fascinated by the wall. \u201cSo anyway,\u201d he said brightly, moving on, \u201c\u2018The Potato Song\u2019 really went over well, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, moving in closer as he slid his arm around my waist. That was the thing about Dexter: he wasn\u2019t totally touchy-feely, like Jonathan had been, but he had these signature moves that I liked. The hand around my waist, for one, but then there was this thing that made me crazy, the way he cupped his fingers around the back of my neck, putting them just so, so that his thumb touched a pulse point. It was so hard to explain, but it gave me a chill, every time, almost like he was touching my heart.</p><p>I looked up and Chloe had her eye on me, vigilant as ever. I shook off these thoughts, quick, and finished my beer just as Ted came up.</p><p>\u201cNice work on that second verse,\u201d was the first thing he said, and not nicely, but in a sarcastic, snarky way. \u201cYou know, if you butcher the words you do the song a disservice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cButcher what words?\u201d Dexter said.</p> <p>Ted sighed, loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she was a vegan princess, living off of beans. It\u2019s she\u2019s a vegan princess, living off beans.\u201d</p><p>Dexter just looked at him, completely nonplussed, as if he\u2019d just given the weather report. Chloe said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire world is the difference!\u201d Ted snapped. \u201c Living off of beans is proper English, which brings with it the connotation of higher society, accepted standards, and the status quo. Living off beans, however, is reminiscent of a more slang culture, realistic, and a lower class, which is indicative of both the speaker in the song and the music that accompanies it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this from one word?\u201d Jess asked him.</p><p>\u201cOne word,\u201d Ted replied, dead serious, \u201ccan change the whole world.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment while we all considered this. Finally Lissa said to Chloe, loud enough for all of us to hear (she\u2019d had a minibottle or two herself), \u201cI bet he did really well on his SATs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Chloe said, just as loudly.</p><p>\u201cTed,\u201d Dexter said, \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying. And I understand. Thanks for pointing out the distinction, and I won\u2019t make the mistake again.\u201d</p> <p>Ted just stood there, blinking. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, somewhat uneasily. \u201cGood. Well. Uh, I\u2019m gonna go smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Dexter said, and with that Ted walked away, cutting through the crowd toward the bar. A couple of girls standing by the door eyed him as he passed, nodding at each other. God, this band thing was sick. Some women had no shame.</p><p>\u201cVery impressive,\u201d I said to Dexter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of practice,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou see, Ted is very passionate. And really, all he wants is to be heard. Hear him, nod, agree. Three steps. Easy cheesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy cheesy,\u201d I repeated, and then he slid his hand up to my neck, pressing his fingers just so, and I got that weird feeling again. This time, it wasn\u2019t so easy to shake, and as Dexter moved closer to me, kissing my forehead, I closed my eyes and wondered how deep I\u2019d let this get before ducking out. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be the whole summer. Maybe I needed to derail it sooner, to prevent a real crash in the end.</p><p>\u201cPaging Dexter,\u201d a voice came from the front of the club. I looked up: it was John Miller, squinting in the house lights. \u201cPaging Dexter. You are needed on aisle five for a price check.\u201d</p><p>The redheaded girl was back at the stage, right up close. She turned her head and followed John Miller\u2019s gaze, right to us. To me. And I looked right back at her, feeling possessive suddenly of something that I wasn\u2019t even sure I should want to claim as mine.</p><p>\u201cGotta go,\u201d Dexter said. Then he leaned into my ear and added, \u201cWait for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed, as if this was a joke, and disappeared into the crowd. A few seconds later I watched him climb onstage, so lanky and clumsy: he tagged a speaker with one foot, sending it toppling, as he headed to the mike. One of his shoelaces, of course, was undone.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Chloe said. She was looking right at me, shaking her head, and I told myself she was wrong, so wrong, even as she spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re a goner.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cI thought this was a cookout. You know, dogs and burgers, Tater Tots, ambrosia salad.\u201d Dexter picked up a box of Twinkies, tossing them into the cart. \u201cAnd Twinkies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I said, consulting the list again before I picked a four-dollar glass jar of imported sun-dried tomatoes off the shelf. \u201cExcept that it\u2019s a cookout thrown by my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d I said, \u201cmy mother doesn\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, waiting.</p><p>\u201cAt all. My mother doesn\u2019t cook at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must cook sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone can make scrambled eggs, Remy. It\u2019s programmed into you at birth, the default setting. Like being able to swim and knowing not to mix pickles with oatmeal. You just know. \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d I told him, pushing the cart farther up the aisle as he lagged along beside, taking long, loping steps, \u201cdoesn\u2019t even like scrambled eggs. She only eats eggs Benedict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d he said, stopping as he was momentarily distracted by a large plastic water gun that was displayed, right at kid\u2019s eye level, in the middle of the cereal section.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what eggs Benedict is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d he asked, picking up the water gun and pulling the trigger, which made a click-click-click sound. He pointed it around the corner, like a sniper, taking shelter behind a display of canned corn.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a way of making eggs that is really complicated and fancy and involves hollandaise sauce,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd English muffins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d He made a face, then shuddered. \u201cI hate English muffins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish muffins,\u201d he said, putting the water gun back as we started walking again. \u201cI can\u2019t eat them. I can\u2019t even think about them. In fact, we should stop talking about them right now.\u201d</p><p>We paused in front of the spices: my mother wanted something called Asian Fish Sauce. I peered closely at all the bottles, already frustrated, while Dexter busied himself juggling some boxes of Sweet \u2019n Low. Shopping with him, as I\u2019d discovered, was like having a toddler in tow. He was constantly distracted, grabbing at things, and we\u2019d already taken on entirely too many impulse items, all of which I intended to rid the cart of at the checkout when he wasn\u2019t looking.</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean to tell me,\u201d I said, reaching up as I spotted the fish sauce, \u201cthat you can eat an entire jar of mayonnaise in one sitting but find English muffins, which are basically just bread, to be disgusting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUghhh.\u201d He shuddered again, a full-body one this time, and put a hand on his stomach. \u201cIcks-nay on the uffins-may. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>It was taking us forever. My mother\u2019s list only had about fifteen things on it, but they were all specialty items: imported goat cheese, focaccia bread, an incredibly specific brand of olives in the red bottle, not the green. Plus there was the new grill she\u2019d bought just for the occasion-the nicest one at the specialty hardware store, according to Chris, who didn\u2019t keep her from overspending as I would have-plus the brand-new patio furniture (otherwise, where would we sit?), and my mother was spending a small fortune on what was supposed to be a simple Fourth of July barbecue.</p><p>This had been all her idea. She\u2019d been working away at her book ever since she and Don had returned from the honeymoon, but a few days earlier she\u2019d emerged midday with an inspiration: a real, all-American Fourth of July cookout with the family. Chris and Jennifer Anne should come, and Don\u2019s secretary, Patty, who was single, poor thing, and wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if she hit it off with my mother\u2019s decorator, Jorge, who we just had to have over to thank for all his hard work on the addition? And wouldn\u2019t it be such a great way for everyone to meet my new beau (insert me cringing here) and christen the new patio and our wonderful, amazing, beautiful lives together as a blended family?</p><p>Oh, yes. It would. Of course.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dexter said to me now, stepping in front of the cart, which I\u2019d been pushing, apparently, faster and faster as these stress thoughts filled my head. It knocked him in the gut, forcing him backward, and he put his hands on it, pushing it back to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, trying to get the cart going again. No luck. He wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you just got this look on your face like your brain was caving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks ever so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019re biting your lip. You only do that when you\u2019re about to shift into superobsessive, what-if mode.\u201d</p><p>I just looked at him. As if I was that easy to figure out, a puzzle that could be cracked in, how long had it been, two weeks? It was insulting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said coolly.</p><p>\u201cAh! The ice queen voice. Which means, of course, that I\u2019m right.\u201d He came around the cart, holding the edge, and stood behind me, putting his hands over mine. He started pushing and walking in his goofy way, forcing me to fall into his rhythm, which felt as awkward as it looked, like walking with a shoeful of marbles. \u201cWhat if I embarrass you?\u201d he said, as if posing a theory, like, say, quantum physics. \u201cWhat if I break some heirloom family china? Or talk about your underwear?\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, then pushed the cart harder, making him stumble. But he hung on, pulling me back against him, his fingers spreading across my stomach. Then he leaned down and whispered, right in my ear, \u201cWhat if I throw down a challenge to Don, right there over dinner, daring him to eat that entire jar of sun-dried tomatoes and chase it with a stick of margarine? And what if \u201d-and here he gasped, dramatically-\u201coh my God, he does it?\u201d</p> <p>I covered my face with my hand, shaking my head. I hated it when he made me laugh when I didn\u2019t want to: it seemed some huge loss of control, so unlike me, like the most glaring of character flaws.</p><p>\u201cBut you know,\u201d he said, still in my ear, \u201cthat probably won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I told him, and he kissed my neck, finally letting go of the cart.</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d he replied, and started down the aisle, already distracted by a huge display of Velveeta cheese in the dairy section. \u201cNever true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Remy. I hear you\u2019re going to Stanford!\u201d</p><p>I nodded and smiled, shifting my drink to my other hand, and felt with my tongue to see if I had spinach in my teeth. I didn\u2019t. But Don\u2019s secretary, Patty, who I hadn\u2019t seen since her tearful bit at the wedding reception, was standing in front of me expectantly, with a nice big piece wedged around an incisor.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, dabbing at her forehead with a napkin, \u201cit\u2019s just a wonderful school. You must be really excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I told her. Then I reached up, nonchalantly, and brushed at one of my teeth, hoping that somehow she would subconsciously pick up on this, like osmosis, and get the hint. But no. She was still smiling at me, fresh sweat beading her forehead as she gulped down the rest of her wine and glanced around, wondering what to say next.</p><p>She was distracted suddenly, as was I, by a small commotion over by the brand-new grill, where Chris had been assigned to prepare the incredibly expensive steaks my mother had special ordered from the butcher. They were, I\u2019d heard her tell someone, \u201cBrazilian beef,\u201d whatever that meant, as if cows from below the equator were of greater value than your average Holstein chewing cud in Michigan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chris wasn\u2019t doing well. First he\u2019d burned off part of an eyebrow and a fair amount of arm hair lighting the grill. Then he\u2019d had some trouble mastering the complicated spatula in the top-of-the-line accessories set the salesman had convinced my mother she absolutely had to have, resulting in one of the steaks being flung across the patio, where it landed with a slap on one of the imported loafers of our decorator, Jorge.</p><p>Now the flames on the grill were leaping as Chris struggled with the gas valve. All of us assembled stood there, holding our drinks as the fire shot up, making the steaks scream and sizzle, then died out completely, the grill making a gurgling noise. My mother, deep in conversation with one of our neighbors, glanced over in a disinterested way, as if this methodic burning and destruction of the main course was someone else\u2019s problem.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Chris called as the flames shot up again and he batted at them with the spatula, \u201cit\u2019s under control.\u201d He sounded about as sure of this as he looked, which was to say, with half a right eyebrow and the smell of singed hair still lingering, not very.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, please!\u201d my mother called out, covering gamely by gesturing at the table where we\u2019d set up all the cheeses and appetizers. \u201cEat, eat! We\u2019ve got so much food here!\u201d</p> <p>Chris was waving smoke out of his face while Jennifer Anne stood off to his left, biting her lip. She\u2019d brought several side dishes, all in plastic containers with matching, pastel-colored lids. On the bottom of each lid, in permanent marker, was written PROPERTY OF JENNIFER A. BAKER, PLEASE RETURN. As if the whole world was part of an international conspiracy to steal her Tupperware.</p><p>\u201cBarbara,\u201d Patty called out, \u201cthis is just wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d my mother said, fanning her face with her hand. She was in black pants and a lime green tank top that showed off her honeymoon tan, her hair pulled back in a headband: she looked the picture of suburban entertaining, as if at any moment she might light a tiki torch and spray some Cheez Whiz onto crackers.</p><p>It was always interesting to see how my mother\u2019s relationships manifested themselves in her personality. With my dad she was a hippie-in all the pictures I\u2019d seen she looked so young, wearing gauzy skirts or frayed jeans, her hair long and black and parted right down the middle. During the time she was married to Harold, the professor, she\u2019d gone academic, sporting a lot of tweed and wearing her reading glasses all the time, even though she saw well enough without them. Once married to Win, the doctor, she\u2019d gone country club, in little sweater sets and tennis skirts, though she couldn\u2019t play to save her life. And with Martin, the golf pro-who she\u2019d met, of course, at the country club-she went into a young phase, since he was six years her junior: short skirts, jeans, little flimsy dresses. Now, as Don\u2019s wife, Barb, she\u2019d gone subdivision on us: I could just see them, years from now, wearing matching jogging suits and riding around in a golf cart, en route to work on their back swing. I really did hope this was my mother\u2019s last marriage: I wasn\u2019t sure she, or I, could take another incarnation.</p><p>Now I watched as Don, wearing a golf shirt and drinking a beer in the bottle, helped himself to another of the crostini, popping it into his mouth. I\u2019d expected him to be the grill master, but he didn\u2019t even seem to be that fond of food at all, in fact, judging by the vast quantities of Ensure that he consumed, those little cans of liquid diet that claim to have all the nutritional value of a good meal with the convenience of a pop-top. He bought them by the case at Sam\u2019s Club. For some reason, this bothered me even more than my now breasty breakfasts, seeing Don walking through the house reading the newspaper, in his leather slippers, a can of Ensure seemingly affixed to his hand, the fffftttt sound of him popping the top now signaling his presence.</p> <p>\u201cRemy, honey?\u201d my mother called out. \u201cCan you come here a second?\u201d</p><p>I made my excuses to Patty and walked across the patio, where my mother slid her hand around my wrist, pulled me gently close to her, and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m wondering if I should be worried about the steaks.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at the grill, where Chris had positioned himself in such a way that it was difficult-but not impossible-to see that the prime Brazilian beef cuts had been reduced to small, black objects resembling lava rocks.</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d I told her, and she absently brushed her fingers over my skin. My mother\u2019s hands were always cool, even in the hottest of weather. I suddenly had a flash of her pressing a palm to my forehead when I was a child, checking for fever, and me thinking this then too. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Remy,\u201d she said, squeezing my hand. \u201cWhat am I going to do without you?\u201d</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d come home it had been like this, these sudden moments when her face changed and I knew she was thinking that I might actually go to Stanford after all, that it was really about to happen. She had her new husband, her new wing, her new book. She\u2019d be fine without me, and we both knew it. This is what daughters did. They left, and came home later with lives of their own. It was a basic plot in any number of her books: girl strikes out, makes good, finds love, gets revenge. In that order. The making good and striking out part I liked. The rest would just be bonus.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Mom,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou won\u2019t even know I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, shaking her head, and pulled me close, kissing my cheek. I could smell her perfume, mixed with hair spray, and I closed my eyes for a second, breathing it in. With all the changes, some things stayed the same.</p><p>Which is exactly what I was thinking as I stood in the kitchen, pulling the hamburgers I\u2019d bought out of the back of the refrigerator, where I\u2019d camouflaged them behind a stack of Ensures. At the supermarket, when Dexter had asked why I was buying this stuff even though it wasn\u2019t on the list, I\u2019d just told him that I liked to be prepared for any eventuality, because you just never knew. Could be I was too cynical. Or maybe, unlike so many others who moved in my mother\u2019s orbit, I had just learned from the past.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it is true.\u201d I turned around to see Jennifer Anne standing behind me. In one hand, she had two packs of hot dogs: in the other, a bag of buns. She half-smiled, as if we\u2019d both been caught doing something, and said, \u201cGreat minds think alike, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am impressed,\u201d I told her as she came over and opened one of the packs, arranging the dogs on a plate. \u201cYou know her well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, but I do know Christopher,\u201d she said. \u201cI had my reservations about that grill from the day we brought it home from the store. He went in there and just got bedazzled. As soon as the guy started talking about convection, he was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvection?\u201d I said.</p><p>She sighed, pushing her hair out of her face. \u201cIt has to do with the heating process,\u201d she explained. \u201cInstead of the heat just rising up, it surrounds the food. That\u2019s what got Christopher in. The guy just kept saying it, like a mantra. It surrounds the food. It surrounds the food.\u201d</p><p>I snorted, and she glanced over at me, then smiled, almost tentatively, as if she had to check first to make sure I wasn\u2019t making fun of her. Then we just stood there, both of us stacking meat products, for a second, until I decided we were on the verge of a Hallmark moment and had to take action.</p> <p>\u201cSo anyway,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m wondering how we\u2019re going to explain this last-minute menu substitution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe steaks were bad,\u201d she said simply. \u201cThey smelled off. And this is just so kitschy, all-American, burger and dogs. Your mom will love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, picking up my plate of patties. She grabbed the buns and her plate, then started toward the door to the patio. I followed behind, glad to let her handle it.</p><p>We were halfway out the door when she turned her head, nodding to the front yard, and said, \u201cLooks like your guest has arrived.\u201d</p><p>I glanced out the window. Sure enough, there was Dexter, coming down the sidewalk, a good half hour late. He was carrying a bottle of wine (impressive) and wearing jeans and a clean white T-shirt (even more so). He was also holding a leash, the other end of which was attached to Monkey, who was charging ahead, tongue out, at a speed that seemed impressive considering his old age.</p> <p>\u201cCan you take this?\u201d I asked Jennifer Anne, handing over my plate of patties.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you outside.\u201d</p><p>As I came down the driveway, the screen door slamming behind me, Dexter was tying Monkey\u2019s leash to our mailbox. I could hear him talking to the dog as I came up, just as you would talk to anyone, and Monkey had his head cocked to the side, still panting, as if he was listening carefully and waiting for his turn to respond.</p><p>\u201c... might not be into dogs, so you\u2019ll just stay here, okay?\u201d Dexter was saying, tying the leash into a knot, then another knot, as if Monkey, whose back leg was trembling even as he sat down, possessed some form of superhuman strength. \u201cAnd then later, we\u2019ll go find a pool so you can take a dip, and then maybe, if we\u2019re really feeling crazy, we\u2019ll take a ride in the van and you can put your head out the window. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Monkey kept panting, closing his eyes as Dexter scratched under his chin. As I came closer he saw me and started wagging his tail, the sound a dull thump against the grass.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dexter said, turning around. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. Had a little problem with the Monkster here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA problem?\u201d I said, squatting down beside him and letting Monkey sniff my hand.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dexter said, \u201cI\u2019ve been so busy with work and the gigs and all that, you know, I\u2019ve kind of neglected him. He\u2019s lonely. He doesn\u2019t know any other dogs here, and he\u2019s really quite social. He\u2019s used to having a whole network of friends.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, then at Monkey, who was now busy chewing his own haunch. \u201cI see,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was getting ready to leave this afternoon, and he was following me around, all pathetic. Whining. Scratching at my shoes.\u201d He rubbed his hand over the top of Monkey\u2019s head, pulling on his ears in a way that looked painful but that the dog seemed to love, making a low, happy noise in his throat. \u201cHe can just stay out here, right?\u201d Dexter asked me, standing up. Monkey wagged his tail hopefully, perking up his ears, the way he always seemed to do at the sound of Dexter\u2019s voice. \u201cHe won\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring him some water.\u201d</p><p>Dexter smiled at me, a nice smile, as if I\u2019d surprised him. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and then added, to Monkey, \u201cSee, I told you. She likes you.\u201d</p><p>Monkey was back to chewing his haunch now, as if this last fact didn\u2019t concern him much. Then I got him some water from the garage, Dexter double-checked the leash knot again, and we headed around the side of the house, where I could already smell hot dogs cooking.</p><p>My mother was deep in conversation with Patty when we walked up, but at the sight of Dexter she stopped talking, put a hand to her chest-a trademark fluttering gesture-and said, \u201cWell, hello. You must be Dexter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d Dexter said, taking her hand as she extended it and shaking it.</p><p>\u201cI recognize you from the wedding!\u201d she said, as if just now putting this together, even though I\u2019d told her at least twice about the connection. \u201cWhat a wonderful singer you are!\u201d</p><p>Dexter seemed pleased and somewhat embarrassed at this. My mother was still holding his hand. \u201cGreat wedding,\u201d he said finally. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you must have something to drink,\u201d my mother said, glancing around for me, and of course, I was right there between them. \u201cRemy, honey, offer Dexter a beer. Or some wine? Or a soft drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer would be fine,\u201d Dexter said to me.</p><p>\u201cRemy, sweetie, there\u2019s some more cold in the fridge, okay?\u201d My mother put a hand on my back, effectively steering me toward the kitchen, then hooked her arm in Dexter\u2019s and said, \u201cYou have to meet Jorge, he\u2019s just this brilliant decorator. Jorge! Come here, you absolutely have to meet Remy\u2019s new boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>Jorge started across the patio as my mother kept trilling about how fabulous everyone within a five-foot radius was. Meanwhile, I headed into the kitchen to fetch Dexter a beer, like hired help. By the time I brought it back out to him Don had joined the conversation and now everyone was discussing, for some weird reason, Milwaukee.</p><p>\u201cColdest weather I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d Don was saying, popping a handful of imported nuts into his mouth. \u201cThe wind can rip you apart in five minutes there. Plus it\u2019s murder on cars. Salt damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat snow, though,\u201d Dexter said, taking the beer as I handed it to him and managing, very subtly, to brush his fingers with mine as he did so. \u201cAnd the local music scene is really coming on there. It\u2019s early, but it\u2019s there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don huffed at this, taking another swig of his beer. \u201cMusic is not a real career,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until last year this boy was majoring in business, can you believe that? At UVA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that interesting,\u201d my mother said. \u201cNow, tell me again how you two are related?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon is my father\u2019s brother-in-law,\u201d Dexter told her. \u201cHis sister is my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just wonderful!\u201d my mother said, a bit too enthusiastically. \u201cSmall world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Don went on, \u201che had a full scholarship. His way paid. Dropped out. Broke his mother\u2019s heart, and for what? Music.\u201d</p><p>Now, even my mother couldn\u2019t come up with anything to say. I just looked at Don, wondering where this was coming from. Maybe it was the Ensures.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant singer,\u201d my mother said again to Jorge, who nodded, as if he hadn\u2019t already heard this several times. Don seemed to be distracted now, looking out across the patio, holding his empty beer. I glanced at Dexter and realized that I\u2019d never seen him like this: a bit cowed, uncomfortable, unable to come up with the quick funny retort that always seemed so close at hand. He ran a hand through his hair, tugging at it, then glanced around the yard, taking another sip of his beer.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, and slipped my hand around his. \u201cLet\u2019s get some food.\u201d Then I pulled him away, gently, over to the grill, where Chris seemed very happy to be poking at the hot dogs, back in his element.</p><p>\u201cGuess what,\u201d I said, and he glanced up, eyebrows raised. \u201cDon\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d Dexter said. He smiled, as if it wasn\u2019t any big deal, then put an arm over my shoulders. \u201cEvery family has a black sheep, right? It\u2019s the American way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Chris said, flipping a burger. \u201cAt least you weren\u2019t in jail.\u201d</p><p>Dexter took a big swig of his beer. \u201cOnly once,\u201d he said cheerfully, then winked at me. And that was it: so quickly, he was back to his old self, as if all that had just happened was a big joke, one that he was in on, and didn\u2019t bother him in the least. I, however, kept looking at Don, my stomach burning, as if I now had a score to settle. Seeing Dexter so quiet, if only for a second, had somehow made him more real to me. As if for those few moments, he wasn\u2019t just my summer boyfriend but something bigger, something I had a stake in.</p><p>The rest of the evening went well. The burgers and dogs were tasty, and most of the expensive olive-and-sun-dried-tomato spread went uneaten, while Jennifer Anne\u2019s deviled eggs and three-bean salad were a hit. I even saw my mother licking her fingers after consuming a second piece of Jennifer Anne\u2019s chocolate pudding pie, which was garnished with a healthy scoop of Cool Whip. So much for gourmet.</p><p>By dark everyone was saying their good-byes, and my mother disappeared to her room, claiming to be completely wiped out from the party because entertaining, even when other people do most of the work, can be so exhausting. So Jennifer Anne and Chris and Dexter and I stacked the dishes and wrapped things up, tossing most of the gourmet crap and the burned steaks, saving only one, with the blackened stuff trimmed off, for Monkey.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll love it,\u201d Dexter said, taking it from Jennifer Anne, who had wrapped it up in foil, the edges folded neatly. \u201cHe\u2019s really a Dog Chow kind of guy, so this is like Christmas to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat an interesting name he has,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI got him for my tenth birthday,\u201d Dexter told her, glancing outside. \u201cI really wanted a monkey, so I was kind of disappointed. But he\u2019s turned out to be much better. Monkeys get really mean, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Jennifer Anne looked at him, somewhat quizzically, then smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that,\u201d she said, not unkindly, and went back to covering leftover pita bread with Cling Wrap.</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019ve got a minute,\u201d Chris said to Dexter, wiping the counter down with a sponge, \u201cyou should come up and see my hatchlings. They\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Dexter said enthusiastically. Then he looked at me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I said, as if I was his mom or something, and they took off up the stairs, feet clumping, on the way to the lizard room.</p><p>Across the kitchen, Jennifer Anne sighed, shutting the fridge. \u201cI will never understand this hobby of his,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, dogs and cats you can cuddle. Who wants to cuddle a lizard?\u201d</p><p>This seemed like a difficult question to answer, so I just pulled the plug on the drain, where I was washing dishes, and let the water gurgle down noisily. Upstairs, it sounded like the honeycomb hideout: giggling, various oohs and ahhs, and the occasional skittering noise, followed by uproarious laughter.</p> <p>Jennifer Anne cast her eyes up at the ceiling, obviously unnerved. \u201cTell Christopher I\u2019m in the den,\u201d she said, picking up her purse from the sideboard, where it was parked next to her plastic containers, now cleaned, lids accounted for. She drew out a book and headed into the next room, where a few seconds later I heard the TV come on, murmuring softly.</p><p>I picked up the foil-wrapped steak and walked outside, flicking on the porch light. As I came down the front walk Monkey got to his feet and started wagging his tail.</p><p>\u201cHey buddy,\u201d I said. He poked at my hand, then got a whiff of the steak and started nudging my fingers with his nose, snuffling. \u201cGot a treat for you here.\u201d</p><p>Monkey wolfed down the steak in about two bites, almost taking part of my pinky with it. Well, it was dark. When he was done he burped and rolled over onto his back, sticking his belly in the air, and I sat down on the grass beside him.</p><p>It was a nice night, clear and cooler, perfect Fourth of July weather. A few people were popping off firecrackers a couple of streets over, the noise pinging in the dark. Monkey kept rolling closer to me, nudging my elbow, until I finally relented and scratched the matted fur on his belly. He needed a bath. Badly. Plus he had bad breath. But there was something sweet about him, nonetheless, and he was practically humming as I moved my fingers across him.</p><p>We sat there like that for a while until I heard the screen door slam and Dexter call out my name. At the sound of his voice, Monkey instantly sat up, ears perked, and then got to his feet, walking toward it until the leash was stretched to the limit.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dexter said. I couldn\u2019t see his face, just his outline in the brightness of the porch light. Monkey barked, as if he\u2019d called him, and his tail wagging grew frenzied, like intense windmill action, and I wondered if he\u2019d knock himself down with the sheer force of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said back, and he started down the steps toward us. As he came closer across the grass, I watched Monkey, amazed at his full-body excitement to see this person he\u2019d only been away from for an hour or so. What did it feel like, I wondered, to love someone that much? So much that you couldn\u2019t even control yourself when they came close, as if you might just break free of whatever was holding you and throw yourself at them with enough force to easily overwhelm you both. I had to wonder, but Monkey clearly knew: you could see it, feel it coming off him, like a heat. I almost envied him that. Almost.</p><p>It was late that night, when I was lying in Dexter\u2019s room on his bed, that he picked up the guitar. He wasn\u2019t much of a player, he told me, as he sat across the room, shirtless, barefoot, his fingers finding the strings in the dark. He played a little riff of something, a Beatles song, then a few lines of the latest version of \u201cThe Potato Opus.\u201d He didn\u2019t play like Ted, of course: his chords seemed more hesitant, as if he was plucking by sheer luck. I leaned back against the pillows and listened as he sang to me. A bit of this, a bit of that. Nothing in full. And then, just as I felt I might be drifting off to sleep, something else.</p><p>\u201cThis lullaby is only a few words, a simple run of chords-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sat up, now wide awake. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Even in the dark, I could see he was surprised. He dropped his hands from the guitar and looked at me, and I hoped he couldn\u2019t see my face either. Because it was all fun and games, so far. Just a few moments when I worried it might go deep enough to drown me. Like now. And I could pull back, would pull back, before it went that far.</p><p>I\u2019d only told him about the song in a moment of weakness, a time of true confessions, which I usually avoided in relationships. The past was so sticky, full of land mines: I made it a point, usually, not to be so detailed in the map of myself I handed over to a guy. And the song, that song, was one of the biggest keys to me. Like a soft spot, a bruise that never quite healed right. The first place I was sure they would strike back, when the time came for them to do so.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear it?\u201d he asked now.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said again. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been so surprised when I told him. We\u2019d been having our own challenge of sorts, a kind of Guess What You\u2019d Never Know About Me. I found out that he was allergic to raspberries, that he\u2019d busted out his front tooth running into a park bench in sixth grade, that his first girlfriend was a distant cousin of Elvis. And I\u2019d told him that I\u2019d come this close to piercing my belly button before fainting, that one year I\u2019d sold more Girl Scout cookies than anyone else in my troop, and that my father was Thomas Custer, and \u201cThis Lullaby\u201d had been written for me.</p> <p>Of course he knew the song, he said, and then hummed the opening chords, pulling the words out of thin air. They\u2019d even sung it a couple of times at weddings, he said: some brides picked it for the dance with their father. Which seemed so stupid to me, considering the words. I will let you down, it says, right there in the first verse, plain as day. What kind of father says such a thing? But that, of course, was a question I\u2019d long ago quit asking myself.</p><p>He was still strumming the chords, finding them in the dark.</p><p>\u201cDexter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you hate it that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate it. I just... I\u2019m sick of it, that\u2019s all.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t true either. I did hate it sometimes, for the lie that it was. As if my father had been able, with just a few words scribbled in a Motel 6, to excuse the fact that he never bothered to know me. Seven years he\u2019d spent with my mother, most of them good until one last blowout, resulting in him leaving for California, with her pregnant, although she didn\u2019t find that out until later. Two years after I was born, he died of a heart attack, never having made it back across the country to see me. It was the ultimate out, this song, admitting to the world that he\u2019d only disappoint me, and didn\u2019t that just make him so noble, really? As if he was beating me to the punch, his words living forever, while I was left speechless, no rebuttal, no words left to say.</p><p>Dexter strummed the guitar idly, not picking out any real melody, just messing around. He said, \u201cFunny how I\u2019ve heard that song all my life and never knew it was for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a song,\u201d I said, running my fingers over the windowsill, easing them around those snow globes. \u201cI never even knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad. I bet he was a cool guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. It was weird to be talking about my father out loud, something I hadn\u2019t done since sixth grade, when my mother found therapy the way some people find God and dragged us all in for group, individual, and art until her money ran out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly, and I was unnerved by how solemn he sounded, how serious. As if he\u2019d found that map after all and was dangerously close, circling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said.</p><p>He was quiet for a second, and I had a flash of his face earlier that night, caught unaware by Don\u2019s pronouncements, and the vulnerability I\u2019d seen there. It had unsettled me, because I was used to the Dexter I liked, the funny guy with the skinny waist and the fingers that pressed against my neck just so. In just seconds I\u2019d seen another shade of him, and if it had been light where we were now, he\u2019d have seen the same of me. So I was grateful, as I had been so often in my life, for the dark.</p><p>I rolled over and pressed myself into the pillow, listening to the sound of my own breathing. I heard him move, a soft noise as the guitar was put down, and next his arms were around me, circling my back, his face against my shoulder. He was so close to me in that moment, too close, but I had never pushed a guy away for that. If anything I pulled them nearer, taking them in, as I did now, sure in my belief that knowing me that well would easily be enough to scare them away.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>\u201cI mean, God,\u201d Lissa said, stopping in front of a huge display of bedsheets, \u201cwho knows the difference between a duvet and a comforter?\u201d</p><p>We were in Linens Etc., armed with Lissa\u2019s mom\u2019s gold card, the list of items that the university suggested for all incoming freshmen, and a letter from Lissa\u2019s future roommate, a girl named Delia from Boca Raton, Florida. She\u2019d already been in contact so that she and Lissa could color-coordinate their bed linens, discuss who should bring what in the way of televisions, microwaves, and wall hangings, and just to \u201cbreak the ice\u201d so that by August, when classes started, they\u2019d already \u201cbe like sisters.\u201d If Lissa wasn\u2019t already glum about starting college post-Adam, this letter-written on pink stationery in silver ink, and spewing forth glitter when she pulled it from the envelope-had pretty much done her in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA duvet,\u201d I told her, stopping to eye a stack of thick purple towels, \u201cis a cover for a comforter, usually a down comforter. And a comforter is just a glorified quilt.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her eyes at me, sighed, and pushed some hair out of her face. Lately she\u2019d just seemed cranky all the time, defeated, as if at the age of eighteen life already sucked beyond any hope of improvement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to get a comforter in a purple/pink hue,\u201d she said, reading off Delia\u2019s letter. \u201cAnd sheets to match. And a bed ruffle, whatever the hell that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes around the base of the bed,\u201d I explained. \u201cTo cover the legs and provide a sort of color continuity, all the way to the floor.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at me, eyebrows raised. \u201cColor continuity?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy mother bought a new bedroom suite a few years back,\u201d I said, taking the list out of her hand. \u201cI got an entire education in thread count sheets and Egyptian cotton.\u201d</p><p>Lissa stopped the cart next to a display of plastic wastebas kets, picking up a lime green one with blue trim. \u201cI should get this,\u201d she told me, turning it in her hands, \u201cjust because it will so clash with her predetermined scheme. In fact, I should pick the most butt-ugly furnishings as a complete protest against her assumption that I would just go along with whatever she said.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around: butt ugly was entirely possible at Linens Etc., which carried not only lime green trash cans but also leopard-patterned tissue holders, framed prints of kittens frolicking with puppies, and bath mats shaped like feet. \u201cLissa,\u201d I said gently, \u201cmaybe we shouldn\u2019t do this today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to,\u201d she grumbled, grabbing a pack of sheets-the wrong size, and bright red-off a nearby shelf and tossing them into the cart. \u201cI\u2019m seeing Delia at orientation next week and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll want a freaking update.\u201d</p> <p>I picked up the red sheets and put them back on the shelf while she pouted around the toothbrush holders, completely un-enthused. \u201cLissa, is this really how you want to start college? With a totally shit attitude?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, yeah, well that\u2019s easy for you to say, Miss Going-across-the-Country-Free-and Clear-No-Problems. You\u2019ll be out in sunny California, windsurfing and eating sushi while I\u2019m stuck here in the same place I\u2019ve always been, watching Adam date his way through the entire freshman class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWindsurfing and sushi?\u201d I said. \u201cAt the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean!\u201d she snapped, and a woman pricing a stack of washcloths glanced over at us. Lissa lowered her voice and added, \u201cI might not even go to school anyway. I might defer and join the Peace Corps and go to Africa and shave my head and dig latrines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShave your head?\u201d I said, because, really, this was the most ludicrous part of the whole thing. \u201cYou? Do you have any idea how ugly most people\u2019s bare heads are? They\u2019ve got all kinds of bumps, Lissa. And you won\u2019t know until it\u2019s too late and you\u2019re flat-out bald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even listening to me!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been so easy for you, Remy. So gorgeous and confident and smart. No guy ever dumped you and left you shattered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I said in a level voice. \u201cAnd you know it.\u201d</p><p>She paused at this, as our shared history caught up with her. Okay, so maybe I was known for having the upper hand in my relationships, but there was a reason for that. She didn\u2019t know what happened that night at Albert\u2019s, within shouting distance of her own bedroom window. But since then, I\u2019d been stomped on my fair share. Even Jonathan had caught me unaware.</p><p>\u201cI planned my whole future around Adam,\u201d she said now, quietly. \u201cAnd now I have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told her, \u201cnow you just don\u2019t have Adam. There\u2019s a big difference, Lissa. You just can\u2019t see it yet.\u201d</p><p>She harrumphed at this, yanking a cow-print Kleenex box cover off the shelf and adding it to the cart. \u201cI can see that everyone else is doing exactly what they wanted with the rest of their lives. They\u2019re all at the gate, pawing the dirt and ready to run, and I\u2019ve already got a lame leg and am this close to being taken around back of the stable to be put out of my misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie,\u201d I said, trying to be patient, \u201cwe\u2019ve only been out of high school a month. This isn\u2019t even the real world yet. It\u2019s just in-between time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hate it here,\u201d she snapped, gesturing all around her, including not only Linens Etc. but the world itself, \u201cin between or not. Give me high school any day. I\u2019d go back in a second, if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early for nostalgia,\u201d I told her. \u201cReally.\u201d</p> <p>We walked along the main aisle toward the miniblind section, not talking. As she grumbled over curtains I walked over to the clearance section, where summer picnic ware was on special, one day only. There were plastic plates in all colors, and cutlery with clear handles, forks with metallic prongs. I picked up a set of tumblers decorated with pink flamingoes: definitely butt ugly.</p><p>But I was thinking of the yellow house, where the only dish-ware consisted of one ceramic plate, a few mismatched forks and knives, some gas-station freebie coffee mugs, and whatever paper goods Ted had managed to score from the damaged bin at Mayor\u2019s Market. It was the only time I\u2019d ever heard someone ask, \u201cCan you grab me the spoon?\u201d as opposed to \u201ca spoon,\u201d which at least connoted there was more than one. And here, on bargain special, was an entire plastic, blue-handled set of cutlery-a virtual plethora of flatware-for only $6.99. I picked them up and put them in the cart without even thinking.</p><p>About ten seconds later, it hit me. What was I doing? Buying flatware for a guy? For a boyfriend? It was as if I, like my brother, had been suddenly brainwashed by aliens. What kind of girl purchases housewares for someone she has hardly been dating for a month? Psycho desperate-to-get-married-and-pop-out-babies types, that\u2019s who, I told myself, shuddering at the thought. I threw the cutlery set back onto the table with such speed it crashed into a stack of dolphin-patterned plates, causing a commotion loud enough to distract Lissa from the reading lamps.</p><p>Calm down, I told myself, taking in a deep breath, then promptly spitting it out, since everything in Linens Etc. stank of scented candles.</p><p>\u201cRemy?\u201d Lissa said. She was holding a green lamp. \u201cYou okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded, and she went back to browsing. At least she was feeling better: the lamp did match the trash can.</p><p>I pushed the cart through hand towels, storage supplies, and halfway into candles-where the smell became a stench-all the while reminding myself that everything does not necessarily have a Greater Meaning. It was just a bargain set of plastic ware, for God\u2019s sake, not a promise ring. This settled me somewhat, even as the more rational part of my mind reminded me that never, in the course of oh, say, fifteen relationships since junior high school, had I ever had the urge to buy a boyfriend anything more permanent than a Zip Coke. Even at birthdays and Christmas I kept to my basic gifts, stuff like shirts and CDs, things that would eventually go out of style. Not like plastic picnic ware, which would probably be around to greet the roaches after the final nuclear holocaust. Plus, if you really went deep into the meaning of gifts, dishes equaled food, food equaled sustenance, and sustenance equaled life, which meant that by giving even one plastic fork I was basically saying I wanted to take care of Dexter forever and ever, amen. Yikes.</p><p>On the way to the checkout, Lissa and I passed the clearance table again. She picked up a retro-looking alarm clock. \u201cThis is cute,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd look at those plastic plates and silverware. Maybe I could use those for when we fix stuff in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, shrugging and ignoring the table as if it was someone I\u2019d dated.</p> <p>\u201cBut what if I didn\u2019t use it?\u201d she went on, in the voice I recognized as Lissa entering Prime Indecisive Mode. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s only seven bucks, right? And it\u2019s cute. But I probably don\u2019t have room for it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said, starting to push the cart again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, the alarm clock in one hand, fingering the cute plastic pouch the cutlery came in. \u201cIt\u2019s really cute, though,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it would be better than using takeout stuff all the time. But still, it\u2019s a lot of silverware, I mean it\u2019ll only be me and Delia...\u201d</p><p>This time I didn\u2019t say anything. All I could smell were those candles.</p><p>\u201c... but maybe we\u2019d have other people in sometimes, you know, for pizza or whatever?\u201d She sighed. \u201cNo, forget it, it\u2019s just an impulse thing, I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p> <p>I started to push the cart again, and she took a couple of steps. Two, to be exact.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d she said, then stopped talking. A sigh. Then, \u201cNo, forget it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d I said, reaching behind me and grabbing the plastic pouch, stuffing it into the cart. \u201cI\u2019ll buy it. Let\u2019s just go, okay?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me, wide-eyed. \u201cDo you want it, though? Because I\u2019m not really sure I\u2019ll use it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said loudly. \u201cI want it. I need it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay,\u201d Lissa said, somewhat uncertainly. \u201cIf you really need it.\u201d</p> <p>Later, when I dropped her off, I told her to make sure she took everything, even the plastic ware. But in typical fashion, she cleaned out every bag from my trunk except one. I promptly forgot about it, that is until a few nights later, when Dexter and I were unloading some groceries he\u2019d bought for the yellow house-peanut butter, bread, orange juice, and Doritos-from my car. He grabbed all his bags, then was about to shut the trunk when he stopped and leaned over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, pulling out a white plastic shopping bag, knotted neatly at the top-I\u2019d taught Lissa well-so that its contents wouldn\u2019t spill.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said quickly, trying to take it from him.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d he said, holding it out of my reach. The peanut butter fell out of one of his other bags, rolling across the yard, but he ignored this, too intrigued by what I didn\u2019t want him to see. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething I bought for myself,\u201d I said curtly, grabbing for it again. No luck. He was too tall, and his arms too long.</p><p>\u201cIs it a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shook the bag slightly, listening to the sound it made. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound secret,\u201d he decided.</p><p>\u201cWhat does secret sound like?\u201d I asked. Idiot. \u201cGive it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike tampons,\u201d he told me, shaking it again. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like tampons.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, and he handed it over, as if now he didn\u2019t want to find out. He walked across the grass to pick up the peanut butter, wiping it on his shirt-of course-and chucking it back into the bag.</p><p>\u201cIf you must know,\u201d I said, as if it was absolutely no big deal whatsoever, \u201cit\u2019s just this plastic ware I bought at Linens Etc.\u201d</p><p>He thought about this. \u201cPlastic ware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was on sale.\u201d</p><p>We stood there. From inside the yellow house, I could hear the TV, and someone laughing. Monkey was standing on the other side of the screen door, watching us, his tail going full speed.</p><p>\u201cPlastic ware,\u201d he said slowly, \u201clike knives and forks and spoons?\u201d</p><p>I brushed a bit of dirt off the back of my car-was that a scratch?-and said casually, \u201cYeah, I guess. Just the basics, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you need plastic ware?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he went on, and I fought the urge to squirm, \u201cit\u2019s so funny, because I need plastic ware. Badly. \u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go inside, please?\u201d I asked, slamming the trunk shut. \u201cIt\u2019s hot out here.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the bag again, then at me. And then, slowly, the smile I knew and dreaded crept across his face. \u201cYou bought me plastic ware, \u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I growled, picking at my license plate.</p><p>\u201cYou did!\u201d he hooted, laughing out loud. \u201cYou bought me some forks. And knives. And spoons. Because-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said loudly.</p><p>\u201c-you love me!\u201d He grinned, as if he\u2019d solved the puzzler for all time, as I felt a flush creep across my face. Stupid Lissa. I could have killed her.</p><p>\u201cIt was on sale,\u201d I told him again, as if this was some kind of an excuse.</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d he said simply, taking the bag and adding it to the others.</p><p>\u201cOnly seven bucks,\u201d I added, but he was already walking away, so sure of himself. \u201cIt was on clearance, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove me,\u201d he called out over his shoulder, in a singsong voice. \u201cYou. Love. Me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stood there in the front yard, at the bottom of the stairs, feeling for the first time in a long while that things were completely out of my control. How had I let this happen? Years of CDs and sweaters, interchangeable gifts, and now one set of picnic ware and I totally lose the upper hand. It seemed impossible.</p><p>Dexter walked up the front steps to the door, Monkey bursting forth and bustling around, sniffing at the bags, until they both went inside and the door slammed shut behind them. Something told me, as I stood there, that I should just turn around, go back to my car, and drive home as fast as possible, then lock every door and window and hunker down to protect my dignity. Or my sanity. So many times it seemed like there were chances to stop things before they started. Or even stop them in midstream. But it was even worse when you knew at that very moment that there was still time to save yourself, and yet you couldn\u2019t even budge.</p><p>The door swung open again, and there was Monkey, panting. Above him, dangling past the doorframe from the left, was one hand, fingers gripping a bright blue fork, wiggling it around suggestively, as if it was some kind of signal, spelling out messages in supersecret spy code. What was it saying? What did it mean? Did I even care anymore?</p><p>The fork kept wiggling, beckoning. Last chance, I thought.</p> <p>I sighed out loud, and started up the steps.</p><p>There were certain ways to tell that my mother was getting close to finishing a novel. First, she\u2019d start working at all hours, not just her set schedule of noon to four. Then I\u2019d start waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of her typewriter, and look out my window to see the light spilling in long, slanting squares from her study onto the side yard. She\u2019d also start talking to herself as she wrote, under her breath. It wasn\u2019t loud enough to really make out what she was saying, but at times it sounded like there were two people in there, one dictating and one just rushing to get it down, one clackety-clacking line at a time. And finally, the most revealing sign of all, always a dead giveaway: when she hit her stride, and the words came so easily she had to fight to hold them back long enough to get them on the page, she always put on the Beatles, and they sang her to her epilogue.</p><p>I was on my way down for breakfast in the middle of July, rubbing my eyes, when I stopped at the top of the stairs and listened. Yep. Paul McCartney, his voice high, something from the early years.</p><p>The lizard room door opened behind me and Chris came out, in his work uniform, carrying a few empty jars of baby food, one of the daily diet staples of the lizards. He cocked his head to the side, shutting the door behind him. \u201cSounds like that album with the Norwegian song on it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I told him, starting down the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s that one where they\u2019re all in the window, looking down.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, and fell into step behind me. When we reached the kitchen we saw the bead curtain was drawn across the entryway to the study, and beyond it Paul\u2019s voice had given way to John Lennon\u2019s. I walked over and peered through the curtain, impressed by the stack of paper on the desk beside her and one burned-out candle. She had to have had two hundred pages, at least. When she was rolling, nothing could stop her.</p><p>I turned back into the kitchen and pushed aside two empty cans of Ensure-I was determined not to clean up after Don, although I was tested daily-before fixing myself a bowl of oatmeal with bananas and a big cup of coffee. Then I sat down, my back to the naked woman on the wall, and pulled the family calendar-a freebie from Don Davis Motors, featuring Don himself smiling in front of a shiny 4Runner-off the wall.</p><p>It was July 15. In two months, give or take a few days, I would be packing up my two suitcases and my laptop and heading to the airport, and seven hours later I would arrive in California to begin my life at Stanford. There was so little written between now and then; even the day I left was hardly marked, except for a simple circle in lipstick I\u2019d done myself, as if it was a big deal only to me.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Chris grumbled from in front of the fridge. I glanced over to see him holding an almost empty bag of bread: all that was left were the two end pieces, which I suppose have a real name, but we\u2019d always called the butts. \u201cHe did it again.\u201d</p><p>Don had lived alone so long that he was having trouble grasping the concept that other people actually came after him and, sometimes, used the same products he did. He thought nothing of finishing off the last of the orange juice, then sticking the empty carton back in the fridge, or taking the last of the usable bread and leaving the butts for Chris to deal with. Even though Chris and I had both asked him, oh so politely, to write things down when he used them up (we kept a list on the fridge, labeled GROCERIES NEEDED) he either forgot or just didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Chris shut the fridge door a bit enthusiastically, shaking the rows of Ensures that were stacked there. They clanked against one another, and one toppled off, falling back between the fridge and the wall with a thunk.</p> <p>\u201cI hate those things,\u201d he grumbled, stuffing the bread butts into the toaster oven. \u201cAnd, God, I just bought this bag. If he\u2019s sucking down those Ensures, why does he need to eat my bread anyway? Isn\u2019t that a complete meal in itself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d he went on as the music picked up in the next room, all yeah-yeah-yeahs, \u201call I\u2019m asking for is a little consideration, you know? Some give-and-take. It\u2019s not too much to ask, I don\u2019t think. Is it?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, looking again at that lipstick circle. Not my problem.</p><p>\u201cRemy?\u201d My mother\u2019s voice drifted from the study, the typewriter noises stopping for a second. \u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I called back to her.</p><p>\u201cBring me some coffee?\u201d The typewriter started up again. \u201cWith milk?\u201d</p><p>I got up and poured a cup almost to the top, then dumped in skim milk until it reached the rim: one of the only things that we had in common, completely, was taking our coffee the same way. I walked over to the entryway to the study, balancing her cup and mine, and pushed aside the curtain.</p> <p>The room smelled like vanilla, and I had to move a row of mugs-most half full, their rims stained with the pearly pink that was her \u201chouse lipstick\u201d-aside to make room. One of the cats was curled up on the chair next to her, and hissed at me halfheartedly as I slid it out of the way so I could sit down. Next to me was a stack of typewritten pages, neatly aligned. I was right: she was really cooking. The number of the page on the top was 207.</p><p>I knew better than to start talking until she was done with whatever sentence, or scene, she was in the midst of writing. So I pulled page 207 off the stack and skimmed it, folding my legs beneath me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuc,\u201d Melanie called to the other room in the suite, but there was only silence beyond. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>No answer from the man who just hours earlier had kissed her under a shower of rose petals, claiming her in front of all Paris society as the one he loved. How could a marriage bed be so cold? Melanie shivered in her lace gown, feeling tears fill her eyes as she caught sight of her bouquet, white roses and purple lilies, lying where the maid had left it on the bedside table. It was still so fresh and new, and Melanie could remember pressing her face to the full blossoms, breathing them in as the realization that she was now Mrs. Luc Perethel washed over her. Once, the words had seemed magical, like a spell cast in a fairy tale. But now, with the city lit up through her open window, Melanie ached not for her new husband but for another man, in another city. Oh, Brock, she thought. She didn\u2019t dare to say the words aloud for fear that they would be carried away, soaring out of her reach, to find the only one true love she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Uh-oh. I glanced up at my mother, who was still typing away, her brow furrowed, lips moving. Now, I knew that what she wrote was pure fiction. After all, this was a woman who\u2019d been constructing stories about the lives and loves of the rich while we were clipping coupons and having our phone cut off on a regular basis. And it wasn\u2019t like Luc, the cold new husband, had a fondness for Ensures or anything. I hoped.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d My mother, spying her fresh cup of coffee, stretched her fingers and picked it up, taking a sip. She had her hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, no makeup, and was wearing pajamas and the leopard-print bedroom slippers I\u2019d gotten her for her last birthday. She yawned, leaning back in her chair, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been going all night. What time is it?\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at the clock in the kitchen, visible through the curtain, which was still swaying slightly. \u201cEight-fifteen.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, putting the cup to her lips again. I glanced over at the sheet in the typewriter, trying to make out what happened next, but all I could see was several lines of dialogue. Apparently, Luc did have something to say after all.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s going well,\u201d I said, nodding toward the stack next to my elbow.</p><p>She flopped her hand at me in a so-so kind of way. \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s smack in the middle, and you know there\u2019s always a dull spot. But last night I was just about asleep when I had this inspiration. It had to do with swans.\u201d</p><p>I waited. But that appeared to be all she would tell me, as now she\u2019d grabbed a nail file from the mug stuffed with pens and pencils and was at work on a pinkie, shaping it deftly.</p> <p>\u201cSwans,\u201d I said finally.</p><p>She chucked the nail file down on the desk and stretched her arms over her head. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, tucking a stray hair behind her ear, \u201cthey\u2019re dreadful creatures, really. Beautiful to look at but mean. The Romans used them instead of guard dogs.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, drinking my coffee. Across the room, I could hear the cat snoring.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she went on, \u201cit got me thinking about what cost beauty. Or for that matter, what cost anything? Would you trade love for beauty? Or happiness for beauty? Could a gorgeous person with a mean streak be a worthy trade? And if you did make the trade, decide you\u2019d take that beautiful swan and hope it wouldn\u2019t turn on you, what would you do if it did?\u201d</p><p>These were rhetorical questions. I thought.</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cAnd then I couldn\u2019t sleep, either. I think it\u2019s that ridiculous tapestry Don insisted we hang on the wall. I can\u2019t relax looking at all these carefully stitched depictions of military battles and people being crucified.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is a little much,\u201d I agreed. Every time I went into her room to get anything I found myself somewhat transfixed by it. It was hard to tear your eyes away from the panel that illustrated the beheading of John the Baptist.</p><p>\u201cSo I came down here,\u201d she said, \u201cthinking I\u2019d just tinker, and now it\u2019s eight in the A.M. and I\u2019m still not sure what the answer is. How can that be?\u201d</p><p>The music faded out now, and it was very, very quiet. I was sure I could feel my ulcer stirring, but it might have just been the coffee. My mother was always very dramatic when she was writing. At least once during every novel she\u2019d fling herself into the kitchen, near tears, hysterical that she\u2019d lost any talent she ever possessed, the book was a quagmire, a disaster, the end of her career, and Chris and I would just sit there, silent, until she wailed out again. After a few minutes, or hours, or-in bad times-days, she\u2019d be right back in the study, curtain closed, typing away. And when the books arrived months later, smelling so new with their smooth, not-yet-cracked spines, she always forgot about the breakdowns that played a part in creating them. If I reminded her, she said writing novels was like childbirth: if you truly remembered how awful it got, you\u2019d never do it again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll work it out,\u201d I said now. \u201cYou always do.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and glanced down at the page in the typewriter, then out the window. The sunlight was spilling in, and I realized she did look tired, even sad, in a way I hadn\u2019t noticed before. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, as if only agreeing with me to move past this. And then, after a quiet second or two, she switched gears completely and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Dexter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI like him very much.\u201d She yawned, then smiled at me apologetically. \u201cHe\u2019s not like the other boys you\u2019ve dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a no-musician rule,\u201d I explained.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and she did too. Then I said, \u201cOkay, so why\u2019d you break it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the reason anyone does anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in love.\u201d</p><p>I heard the front door swing shut as Chris left for work, yelling a good-bye behind him. We watched as he walked down the driveway to his car, a Mountain Dew-his version of coffee-in one hand.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s going to buy her a ring, if he hasn\u2019t already,\u201d my mother said thoughtfully. \u201cI just have this feeling.\u201d</p><p>Chris started the engine, then pulled out into neighborhood traffic, turning around slowly in the cul-de-sac. He was swigging the Mountain Dew as he drove past.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cyou would know.\u201d</p><p>She finished her coffee, then reached over and brushed her fingers over my cheek, tracing the shape of my face. A dramatic gesture, like most of hers, but it was comforting in that she\u2019d done it for as long as I could remember. Her fingers, as always, were cool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, my Remy,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly you understand.\u201d</p><p>I knew what she meant, and yet I didn\u2019t. I was a lot like my mother, but not in ways I was proud of. If my parents had stayed together and grown to be old hippies singing protest songs as they washed dishes after dinner, maybe I would have been different. If I\u2019d ever seen what love really could do, or was, maybe I\u2019d have believed in it from the start. But too much of my life had been spent watching marriages come together and then fall apart. So I understood, yes. But sometimes, like lately, I wished that I didn\u2019t, not at all.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s filling up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilling up but not full.\u201d I took the Tide from him and unscrewed the cap. \u201cIt has to be full.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always put the soap in right when it starts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why,\u201d I said, pouring a bit of detergent in as the water level rose, \u201cyour clothes don\u2019t ever get truly clean. There is a chemistry involved here, Dexter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s laundry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said as I poured in the rest of the Tide and eased the lid shut, \u201cthe rest of the guys are even worse. They hardly ever even do laundry, much less separate their colors and brights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColors and whites,\u201d I corrected him. \u201cColors and brights go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you this anal about everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want everything to be pink again?\u201d</p><p>That shut him up. Our little laundry lesson this evening had been precipitated by his throwing a new red shirt into the hot water cycle, which left everything he\u2019d been wearing lately with a rosy tinge. Since the plastic ware incident I\u2019d been doing all I could to be the very opposite of domestic, but I couldn\u2019t abide a pink boyfriend. So here I was, in the laundry room of the yellow house, a place I normally steadfastedly avoided because of the enormous pile of unwashed underwear, socks, and various T-shirts that dwelled there, often spilling out into the hallway. Which was not surprising, considering that hardly anyone ever bought detergent. Just last week, John Miller had apparently washed all his jeans in Palmolive.</p><p>Once the cycle started, I stepped carefully over a pile of nasty socks, back out into the hallway, and eased the door shut as far as it would go. Then I followed Dexter into the kitchen, where Lucas was sitting at the table, eating a tangerine.</p><p>\u201cYou doing laundry?\u201d he asked Dexter.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>Dexter nodded. \u201cI\u2019m bleaching out my whites.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked impressed. But then, he was wearing a shirt with a ketchup stain on the collar. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>And then, suddenly, it was dark. Totally dark. All the lights cut off, the refrigerator whirred to a stop, the swishing of the washing machine went quiet. The only brightness anywhere left that I could see was the porch light of the house next door.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d John Miller yelled from the living room, where he was absorbed, as usual about this time each night, in Wheel of Fortune. \u201cI was just about to solve the puzzle, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lucas said, standing and walking over to the light switch, which he flipped on and off a couple of times, click-clack-click. \u201cMust be a blown fuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the whole house,\u201d Dexter said.</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if it was just one fuse something would still be on.\u201d Dexter picked up a lighter from the middle of the table and flicked it. \u201cMust be a power outage. Probably the whole grid\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lucas sat back down. In the living room, there was a crash as John Miller attemped to navigate the darkness.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t my problem. Surely it wasn\u2019t. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but point out, \u201cUm, the lights are on next door.\u201d</p><p>Dexter leaned back in his chair, glancing out the window to verify this. \u201cSo they are,\u201d he said. \u201cIn-teresting.\u201d</p><p>Lucas started to peel another tangerine as John Miller appeared in the kitchen doorway. His pale skin seemed even brighter in the dark. \u201cLights are out,\u201d he said, as if we were blind and needed to be told this.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Einstein,\u201d Lucas grumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a circuitry problem,\u201d Dexter decided. \u201cBad wiring, maybe.\u201d</p><p>John Miller came into the room and flopped down on the couch. For a minute, no one said anything, and it became clear to me that this, to them, wasn\u2019t really that big a problem. Lights, schmights.</p><p>\u201cDid you not pay your bill?\u201d I asked Dexter, finally.</p><p>\u201cBill?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cThe power bill.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, from Lucas, \u201cOh, man. The freaking power bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we paid that,\u201d John Miller said. \u201cIt was right there on the counter, I saw it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Dexter looked at him. \u201cYou saw it, or we paid it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d John Miller said, and Lucas sighed, impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWhere was it?\u201d I asked John Miller, standing up. Someone had to do something, clearly. \u201cWhich counter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, pointing, but it was dark and I couldn\u2019t see where. \u201cIn that drawer where we keep the important stuff.\u201d</p><p>Dexter picked up a lighter and lit a candle, then turned to the drawer and began to dig around, sorting through what, to the guys, was deemed Important. Apparently, this included soy sauce packets, a plastic hula girl toy, and matchbooks from what looked like every convenience store and bar in town.</p><p>Oh, and a few pieces of paper, one of which Dexter seized and held aloft. \u201cIs this it?\u201d</p><p>I took it from him, squinting down at the writing. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, slowly, \u201cthis is a notice saying if you didn\u2019t pay your bill by-let\u2019s see- yesterday, they were going to cut the power off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d John Miller said. \u201cHow did that slip past us?\u201d</p><p>I turned it over: stuck to the back was a set of pizza coupons with one ripped off, all of those left still a little greasy. \u201cNo idea,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYesterday,\u201d Lucas said thoughtfully. \u201cWow, so they gave us, like, a half day over that. That\u2019s mighty generous of them.\u201d</p><p>I just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dexter said cheerfully, \u201cso whose job was it to pay the power bill?\u201d</p><p>Another silence. Then John Miller said, \u201cTed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed,\u201d Lucas echoed.</p><p>\u201cTed,\u201d Dexter said, reaching over to the phone and yanking it off the hook. He dialed a number, then sat there, drumming his fingers on the table. \u201cHi, hey, Ted. Dexter. Guess where I am?\u201d He listened for a second. \u201cNope. The dark. I\u2019m in the dark. Weren\u2019t you supposed to pay the power bill?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could hear Ted saying something, talking fast.</p><p>\u201cI was about to solve the puzzle!\u201d John Miller yelled. \u201cI only needed an L or a V. \u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody cares,\u201d Lucas told him.</p><p>Dexter continued to listen to Ted, who apparently had not taken a breath yet, making only hmm-hmm noises now and then. Finally he said, \u201cOkay then!\u201d and hung up the phone.</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dexter told us, \u201cTed has it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMeaning that he\u2019s royally pissed, because, apparently, I was supposed to pay the power bill.\u201d Then he smiled. \u201cSo! Who wants to tell ghost stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter, honestly,\u201d I said. This kind of irresponsibility made my ulcer ache, but apparently Lucas and John Miller were used to it. Neither one of them seemed particularly fazed, or even surprised.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cTed\u2019s got the money, he\u2019s going to call them and see what he can do about getting it on tonight or early tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for Ted,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cBut what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Dexter seemed surprised. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe means,\u201d I said, \u201cthat you should do something nice for the house by way of apology for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cListen to Remy.\u201d</p><p>Dexter looked at me. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the dark!\u201d John Miller said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s your fault, Dexter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do something for the house. I\u2019ll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cClean the bathroom?\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dexter said flatly.</p><p>\u201cDo a load of my laundry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Finally, John Miller said, \u201cBuy beer?\u201d</p><p>Everyone waited.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cYes! I will buy beer. Here.\u201d He reached into his pocket and came up with a crumpled bill, which he held up for all of us to see. \u201cTwenty bucks. Of my hard-earned money. For you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas swiped it off the table, fast, as if expecting Dexter to change his mind. \u201cWonderful. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d said John Miller, jumping to his feet. He and Lucas left the kitchen, arguing about where the keys were. Then the screen door slammed, and we were alone.</p><p>Dexter reached over the kitchen counter and found another candle, then lit it and put it on the table as I slid into the chair opposite him. \u201cRomantic,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cI planned all of this, just to get you alone in a dark house in the candlelight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChee-sy,\u201d I said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>We sat there for a second, in the quiet. I could see him watching me, and after a second I pushed out my chair and walked around the table to him, sliding into his lap. \u201cIf you were my roommate and pulled this kind of crap,\u201d I said as he brushed my hair off my shoulder, \u201cI\u2019d kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d learn to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you are actually, secretly attracted to all the parts of my personality that you claim to abhor.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it,\u201d he said, \u201cthat makes you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really.\u201d He pulled me back against him, so my head was next to his, his hands locked around my waist. In front of us the candle was flickering, sending uneven shadows across the far wall. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, adding, \u201cit\u2019s too weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not. Look. I\u2019ll tell you what I like about you.\u201d</p><p>I groaned.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said, ignoring this. \u201cAnd that, I have to admit, was what first got my attention at the dealership that day. But then, I must say, it\u2019s your confidence that really did me in. You know, so many girls are always insecure, wondering if they\u2019re fat, or if you really like them, but not you. Man. You acted like you couldn\u2019t have given less of a shit whether I talked to you or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActed?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I could feel him grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re attracted to the fact that I\u2019m a bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. That\u2019s not it.\u201d He shifted his weight. \u201cWhat I liked was that it was a challenge. To get past that, to wriggle through. Most people are easy to figure out. But a girl like you, Remy, has layers. What you see is so far from what you get. You may come across hard, but down deep, you\u2019re a big softie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. Honestly, I was offended. \u201cI am not soft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought me plastic ware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was on sale!\u201d I yelled. \u201cGod!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really nice to my dog.\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, \u201cnot only did you volunteer to come over here and teach me how to properly separate my colors from brights-\u201d</p><p>\u201cColors from whites. \u201d</p><p>\u201c-but you also stepped up to help solve our power bill problem and smooth over the differences with the guys. Face it, Remy. You\u2019re sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that a bad thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019d been called a lot of things in my life, but sweet had never been one of them. It made me feel strangely unnerved, as if he\u2019d discovered a deep secret I hadn\u2019t even known I was keeping.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you tell me why you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t make me call you sweet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d I sat up and leaned forward, stalling by pulling the candle over to the edge of the table. Talk about losing my edge: this was what I\u2019d become. True confessions by candlelight. \u201cWell,\u201d I said finally, knowing he was waiting, \u201cyou make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201c Pretty good-looking? I called you beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to be beautiful?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the ceiling, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, I\u2019ll stop. God, relax, would you? I\u2019m not asking you to recite the Declaration of Independence at gunpoint.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish,\u201d I said, and he laughed, loud enough to blow out the candle on the table, leaving us again in total darkness.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said as I turned back to face him, sliding my arms around his neck. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it out loud. I already know why you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around my waist, pulling me closer. \u201cSo,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an animal attraction,\u201d he said simply. \u201cTotally chemical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said. \u201cYou could be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, anyway, why you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His hands were in my hair now, and I was leaning in, not able to totally make out his face, but his voice was clear, close to my ear. \u201cJust that you do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p> <p>\u201cThis,\u201d Chloe said as another bubble rose up and popped in her face, \u201cis disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe can hear you, you know.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, wiping her face with the back of her hand. It was hot, and the black asphalt of the driveway made things seem positively steamy. Monkey, however, sitting between us in a plastic baby pool up to his haunches in cold water, was totally content.</p><p>\u201cGet his front feet,\u201d I said to Chloe, squeezing more shampoo into my hand and lathering it up. \u201cThey\u2019re really dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of him is dirty,\u201d she grumbled as Monkey stood up and shook again, sending soap suds and dirty water over both of us in a wave. \u201cAnd have you looked at these nails? They\u2019re longer than Talinga\u2019s, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Monkey stood up suddenly, barking, having spied a cat working its way through a row of hedges on the edge of Chloe\u2019s yard. \u201cDown boy,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cHello? Sit, Monkey. Sit. \u201d</p><p>Monkey shook again, dousing us both, and I pushed down on his butt. He sat with a splash, his tail flopping over the side. \u201cGood boy,\u201d I said, even though he was already trying to stand up again.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if my mother were to show up now I\u2019d be homeless,\u201d Chloe said, spraying Monkey\u2019s chest with the hose. \u201cJust the sight of this mangy beast within spitting distance of her prized Blue Category Chem Special would give her an aneurysm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlue Category What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of grass,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Chloe had first given me a flat-out no when she opened the door to see me on her front porch, shampoo and dog in hand, before I\u2019d even begun my hard sell. But after a few minutes of wheedling, plus a promise to buy her dinner and whatever else she wanted to do that night, she\u2019d relented, and even seemed to warm to Monkey a bit, petting him cautiously as I got the baby pool-a Wal-Mart bargain at a mere nine bucks-out of my car. I\u2019d planned to wash the dog at my house, but Chris had co-opted our hose to rig up an elaborate watering system for the lizards, which left me with few options.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe how low you\u2019ve stooped,\u201d she said now as I finished the final rinse, then let Monkey leap from the pool and do a series of full-body shakes up and down the driveway. \u201cThis is total girlfriend behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, steering Monkey away from the grass before Chloe had a chance to freak out. \u201cThis is a humanitarian act. He was miserable.\u201d</p><p>Which was true. Plus, I\u2019d been spending a fair amount of time with Monkey lately, and okay, there was a certain odor to him. And if all it took to fix things was a five-dollar bottle of dog shampoo, some nail clippers, and a quick trim, what was the harm in taking action? It wasn\u2019t for me, anyway. It was for Monkey.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t getting attached,\u201d she said as I pulled the clippers out of my pocket and sat the dog down again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s just for the summer. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Dexter.\u201d She nodded at Monkey, who was now trying to lick my face. He stank of citrus now: all they\u2019d had left was an orangey citrus scent. But we\u2019d trimmed the hair over his eyes and around his feet, which made him look five years younger. It was true what Lola said: a good haircut changed everything. \u201cThis is an additional level of commitment. And responsibility. It\u2019s going to make things complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe, he\u2019s a dog, not a five-year-old with an abandonment complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d She squatted down beside me, watching as I finished up one paw and switched to the other. \u201cAnd anyway, what happened to our wild and carefree summer? Once you dumped Jonathan I thought we\u2019d just date our way to August. No worries. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d she said darkly.</p><p>\u201cNot ever,\u201d I told her. I stood up. \u201cThere. He\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>We stood back and surveyed our work. \u201cA vast improvement,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything would have been,\u201d she said, shrugging. But then she bent down and petted him, running her hand over the top of his head as I spread a few towels across the backseat of my car. I liked Monkey, sure, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean I was up for picking dog hair out of my upholstery for the next few weeks.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Monk,\u201d I called out, and he sprang up, trotting down the driveway. He just hopped in, then promptly stuck his head out the back window, sniffing the air. \u201cThanks for the help, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>As I slid into the front seat, the leather hot under my legs, she stood and watched me, her hands on her hips. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s not too late. If you go ahead and break up with him now you\u2019d still have a good month\u2019s worth of quality single-girl time before you leave for school.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my key in the ignition. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSee you around five-thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then stood there, one hand shielding her eyes as I backed out into the street. Of course it would be that cut-and-dried for her, how I could end things with Dexter. It was the way we\u2019d always operated. Chloe was, after all, my twin in all things concerning boys and relationships. Now, I was throwing her a curve, veering off in a way she couldn\u2019t understand. I knew how she felt. Ever since I\u2019d met Dexter, things weren\u2019t making much sense to me either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The collage was on the wall in the kitchen of the yellow house, right over the sofa. It started innocently enough, with just a couple of snapshots tacked up; at first glance, I\u2019d assumed they were of the guys\u2019 friends. But upon closer inspection, I\u2019d realized that the pictures, like the ones Dexter had given me weeks earlier, were of customers of Flash Camera.</p><p>Dexter and Lucas had both been hired there to run the photo machine, which basically consisted of sitting on a stool and peering through a little hole at the images, marking them and adjusting them, if possible, for optimum color and brightness. This wasn\u2019t rocket science, but it did involve a bit of skill, a good eye, and most of all an attention span that could focus on one, sometimes monotonous activity for an hour or two at a time. This meant, pretty much, that Dexter was out. After Dexter had ruined an entire set of once-in-a-lifetime Hawaiian vacation pictures and twenty disposable wedding cameras, the owner of Flash Camera gently suggested that he might be happier using his strong customer service skills by taking a counter position. And because he was so charming, she\u2019d kept him on at a technician\u2019s salary, which Lucas was always quick to bitch about when given the chance.</p><p>\u201cMy job involves so much more responsibility,\u201d he\u2019d sniff every payday, snatching up his check. \u201cAll you have to do is basic math and be able to alphabetize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Dexter always said, smartly adjusting his name tag in a model employee fashion, \u201cbut I alphabetize very, very well.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, he didn\u2019t. He was constantly losing people\u2019s pictures, mostly because he\u2019d get distracted and stick the R s in with the B s, or sometimes glance at the labels wrong and put them under people\u2019s first names. If he worked for me, I wouldn\u2019t have trusted him with anything more complicated than sharpening pencils, and even that only when supervised.</p><p>So while Ted, working at Mayor\u2019s Market, could score some bruised but edible produce, and John Miller was jacked up on coffee constantly from his job at Jump Java, Dexter and Lucas were left with little to contribute. That is, until they started making doubles of the pictures that intrigued them.</p><p>They were boys, so of course it started with a set of dirty pictures. Not X-rated, exactly: the first one on the wall that I saw was of a woman in her bra and panties, posing in front of a fireplace. She wasn\u2019t exactly pretty, however, and it didn\u2019t help that right in the back of the shot, clearly visible, was a huge bag of cat litter with the words KITTY KLEAN! splashed across the front of it, which took away from that exotic, Playboy -esque quality that I assumed she and whoever took the picture had been going for.</p><p>As the weeks passed, more and more pictures were added to the collage. There were vacation snapshots, a family posing en masse in front of the Washington Monument, everyone smiling except for one daughter who was scowling darkly, her middle finger clearly displayed. A few more nudie shots, including one of a very fat man spread out in black underwear across a leopard-skin bedspread. All of these people had no idea that in a little yellow house off Merchant Drive their personal memories were being slapped up on the wall and showcased as art for strangers.</p><p>The day I washed Monkey, Chloe and I brought him back about six, and Dexter was already home, sitting in the living room watching PBS and eating tangerines. Apparently they were on special at Mayor\u2019s Market, and Ted was getting a discount. They came about twenty-five to a case and, like Don\u2019s Ensures at home, were everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, pushing open the screen door and holding Monkey back by the collar. \u201cBehold.\u201d</p><p>I let him go, and he skittered across the floor, tail wagging madly, to leap on the couch, knocking a stack of magazines to the floor. \u201cOh, man, look at you,\u201d Dexter said, scratching Monkey behind his ears. \u201cHe smells different,\u201d he said. \u201cLike you washed him in Orange Crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the shampoo,\u201d Chloe said, flopping into the plastic lawn chair next to the coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019ll stop stinking in, oh, about a week.\u201d</p><p>Dexter glanced at me and I shook my head to show him she was kidding. Monkey hopped off the couch and went into the kitchen, where we heard him gulping down what sounded like about a gallon of water without stopping.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dexter said, pulling me into his lap, \u201cthose makeovers sure make a man thirsty.\u201d</p><p>The screen door opened and John Miller walked in, tossing the van keys onto a speaker by the door. Then he walked to the middle of the room, held up his hands to stop all conversation, and said, very simply, \u201cI have news.\u201d</p> <p>We all looked at him. Then the door opened again, and Ted came in, still wearing his Mayor\u2019s Market green smock, and carrying two boxes of tangerines.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Dexter said, \u201c please no more tangerines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have news,\u201d Ted announced, ignoring this. \u201cBig news. Where\u2019s Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork,\u201d Dexter said.</p><p>\u201cI have news too,\u201d John Miller said to Ted. \u201cAnd I was here first, so-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is important news,\u201d Ted replied, waving him off. \u201cOkay, so-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait just a second!\u201d John Miller shook his head, his face incredulous. He had been born indignant, always convinced that he was somehow being wronged. \u201cWhy do you always do that? You know, my news could be important too.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet as Ted and Dexter exchanged a skeptical look, not unnoticed by John Miller, who sighed loudly, shaking his head.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Dexter said finally, holding up his hands, \u201cwe should just take a moment to really think about the fact that we\u2019ve gone a long time with no big news at all, and now here, simultaneously, we have two big newses all at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewses?\u201d Chloe said.</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d Dexter went on smoothly, \u201cit\u2019s really impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d Ted said loudly, \u201cI met this A and R chick today from Rubber Records and she\u2019s coming to hear us tonight.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Except for Monkey walking in, dripping water from his mouth, his newly clipped nails tippy-tapping very quietly on the floor.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone smell oranges?\u201d Ted asked, sniffing.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d John Miller said darkly, glaring at him, \u201cwas totally unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA and R?\u201d Chloe said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArtists and Repertoire,\u201d Ted explained, taking off his smock and balling it up in one hand, then stuffing it into his back pocket. \u201cIt means if she likes us she might offer us a deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had news,\u201d John Miller grumbled, but it was over. He knew he\u2019d been beaten. \u201cBig news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow serious is this?\u201d Dexter asked Ted, leaning forward. \u201cJust-making-conversation-I\u2019ll-show-up-to-see-you, or definitely-I-have-pull-at-the-label-I\u2019ll-come-see-you?\u201d</p><p>Ted reached into his pocket. \u201cShe gave me a card. She\u2019s got a meeting tonight, but when I said we usually started the second set by ten-thirty she said she\u2019d make it by then, no problem.\u201d</p><p>Dexter slid me off his lap, then stood up, and Ted handed him the card. He squinted at it for a good while, then handed it back. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cFind Lucas. We have to talk about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know this could be nothing,\u201d John Miller said, still smarting a bit. \u201cIt could be a bunch of smoke up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it probably is,\u201d Ted replied. \u201cBut it also could be that she likes us and we get a meeting and before the summer\u2019s out we\u2019re in a bigger place, bigger venue, bigger town. It happened to Spinnerbait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate Spinnerbait,\u201d John Miller said, and they all three nodded, as if this was clear fact.</p><p>\u201cSpinnerbait has a deal, though,\u201d Dexter added. \u201cAnd a record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpinnerbait?\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cThey were this band that started playing the bars near Williamsburg when we did,\u201d Dexter said to me. \u201cTotal assholes. Frat rats. But they had this really good guitar player-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t that good,\u201d Ted said indignantly. \u201cTotally overrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-and their original stuff was tight. They got signed last year.\u201d Dexter sighed, then looked up at the ceiling. \u201cWe hate Spinnerbait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate Spinnerbait,\u201d John Miller repeated, and Ted nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, get ahold of Lucas,\u201d Dexter said, slapping his hands together. \u201cEmergency session. Band meeting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBand meeting!\u201d Ted yelled, as if everyone who was in the band and could feasibly hear it wasn\u2019t within a two-foot radius. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go scrub up and we reconnoiter in the kitchen, twenty minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Dexter grabbed the cordless phone off the top of the TV, jabbed in some numbers, and then left the room with it pressed against his ear. I could hear him ask for Lucas, then say, \u201cGuess what Ted scored at work today?\u201d Then a pause, as Lucas offered a theory. \u201cNo, not tangerines...\u201d</p><p>John Miller sat down on the couch, crossing one leg over another and leaning back so that his head hit the wall behind him with a thunk. Chloe looked at me, raising her eyebrows, then shook a cigarette out of her pack and lit it, dropping the spent match in an ashtray already overflowing with tangerine peels.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite,\u201d I said finally. \u201cWhat\u2019s your news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, now it\u2019s completely anticlimactic,\u201d he grumbled. He still looked so much like a little kid to me, all red haired and freckled, like a grade schooler you might see on TV in a peanut butter commercial. It didn\u2019t help that he was pouting.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I said, and picked up the remote, turning the TV on. It wasn\u2019t like I was about to beg him or anything.</p><p>\u201cMy news was,\u201d he said slowly, lifting his head off the wall, \u201cthat she agreed to come to Bendo tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Finally. I\u2019ve only been asking her for weeks. \u201d He reached up and scratched his ear. \u201cAnd it was a very big deal because I was beginning to think I was going to make no progress at all with her.\u201d</p> <p>I said to Chloe, \u201cJohn Miller is in love with his boss.\u201d</p><p>Chloe exhaled loudly. \u201cAt Jump Java?\u201d</p><p>John Miller sighed again. \u201cShe\u2019s not really my boss,\u201d he told us. \u201cShe\u2019s more of a coworker. A friend, really.\u201d</p><p>Chloe looked at me. \u201cThis is Scarlett Thomas?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but John Miller\u2019s eyes shot open. \u201cYou know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Chloe said, shrugging. \u201cRemy knows her better, though. She and Chris go way back, right?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, concentrating on flipping the channels on the TV. I\u2019d known about John Miller\u2019s infatuation with Scarlett back when it was just curious interest, then watched-along with the rest of the employees at various Mayor\u2019s Village businesses-as it progressed to puppy-dog-esque devotion before finally reaching the ridiculous level of romantic pining that was its current state. Scarlett was the manager of Jump Java, and she\u2019d only hired John Miller because of Lola, who she still owed a favor to for her last cut and color. And while I\u2019d listened to John Miller sing her praises, I\u2019d managed to keep it quiet that I knew her more than just in passing. Until now.</p><p>I could feel John Miller looking at me, even as I pretended to be completely engrossed in a news story about structural problems with the new county dam. He said, \u201cRemy? You know Scarlett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother dated her,\u201d I said, in what I hoped was a no-big-deal kind of voice. \u201cIt was ages ago.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and took the remote, hitting the mute button. The dam remained on the screen, holding water back just fine, it seemed to me. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d he said quickly, \u201ccan you tell me? Anything?\u201d</p><p>Across the room, Chloe laughed. I shrugged and said, \u201cMy brother dated her toward the end of their senior year. It wasn\u2019t serious. Chris was still in his pothead thing, and Scarlett was way too smart to put up with it. Plus she already had Grace, then.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Grace was Scarlett\u2019s daughter, who was three now. She\u2019d been born when Scarlett was a junior, causing a minor neighborhood scandal. But Scarlett had stayed in school, finishing during a summer session the credits she\u2019d missed, and now was taking classes part-time at the university while managing Jump Java and, apparently, putting up with the besotted John Miller passing longing glances over the muffins about twenty hours a week.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Scarlett a little out of your league?\u201d Chloe asked him, not unkindly. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s got a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am wonderful with children,\u201d he said indignantly. \u201cGrace loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace loves everybody,\u201d I told him. Just like Monkey, I thought. Kids and dogs. It\u2019s just too easy.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cshe especially likes me.\u201d</p><p>Dexter stuck his head through the doorway and pointed a finger at John Miller. \u201cBand meeting!\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBand meeting,\u201d John Miller repeated, standing up. Then he looked at me and said, \u201cA little help tonight would be greatly appreciated, Remy. A good word, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise anything,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>He seemed happier, hearing this, as he headed into the kitchen. I got up and grabbed my purse, finding my keys. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said to Chloe. \u201cBand meeting and all.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, stuffing her smokes in her pocket and walking to the front door, pushing it open. \u201cI\u2019ll call Lissa from the car. See if she wants to meet us at the Spot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>As the screen door slammed behind her, Dexter walked over to me. \u201cThis is big,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI mean, maybe it isn\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019ll be a crushing disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the right attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe,\u201d he went on, pulling his hands through his hair the way he always did when just barely able to contain himself, \u201cit\u2019s the beginning of something. You know, when Spinnerbait got that meeting with the label, they immediately got an in to the bigger clubs. We could be in Richmond, or D.C., easy. It could happen.\u201d</p><p>He was just standing there, grinning, and I made myself smile back. Of course this was good news. Wasn\u2019t it me who wanted everything to be transitory, anyway? It was the best-case scenario, really, for him to get some great chance and ride off in the dirty white van into the sunset, tailpipe dragging. In time he\u2019d just be some story I\u2019d tell, about the crazy musician I\u2019d spent the last days of my senior summer with, just the way Scarlett Thomas was only a footnote now to Chris. They had these stupid songs about potatoes, I could hear myself telling someone. A whole opus.</p> <p>Yes, definitely. It was best this way.</p><p>Dexter leaned down and kissed my forehead, then looked at me closely, cocking his head to the side. \u201cYou okay? You look weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, you just seem-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBand meeting!\u201d Ted yelled from the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re recon noitering right now!\u201d</p><p>Dexter glanced toward the doorway, then back at me.</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d I said, pressing my palms to his chest and pushing him backward, gently. \u201cBand meeting.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and for a second I felt a tug, some alien feeling that made me, for an instant, want to pull him back within arm\u2019s length. But by then he was already walking backward, toward the kitchen, where the voices of his band mates were now building as they made their plans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at Bendo around nine,\u201d he said. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, cool as ever, and he turned the corner, leaving me standing there. Watching him go. What a weird feeling that was. I decided I didn\u2019t like it. Not at all.</p><p>By ten-thirty, as Truth Squad\u2019s second set was about to get under way, the A &amp;R chick still hadn\u2019t shown up. The natives were getting restless.</p><p>\u201cI say we just go on and forget about her,\u201d Lucas said, spitting some ice back into his cup of ginger ale. \u201cAll this worrying is making us suck anyway. Ted was off key the whole last set.\u201d</p><p>Ted, sitting next to me and carving lines into the table, glared at him darkly. \u201cI,\u201d he said, \u201cam the only reason she\u2019s coming. So get off my fucking back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now.\u201d Dexter tugged at his collar, something he\u2019d been doing all night long: it was completely stretched out of shape, hanging lopsided. \u201cWe need to go up there and do the best job we can. A lot is riding on this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo pressure, though,\u201d Lucas grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is John Miller?\u201d Ted said, pushing up from the table and craning his neck around the room. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a band meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impromptu,\u201d Dexter told him, tugging at his collar again. \u201cPlus he\u2019s over there with what\u2019s-her-name. The coffee boss.\u201d</p><p>We all looked at once. Sure enough, at a booth by the stage, John Miller was sitting with Scarlett. He had his drumsticks on the table and was talking animatedly, using his hands. Scarlett was drinking a beer and listening, a polite smile on her face. Every once in a while she\u2019d glance around the room, as if she\u2019d expected this to be more of a group thing and was wondering where everyone else was.</p><p>\u201cPathetic,\u201d Ted said. \u201cTotally blowing us and the band\u2019s future off for a chick. That\u2019s Yoko Ono behavior, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cOkay, so I\u2019m thinking we should start with \u2018Potato Song Two,\u2019 then do the kumquat version, and then...\u201d</p><p>I tuned them out, drawing my finger through the circle of water under my beer. Off to my left, I could see Chloe, Lissa, and Jess talking to a group of guys at the bar. At the Spot earlier, Chloe had decided they all needed to \u201cget back out there\u201d and make the most of the \u201csummer single-girl thing,\u201d appointing herself ringleader for the effort. So far there had been progress: she was sitting on a barstool next to a blond guy with surfer looks. Lissa was talking to two guys, one really cute, who was still scop ing the room as if in search of an upgrade (bad sign), and one not-so-cute-but-decent who seemed interested and not completely offended that he was most likely an also-ran. And then there was Jess, trapped by the beer taps by a short, wiry guy who was talking so excitedly that she kept having to lean back, which could only have meant he was spitting out more than words.</p><p>\u201c... decided that we\u2019d do no covers. That was the entire upshot of yesterday\u2019s meeting,\u201d Dexter said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that if the potato songs don\u2019t go over well we need a backup plan,\u201d Lucas argued. \u201cWhat if she hates potatoes? What if she thinks the songs are, you know, infantile, frat-party crap?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of astonished silence as Dexter and Ted absorbed this. Then Ted said, \u201cSo that\u2019s what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas said quickly, glancing at Dexter, who was now tugging his collar hard enough that I had to reach up and unlatch his fingers, bringing down his hand. He hardly noticed. Lucas said, \u201cI\u2019m just saying we don\u2019t want to come across as derivative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd doing covers isn\u2019t derivative?\u201d Dexter said.</p><p>\u201cCovers will get the crowd going and show our range,\u201d Lucas told him. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been in a lot of bands-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Ted said, throwing up his hands dramatically. \u201cHere we go. Educate us, oh wise one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c-and I know from experience that these reps like a tight set that gets the crowd going and showcases our potential as a band. Which means a mix of our own stuff and songs that we cover, yeah, but with our own take on them. It\u2019s not like we do \u2018I\u2019ve Got You Babe\u2019 just the way Sonny and Cher do. We give it a twist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not doing a Sonny and Cher song here tonight!\u201d Ted yelled. \u201cNo way, man. I am not going to be the G Flats for this chick. That\u2019s wedding crap. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just an example,\u201d Lucas said flatly. \u201cWe can do another song. Calm down, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Robert, the owner of Bendo, yelled from behind the bar, \u201cyou guys planning on actually working tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Ted said, standing up and finishing his beer.</p><p>\u201cDid we even decide anything?\u201d Lucas asked, but Ted ignored him as they made their way to the stage.</p><p>Dexter sighed, running his fingers through his hair. I\u2019d never seen him like this, so on edge. \u201cGod,\u201d he said softly, shaking his head. \u201cThis is so freaking stressful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking about it,\u201d I told him. \u201cJust go up there and play the way you always do. Thinking about it is throwing you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sounded like shit, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, which wasn\u2019t entirely a lie. But Ted had been off-key, John Miller was showboating outrageously-tossing drumsticks in the air, missing them-and Dexter had mangled the words to \u201cPotato Song Three,\u201d a song that I knew he could, literally, sing in his sleep. \u201cBut you sounded unsure of yourself. Wobbly. And you\u2019re not. You\u2019ve done this a million times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA million times.\u201d He still didn\u2019t sound convinced, however.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like riding a bike,\u201d I told him. \u201cIf you actually think about it too much, you realize how complicated a concept it actually is. You have to just hop on and go, and not worry about the mechanics. Let it run itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, kissing my cheek, \u201care so right. How can you always be so right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a curse,\u201d I said, shrugging. He squeezed my leg and slid out of the booth, still tugging at his collar, and I watched him weave through the crowd, stopping to flick John Miller, who was still chatting up Scarlett, on the head as he passed. Ted put on his guitar, played a few random chords, and then he, Lucas, and Dexter exchanged glances and head nods, setting the game plan.</p><p>The first song was a bit unsteady. But then, the next was better. I could see Dexter relaxing, easing into it, and by the third song, when I saw the A &amp;R chick come in, they sounded tighter than they had all evening. I recognized her immediately. First, she was a little old for Bendo, which catered to a college and younger crowd, and second, she was dressed entirely too fashionably for this small town: black pants, silky shirt, small black glasses just nerdy enough to be cool. Her hair was long and pulled back loosely at the base of her neck, and when she walked up to the bar for a drink, every one of the guys chatting up my girlfriends stopped to stare at her. By the time the song wound down, the crowd on the floor was thickening, and I saw Ted glance at the bar, see her, and then say something, quietly, to Dexter.</p> <p>After the applause and hooting died down, Dexter tugged at his shirt collar and said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to do a little number for you now called \u2018The Potato Song.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The crowd cheered: they\u2019d been playing Bendo long enough now that \u201cThe Potato Song,\u201d and its many incarnations, was known. Ted started the opening bridge, John Miller picked up his sticks, and they launched into it.</p><p>I kept my eyes on the girl at the bar. She was listening, beer in hand, taking a sip now and then. She smiled at the line about the vegan princess, and again when the crowd chimed in and yelled, \u201csweet potato!\u201d And when it was over, she clapped enthusiastically, not just politely. A good sign.</p><p>Feeling confident, they continued with another \u201cPotato Song.\u201d But this one wasn\u2019t quite so strong, and the crowd didn\u2019t know it as well. They gave it a good shot, the best they could, but it sounded flat, and at one point John Miller, who\u2019d only recently learned the new part, screwed up and lost the beat for a second. I saw Dexter flinch at this, then tug his collar. Ted was looking everywhere but at the bar. They launched right into another original song, one not even about potatoes, but it too sounded off, and they cut it short after two verses, ditching the third.</p><p>By now the A &amp;R girl seemed distracted, almost bored, looking around the club and then-very bad sign-at her watch. Ted leaned over and said something to Dexter, who shook his head quickly. But then Lucas stepped forward, nodding, and Ted said something else, and Dexter finally shrugged and turned back to the microphone. John Miller tapped out a beat, Ted picked it up, and they launched full force into an old Thin Lizzy song. And suddenly the crowd was right with them again, pressing up closer. And after the first verse, the A &amp;R chick ordered another beer.</p><p>When the song was over, Ted spoke to Dexter, who hesitated. Then Ted said something else, and Dexter made a face, shaking his head.</p><p>Just do it, I thought to myself. Another cover won\u2019t kill you.</p><p>Dexter looked at Lucas, who nodded, and I relaxed. Then the first chords began. They sounded so familiar, somehow, as if I knew them in a different incarnation. I listened for a second, and the realization grew stronger, as if it was just at the tip of my mind, close enough to touch. And then, I got it.</p> <p>\u201cThis lullaby,\u201d Dexter sang, \u201cis only a few words...\u201d</p><p>Oh, my God, I thought.</p><p>\u201cA simple run of chords...\u201d</p><p>It sounded more retro and lounge-singer-esque, the maudlin aspect that had made it a wedding and lite FM favorite now twisted into something else, something self-mocking, as if it was winking at its own seriousness. I felt a drop in my stomach: he knew how I felt about this. He knew. And still, he kept singing.</p><p>\u201cQuiet here in this spare room, but you can hear it, hear it...\u201d</p><p>The crowd was loving it, cheering, some girls along the back row singing along, hands on their hearts, like washed-up divas on the Labor Day telethon.</p><p>I looked over at the bar, where Chloe was staring right at me, but she didn\u2019t have a smug look, instead something even worse. It might have been pity, but I turned my head away before I could know for sure. And a few seats down from her, the A &amp;R chick was swaying, smiling. She loved it.</p><p>I got up from the booth. All around me the crowd was singing along to the song, one they\u2019d heard all their lives too, but never quite in the context that I had. To them it was just old and sappy enough now to be nostalgic, a song their parents might have listened to. It was probably played at their bar mitzvahs or sisters\u2019 weddings, trotted out about the same time as \u201cDaddy\u2019s Little Girl\u201d and \u201cButterfly Kisses.\u201d But it was working. The appeal was obvious, the energy coming through the crowd so strongly, the kind of response that Ted, in a million potato dreams, wouldn\u2019t even have hoped for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will let you down,\u201d Dexter sang as I pushed my way toward the bar. \u201cBut this lullaby plays on...\u201d</p><p>I went to the bathroom, where for once there was no line, and shut myself into a stall. Then I sat down, pulled my hands through my hair, and told myself to calm down. It meant nothing, this song. All my life I\u2019d let other people put so much weight to it, until it was heavy enough to drown me, but it was just music. But even there, locked in the stall, I could still hear it going, those notes I\u2019d known by heart for as long as I could remember, now twisted and different, with another man I hardly knew who had some claim to me, however small, singing the words.</p><p>What had my mother always said when we listened to it on the one scratchy album she owned of my dad, back when we still had a record player? His gift to you, she\u2019d tell me, idly brushing my hair back from my forehead with a dreamy expression, as if someday I\u2019d truly understand how important this was. By then, she had already forgotten the bad times with my father, the ones I heard secondhand: how they were dirt-poor, how he\u2019d hardly spent any time with Chris when he was a baby, and only married her-not even legally, it turned out-in a last-ditch attempt to save a relationship already beyond repair. What a legacy. What a gift. It was like a parting prize in a game show where I\u2019d lost big, a handful of Rice-A-Roni and some cheap luggage thrust upon me as I left, little consolation.</p><p>The final note sounded: the drum cymbals hummed. Then, huge applause, cheering. It was over.</p> <p>Okay then. I walked out of the bathroom and headed straight to the bar, where Chloe was sitting on a stool with a bored expression. Truth Squad was still going, playing a medley of camp songs-played Led Zeppelin style, with crashing guitars and a lot of whooping-that I recognized as being a set-ender. The guy Chloe had been talking to was gone, Lissa was still talking to the not-cute-but-decent one, and Jess, I assumed, had used one of her regular excuses and was either \u201cat the pay phone\u201d or \u201cgetting something from the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the surfer boy?\u201d I asked Chloe as she scooted over, making room for me on her stool.</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend,\u201d she said, nodding to a booth off on our left, where the guy was now nuzzling a redheaded girl with a pierced eyebrow.</p><p>I nodded as Ted did a few windmill guitar moves, John Miller going all out on a drum solo, his face almost as red as his hair. I wondered if Scarlett was impressed, but she\u2019d left the booth where she\u2019d been sitting, so I couldn\u2019t know for sure.</p><p>\u201cInteresting song choice earlier, didn\u2019t you think?\u201d Chloe asked me, pushing off the floor with her foot so that we twisted slightly in the stool, to one side and then back again. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help but feel that I had heard it somewhere before.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t say anything, instead just watching as John Miller continued to battle his drum set while the crowd clapped along.</p><p>\u201cOf all the things he should know,\u201d she went on, \u201cthat you hate that song is a freaking given. I mean, God. It\u2019s basic. \u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d I said softly, \u201cshut up, okay?\u201d</p><p>I could feel her looking at me, slightly wide-eyed, before going back to stirring her drink with her finger. Now there was only one person between me and the A &amp;R chick, who was jotting something down with a pencil she\u2019d borrowed from the bartender, who was watching her write with great interest while ignoring a whole slew of people waving money for beers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re Truth Squad!\u201d Dexter yelled, \u201cand we\u2019re here every Tuesday. Thank you and good night!\u201d</p><p>The canned dance music came on, everyone pushed toward the bar, and I watched as Dexter hopped off the stage, conferred with Ted for a second, and they both began heading toward us, Lucas in tow. John Miller was already making a beeline for Scarlett, who I now saw standing by the door, as if trying to ease herself out gradually.</p> <p>The A &amp;R chick was already holding out her hand to Dexter as they came up. \u201cArianna Moss,\u201d she said, and Dexter pumped her hand a bit too eagerly. \u201cGreat set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he replied, and she kept smiling at him. I glanced across the room, looking toward the door, wondering where Jess was.</p><p>Ted, pressing closer, added, \u201cThe acoustics in here are terrible. We\u2019d sound much better with decent equipment, and the crowd kind of sucks.\u201d</p><p>Dexter shot him a you-aren\u2019t-helping kind of look. \u201cWe\u2019d love to hear what you think,\u201d he said to her. \u201cCan I buy you a beer?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch. \u201cSure. Let me just make a call first.\u201d</p><p>As she walked away, pulling a cell phone out of her pocket, Dexter saw me, waved, and mouthed that he\u2019d be just a minute. I shrugged, and he started to move toward me, but Ted pulled him back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he demanded. \u201cShe\u2019s here to talk to all of us, Dexter, not just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said we wanted to hear what she thinks,\u201d Lucas told him. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s buying her a beer!\u201d Ted said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called public relations,\u201d Dexter told him, glancing back in my direction. But now Arianna Moss was already coming back, tucking her phone in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cAnd what was up with that song?\u201d Ted shook his head, incredulous. \u201cSonny and Cher would have been better. God, anything would have been better. We might as well have had on leisure suits and been playing dinner theater with that crappy song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved it,\u201d Dexter said, trying to catch my eye, but I let a burly guy wearing a baseball cap step into my line of vision.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Lucas agreed. \u201cPlus it got us out of the bottomless pit into which \u2018The Potato Song\u2019 had flung us.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Potato Song,\u2019\u201d Ted huffed, \u201cwas doing just fine. If John Miller had bothered to make it to the last band practice on time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s always somebody else, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lucas snapped.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you guys,\u201d Dexter said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cReady to talk?\u201d Arianna Moss asked as she walked up. She asked Dexter. I noticed, and so did Ted. But only he, of course, was truly bothered.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cOver here okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>They started walking and I turned my back again, waving down the bartender for a beer as they passed. By the time I\u2019d paid they were sitting in a booth by the door, she and Dexter on one side, Lucas and Ted on the other. She was talking: they were all listening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jess appeared next to my elbow. \u201cIs it time to go yet?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Chloe said.</p><p>\u201cI had to get something from the car,\u201d Jess said flatly.</p><p>\u201cRemy, hey, there you are.\u201d John Miller popped up beside me. \u201cYou seen Scarlett?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was over by the door last I saw her.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head around, eyes scanning the wall. Then he started waving his arms. \u201cScarlett! Over here!\u201d</p><p>Scarlett looked up, saw us, and smiled in a way that made me think I\u2019d been right on in assuming she\u2019d been hoping to leave in-conspicuously. But John Miller was waving her over, oblivious, so she had no choice but to work her way through the crowd to us.</p><p>\u201cYou were great,\u201d she said to John Miller, who beamed. \u201cReally good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re usually a lot tighter,\u201d John Miller told her with a bit of a swagger, \u201cbut Ted was off tonight. He was late for the last practice, didn\u2019t know the new arrangements.\u201d</p> <p>Scarlett nodded and glanced around her. The crowd at the bar was thickening, now about three deep, and people kept jostling us.</p><p>Lucas came up behind John Miller and managed to flick him on the back of the head while balancing two beers. \u201cHey, in case you, you know, have a minute, we\u2019re talking to this A &amp;R woman over here and she\u2019s probably getting us a great gig in D.C. if, you know, you care in the least. \u201d</p><p>John Miller rubbed the back of his head. \u201cD.C.? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat big theater, the one where we saw Spinnerbait that time.\u201d Lucas grimaced. \u201cHate Spinnerbait, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate Spinnerbait,\u201d John Miller agreed, taking one of the beers. \u201cThat\u2019s a band,\u201d he explained to Scarlett.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cShe needs to talk to all of us. This could be big, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d John Miller said to Scarlett, squeezing her arm. \u201cThis is just, you know, official band business. Management decisions and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Scarlett said as he followed Lucas over to the booth, where Ted made room for both of them. I could see Dexter sitting in the corner, against the wall, folding a matchbook and listening intently as Arianna Moss spoke.</p><p>\u201cPoor you,\u201d Chloe said to Scarlett. \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very nice,\u201d Scarlett said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pathetic.\u201d Chloe hopped off the barstool. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom. You coming?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. She bumped a couple of guys aside and disappeared into the crowd. As the bodies around us shifted I could catch the occasional glance of Dexter. He looked like he was explaining something while Arianna Moss nodded her head, taking a sip of her beer. Ted and Lucas were talking, and John Miller seemed totally distracted, glancing over at us every few seconds to make sure Scarlett hadn\u2019t made a break for it.</p><p>\u201cJohn Miller\u2019s very nice,\u201d I said, feeling obligated to do so just because he kept looking at me.</p> <p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Scarlett agreed. \u201cA little young for me, though. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s really parent material, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell her that this, at least in my experience, wasn\u2019t as big of a factor in a relationship as you\u2019d think, but decided against it.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you been dating Dexter?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d I glanced over again at the booth. Dexter was waving his hands around while Arianna Moss laughed, lighting a cigarette. You would have thought they were on a date. If you didn\u2019t know better.</p><p>\u201cHe seems really great,\u201d she said. \u201cSweet. And funny.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah. He is.\u201d</p><p>Ted suddenly appeared next to me, bursting through a crowd of large girls in tight shirts who seemed to be celebrating a bach elorette: one of them was wearing a veil, the rest Barbie hats. \u201cTwo beers!\u201d he shouted at the bartender in his typical vexed way, then stood there and seethed for a second before noticing us.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He glared back at the booth. \u201cFine. Dexter will probably be in her pants within the hour, not that it\u2019s gonna help the band any.\u201d</p><p>Scarlett looked at me, raising her eyebrows. I said, \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he shrugged, as if only now realizing that maybe I wasn\u2019t the best person to say this to. Not that it stopped him: this was Ted, after all. \u201cIt\u2019s just how he is, you know. He hooks up, things end badly, and we\u2019re out a gig, or a place to live, or a hundred bucks in grocery money. He always does this.\u201d</p><p>Now, standing there, I felt so stupid I was sure it showed on my face, if that was possible. I picked up Chloe\u2019s drink-now all ice-and took a gulp from it, just to do something.</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d he growled as the beers were dropped in front of him, \u201cif we\u2019re going to work as a group, we have to think as a group. Period.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone, bumping the girls behind us hard enough to trigger a wave of curse words and lewd gestures. I was stuck there with Scarlett, looking like Band Floozy Number Five.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Scarlett said uneasily. \u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t really mean that.\u201d</p><p>I hated that she felt sorry for me. It was even worse than feeling sorry for myself, but not by much. I turned my back to the booth-damned if I cared what happened over there now-and sat back on the stool, crossing my legs. \u201cWhatever,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know the deal about Dexter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Really?\u201d</p><p>I picked up Chloe\u2019s straw, twisting it between my fingers. \u201cJust between you and me,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s kind of why I picked him in the first place. I mean, I\u2019m off to school in the fall. I can\u2019t have any big commitments. That\u2019s why it\u2019s perfect, you know. A set ending. No complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, steadying herself as a stray elbow bumped her from behind.</p><p>\u201cI mean, God. All relationships should be this easy, you know? Find a cute guy in June, have fun till August, leave scot-free in September.\u201d This was so easy to say, I realized, that it had to be the truth. Wasn\u2019t this always what I\u2019d said about Jonathan, and any other of my seasonal boyfriends? Of course this wasn\u2019t different.</p><p>She nodded, but something in her face told me she wasn\u2019t the kind of girl to believe this, much less do it herself. But then again, she had a kid. It was different when other people were at stake. I mean, in normal families. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said, \u201cjust a summer boyfriend. No worries. No entanglements. Just the way I like it. I mean, it\u2019s not like Dexter\u2019s husband material or anything. He can\u2019t even keep his shoes tied.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again. God, this was so true. So true. What had I been thinking?</p><p>We stood there for a second, in a silence that was not exactly awkward but not altogether comfortable either.</p><p>She looked at her watch, then behind me, into the crowd. She seemed surprised for a second, and I figured John Miller must have given her another one of his hold-on-honey-I\u2019m-almost-done-here waves. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, \u201cI really have to go, or my sitter\u2019s going to kill me. Can you tell John Miller I\u2019ll see him tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I told her. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Remy. Take care, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I watched her walk to the door, then cut out quickly just as John Miller turned his head, looking over at us again. Too late, I thought. I scared her off. Big, bad Remy, cold bitch, was back.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jess said, appearing next to me, \u201cit has got to be time to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d Chloe said, plopping down beside me. \u201cNo decent prospects here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissa\u2019s doing okay,\u201d Jess told her.</p><p>Chloe bent forward, peering down the bar. \u201cThat\u2019s the first guy that spoke to her when she got here, so yes, we should go. If we don\u2019t she\u2019ll be engaged to him by last call. Lissa!\u201d</p><p>Lissa jumped. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going!\u201d Chloe slid off the stool, pulling me with her. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something better to do tonight. Got to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys,\u201d Lissa said as she came up, fluffing her hair, \u201cI\u2019m talking to somebody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s subpar,\u201d Chloe told her, glancing at him again. He waved and smiled, poor guy. \u201cYou can do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s nice,\u201d Lissa protested. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to him all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Jess said. \u201cYou need a variety of guys, not just one. Right, Remy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s go already.\u201d</p><p>We were almost to the door when I saw Jonathan. He was standing by the jukebox, talking to the bouncer. I\u2019d seen him from a distance a few times since we\u2019d broken up, but this was the first official drive-by, so I slowed down.</p><p>\u201cHey Remy,\u201d he said as we passed, reaching out, in typical fashion, to brush my arm. Normally I would have sidestepped, out of range, but this time I didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t look much different, his hair a bit shorter, his skin tan. Typical summer changes, all easily undone by September. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said as Chloe and Lissa walked past me, out the door. Jess I could feel hovering closer by, as if I needed reminding not to waste too much breath here. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaking great,\u201d he said, smiling big, and I wondered what I\u2019d ever seen in him, with his slick looks and touchy-feely ways. Talk about subpar. I\u2019d been bottom fishing and hadn\u2019t even known it. Not that Dexter was much of an improvement, apparently.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Jonathan,\u201d I said, smiling at him and moving just a bit closer as two girls passed behind me. \u201cYou always were so modest.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, touching my arm again. \u201cI was always great too. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d I told him, but I kept smiling. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see you around,\u201d he called after me, too loudly. \u201cWhere you gonna be later? You going to that party in the Arbors?\u201d</p><p>I reached over my head with my hand and waggled my fingers, then walked out into the thick, humid night air. Lissa had already pulled her car around, and she and Chloe were waiting, engine idling, as Jess and I came down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cClassy,\u201d she said to me as we slid into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI was just talking,\u201d I told her, but she only turned her head, rolling down her window, and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Lissa put the car in gear and we were off. I knew Dexter would wonder where I\u2019d gone, just like he\u2019d probably wonder who I\u2019d been talking to and, whoever he was, why I\u2019d been smiling at him that way. Boys were so easy to play. And if nothing else, I gave as good as I got. He could cozy up with some chick all he wanted, but I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d sit and wait while he did it.</p><p>\u201cWhere we going?\u201d Lissa asked, turning her head and glancing back at me.</p><p>\u201cThe Arbors,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s a party there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re talking,\u201d Chloe said. She reached forward and cranked up the radio. And just like that, it could have been old times: the four of us, on the prowl. Earlier I\u2019d been the odd girl out, Miss Committed, having to warm the bench while they set out into the game. But no more. And there was still so much of summer left.</p><p>We were almost out of the parking lot when I heard it. A voice, yelling after us. Chloe turned down the radio as I twisted in my seat, already wondering what I\u2019d say when Dexter asked why I was leaving, what was the deal, how exactly I could refute that automatic assumption that this was just jealous girlfriend behavior. Which it wasn\u2019t. Not at all.</p><p>The voice yelled again, just as I peered through the back window. But it wasn\u2019t Dexter. It was the guy Lissa had been talking to. He called her name, looking confused as we pulled out into traffic and drove away.</p><p>It was after one when Lissa dropped me off at the end of my driveway. I took off my shoes and started across the grass, taking a sip of the Diet Zip I\u2019d gotten on the way home from the party in the Arbors, which had turned out to be a total bust. By the time we\u2019d gotten there the cops had already been and gone, so we\u2019d headed to the Quik Zip to sit on the hood of Lissa\u2019s car, talking and sharing a big bag of buttered popcorn. A good way to end what had been, for the most part, a crap night.</p><p>It was nice outside now, though. Warm, the crickets chirping, and the grass cool under my bare feet. There was a sky full of stars, and the whole neighborhood was quiet, except for a dog barking a few yards over and the soft clackety-clacking of my mother\u2019s typewriter, drifting out of her study window, where the light, as was the norm lately, was bright and burning.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>There was someone behind me. I felt my whole body tense, then run hot, as I turned around. My full Diet Zip left my hand before I even realized it, sailing through the air at warp speed toward the head of the person who was standing in the middle of the lawn. It would have hit square on, perfect target, except that he moved at the last second, and it flew past, crashing against the mailbox and bursting open, showering the curb with Diet Coke and ice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d Dexter shouted.</p><p>\u201cMy problem?\u201d I snapped. I could feel my heart beating, thunk thunk thunk, in my chest. Who lurks around neighborhoods past midnight, sneaking up on people? \u201cYou scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He walked up to me, shoes leaving a trail across the damp grass, until he was right in front of me. \u201cAt the club. When you just took off, no explanation? What was that all about, Remy?\u201d</p><p>I had to take a moment to collect myself. And mourn for my Diet Zip, which I had refilled just minutes earlier. \u201cYou were busy,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cAnd I got tired of waiting.\u201d</p> <p>He stuck his hands in his pockets and looked at me for a second. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back to him and dug out my keys, shaking them until I found the one that fit the front door. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m going inside to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it the song?\u201d He stepped up even closer to me as I stuffed the key in the lock. \u201cIs that why you freaked out and left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not freak out,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cI just figured you had your hands full with that girl, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said. He stepped back, down the steps, and laughed. \u201cIs that what this is about? You\u2019re jealous?\u201d</p> <p>Okay. Those, as far as I was concerned, were fighting words. I turned around. \u201cI don\u2019t get jealous,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. So you\u2019re not human, then.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cRemy, for God\u2019s sake. All I know is that one minute I\u2019m telling you I\u2019ll be done in a second and the next you just vanish, and the last I see is you talking to some old boyfriend about meeting him later. Which was kind of surprising, considering we\u2019re seeing each other. Or so I thought.\u201d</p><p>There was so much erroneous information in this statement that it honestly took me a second to decide, outline style, what to address first. \u201cYou know,\u201d I said finally, \u201cI waited around, Ted said you were deep in negotiations with this girl, my friends were ready to leave. So I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat else did Ted say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and pulled his hand through his hair, then let his hand drop to his side. \u201cOkay, then. I guess everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I said and turned around again, turning the key in the lock.</p><p>And then, just as I was about to push the door open, he said, \u201cI heard you, you know.\u201d</p><p>I stopped, pressing my palm against the wood of the door. I could see myself in the small square of glass there, and him reflected behind me. He was kicking at something in the grass with his toe, not looking at me.</p><p>\u201cHeard me what?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTalking to Scarlett.\u201d Now he did look up, but I couldn\u2019t turn around. \u201cI wanted to tell you I\u2019d be done in a minute and to wait, if you could. So I walked over, and I heard you. Talking about us.\u201d</p><p>So that had been what had surprised Scarlett. I reached up and tucked my hair behind my ear.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know where I stand, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cSummer boyfriend and all. Set ending. No worries. A bit surprising, I have to admit. But maybe I should just admire your honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. My mother did always say I\u2019d make a lousy husband, so it\u2019s good to get a second opinion. Plus I like knowing you don\u2019t see us going anywhere. Takes the guesswork out of it.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and looked at him. \u201cWhat did you expect? That we\u2019d stay together forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those the only options? Nothing or forever?\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cGod, Remy. Is that what you really believe?\u201d</p><p>Maybe, I thought. Maybe it is.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I told him, \u201chonesty is good. I\u2019m going away to college, you\u2019ll be gone by the end of the summer, or maybe, after tonight, even sooner. Ted made it sound like you were leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTed is an idiot!\u201d he said. \u201cTed probably also told you I sleep with every girl we meet, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew there was some Ted factor involved in this. The Ted curve. What did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, loudly. \u201cA year ago I got involved with the girl who booked bands for this club in Virginia Beach. It ended badly and-\u201d</p><p>I held up my hand, stopping him. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t. Let\u2019s not do the true confessions thing, okay? Believe me, you don\u2019t want to hear mine.\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised at this, and for a second I realized he didn\u2019t know me at all. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cI do, though,\u201d he said, and his voice was softer now, conciliatory, as if all this was fixable in some way. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference. I\u2019m not in this just for a week, or a month, Remy. I don\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p><p>A car drove by, slowing down as it passed. The guy behind the wheel was blatantly staring at us. It took all I had not to flip him the finger, but I resisted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d he asked, coming closer. \u201cIs it that bad that you might actually really like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. It\u2019s just simpler this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying we should just decide now that this summer doesn\u2019t mean anything? Just use each other and then when you go or I go it\u2019s over, see you later?\u201d</p><p>It sounded so bad when he said it that way. \u201cI have worked all my life to get out of here scot-free,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t take anything else with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be a burden,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do you want to make it one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know how things end, Dexter.\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what commitment leads to, and it isn\u2019t pretty. Going in is the easy part. It\u2019s the endings that suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think you\u2019re talking to?\u201d he said incredously. \u201cMy mother\u2019s had six husbands. I\u2019ve been related to half the country at one time or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThis is how it has to be. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>For a minute neither of us said anything. After so many years of only thinking these things, saying them out loud felt so strange, as if now they were officially real. My cold, hard heart exposed, finally, for what it truly was. Fair warning, I thought. I should have told you from the start. I will let you down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know why you\u2019re saying this,\u201d he said finally, \u201cbut you\u2019re missing out. You know, when it works, love is pretty amazing. It\u2019s not overrated. There\u2019s a reason for all those songs.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands. \u201cThey\u2019re just songs, Dexter. They don\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and stood right in front of me, taking my hands in his. \u201cYou know, we only sang that tonight because we were dying up there. Lucas heard me humming it the other day and got all inspired and came up with that arrangement. They don\u2019t know it has anything to do with you. They just think it\u2019s a good crowd pleaser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it is,\u201d I said. \u201cJust not for me.\u201d</p> <p>I felt it then. That strange settling feeling that meant the worst part of breaking up was over, and now there were only a few pleasantries to exchange before you were done for good. It was like the finish line coming up over the hill, and knowing that what lies ahead is all within your sight.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, rubbing my thumb with his, \u201cit could have gone either way with us. All those marriages and everything. Another day, you\u2019d be the one who believed, and I\u2019d be sending you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I replied. But I couldn\u2019t even imagine believing in love the way he did. Not with the history we shared. You had to be crazy to come out of it and think forever was still possible.</p><p>He leaned forward, still holding my hand, and kissed my forehead. I closed my eyes as he did so, pressing my toes into the grass. I took in everything about him that I\u2019d grown to like: the smell of him, his narrow hips, the smoothness of his skin against mine. So much in so little time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around,\u201d he said, pulling back from me. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand one last time, then let it drop and started across the grass. His feet left fresh tracks: the ones from earlier were gone, already absorbed, as if nothing had happened up to here.</p><p>Once inside I went up to my bedroom and got undressed, pulling on an old pair of boxers and a tank top and crawling under the sheets. I knew this feeling, the 2 A.M. loneliness that I\u2019d practically invented. It was always worse right after a breakup. In those first few hours officially single again the world seems like it expands, suddenly bigger and more vast now that you have to get through it alone.</p><p>That was why I\u2019d started listening to the song, in the beginning: it took my mind off things. It was the one constant in my life, however I felt about it, the one thing that had remained a part of me as stepfathers and boyfriends and houses shifted in and out. The recording never changed, the words staying the same, my father\u2019s voice taking the same breaths between lines. But now I couldn\u2019t even do that. It was now stuck in my mind the way Dexter had sung it: mocking and sweet and different, carrying a heavier and stranger weight than it ever had before.</p><p>I kept thinking about how he\u2019d kissed my forehead as we said good-bye. It had to be the nicest breakup ever. Not that it made it any easier. But still.</p><p>I rolled over and pulled the pillow tight under my head, closing my eyes. I tried to distract myself with other songs: the Beatles, my current favorite CD, old 1980s hits from my childhood. But Dexter\u2019s voice kept coming back, slipping easily over the words I knew too well. I fell asleep with it still playing in my mind, and the next thing I knew it was morning.</p> <p>August</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cCome on! Who wants to KaBoom?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Lissa. It was over ninety degrees out, the sun was blasting hot, and somewhere over to my left, a barbershop quartet was singing \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home.\u201d It was official: we were in hell.</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d I said. Again. Two weeks into her job shilling a new sports drink/caffeine jolt soda, and Lissa still couldn\u2019t accept that I didn\u2019t like the taste of it. And I wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s like... fizzy lemonade,\u201d Chloe said delicately, swirling the tiniest sip of it around in her mouth. \u201cWith a weird cheap cola aftertaste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Lissa asked her, refilling the row of plastic cups on the table in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d Chloe said. Then she swallowed, and made a face. \u201cEeeech.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChloe!\u201d Lissa hissed, glancing around. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, it tastes like crap,\u201d I said, but she just ignored me, piling more KaBoom merchandise-plastic Frisbees, T-shirts, and plastic cups all emblazoned with the same swirling yellow sunshine logo-onto the table. \u201cYou know that, Lissa. You don\u2019t even drink this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not true,\u201d she said, adjusting her KaBoom name tag, which said Hi, I\u2019m Lissa! Want to Boom? I\u2019d tried to point out that this could be taken in other ways than sampling products, but she\u2019d only waved me off, so self-righteous in her quest to spread the KaBoom message to cola drinkers everywhere. \u201cI drink this stuff like water. It\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>I turned around and looked behind me, where a family of four was passing by, hands already full of Don Davis Toyotafaire freebie merchandise. They didn\u2019t stop, though. In fact, the KaBoom table was pretty much deserted, even with all the free stuff Lissa and her coworker, P.J., were giving away.</p><p>\u201cBalloons, everyone! Who wants a KaBoom balloon?\u201d Lissa shouted out into the crowd. \u201cFree samples, folks! And we\u2019ve got Frisbees!\u201d She picked up one of the Frisbees and hurled it across the parking lot. It sailed evenly for a little ways before banking off and missing one of the new Land Cruisers by about a foot before crashing to the pavement. Don, who was talking up some customers by a row of Camrys, glanced over at us.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Lissa said, covering her mouth with her hand.</p><p>\u201cEasy on the Frisbees, slugger,\u201d P.J. told her, picking up one of the plastic sample cups and downing it. \u201cIt\u2019s still early.\u201d</p><p>Lissa smiled at him gratefully, blushing, and I realized Chloe\u2019s hunch about her feelings for P.J. were, in fact, correct. KaBoom, indeed.</p><p>The Don Davis Motors Toyotafaire had been in the works for weeks. It was one of the biggest sales bonanzas of the year, with games for the kids, fortune-tellers, Slurpee machines, even one very tired looking pony that was walking circles around the auto bays. And, right this way, in the shade by the showroom, local author and celebrity Barbara Starr.</p><p>Normally my mother never did publicity except when she had a new book out, and she now was at a point in her writing when she didn\u2019t even want to leave her study, much less the house. Chris and I had been used to her schedule for years and knew to keep quiet when she was sleeping-even if it was at four in the afternoon-to stay out of the way when she passed through the kitchen mumbling to herself, and to understand that we\u2019d know when she was done when she pushed the typewriter carriage to the left one last time, clapped her hands twice, and let out a loud, very emphatic, \u201cThank you!\u201d It was the closest she came to religion-this one, final expression of gratitude. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Don didn\u2019t get it. First, he had no respect for the beaded curtain. In he\u2019d walk, without hesitation, putting his hands on her shoulders even as she was still typing. When he did this, my mother\u2019s keystrokes grew speedier: you could hear it, as if she was rushing to get out what was in her head before he broke her train of thought entirely. Then he\u2019d go to take a shower, asking her to bring him a cold beer in a few minutes, would you, darling. Fifteen minutes later he\u2019d be calling for her, wondering where that beer was, and she\u2019d type fast again, pounding out the last lines she could before he padded back in, smelling of aftershave and asking what they were having for dinner.</p><p>The weird thing was that my mother was going along with it. She seemed totally smitten, still, with Don, to the point that she saw creeping around in the wee hours to write as a completely fair trade. With all her other husbands and boyfriends, she\u2019d always stuck to her schedule, lecturing them, as she had us, about her \u201ccreative needs\u201d and the \u201cdisciplinary necessity\u201d of her time spent in the office. But she seemed more willing to compromise now, as if this was, indeed, going to be her last marriage.</p><p>Now, Chloe headed to the bathroom as I walked over to the table Don had set up for my mother next to the showroom. MEET BEST-SELLING AUTHOR BARBARA STARR! was painted on the banner that hung behind her, in big red letters framed by hearts. She was wearing sunglasses, fanning herself with a magazine while she talked to a woman wearing a fanny pack who had a toddler on her hip.</p><p>\u201c... that Melina Kennedy was just the best character ever!\u201d the woman was saying, switching the baby to her other side. \u201cYou know, you just really felt her pain when she and Donovan were separated. I couldn\u2019t stop reading, I really couldn\u2019t. I just had to know if they got back together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d my mother said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAre you working on something new?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d my mother said. Then she lowered her voice and added, \u201cI think you\u2019ll like it. The main character is a lot like Melina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh!\u201d the woman said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I honestly can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy!\u201d a voice shouted from over by the popcorn machine. \u201cCome here a second, will you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s my husband,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIt was just so nice to finally meet you. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you,\u201d my mother replied as the woman walked away, over to where her husband, a shorter man wearing a bandanna around his neck, was scrutinizing the mileage on a minivan. My mother watched her go, then glanced at her watch. Don wanted her to stay for the full three hours, but I was hoping we\u2019d get to go soon. I wasn\u2019t sure how much more barbershop music I could take.</p><p>\u201cYour public loves you,\u201d I said as I walked up.</p><p>\u201cMy public is not really here, I don\u2019t think. I\u2019ve already had two people ask me about financing, and I\u2019ve mostly just directed people to the bathroom,\u201d she said. Then, more brightly, she added, \u201cBut I have really enjoyed that wonderful barbershop quartet. Aren\u2019t they charming?\u201d</p><p>I plopped down on the curb beside her, not even bothering to answer this.</p><p>She sighed, fanning herself again. \u201cIt\u2019s very hot,\u201d she said. \u201cCould I have some of your drink?\u201d</p> <p>I looked down at the bottle of KaBoom Lissa had forced on me. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she said easily. \u201cIt\u2019s scorching out here. Just let me have a sip.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and handed it over. She screwed off the top, tipped it to her lips, and took a decent-size mouthful. Then she made a somewhat uneasy face, swallowed, and handed the bottle back to me.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Just then the white Truth Squad van bumped into the parking lot, pulling into a space by the auto bay. The back door opened and John Miller jumped out, his drumsticks tucked under his arm, followed by Lucas, who was eating a tangerine. They started unloading equipment and stacking it as Ted climbed out of the driver\u2019s side, slamming the door behind him. And then, as I watched, Dexter got out of the van, pulling a shirt on over his head. He checked his reflection in the side mirror, then ducked around the side of the van, out of my sight.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d seen him, of course. The morning after we broke up, in fact, I\u2019d been standing in line at Jump Java for Lola\u2019s morning mocha when he walked in, crossed the room in a most determined fashion, and came right up to me.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m thinking,\u201d he said, no hello or hi or anything, \u201cthat we need to be friends.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, my internal alarms went off, reminding me of the breakup logic I\u2019d been preaching for almost as long as I could remember. Not possible, I thought, but out loud I said, \u201cFriends?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFriends,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBecause it would be a shame if we did the whole awkward, ignoring-each-other, pretending-nothing-ever-happened thing. In fact, we could just jump right in and deal with it right now.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the clock next to the espresso machine. It was 9:05. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little early,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cto take that on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the point!\u201d he said emphatically as a man talking on his cell phone glanced over at us. \u201cLast night we broke up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, in a quieter voice than he was using, hoping he\u2019d catch the hint. No luck.</p><p>\u201cAnd today, here we are. Meeting up, as we are bound to do endless other times between now and when the summer ends. We do work across from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I said as I finally got up to the front of the line, nodding as the guy behind the counter asked if I wanted Lola\u2019s usual.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he went on, \u201cI say that we just admit that things may be a little strange, but that we won\u2019t avoid each other or allow things to be awkward at all. If anything feels weird, we acknowledge it straight up and move on. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d I said, \u201cthat it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can never go from going out to being friends, just like that,\u201d I explained, grabbing some napkins out of the dispenser. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s just something that people say they\u2019ll do to take the permanence out of a breakup. And someone always takes it to mean more than it does, and then is hurt even more when, inevitably, said \u2018friendly\u2019 relationship is still a major step down from the previous relationship, and it\u2019s like breaking up all over again. But messier.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He considered this, then said, \u201cOkay. Point taken. And in this scenario of yours, since I\u2019m the one pursuing the idea of a friendship, then it would be me who would get hurt again. Correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to say,\u201d I said, taking Lola\u2019s coffee and mouthing a thanks to the counter guy as I stuffed a dollar bill into the tip box. \u201cBut if this followed the formula, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I,\u201d he said, \u201cwill prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter,\u201d I said softly as we walked to the door, \u201ccome on.\u201d It seemed surreal to be discussing the previous night in such analytical terms, as if it had happened to someone else and we were just off to the side, doing the play-by-play.</p> <p>\u201cLook, this is important to me,\u201d he said as he held the door open and I ducked beneath his arm, keeping the cup in my hands level. \u201cI hate bad breakups. I hate awkwardness and those weird stilted conversations and feeling like I can\u2019t go somewhere because you\u2019re there, or whatever. For once I\u2019d like to just skip all that and agree to part as friends. And mean it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him. Last night, as we\u2019d stood in my front yard, I\u2019d dreaded this, seeing him again. And I had to admit I kind of liked that it was already pretty much over with, the first awkward Ex Sighting. Check it off the list, move on. Break up efficiently. What a concept.</p><p>\u201cIt would be,\u201d I said, brushing a hair out of my face, \u201cthe challenge of all challenges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he agreed, smiling. \u201cIndeed. You up for it?\u201d</p><p>Was I? It was hard to say. It sounded good on paper, but when actually put into practice I suspected there would be a few variables that would really screw up the numbers. But I hadn\u2019t backed down from a challenge yet.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re on. We\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d he repeated. And then we shook on it.</p><p>That had been two weeks ago, and since then we\u2019d talked several times, sticking to neutral topics like what was happening with Rubber Records (not much yet, but there was talk of A Meeting) and how Monkey was (good, but suffering through an infestation of fleas that had left everyone at the yellow house scratching and cranky). We\u2019d even eaten lunch together once, sitting on the curb outside of Flash Camera. We\u2019d decided there had to be rules, and established two so far. Number one: no unnecessary touching, which could only lead to trouble. And number two was if anything happened or was said that felt strange or awkward, there could be no strained silences: it had to be acknowledged as quickly as possible, brought out in the open, dealt with and dismantled, like diffusing a bomb.</p><p>Of course my friends all thought I was crazy. Two days after we\u2019d broken up, I\u2019d gone with them to Bendo, and Dexter had come over and chatted with me. When he\u2019d left, I\u2019d turned back to a row of skeptical, holier-than-thou faces, like I was drinking beer with a bunch of apostles.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Chloe said, pointing a finger at me, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you guys are going to be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly,\u201d I said, which only made them look more aghast. Lissa, who\u2019d spent the better part of the summer reading the kind of self-help books I normally associated with Jennifer Anne, looked especially disappointed. \u201cLook, we\u2019re better friends than dating. And we hardly dated at all, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d Chloe told me, lighting a cigarette. \u201cCrutch for the weak, the whole friends thing. Who used to say that?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right!\u201d she said, snapping her fingers. \u201cIt was you! You always said that, just like you always said that you should never date a guy in a band-\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201c-or give in to a guy who really pursues you, since they\u2019ll just lose interest the moment the chase ends-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-or fall for someone with an ex-girlfriend who is still hanging around, because if she hasn\u2019t gotten the message he probably isn\u2019t sending it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d I said. \u201cThat last one has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo out of three,\u201d she replied, waving her hand. \u201cMy point is made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Lissa said, reaching over and patting my hand, \u201cit\u2019s okay. You\u2019re human. You make the same mistakes as any of us. You know, in that book I was reading, Coming to Terms: What Love Can and Can\u2019t Do, there\u2019s a whole chapter on how we break our rules for men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not breaking my rules,\u201d I snapped, hating that I\u2019d ended up on the advice-receiving end of things, jumping from Dear Remy to Confused in Cincinnati all in one summer.</p><p>Now, at Toyotafaire, Chloe and I left my mother chatting with another fan and headed over to a patch of grass for some shade. At the microphones, Truth Squad was almost totally set up. Don had told us over dinner a few days earlier that he\u2019d hired them to play an hour-long set of nothing but car-related songs to really push the idea of fun, freewheeling summer driving.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ve got some prospects for us,\u201d Chloe said as Truth Squad launched into \u201cBaby You Can Drive My Car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProspects?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCollege guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said, fanning myself with one hand.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Matt,\u201d she continued, \u201cand he\u2019s a junior. Cute, tall. He wants to be a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot to date.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me. \u201cI knew it,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, \u201care so not one of us anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her legs at the ankles, kicking off her shoes, and leaned back on her palms. \u201cYou say that you\u2019re single and ready to be out there with us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she went on, \u201cevery time I\u2019ve tried to set you up or introduce you to anyone, you beg off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just the one time,\u201d I told her, \u201cand that was because I\u2019m not into skaters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was twice,\u201d she corrected me, \u201cand the second time he was totally cute and tall, just the way you like them, so don\u2019t give me that crap. We both know what the problem is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we do? And what is that?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and nodded toward where Truth Squad was in full swing, while two little kids in KaBoom T-shirts were dancing, jumping around. \u201cYour \u2018friend\u2019 over there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, waving this off as ridiculous, which it was.</p><p>\u201cYou still see him,\u201d she said, holding up a finger, counting this off.</p><p>\u201cWe work two feet from each other, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking to him,\u201d she said, holding up another finger. \u201cI bet you even have driven past his house when it wasn\u2019t even on your way home.\u201d</p> <p>That I wasn\u2019t even going to honor with a response. God.</p><p>For a minute or two we just sat there, as Truth Squad played a rousing medley of \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d and \u201cBorn to Be Wild.\u201d There were only a certain number of songs related to automobiles, but already they seemed to be grasping a bit.</p><p>\u201cSo, fine,\u201d I said finally. \u201cTell me about these guys.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, suspicious. \u201cDon\u2019t do me any favors,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to be out there, it\u2019ll show. We both know that. It\u2019s not even worth the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. They\u2019re all going to be sophomores, and...\u201d</p><p>She kept talking, and I half listened, noticing at the same time that Truth Squad was stretching the theme considerably as they started playing \u201cDead Man\u2019s Curve,\u201d not exactly the kind of song that fired anyone up to plunk down five figures on a shiny new car. Don picked up on this too, glaring at Dexter until the song was cut short, just as the curve was about to get really deadly: instead, they segued, a bit clumsily, into \u201cThe Little Old Lady from Pasadena.\u201d</p><p>I could see Dexter rolling his eyes, between verses, back at John Miller, and felt that twinge again, then quickly shook it off, not wanting to risk another set of told-you-so\u2019s from Chloe. It was time to get back on that horse, before I\u2019d done permanent damage to my reputation.</p><p>\u201c... so we set it up for tonight, seven o\u2019clock. We\u2019re all meeting at Rigoberto\u2019s for dinner. It\u2019s free breadstick night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cCount me in.\u201d</p><p>The thing about Out There that you always forget is how, at times, it can really suck.</p> <p>This is what I was thinking that night around eight-thirty, as I sat at a table at Rigoberto\u2019s, chewing on a stale breadstick and wishing my date, Evan, a chunky guy with tangled shoulder-length hair that desperately needed washing, would shut his mouth when he chewed.</p><p>\u201cTell me again,\u201d I said under my breath to Chloe, who was already cuddled up close with her date, the only good-looking one in the bunch, \u201cwhere you found these guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Wal-Mart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were buying trash bags, and so was I. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>I could. But this was because Evan had already told me that the day they\u2019d met Chloe they had been on their way to pick up litter. Their fantasy game club had adopted a stretch of highway and spent one Saturday a month cleaning it up. The rest of their time, apparently, was spent drawing up sketches of their game \u201calter egos\u201d and combating strange trolls and demons by rolling dice in somebody\u2019s basement. In just an hour, I\u2019d already learned more about Orcs, Klingons, and some master race invented by Evan himself called the Triciptiors than I ever cared to know.</p><p>Chloe\u2019s date, Ben, was cute. It was clear, however, that she had not taken the trouble to look past him when making these plans: Evan was, well, Evan, and the twins David and Darrin both were sporting Star Wars T-shirts and had spent the entire dinner so far ignoring Lissa and Jess completely while discussing Japanese animation. Jess was shooting Chloe death looks, while Lissa just smiled politely thinking, I knew, about her KaBoom coworker, P.J., and the crush she had on him that she thought wasn\u2019t obvious. This, basically, was Out There, and I realized in the last four weeks I\u2019d not missed it one bit.</p><p>After dinner the brothers Darrin and David headed home with Evan in tow, clearly as smitten with us as we had been with them. Jess begged off by saying she had to put her little brothers to bed, and Chloe and Ben stayed at the table, feeding each other tiramisu, leaving just me and Lissa.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked me as we climbed into my car. \u201cBendo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s just go to my house and watch movies or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>As we turned into my driveway, the headlights curving across the lawn, the first thing I saw was my mother sitting on the front steps. She had her shoes off, her elbows on her knees, and when she saw me she stood up, waving her arms, as if she was in the middle of the ocean clinging to a life raft instead of twenty feet from me on solid ground.</p><p>I got out of the car, Lissa behind me. I hadn\u2019t taken two steps when I heard someone off to my left say, \u201cFinally!\u201d</p><p>I turned around: it was Don, and he was holding a croquet mallet in one hand. His face was red, his shirt untucked, and he looked pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked my mother, who was now coming across the grass to us, quickly, her hands fluttering.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d Don said loudly, \u201cis that we have been locked out of the house for the last hour and a half with no way of gaining entry. Do you realize how many messages we\u2019ve left for you on your phone? Do you?\u201d</p><p>He was yelling at me. This took a moment to compute, simply because it had never happened before. None of my previous stepfathers had taken much interest in the parenting role, even when Chris and I were young enough to actually have tolerated it. Honestly, I was speechless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Answer me!\u201d he bellowed, and Lissa stepped back, a nervous look on her face. She hated confrontations. No one in her family yelled, and all discussions and disagreements were held in controlled, sympathetic, indoor voices.</p><p>\u201cDon, honey,\u201d my mother said, coming up beside him. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be upset. She\u2019s here now and she can let us in. Remy, give me your keys.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t move, keeping my eyes on Don. \u201cI was at dinner,\u201d I said in an even voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my phone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have called you six times!\u201d he said. \u201cDo you have any idea how late it is? I have a sales meeting at seven A.M. tomorrow, and I don\u2019t have time to be standing around out here trying to break into my own house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon, please,\u201d my mother said, reaching out a hand to touch his arm. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get home if you don\u2019t have your keys?\u201d I asked her.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cWe-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe drove home one of the new year models,\u201d Don snapped, \u201cand that\u2019s not the point. The point is that we have left messages for you and your brother which were not returned or acknowledged and we have been out here for over an hour, about to bust out a goddamn window-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s here now,\u201d my mother said cheerfully, \u201cso let\u2019s just get her key and we\u2019ll get inside and everything will be-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbara, for Christ\u2019s sake, do not interrupt me when I\u2019m talking!\u201d he snapped, whipping his head around to look at her. \u201cJesus!\u201d</p> <p>For a second, it was very quiet. I looked at my mother, feeling a pang of protectiveness that I hadn\u2019t experienced in years, since it was usually me either yelling at her or, more often, just wishing I could. But regardless of the anger my mother could flare in me, there had always been a clear line, at least in my mind, de marking the short but always clear distance between the We that was my family and whatever man was in her life. Don couldn\u2019t see it, but I could.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said to Don, my voice low, \u201cdon\u2019t talk to her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy, honey, give me your keys,\u201d my mother said, reaching out to touch my arm. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Don said, pointing right in my face. I stared at his fat finger, focusing only on it, while everything else-Lissa standing off to the side, my mother pleading, the smell of the summer night-fell away. \u201cYou need to learn some respect, missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d I heard Lissa say softly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d I said to Don, \u201cneed to respect my mother. This is nobody\u2019s fault but your own and you know it. You forgot your keys, you got locked out. End of story.\u201d</p><p>He just stood there, breathing hard. I could see Lissa shrinking down the driveway, bit by bit, as if with just another couple of steps she might be able to disappear completely.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d my mother said again. \u201cThe keys.\u201d</p><p>I pulled them out of my pocket, my eyes still on Don, then handed them past him to her. She took them and started quickly up the lawn. Don was still staring at me, as if he thought I might back down. He was wrong.</p><p>The porch light snapped on suddenly, and my mother clapped her hands. \u201cWe\u2019re in!\u201d she called out. \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well!\u201d</p><p>Don dropped the croquet mallet. It hit the driveway with a thunk. Then he turned his back to me and headed up the walk, taking long, angry strides. Once up the front steps, he pushed past my mother, ignoring her as she spoke to him, and disappeared down the hallway. A second later I heard a door slam.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a baby,\u201d I said to Lissa, who was now down by the mailbox, pretending to be engrossed with reading the new letters STARR/DAVIS that had recently been affixed to it.</p><p>\u201cHe was really mad, Remy.\u201d She came up the driveway carefully, as if expecting Don to throw himself back out the door, ready for round two. \u201cMaybe you should have just said you were sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for what?\u201d I said. \u201cFor not being psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just might have been easier.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the house, where my mother was standing in the doorway, hand on the knob, glancing down the hall to the darkened kitchen, the direction in which Don had stalked off. \u201cHey,\u201d I called out. She turned her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s his problem, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I thought I heard him saying something from inside, and she eased the door shut a bit, turning her body away from me. And suddenly I felt completely strange, like the distance between us was much much greater than what I could see from where I was standing. Like that line, always so clear to me, had somehow shifted, or never even been where I\u2019d thought it was at all.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I called out. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Good night, Remy,\u201d she said. And then she shut the door.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d I said to Jess. \u201cIt was totally messed up.\u201d</p><p>Across from me, Lissa nodded. \u201cBad,\u201d she said. \u201cLike scary bad.\u201d</p><p>Jess sipped on her Zip Coke, pulling her sweater tighter over her shoulders. We\u2019d gone by and knocked on her window after leaving my mom\u2019s, when I decided I wasn\u2019t about to spend the evening under the same roof as Don and his temper. Plus there was something else: this weird feeling of betrayal, almost, as if for so long my mother and I had been on one team, and now suddenly she\u2019d up and defected, pushing me aside for someone who would stick a finger in my face and demand respect he hadn\u2019t even begun to earn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of normal behavior,\u201d Jess told me. \u201cThis whole my-house-my-rules thing. Very male. Very Dad-esque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my dad,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dominance thing,\u201d Lissa chimed in. \u201cLike dogs. He was making clear to you that he is the alpha dog.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019re the alpha dog,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know that yet. He\u2019s testing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the alpha dog,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dog, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird that your mom would put up with that,\u201d Jess said in her thinking voice. \u201cShe\u2019s never been the type to take much crap, either. That\u2019s where you get it from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s scared,\u201d I said, and they both looked at me, surprised. I was surprised myself; I didn\u2019t realize I thought this until I said it aloud. \u201cI mean, of being alone. This is her fifth marriage, you know? If it doesn\u2019t work out-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-and you\u2019re leaving,\u201d Lissa added. \u201cAnd Chris is this close to being married himself-\u201d</p><p>I sighed, poking at my Zip Diet with my straw.</p><p>\u201c-so she thinks this is her last chance. She has to make it work.\u201d Lissa sat back, ripping open the bag of Skittles she\u2019d bought and popping a red one in her mouth. \u201cSo maybe, she would pick him over you. Just for now. Because he\u2019s the one she has to live with, you know, indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Jess eyed me as I heard this, as if expecting some reaction. \u201cWelcome to adulthood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sucks as much as high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t believe in relationships,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re such a crutch. Why would she put up with his baby ways like this? Because she thinks she needs him or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lissa said slowly, \u201cmaybe she does need him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d I said. \u201cIf he moved out tomorrow she\u2019d have a new prospect within a week. I\u2019d lay money on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she loves him,\u201d Lissa said. \u201cAnd love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone\u2019s bad qualities because they somehow complete you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is an excuse to put up with shit that you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d I replied, and Jess laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s how it gets you. It throws off the scales so that things that should weigh heavily don\u2019t seem to. It\u2019s a crock. A trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Lissa said, sitting up straighter, \u201clet\u2019s talk about untied shoelaces.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDexter,\u201d she said. \u201cHis shoelaces were always untied. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do, and yes, they were. Plus he was clumsy, his room was a mess, he was completely unorganized, and he ate in your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ate in your car?\u201d Jess asked incredulously. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the one time,\u201d I said, and ignored the it\u2019s-a-miracle-throw-up-a-hallelujah face she made. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d Lissa cut in, \u201cthat these are all things that would have made you send any other guy packing within seconds. But with Dexter, you put up with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d she said, pouring more Skittles into her hand, \u201cand why, do you think, were you willing to overlook these things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it was because I loved him,\u201d I warned her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe you could have loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cExtremely unlikely,\u201d Jess agreed. \u201cAlthough, you did let him eat in your car, so I suppose anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were different around him,\u201d Lissa said to me. \u201cThere was something new about you that I\u2019d never seen before. Maybe that was love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr lust,\u201d Jess said.</p><p>\u201cCould have been,\u201d I said, leaning back on my palms. \u201cBut I never slept with him.\u201d</p><p>Jess raised her eyebrows. \u201cNo?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cI almost did. But no.\u201d The night he\u2019d played the guitar for me, that first time, picking out the chords of my father\u2019s song, I\u2019d been ready to. It had already been a few weeks, which at one time might have been considered a record for me. But just as we\u2019d gotten close, he\u2019d pulled back a bit, taking my hands and folding them against his chest, instead pressing his face into my neck. It was subtle, but clear. Not yet. Not now. I\u2019d wondered what he was waiting for, but hadn\u2019t found a good time to ask him. And now I\u2019d never know.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Lissa said, snapping her fingers as if she\u2019d just discovered uranium, \u201cproves it. Right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProves what?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAny other guy you would have slept with. No question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d I said, pointing at her. \u201cI have changed, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would have, right?\u201d she asked. She was so insistent, this new Lissa. \u201cYou knew him well enough, you liked him, you\u2019d been hanging out for a while. But you didn\u2019t. And why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because,\u201d she said grandly, sweeping her hand, \u201cit meant something to you. It was bigger than just one guy and one night and out you go, free and clear. Part of the change I saw in you. That we all saw. It would mean more, and that scared you.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jess but she was scratching her knee, choosing not to get into this. And what did Lissa know anyway? It was Dexter who\u2019d stopped things, not me. But then again, I hadn\u2019t tried to push it further, and there had been other chances. Not that that meant anything. At all.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Lissa said, pleased with herself. \u201cYou\u2019re speechless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cwas the closest you\u2019ve come to love, Remy. Real love. And you dodged it, at the last second. But it was close. Real close. You could have loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>When I got home later that night I realized, irony of ironies, that I was locked out. I\u2019d given my key to my mother, and never thought to ask for it back. Luckily, Chris was home. So I just tapped on the window over the kitchen sink, making him jump about four feet vertically and shriek like a schoolgirl, which made having to forge through the dark and navigate around the pricker bushes in the backyard at least worthwhile.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said nonchalantly as he opened the back door, all cool now, as if we both hadn\u2019t just witnessed this particularly spineless behavior. \u201cWhere\u2019s your key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, somewhere,\u201d I said, stopping the door before it slammed shut. \u201cMom and Don were locked out earlier.\u201d Then I filled him in on the gory details as he munched on a peanut butter sandwich-bread butts again-nodding and rolling his eyes in all the right places.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he said as I finished. I shushed him, and he lowered his voice. Our walls, we both knew, were thin. \u201cWhat a chump. He was yelling at her?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI mean, not in a violent way. More in a pouty, spoiled brat kind of way.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the last remnants of bread butts in his hand. \u201cNo surprise there. He\u2019s a total baby. And the next time I trip over one of those Ensures on the side porch someone\u2019s going down. Down. \u201d</p><p>This made me smile, reminding me of how much I really liked my brother. Despite our differences, we did have a history. No one understood where I was coming from the way he did.</p><p>\u201cHey Chris?\u201d I asked him as he pulled a carton of milk from the fridge and poured himself a glass.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I sat down on the edge of the table, running my hand over the surface. I could feel little pieces of sugar, or salt, fine but distinct beneath my fingers. \u201cWhat made you decide to love Jennifer Anne?\u201d</p><p>He turned around and looked at me, then swallowed with a glunking noise my mother always screamed at him about when we were kids, saying it made him sound like he was drinking rocks. \u201cDecide to love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNope.

Forget it.\u201d</p><p>He put his glass in the sink, then ran water over it. \u201cDo you mean what made me love her?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I could take further discussion of that question. \u201cNo. I mean, when you thought about whether or not you wanted to open yourself up, you know, to the chance that you could get really hurt, somehow, if you moved forward with her, what did you think? To yourself?\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow at me. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped. \u201cGod. It\u2019s a simple question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. So simple I still don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re asking.\u201d He flipped off the light over the sink, then wiped his hands on a dishtowel. \u201cYou want to know how I debated about whether or not to fall in love with her? Is that even close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d I said, pushing off the table. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m trying to find out. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d I started toward the foyer, and as I got closer, I could see my keys laid out neatly on the table by the stairs, waiting for me. I slid them into my back pocket.</p><p>I was on the second step when Chris appeared in the kitchen doorway. \u201cRemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what you\u2019re asking is how I debated whether or not to love her the answer is I didn\u2019t. Not at all. It just happened. I didn\u2019t ever question it; by the time I realized what was happening, it was already done.\u201d</p> <p>I stood there on the stairs, looking down at him. \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and flipped off the last kitchen light, then started up the stairs, brushing past me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeday, you will.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared down the hall, and a minute later I heard him shut his door, his voice low as he made his required good-night-again-this-time-by-phone call to Jennifer Anne. I washed my face, brushed my teeth, and was on my way to bed when I stopped by the half-open door of the lizard room.</p><p>Most of the cages were dark. The lights for the lizards were kept on timers, which clicked them on and off at just the right cycles to make the lizards believe, I supposed, that they were still sunning themselves on desert rocks instead of sitting in a cage in a converted linen closet. But at the far end of the room, on a middle shelf, one light was on.</p><p>It was a glass cage, and the floor of it was covered in sand. There were sticks crisscrossing it, and at the top of one stick were two lizards. As I came closer, I saw that they were entwined-not in a mating, nature-takes-its-course kind of way, but almost tenderly, if that was even possible, like they were holding each other. They both had their eyes closed, and I could see the pattern of their ribs, revealed and hidden with each breath they took.</p><p>I kneeled down in front of the cage, pressing my index finger against the glass. The lizard on the top opened his eyes and looked at me, unflinching, his pupil widening slightly as he focused on my finger.</p> <p>I knew this meant nothing. They were just lizards, cold-blooded and probably no smarter than the average earthworm. But there was something so human about them, and for a minute all the things that had happened in the last few weeks blurred past in my mind: Dexter and I breaking up, my mother\u2019s worried face, Don\u2019s finger pointing at me, all the way up to Chris shaking his head, unable to put into words what seemed to me, at least, the most simple of concepts. And all of it came down to one thing: love, or the lack of it. The chances we take, knowing no better, to fall or to stand back and hold ourselves in, protecting our hearts with the tightest of grips.</p><p>I looked back at the lizard in front of me, wondering if I had finally gone completely crazy. He returned my gaze, now having decided I was not a threat, and then slowly closed his eyes again. I leaned in closer, still watching, but already the light was dimming as the timer kicked in, and before I knew it, everything was dark.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cRemy, sugar? Come here for a minute, will you?\u201d</p><p>I got up from behind the reception desk, putting down the stack of body lotion invoices I\u2019d been counting, and walked back into the manicure/pedicure room, where Amanda, our best nail girl, was wiping down her work space. Behind her was Lola, patting her scissors into her open palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, already suspicious.</p><p>\u201cJust sit down,\u201d Amanda told me, and the next thing I knew I was sitting: Talinga had snuck up behind me and pressed down on my shoulders, whipping a hair cape around me and snapping it at the neck before I even knew what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d I said as Amanda grabbed my hands and planted them, quick as lightning, onto the table between us. She spread out my fingers and started filing my nails with quick, aggressive jerks of an emory board, biting her lip as she did so.</p><p>\u201cJust a quick makeover,\u201d Lola said smoothly, coming up behind me and lifting up my hair. \u201cA little manicure, a little trim, a little makeup-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said, pulling free from her grip. \u201cYou are not touching my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a trim!\u201d she replied, yanking me back into place. \u201cUngrateful girl, most women would pay big money for this. And you get it for free!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet not,\u201d I grumbled, and they all laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands still or I\u2019ll cut more than this cuticle,\u201d Amanda warned me.</p><p>\u201cNo catch,\u201d Lola said breezily, and I braced myself as I heard snipping behind me. God, she was cutting my hair. \u201cA bonus.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Talinga, who was testing lipsticks on the back of her hand, glancing at me every so often as she gauged my colors. \u201cBonus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA plus. A gift!\u201d Lola laughed one of her big laughs. \u201cA special present for our Miss Remy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift,\u201d I repeated, warily. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess,\u201d Amanda said, smiling at me as she started applying smooth streaks of red polish to my pinky nail.</p><p>\u201cIs it bigger than a bread box?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou wish!\u201d Lola said, and they all started laughing hysterically, like this was the funniest thing ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d I said sternly, \u201cor I\u2019m out of here. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>They were still tittering, trying to control themselves. Finally Talinga took a deep breath and said, \u201cRemy, honey. We found you a man. \u201d</p><p>\u201cA man?\u201d I said. \u201cGod. I thought maybe I was getting some free cosmetics or something. Something I need. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a man,\u201d Amanda said, moving to my next nail.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Talinga said, \u201c I need a man. Remy needs a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nice boy,\u201d Lola corrected her. \u201cAnd today is your lucky day, because we happen to have one for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d I said as Talinga bent down next to me, poking at my face with a makeup brush. \u201cIs this the one you tried to set me up with before? The bilingual one with nice hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here at six,\u201d Lola went on, ignoring me completely. \u201cHis name is Paul, he\u2019s nineteen, and he thinks he\u2019s coming to pick up some samples for his mother. But instead he\u2019ll see you, with your beautiful hair-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd makeup,\u201d Talinga added.</p> <p>\u201cAnd nails,\u201d Amanda said, \u201cif you stop wiggling around, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-and be completely smitten,\u201d Lola finished. Then she did two more small snips and ran a hand through my hair, checking her work. \u201cGod, you had some split ends. Disgraceful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cmakes you think I\u2019ll go through with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s good-looking,\u201d Talinga said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you should,\u201d Amanda added.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Lola said, whisking the cape off me, \u201cyou can.\u201d</p> <p>I had to admit they were right. Paul was good-looking. He was also funny, pronounced my name right, had a firm handshake-and, okay, nice hands-and seemed to be a good sport about the fact that it was such an obvious setup, exchanging a wary expression with me when Lola \u201cjust happened\u201d to have a gift certificate from my favorite Mexican place that she was suddenly sure she\u2019d never use.</p><p>\u201cDo you get the feeling,\u201d Paul asked me, \u201cthat this is out of our control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut it is a free dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cGood point. But really, don\u2019t feel obligated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou either,\u201d I told him.</p><p>We stood there for a second while Lola and Talinga and Amanda, in the next room, were so quiet I could hear someone\u2019s stomach growling.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go,\u201d I said. \u201cMake their day and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven?\u201d</p> <p>I wrote down my address on the back of a Joie business card, then watched as he walked out to his car. He was cute, and I was single. It had been almost three weeks since Dexter and I had split, and not only was I dealing with it, we\u2019d almost finessed the impossible: a friendship. And here was this nice guy, an opportunity. Why wouldn\u2019t I take it?</p><p>One possible answer to this question appeared as I was walking out to my car, digging in my purse for my keys and sunglasses. I wasn\u2019t looking where I was going, much less around me, and didn\u2019t even see Dexter come out of Flash Camera and cross the parking lot until I heard a loud clicking noise and looked up to see him standing there, holding a disposable wedding camera.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, winding the film with one finger. Then he put the camera back up to his eye and bent back a bit, getting me from another angle. \u201cWow, you look great. Got a hot date or something?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, and he took the picture. Click. \u201cWell, actually...\u201d I said.</p><p>For a second, he didn\u2019t move, not winding the film or anything, just looking at me still through the viewfinder. Then he took the camera away from his eye, then smacked his forehead with one hand and said, \u201cOuch. Oh, man. Awkward moment time. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a setup,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cLola did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain,\u201d he said, winding the film, click-click-click. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>And then it happened. One of those too-long-to-just-be-a-regular-pause-in-conversation pauses, and I said, \u201cOkay. Well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, awkward. Double awkward,\u201d he said. Then shrugged his shoulders briskly, as if shaking this off, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a challenge, after all, right? It\u2019s not supposed to be easy.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my purse, realizing my keys, which I\u2019d been digging for this whole time, were in fact in my back pocket. I pulled them out, glad to have some kind of task, however stupid, to focus on.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said casually, pointing the camera over my head and taking a picture of Joie\u2019s storefront, \u201cwho\u2019s the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, this is what friends discuss, right? It\u2019s just a question. Like asking about the weather.\u201d</p><p>I considered this. We had known what we were getting into: eating ten bananas wasn\u2019t easy either. \u201cThe son of a client here. I just met him twenty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, rocking back on his heels. \u201cBlack Honda?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cRight. Saw him.\u201d He wound the film again. \u201cLooked like a nice, upstanding guy.\u201d</p><p>Upstanding, I thought to myself. As if he were running for student council president, or volunteering to help your grandmother across the street. \u201cIt\u2019s just dinner,\u201d I said as he snapped another picture, this one, inexplicably, of my feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the camera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefective shipment,\u201d he explained. \u201cSomebody at the main office left the box out in the sun, so they\u2019re all warped. Management said we could have them, if we wanted them. Kind of like the tangerines, you know. Can\u2019t turn down free stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will the pictures even come out?\u201d I asked, noticing now, as I looked closer, that the camera itself was bent, warped, like the VCR tape I\u2019d accidentally left on my dash the summer before. It didn\u2019t look like you could even get the film out, much less develop it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he said, taking another picture. \u201cThey might. Or they might not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cThe film\u2019s probably ruined from the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe,\u201d he said, holding the camera out at arm\u2019s length and smiling big as he snapped a picture of himself, \u201cit isn\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s just fine. We won\u2019t know until we develop it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s probably a total waste,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p><p>He put down the camera and looked at me, really looked at me, not through the lens, or from the side, just me and him. \u201cThat\u2019s the big question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole problem here. I think they just might come out. Maybe they won\u2019t be perfect-I mean, they could be blurred, or cut off in the middle-but I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s worth a shot. That\u2019s just me, though.\u201d</p><p>I just stood there, blinking, as he lifted the camera up and took one more shot of me. I stared straight at him as it clicked, letting him know I got his little metaphor. \u201cI have to go,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and smiled at me. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p> <p>As he walked away, he tucked the camera into his back pocket, darting between cars as he headed back to Flash Camera. Maybe he would print out the pictures and find them perfect: my face, my feet, Joie rising up behind me. Or maybe it would just be black, void of light, not even an outline of a face or figure visible. That was the problem, after all. I wouldn\u2019t waste the time on such odds, while he jumped to them. People like Dexter followed risks the way dogs followed smells, thinking only of what could lie ahead and never logically of what probably did. It was good we were friends, and only that. If even that. We never would have lasted. Not a chance.</p><p>It had been two days since the scene with Don in the front yard, and so far I\u2019d managed to avoid him, timing my trips to our common area, the kitchen, when I knew he was either out or in the shower. My mother was easier: she was completely immersed in her novel, pushing through the last hundred pages at breakneck speed, and hardly would have noticed a bomb going off in the living room if it meant pulling herself away from Melanie and Brock Dobbin and their impossible love.</p><p>Which was why I was surprised to find her sitting at the kitchen table, a cup of coffee beside her, when I came home to get ready for my date with setup Paul. She had her head balanced on one hand and was staring up at Don\u2019s naked lady painting, so lost in thought that she jumped when I touched her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, Remy,\u201d she said, pressing a finger to her temple and smiling. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I pulled out a chair and sat down across from her, dropping my keys on the table. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWaiting for Don,\u201d she said, fluffing her hair with her fingers. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting some Toyota VIPs for dinner, and he\u2019s a nervous wreck. He thinks if we don\u2019t impress them they\u2019ll cut back on his dealer perk allotment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cIt\u2019s dealership talk. This whole night will be dealership talk, and meanwhile I\u2019ve got Melanie and Brock at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 in Brussels with her estranged husband fast approaching and the last thing in the world I want to think about is sales figures and cut-rate financing techniques.\u201d She cast a longing look into her study at her typewriter, as if being pulled there by some tidelike force. \u201cOh, God, don\u2019t you sometimes wish you could live two lives?\u201d</p><p>Inexplicably, or maybe not, Dexter suddenly popped into my head, watching me through a bent disposable camera. Click. \u201cSometimes, yeah,\u201d I said, shaking this off. \u201cI guess I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbara!\u201d Don bellowed, opening the door to the New Wing. I couldn\u2019t see him, but his voice had no trouble carrying. \u201cHave you seen my red tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what, darling?\u201d she called back.</p> <p>\u201cMy red tie, the one I wore to the sales dinner? Have you seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, turning in her chair. \u201cMaybe if you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll just wear the green one,\u201d he said, and the door shut again.</p><p>My mother smiled at me, as if he was just really something, then reached over and patted my hand. \u201cEnough about me. What\u2019s happening with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cLola set me up with a blind date for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blind date?\u201d She looked at me warily.</p><p>\u201cI already met him, at the salon,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe seems really nice. And it\u2019s just dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cJust dinner. As if nothing could happen within three courses and a bottle of wine.\u201d Then she sat there, blinking. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cOh, my. I should write that down.\u201d</p> <p>I watched as she picked up an envelope, an old power bill, and a pen. Three courses-just dinner-nothing could happen she scrawled on the side of it, capping it off with a big exclamation point, then slid the envelope under the sugar bowl, where it would probably remain, forgotten, until one day when she was totally blocked and found it. She left these scribblings all around the house, folded into corners, on the backs of shelves, acting as markers in books. I\u2019d once found one about seals, which later turned out to be a major plot point in Memories of Truro, sticking out of a box of tampons under my sink. I guess you just never knew when inspiration would strike.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re going to La Brea,\u201d I told her, \u201cso it\u2019ll probably just be the one course. Even less chance of it working out.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me. \u201cYou never know, Remy. Love is so unpredictable. Sometimes you\u2019ll know a man for years and then one day, boom! Suddenly you see him in a different way. And other times, it\u2019s that first date, that first moment. That\u2019s what makes it so great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not falling in love with him. It\u2019s just a date,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBarbara!\u201d Don yelled. \u201cWhat did you do with my cuff links?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d she said, turning around again. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched your cuff links.\u201d She sat there, waiting, and when he didn\u2019t say anything else she just shrugged, turning back to me.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I said, lowering my voice, \u201cI don\u2019t see how you put up with him.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, reaching over to brush my hair out of my face. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big baby,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the Ensure thing would make me nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I love Don. He\u2019s a good man, he\u2019s kind to me. And no relationship is perfect, ever. There are always some ways you have to bend, to compromise, to give something up in order to gain something greater. Yes, Don has habits that try my patience. And I\u2019m sure I have plenty that do the same for him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt least you act like an adult,\u201d I said, although I knew myself this wasn\u2019t always true. \u201cHe can\u2019t even dress himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she went on, ignoring this, \u201cthe love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences. And that\u2019s the key. It\u2019s like a big pie chart, and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece. Love can make up for a lot, Remy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is a sham,\u201d I said, sliding the saltshaker in a circle.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, no!\u201d She reached over and took my hand, squeezing my fingers. \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that, do you?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cI have yet to be convinced otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Remy.\u201d She picked up my hand, folding her fingers around mine. Hers were smaller, cooler, the nails bright pink. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>I just looked at her. One, two, three seconds. And then she was with me.</p><p>\u201cOh, now,\u201d she said, letting my hand go, \u201cjust because a few marriages didn\u2019t last doesn\u2019t make it a total wash. I had many good years with your father, Remy, and the best part was that I got Chris and you out of it. The four years I was with Harold were wonderful, until the very end. And even with Martin and Win, I was happy for most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they did end, all of them,\u201d I said. \u201cThey failed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe some people would say so.\u201d She folded her hands in her lap and thought for a second. \u201cBut I think, personally, that it would be worse to have been alone all that time. Sure, maybe I would have protected my heart from some things, but would that really have been better? To hold myself apart because I was too scared that something might not be forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, picking at the edge of the table. \u201cBecause at least then you\u2019re safe. The fate of your heart is your choice, and no one else gets a vote.\u201d</p><p>She considered this, really thinking about it, then said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s true that I have been hurt in my life. Quite a bit. But it\u2019s also true that I have loved, and been loved. And that carries a weight of its own. A greater weight, in my opinion. It\u2019s like that pie chart we talked about earlier. In the end, I\u2019ll look back on my life and see that the greatest piece of it was love. The problems, the divorces, the sadness... those will be there too, but just smaller slivers, tiny pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think that you have to protect yourself,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just give yourself away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cYou can\u2019t. But holding people away from you, and denying yourself love, that doesn\u2019t make you strong. If anything, it makes you weaker. Because you\u2019re doing it out of fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear of what?\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cOf taking that chance,\u201d she said simply. \u201cOf letting go and giving into it, and that\u2019s what makes us what we are. Risks. That\u2019s living, Remy. Being too scared to even try it-that\u2019s just a waste. I can say I made a lot of mistakes, but I don\u2019t regret things. Because at least I didn\u2019t spend a life standing outside, wondering what living would be like.\u201d</p><p>I sat there, not even sure what to say next. I realized I\u2019d felt sorry for my mother for nothing. All these years I\u2019d pitied her all her marriages, saw the very fact that she kept trying as her greatest weakness, not understanding that to her, it was the complete opposite. In her mind, me sending Dexter away made me weaker than him, not stronger.</p><p>\u201cBarbara, we\u2019ve got to be there in ten minutes so let\u2019s-\u201d Don appeared in the kitchen doorway, tie crooked, his jacket folded over one arm. He stopped when he saw me. \u201cOh. Remy. Hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, look at your tie,\u201d my mother said, standing up. She walked over to him, smoothing her hands down the front of his shirt, and straightened it, tightening the knot. \u201cThere. All fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go.\u201d Don kissed her on the forehead and she stepped back from him. \u201cGianni hates having to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, then let\u2019s get going,\u201d my mother said. \u201cRemy, honey, have a wonderful time. Okay? And think about what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I told her. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p> <p>Don headed out to the car, keys in hand-which I noticed, of course-but my mother came over to me as I stood up, putting her hands on my shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t let your mother\u2019s history make you a cynic, Remy,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Too late, I thought as she kissed me. Then I watched as she walked out to the car, where Don was waiting. He put a hand against the small of her back, guiding her into her seat, and in that one moment I began to think I just might understand what she was talking about. Maybe a marriage, like a life, isn\u2019t only about the Big Moments, whether they be bad or good. Maybe it\u2019s all the small things-like being guided slowly forward, surely, day after day-that stretch out to strengthen even the most tenuous bond.</p><p>My luck was continuing. Paul was actually not a bad setup.</p><p>I\u2019d been a little wary when he\u2019d picked me up, but was surprised when, actually, we\u2019d immediately fallen into talking about college. Apparently one of his best friends from high school was at Stanford, and he\u2019d been there over Christmas to visit.</p><p>\u201cGreat campus,\u201d he was saying as the mariachi band, a La Brea staple, started up yet another rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d across the restaurant. \u201cPlus the ratio in the classes of professors to students is really good. You\u2019re not just dealing with a TA, you know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI hear it\u2019s pretty rigorous academically.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOh, come on. I know how smart you have to be to get in there. I doubt you\u2019ll have a problem. You probably, like, aced the SATs, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI, however,\u201d he said grandly, taking a sip of his water, \u201cscored in the moron category. Which is why I\u2019ll still be at my fine state school pulling the gentleman\u2019s C, while you head off to lead the free world. You can send me a postcard. Or, better yet, come see me at my postgraduate job, where I\u2019ll be happy to Supersize your order because, you know, we\u2019re friends and all.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Paul was a charmer, and a rich boy, but I liked him. He was the kind of guy where talking comes easily because he has something in common with everyone. Already, other than Stanford we\u2019d discussed waterskiing (he was terrible, but addicted), the fact that he was bilingual (Spanish-his grandmother was Venezuelan), and the fact that once summer was over, he\u2019d head back to school, where he was a brother at Sigma Nu, majored in psychology, and managed what he described as the \u201call heart, no skills\u201d men\u2019s basketball team. He wasn\u2019t goofy or uproariously hilarious, but then again, he wasn\u2019t clumsy either, and both his shoes were tied. Before I knew it, our food had come, we\u2019d eaten, and we were still sitting there talking, even as they cleared every plate from around us in a subtle hint that we were lingering too long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, as we made our waiter\u2019s day by finally leaving, \u201cin the interest of full disclosure, I have to say I was a little wary about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the interest of full disclosure,\u201d I replied, \u201cI would say that you were not alone in that feeling.\u201d</p><p>As we reached the car, he surprised me by unlocking my door, then holding it open as I climbed in. Nice, I thought, as he walked around to the driver\u2019s side. Very nice.</p><p>\u201cSo, if this had been a total disaster,\u201d he said as he got in, \u201cI\u2019d tell you I had a great time, then take you home, walk you to your door, and run every stop sign on the way out of your neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClassy,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he went on, \u201csince it wasn\u2019t, I was wondering if you wanted to go to a party with me. Some friends of mine are having a pool thing. You interested?\u201d</p><p>I considered my options. So far, it had been a good night. A good date. Nothing had happened that I would regret, or have to think about too much later. It was all going by the book, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t shake what my mother had said to me from my mind. Maybe I did hold the world at arm\u2019s length, and so far it had worked for me. But you just never knew.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He smiled, then cranked the engine. As he started to back out, I caught him glancing over at me, and knew, right then, that already things were in motion. It was funny how easy it was to start again, after only three weeks. I\u2019d thought Dexter would affect me more, change me, but here I was with another boy in another car, the cycle starting all over again. Dexter was the different one, the aberration. This was what I was used to, and it was good to be back on a sure footing again.</p> <p>\u201cMan,\u201d Lissa said, dipping a fry into her ketchup, \u201cit\u2019s like you special-ordered him or something. How is that?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, sipping on my Diet Coke. \u201cJust lucky, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s totally cute.\u201d Lissa stuffed another fry in her mouth. \u201cGod, all the good ones are taken, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does this whining,\u201d Jess asked Lissa, \u201cmean that KaBoom P.J. has a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that,\u201d Lissa said sulkily, eating another fry. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve already broken up once this summer. She hasn\u2019t come to a single event, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Jess said, and I laughed out loud.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d Lissa continued, ignoring us, \u201cthat it\u2019s just not fair that I\u2019ve been dumped and now the guy I like is unavailable while Remy gets not only fun band boyfriend but now cute college boyfriend. It\u2019s not right.\u201d She ate another fry. \u201cAnd, I can\u2019t stop eating. Not that anybody cares, since I\u2019m completely unlovable anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Jess grumbled. \u201cGet out the violin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun band boyfriend?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDexter was nice,\u201d she told me, wiping her mouth. \u201cAnd now you have perfect Paul too. And all I\u2019ve got is an endless supply of KaBoom and the appetite of a truck driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a healthy appetite,\u201d Jess told her. \u201cGuys like a few curves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have curves already,\u201d Lissa replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Clumps?\u201d Chloe, the thinnest of all of us, snorted at this. \u201cThat\u2019s one word for it.\u201d</p><p>Lissa sighed, shoving her tray away and wiping her hands on a napkin. \u201cI gotta go. I\u2019m due at the Tri-Country track meet in fifteen minutes. We\u2019re KaBooming the all-state athletes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jess said dryly, \u201cbe sure to wear protection.\u201d</p> <p>Lissa made a face. She was over the KaBoom jokes, but they were just too easy.</p><p>Back at work, Paul dropped by to see me on his way home from his life-guarding job at the Y. I couldn\u2019t help but notice a couple of bridesmaids waiting for prewedding manicures ogle him a bit as he came in, tanned and smelling like suntan lotion and chlorine.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, and I stood up and kissed him, very lightly, because that was about where we were at relationship-wise. It had been a week and a half, and we\u2019d seen each other almost every day: lunches, dinners, a couple of parties. \u201cI know you\u2019re busy tonight, but I just wanted to say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d He grinned at me. God, he was cute. I kept thinking that if only I\u2019d gone out with him way back when Lola had first tried to set us up, the entire summer would have been different. Totally different.</p><p>After all, Paul met just about every criteria on my guy list. He was tall. Good-looking. Had no annoying personal habits. Was older than me but not by more than three years. Was a decent dresser but didn\u2019t shop more than I did. Fell within the acceptable limits in terms of personal hygiene (i.e., aftershave and cologne yes, mousse and fake tan, no). Was smart enough to carry on good conversation but not an eggbert. But the big whammy, the tipping point, was that he was leaving at the end of the summer and we\u2019d already established that we would part as friends and go our separate ways.</p><p>Which left me with a nice, cute, courteous guy with his own life and hobbies who liked me, kissed very well, paid for dinner, and had no problem with any of the terms that so many before him had stumbled over. And all this from a blind date. Amazing.</p><p>\u201cSo I know tonight is girls\u2019 night,\u201d he said as I slid my hands across the counter, over his, \u201cbut I wondered what the chances were for getting up with you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d I told him. \u201cOnly the lamest women bail their girlfriends for a guy. It\u2019s against the code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cWell. It was worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>Across the parking lot, I could see the white Truth Squad van pulling up to Flash Camera. Ted parked in the loading zone and hopped out of the driver\u2019s side, slamming the door behind him, then disappeared inside.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing tonight?\u201d I asked Paul. \u201cBoy stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said as I looked across at Flash Camera again, watching as Dexter followed Ted back to the van. They were talking animatedly-arguing?-as they hopped in and drove off, running the stop sign that led past Mayor\u2019s Market, toward the main road.</p><p>\u201c... some band the guys want to see is playing at that club over by the university.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I said, not exactly listening as the white van pulled out into traffic in front of a station wagon, which let loose with an angry beep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, Trey says they\u2019re really good... Spinnerbait, I think they\u2019re called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate Spinnerbait,\u201d I said automatically.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, realizing I\u2019d been in a complete fog for this entire conversation. \u201cOh, nothing. I just, um, I heard that band kind of sucked.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cWow. Really? Trey says they\u2019re great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sure he knows better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d He leaned across the counter and kissed me. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tonight, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As he left, the two bridesmaids eyed me appreciatively, as if I was due respect simply because such a guy was with me. But for some reason I was distracted, ringing up Mrs. Jameson\u2019s hair streaking as a bikini wax and then charging her fifty bucks instead of five for some cuticle cream. At least it was almost time to go home.</p> <p>I was getting into my car when I heard someone tap on the passenger window. I looked up: it was Lucas. \u201cHey Remy,\u201d he said, when I rolled down the window. \u201cCan you give me a ride home? Dex already left with the van and otherwise I have to hoof it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, even though I was already running late. I was supposed to pick up Lissa, and the yellow house was entirely in the other direction. But it wasn\u2019t like I could just leave him there.</p><p>He climbed in, then immediately began to fiddle with the radio as I backed out of my parking spot. This, at one point, would have been grounds for instant ejection, but I let it slide because I was in a decent mood. \u201cWhat CDs you got?\u201d he asked, flipping past my main preset to the lower end of the dial and cranking up some experimental-sounding, shrieking-ish noise on the college radio station.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the glove box,\u201d I said, pointing. He opened it up and shuffled through them-they had been arranged alphabetically, but only because I\u2019d had some extra time when stuck in a traffic jam a few days earlier. He kept making clucking noises, low sighs, and mumbles. Apparently my collection, like my presets, wasn\u2019t up to his standards. But I had no need to impress Lucas. Thanks to Dexter I knew not only that his given name was Archibald, but also that in high school he\u2019d had long hair and played in a metal band called Residew. Apparently there was only one picture existing of Lucas wailing on his keyboard in full-hair-sprayed mode, and Dexter had it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, feeling the need to mess with him a bit anyway, \u201cI hear Spinnerbait\u2019s playing tonight.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head around and looked at me. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMurray\u2019s,\u201d I told him as we cruised through a yellow light.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcross town, by the university. It\u2019s a pretty big place.\u201d I could see him in my peripheral vision; he was gnawing on the cuff of his shirt, looking irritated.</p><p>\u201cHate Spinnerbait,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cBunch of poser rock assholes. Totally manufactured sound, and their fans are a bunch of pretty-boy, frat-a-tat blondies with good hair driving Daddy\u2019s car with no taste whatsoever. \u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d I said, unable to help but notice this description, while harsh, did somewhat describe Trey, Paul\u2019s best friend, as well as Paul himself, if you didn\u2019t know him better. Which, of course, I did.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is big news,\u201d Lucas said as I turned onto their street. \u201cBut not as big as what else is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I said, immediately flashing back to the van speeding out of Mayor\u2019s Village earlier.</p><p>He glanced over at me, and I could tell by his face he was weighing whether it was even my business. \u201cHigh-level band stuff,\u201d he said cryptically. \u201cWe\u2019re on the brink. Basically.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d I said. \u201cThe brink of what?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as I slowed down, the yellow house coming up in sight. I could see Ted and Scary Mary in the front yard, sitting in lawn chairs: she had her feet in his lap, and they were sharing a box of Twinkies. \u201cRubber Records wants to meet with us. We\u2019re going up to D.C. next week, to you know, talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, navigating my way into the driveway, where the van was parked at an angle. Ted looked over at us, mildly interested, and Mary waved as Lucas popped open his door and got out. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet this,\u201d he yelled at Ted. \u201cSpinnerbait\u2019s playing tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate Spinnerbait!\u201d Mary said.</p><p>\u201cWhere at?\u201d Ted asked as Lucas shut my door and walked around the front of the car.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d he said, knocking his hand on my half-open window. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, what is that all about?\u201d Ted yelled. \u201cThey\u2019re invading our territory!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a turf war!\u201d Lucas said back, and they both laughed.</p><p>He started to walk away, but I beeped the horn, and he turned around. \u201cHey, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He took a couple of steps back toward me.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with everything,\u201d I said, then felt somewhat awkward, seeing that I hardly knew him. Still, for some reason I needed to say something. \u201cI mean, good luck to you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d</p><p>As I pulled out, he was dragging up a milk crate to join Mary and Ted\u2019s outdoor picnic as Ted tossed him a Twinkie. I glanced back one last time at the house, where I could see Monkey sitting in the doorway, panting. I wondered where Dexter was, then reminded myself that it wasn\u2019t my concern any longer. But if he\u2019d been home, he probably would have come out and said hello to me. Just because we were friends.</p><p>I started down the street, easing to a slow stop at the stop sign. In my rearview, I could see Ted, Mary, and Lucas still sitting there, talking, but now Dexter was with them, crouching down next to the makeshift table, unwrapping a Twinkie while Monkey circled them, tail wagging. They were all talking, and for a split second I felt a pang, as if I was missing out on something. Weird. Then, the car behind me beeped, impatient, and I jerked myself back to reality, shaking off this fog and moving forward again.</p><p>When I got home, the house was quiet. My mother was out of town, at a writers\u2019 conference she attended every August, where she taught workshops to aspiring romance novelists, soaking up buckets of admiration for three days and two nights in the Florida Keys. As for Chris, he was basically living and sleeping at Jennifer Anne\u2019s, where the bread wasn\u2019t all butts and he could eat his breakfast staring at prints of cheerful flower gardens instead of fifteen-pound neoclassic breasts. Normally I liked having the house to myself, but things were still awkward with me and Don, so I\u2019d taken Lissa up on her offer of sleeping at her house for the weekend, informing Don of my decision with a formal note I wedged under the growing pyramid of empty Ensure cans on the kitchen table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now I went into my mother\u2019s office, pushing the curtain aside. On the shelf next to her desk, there was a stack of papers: the new novel, or what there was of it so far. I pulled it into my lap and tucked my legs up underneath me, flipping the pages. When I\u2019d last left Melanie, she\u2019d been facing a cold marital bed with a distant husband, realizing her marriage had been a mistake. That had been about page 200, and by 250, she had left Paris and was back in New York, working in fashion design for a nasty woman with villain written all over her. Apparently, coincidence of coincidences, Brock Dobbin was also back in New York, having been injured during some kind of third world riot while working in his prizewinning career as a photojournalist. At the fall shows, they\u2019d caught each other\u2019s eye from across the runaway, and a romance was reborn.</p><p>I skipped to page 300, where things had obviously gone bad: Melanie was in a mental hospital, doped up on painkillers, while her former boss took credit for her entire fall line. Her estranged husband, Luc, was also back in the picture, involved in some kind of elaborate financial scheme. Brock Dobbin seemed to have disappeared entirely, but I found him on page 374, in a Mexican prison, where he was facing dubious charges of trafficking drugs and falling for the charms of a local beggar girl named Carmelita. This, I figured, had to be where my mother was losing her train of thought, but by 400 she seemed to have her steam back, and everyone was in Milan preparing for the fall shows. Luc was trying to reconcile with Melanie, but his intentions weren\u2019t good, while Brock was back on the job, chasing a story about the dirty underside of fashion with his trusty Nikon and a sense of justice that no injury, not even a rock to the head in Guatemala, could quell.</p><p>The last sheet in my lap was numbered 405, and in it Melanie and Brock were drinking espresso at a caf\u00e9 in Milan.</p><p>They only had eyes for one another, as if their time apart had made them hungry for each other in a way that could be conveyed solely by a glance, forbidden to be expressed in words. Melanie\u2019s hands were shaking, even as she wrapped them in her silk shawl, the fabric providing little comfort in the stiff breeze.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you love him?\u201d Brock asked her. His green eyes, so deep and probing, were watching her intently.</p><p>Melanie was shocked at his bluntness. But it seemed the time in prison had given him an urgency, a need for answers. He stared at her, waiting. \u201cHe is my husband,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201c That is not what I asked.\u201d Brock reached over and took her hand, folding it within his. His fingers were calloused and thick, rough against her pale skin. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>Melanie bit her lip, forcing down the sob she feared would escape if she was pressed to tell the truth about Luc and his cold, cold heart. Brock had left her all those months ago with no other choice. She\u2019d given him up for dead, their love as well. He had been like a ghost walking up to her as she sat at the caf\u00e9, crossing over from that world to her own.</p><p>\u201cI do not believe in love,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Brock squeezed her hand. \u201cHow can you say that, after what we had? What we still have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing,\u201d she said, and took her hand back. \u201cI am married. I will make my marriage work because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this man loves me,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201c This man,\u201d Brock said, his voice grave, \u201cloves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too late.\u201d Melanie stood. She had put Brock Dobbin from her mind again and again, telling herself that she could make a life with Luc. Luc, so suave and debonair, so steady and strong. Brock was always coming in and out of her life, making promises, the love they shared so passionate, and then just gone, leaving her behind in a cloud of memories and train smoke as he disappeared, heading across the world, chasing the story that would never be theirs. Maybe Luc wasn\u2019t ever going to love her the way Brock had, filling her body and mind with a joy that made the world fall away. But that joy never lasted, and she wanted to believe in a forever. Even one that sometimes left her wanting at night, dreaming of better things.</p> <p>\u201cMelanie,\u201d Brock called after her as she started down the cobblestone street, wrapping her scarf around her. \u201cCome back.\u201d</p><p>They were words she knew well. She had said them herself, at the station in Prague. Outside the Plaza, as he\u2019d climbed into a cab. On the deck of the yacht, as his boat sped away, riding the waves. He always did the leaving. But not this time. She kept walking, and did not look back.</p><p>Go Melanie, I thought, turning the last page over on the stack on my lap. But I had to admit, it was not typical of my mother\u2019s heroines to turn from a man of passion to a faulty man who provided a steady hand, if not a passionate one. Was my mother preaching settling? It was a discomforting thought. She\u2019d been so quick to tell me I was wrong about love. But it was too early to know: there were always more pages to go, more words to be written, before the story was over.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cPull over at this store up here,\u201d Paul called out to Trey, who was driving. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Trey nodded and put on the turn signal. In the front seat, Lissa turned around to look at me, raising her eyebrows as she nodded toward the backseat console, where there was not only the standard ashtray and cup holder but also a separate CD player and a video screen.</p><p>\u201cThis car is amazing,\u201d she whispered. I had to agree with her. Trey drove one of those huge SUVs, fully loaded. It reminded me of a spaceship, full of glowing buttons and levers, and I half expected that somewhere to the left of the steering wheel would be a small switch marked WARP SPEED.</p><p>We pulled up in front of the Quik Zip and Trey cut the engine. \u201cWho wants what?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a long ride ahead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe definitely need provisions,\u201d Paul told him, opening his door. A small, polite chiming noise sounded, bing bing bing. \u201cBeer and...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkittles,\u201d Lissa finished for him, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cOne pack of Skittles,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay. Remy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiet Coke,\u201d I told him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He hopped out of the car, shutting his door behind him. Trey jumped out as well, leaving the keys in and the radio on low. We were on our way to the drive-in one town over that played triple features on summer nights. It wasn\u2019t a double date, since Trey had a girlfriend at school, and we\u2019d originally invited Chloe and Jess as well. But Jess had to baby-sit, and Chloe, having already dumped her nerd boyfriend, was now pursuing some guy she\u2019d met at the mall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I had a car like this,\u201d Lissa said now, turning around completely in her seat, \u201cI would live in it. I could live in it. And still have room to rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is huge,\u201d I agreed, glancing behind me, where there were two more rows of seats before you even got close to the back door. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sick, actually. Who needs this much room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he buys a lot of groceries,\u201d Lissa suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a college student,\u201d I told her.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, shrugging, \u201call I know is I wish he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend. I\u2019ve decided I like cute rich boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like,\u201d I said absently as I watched Paul and Trey eye the guy behind the counter-it was well-known underground information which Zip clerks checked IDs closely and which didn\u2019t-and make their way to the rear of the store, picking up not one but two packs of Skittles for Lissa on the way. These boys did nothing in a small way, or so I was learning. Everything Paul had bought me in the two weeks we\u2019d been dating had been Supersized or Doubled, and he always reached for his wallet immediately, not even entertaining my efforts to go Dutch every once in a while. He was still Perfect Paul, the Ideal Boyfriend Exhibit A. And yet something in me continued to nag, as if I just wasn\u2019t enjoying this-the fruit of so many years of hard dating work-enough.</p><p>I heard a rattling noise and glanced over to my left, startled to see the Truth Squad van pull up right beside us. I started to lean back, out of sight, before remembering that the windows were tinted so black you couldn\u2019t see in. Ted was behind the wheel, a cigarette poking out of his mouth, and John Miller was in the passenger seat. As we watched, he leaned down and pulled on his door handle, and it swung open, but for some reason he forgot to let go and was taken with it, quickly dropping out of sight, the door left ajar.</p><p>Ted glanced over at the empty seat, sighed in an irritated way, and got out of the van, slamming his door behind him. \u201cIdiot,\u201d he said loud enough for us to hear as he rounded the front bumper, where we could still see him through the windshield. He was looking down at the pavement. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>We couldn\u2019t hear John Miller\u2019s reply. But by then I was distracted anyway, because I\u2019d spotted Dexter climbing clumsily into the front seat of the van, tripping over the gearshift before tumbling into the driver\u2019s seat and then out the door, dropping to the pavement a bit more gracefully than John Miller but not by much. He had on the same orange T-shirt as the day I\u2019d met him, with a white oxford cloth shirt over it. Sticking out of the front pocket was another one of those warped wedding cameras. He looked in Lissa\u2019s window, peering close, but couldn\u2019t see anything. She just stared back, as if on the hidden side of a two-way mirror.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Dexter?\u201d she whispered, keeping her voice low-Trey\u2019s window, on the driver\u2019s side, was open-as he pulled the camera out of his pocket and leaned in, taking a picture of her black window. The flash lit the whole inside of the truck for a second, and then he went to stick it back in his pocket, missing once, before fitting it back in.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said as we watched him stumble slightly as he rounded the front of the van, reaching out a hand to touch Trey\u2019s bumper for support. He was weaving, and not in the typical Dexter-clumsy way. He seemed drunk.</p><p>\u201cOkay, look you two,\u201d Ted announced as Dexter ambled up, \u201cI said I\u2019d get you here and I did. But I\u2019ve got a date with Mary and she\u2019s already pissed at me so this is the end of the line. I\u2019m not a taxi service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy good man,\u201d I heard John Miller say, in a faux Robin Hood voice, \u201cyou have done your duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to get up, or what?\u201d Ted asked.</p><p>John Miller got to his feet. He was still in his work clothes but looked entirely wrinkled, as if someone had balled him up in a pocket for a couple of hours. His shirt was hanging out, his pants totally creased, and he, too, had a disposable camera, sticking out of one of his pants pockets. He had a scratch on his cheek, too, which looked fresh, probably the result of the tumble from the van. He reached up and touched it, as if surprised to find it there, then let his hand drop.</p> <p>\u201cMy good man,\u201d Dexter said, flopping an arm around Ted, who immediately made a face, clearly fed up, \u201cwe owe you the greatest of favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy good man,\u201d John Miller echoed, \u201cwe will repay you with gold, and maidens, and our eternal allegiance to your cause. Huffah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuffah!\u201d Dexter repeated, raising his fist.</p><p>\u201cWill you two cut that shit out?\u201d Ted snapped, shaking off Dexter\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, comrade,\u201d John Miller told him. \u201cRaise a glass and huffah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuffah!\u201d Dexter said again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Ted started back to the van. \u201cI\u2019m gone. You guys can huffah all you want-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuffah!\u201d they yelled in unison. John Miller, throwing his arms into it, seemed close to tumbling over again.</p> <p>\u201c-but you get home on your own. And don\u2019t do anything stupid, okay? We don\u2019t have bail money right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuffah!\u201d John Miller said, saluting Ted\u2019s retreating back as he walked away. \u201cThank you, oh kind sir!\u201d</p><p>Ted flipped them the bird, obviously over it, then coaxed the van\u2019s engine to life and backed away, leaving them there in front of the Quik Zip, where they commenced taking pictures of each other posing by the newspaper racks. Inside, I watched as Paul and Trey chatted up the guy behind the counter as he slid their two six-packs into a paper bag.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now give me some pout,\u201d Dexter was saying to John Miller, who struck a model\u2019s pose, sticking out his chest and using a stack of coupon fliers as a prop, fanning them in front of his face and peeking over them, seductively. \u201cThere, that\u2019s good! Great!\u201d The flash popped, and Dexter wound the film, giggling. \u201cOkay, now do somber. That\u2019s right. You\u2019re serious. You\u2019re hurt...\u201d</p><p>John Miller looked out at the road, suddenly mournful, contemplating the Double Burger, which was across the street, with a wistful expression.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful!\u201d Dexter said, and they both busted out laughing. I could hear Lissa chuckling in front of me.</p><p>John Miller had struck his best pose yet, draping himself across the phone booth and fluttering his eyelashes, when Dexter popped one last flash and ran out of film. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said, shaking the camera, as if that would suddenly make more pictures appear. \u201cOh, well. So much for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They sat down on the curb. I kept thinking we should roll down the window, say something to let them know we were there, but already it seemed too late to do so without repercussions.</p><p>\u201cTruth be told, my good man,\u201d John Miller said solemnly, turning his own disposable camera in his hands, \u201cI am somber. And serious. And hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy good man,\u201d Dexter told him, leaning back on his palms and stretching his feet out in front of him, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman I love will not have me.\u201d John Miller squinted up at the sky. \u201cShe thinks I am not husband material, and, in her words, a bit immature. And today, in defiance of this proclamation, I quit my very easy job in which I made nine bucks an hour doing not very much at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are other jobs, my squire,\u201d Dexter said.</p><p>\u201cAnd, on top of that,\u201d John Miller continued, \u201cthe band will mostly likely be rejected by yet another record label because of the artistic integrity of Sir Ted, who will drive us all into retirement by stubbornly refusing to admit that his potato opuses are a bunch of crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Dexter said, nodding. \u201cIt is true. Young Ted may, indeed, shoot us all in the foot.\u201d</p><p>This was news to me, but not entirely surprising. Dexter had told me that Ted\u2019s vehement insistence that they do no covers for a demo, ever, had worked against them in previous towns, with previous chances.</p><p>\u201cBut you, fine sir.\u201d John Miller clapped Dexter on the shoulder, a bit unsteadily. \u201cYou have problems of your own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is true,\u201d Dexter replied, nodding.</p><p>\u201cThe women,\u201d John Miller sighed.</p><p>Dexter wiped a hand over his face, and glanced down the road. \u201cThe women. Indeed, dear squire, they perplex me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the fair Remy,\u201d John Miller said grandly, and I felt a flush run up my face. Lissa, in the front seat, put a hand to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe fair Remy,\u201d Dexter repeated, \u201cdid not see me as a worthwhile risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am, of course, a rogue. A rapscallion. A musician. I would bring her nothing but poverty, shame, and bruised shins from my flailing limbs. She is the better for our parting.\u201d</p><p>John Miller pantomimed stabbing himself in the heart. \u201cCold words, my squire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuffah,\u201d Dexter agreed.</p><p>\u201cHuffah,\u201d John Miller repeated. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Then they just sat there, saying nothing for a moment. In the back of the Excursion, I could feel my heart beating. Watching him, I knew there was nothing I could do now to take any of it back. And I felt ashamed for hiding.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of money you got?\u201d John Miller said suddenly, digging into his own pocket. \u201cI think we need more beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Dexter said, pulling out a wad of bills and some change, which he promptly dropped on the ground, \u201cthat you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Paul and Trey came out of the store then, and Paul yelled over at us, \u201cHey, Remy-was that diet you wanted or regular? I couldn\u2019t remember.\u201d He stuck his hand in the bag he was carrying and pulled out two bottles, one of each. \u201cI got you both, but...\u201d</p> <p>Lissa put her hand on the window button to lower it, then glanced back at me, not knowing what she should do. But I just froze, my eyes on Dexter. He looked at Paul, slowly comprehending the situation, and then over at the truck, at us.</p><p>\u201cDiet,\u201d he said out loud, looking right at me, as if suddenly he could see me.</p><p>Paul looked over at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Dexter cleared his throat. \u201cShe wants diet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not in a bottle, like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Paul said, smiling slightly, \u201cwhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy drinks Diet Coke,\u201d Dexter told him, standing up. \u201cBut from the fountain drink thing. Extra large, lots of ice. Isn\u2019t that right, Remy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Lissa said softly. \u201cShould we-\u201d</p><p>I opened up my door and was out, dropping to the ground-it was unbelievable how high up the Excursion was-before I even really knew what I was doing. I walked up to them. Paul was still smiling, confused, while Dexter just looked at me.</p><p>\u201cHuffah,\u201d he said, but this time John Miller didn\u2019t chime in.</p><p>\u201cThis is fine,\u201d I said to Paul, taking the drinks from him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Dexter was just staring at us and I could tell Paul was uneasy, wondering what was going on.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Dexter said suddenly, as if someone had asked him. \u201cNot awkward at all. But we\u2019d say if it was, right? Because that\u2019s the deal. The friends deal.\u201d</p><p>By now, Trey had started toward the truck, wisely knowing to keep out of this. John Miller walked into the Quik Zip. And then there were three.</p><p>Paul glanced at me and said, \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d Dexter told him, \u201cis just fine. Fine.\u201d</p><p>Paul was still watching me, waiting for verification. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just give me a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He squeezed my arm-as Dexter watched, a pointed look on his face-then walked over to the truck, climbing in and shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Dexter looked at me. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cyou could have let me know you were there.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, looking down at the Diet Coke. I lowered my voice, then said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, too quickly, then snapped his fingers, all happy-go-lucky. \u201cAbsolutely-freaking-fantastic!\u201d Then he looked at the truck again. \u201cMan,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThat thing has a freaking Spinnerbait sticker on it, for God\u2019s sake. Better hurry, Remy, old Tucker and Bubba the third are probably getting impatient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you acting like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so I knew why. This, in fact, was the standard post-breakup behavior, the way he should have been behaving all along. But since it was starting now, instead of then, I was thrown a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who said we should be friends,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOh, come on. You were just playing along with that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThis is all you,\u201d he said, pointing one somewhat wobbly finger at my chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in love, so it just follows logic you wouldn\u2019t believe in like, either. Or friendship. Or anything that might involve even the smallest personal risk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, and now I was starting to get a little pissed. \u201cI was honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well let\u2019s just give you a medal, then!\u201d he said, clapping his hands. \u201cYou break up with me because I might really like you, enough to look past just hooking up for the summer, and now I\u2019m the bad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cso you would have rather I lied and said I felt the same way, then dumped you a month later instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would have been just so inconvenient,\u201d he said sarcastically, \u201cmaking you miss Mr. Spinnerbait and that opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cIs that what this is about?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would make it simple, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cAnd Remy likes simple. You think you have everything figured out, that you can chart my reaction and what I\u2019m saying on some little graph you keep tucked away. But life isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I said. \u201cThen what is it like? You tell me. \u201d</p><p>He leaned in very close to me, lowering his voice. \u201cI meant what I said to you. I wasn\u2019t playing some kind of summer game. Everything I said was true, from the first day. Every goddamn word.\u201d</p><p>My mind flitted back then, over the challenges, the jokes, the half-sung songs. What meaningful truth was there in that? It had only been that first day that he\u2019d said anything big, and that was just-</p> <p>There was a whirring noise behind me, and next Lissa\u2019s voice, slight and tentative. \u201cUm, Remy?\u201d she asked, then cleared her throat, as if realizing how she sounded. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss the beginning of the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, over my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done anyway,\u201d Dexter explained, saluting the truck. To me he added, \u201cThat\u2019s what this has been all about for you, correct? Making it clear. That you and me-it was nothing more than what you\u2019ll have with Spinnerbait boy, or the guy after that, or the guy after that. Right?\u201d</p><p>For one split second, I wanted to tell him he was wrong. But there was something in the way he said this, a cocky angriness, that stopped me. He\u2019d said himself I was a bitch, and once I would have taken pride in that. So sure, okay. I\u2019d play.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He just stood there, looking at me, as if I had actually changed before his eyes. But this was the girl I\u2019d been all along. I\u2019d just hidden her well.</p> <p>I started to walk away, toward the truck. Paul opened the back door for me. \u201cIs he bothering you?\u201d he asked, his face serious. \u201cBecause if he is-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung knight!\u201d Dexter yelled at Paul, just as he was shutting the door. \u201cBe forewarned, when she does have the fountain drink, she has a vicious arm on her. She will peg you, my good man. When you least see it coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Paul said, and Trey nodded, starting to back up.</p><p>As we drove away I was determined not to look back. But in Lissa\u2019s side mirror, I could still see him standing there, shirttails flapping, arms spread, up in the air, as if waving us off on a grand trip while he stayed behind. Bon voyage, take care. Go in peace. Huffah.</p><p>The next day when I got back from spending the night at Lissa\u2019s, my mother was home. I dropped my keys on the side table, my purse on the stairs, and was just starting into the kitchen when I heard her.</p><p>\u201cDon?\u201d she called out, her voice bouncing down the hallway that led to the new wing. \u201cHoney? Is that you? I took an earlier flight, thought I could surprise-\u201d She rounded the corner, the sandals she was wearing clicking across the floor, then stopped when she saw it was me. \u201cOh, Remy. Hello. I thought you were Don.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I said. \u201cHow was Florida?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeavenly!\u201d She walked over and hugged me, pulling me close against her. She had a nice tan and a new haircut, shorter and streaked with a bit of blond, as if in Florida you are required by law to go tropical. \u201cJust wonderful. Invigorating. Rejuvenating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I told her as she released me, stepping back. \u201cAll that in only three days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed, walking ahead of me into the kitchen, \u201cit was just what I needed. Things have been so busy and stressful since the wedding, and then before the wedding with all the planning and organizing... it was just too much, you know?\u201d</p><p>I decided not to point out how little wedding planning she had actually done, figuring she was going somewhere with this. So instead I just leaned against the sink as she pulled an Ensure out of the fridge, popping the little tab top and taking a sip.</p><p>\u201cBut once I was there,\u201d she said, pressing a hand to her heart and closing her eyes, dramatically. \u201cSheer heaven. The surf. The sunsets. Oh, and my fans. I just felt like I was finally myself again. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed, although it had been a while since I\u2019d felt anything like myself. All night I\u2019d kept seeing Dexter in my mind, arms waving, calling after me.</p><p>\u201cSo I came home on an earlier flight, hoping to share this new feeling of contentment with Don, but-he\u2019s not here.\u201d She took another sip of her Ensure, glancing out the kitchen window. \u201cI guess I was just feeling hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been around at all,\u201d I told her. \u201cI think he worked, like, all weekend.\u201d</p><p>She nodded gravely, putting the Ensure down on the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a problem for us. His work. My work. All the details of each. I feel like we haven\u2019t even had a chance to really bond as husband and wife yet.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh, I thought again, as a warning bell sounded softly in my head. \u201cWell,\u201d I began, \u201cyou\u2019ve only been married a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while I was gone, I realized that we really have to focus on this marriage. The work can wait. Everything can wait. I think I\u2019ve been guilty too long of putting other things first, but not this time. I just know things are going to be better now.\u201d</p><p>Okay. So that sounded positive. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me, pleased. \u201cI really believe it, Remy. We may have had a bumpy adjustment, but this one\u2019s for good. I\u2019m finally realizing what it takes to really be a partner. And it just feels great.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was smiling so happily, with this new conversion. As if somewhere high over the Southeast seaboard, she\u2019d finally found the answer to the puzzle that had eluded her for so long. My mother always had ducked out of relationships when the going got tough, not wanting to dirty her hands with messy details. Maybe people could change.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness, I just can\u2019t wait to see him,\u201d she said to me now, walking to the table and picking up her purse. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just run down to the dealership and bring him lunch. He loves it when I do that. Honey, if he calls, don\u2019t let on, okay? I want it to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I told her, and she blew me a kiss as she sailed out the door and across the lawn to her car. I had to admire it, that absolute kind of love that couldn\u2019t even wait a couple of hours. I\u2019d never felt that strongly about anyone. It was nice, this rushing need to say something to someone right this very second. Almost romantic, really. If you liked that sort of thing.</p><p>The next morning I was in line at Jump Java, half asleep and waiting for Lola\u2019s morning mocha, when I saw the white Truth Squad van pull up outside, rattling to a stop in the fire lane. Ted hopped out and came into the store, pulling some wrinkled bills out of his pocket.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said when he saw me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I replied, pretending to be engrossed in a story on redistricting on the front page of the local newspaper.</p><p>The line for coffee was long, and full of cranky people who wanted their drinks made with such intricate specifics that it gave me a headache just listening to the orders. Scarlett was working the espresso machine, trying to keep up with a slew of nonfat, soy-milk double-tall requests with a sour look on her face.</p><p>Ted was a bit behind me in line, but then the guy between us, disgusted by the wait, walked out. Which left us next to each other, so we had no choice but to talk to each other.</p><p>\u201cSo Lucas told me you guys have a meeting with Rubber Records,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cYup. Tonight, in D.C. We\u2019re leaving in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I said as we slowly crept forward about an inch in the line.</p><p>\u201cYeah. They want us to play for them, you know, in the office. And then maybe at this showcase on Thursday, if they can get us a spot. Then, if they like us, it might get us something permanent up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt is if they like our stuff. But they\u2019re pushing for some stupid covers instead, which, you know, totally goes against our integrity as a band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, the other guys, they\u2019d do freaking anything for a contract, but, you know, to me it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about music, man. Art. Personal expression. Not a bunch of corporate, upper-management bullshit.\u201d</p><p>A businessman holding the Wall Street Journal glanced back at us, but Ted just looked at him, indignant, until he faced forward again.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re doing \u2018The Potato Opus\u2019?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI think we should. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been pushing all along. Like us for our original stuff, or not at all. But you know Lucas. He\u2019s never been behind the potato stuff at all. He\u2019s so freaking lowbrow, it\u2019s ridiculous: I mean, he was in a hair-metal band. What the hell does he know about real music?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to say to this.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s John Miller, who\u2019d play anything as long as he doesn\u2019t have to go back to school and push paper in his daddy\u2019s company some day. Which leaves us with Dexter, and you know how he is.\u201d</p><p>I was startled, slightly, at this. \u201cHow he is?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>Ted rolled his eyes. \u201cMr. Positive. Mr. Everything\u2019s-Gonna-Be-All-Right-I-Swear. If we left it up to him, we\u2019d just go up there with no game plan, no set of demands, and just see how it goes.\u201d He flipped his hand in a loose, silly way, punctuating this. \u201cGod! No plan, no worries whatsoever. Ever! I hate people like that. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p> <p>I took in a breath, wondering how to respond to this. It was the same thing I\u2019d always been so annoyed with about Dexter, as well, but coming from Ted it sounded so small-minded, and negative. He was so opinionated, so sure he knew everything. God. I mean, sure, maybe Dexter didn\u2019t think things through quite enough, but at least you could stand to-</p><p>\u201cNext!\u201d Scarlett yelled. I was at the front of the line. I stepped up and told her I wanted Lola\u2019s regular, then moved aside so Ted could get his extra-large, black coffee, no lid.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, as he paid, \u201cgood luck this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We walked out together, him to the van, me starting down to Joie, where I was ticking down my last days as receptionist ex traordinaire. It was August 20, and I was leaving for school in three weeks. If we\u2019d stayed together, I\u2019d always assumed it would be me leaving Dexter behind. But now, I saw, it might have been me staying here, watching him go. Funny all the ways things could work out. But this was better, totally. Of course it was.</p><p>With Dexter gone for a full week, I didn\u2019t have to worry about chance encounters or awkward moments. It made life so much easier, and inspired me to really get things done, as if him being in my same area code was enough to affect my sense of equilibrium.</p><p>First, I cleaned. Everything. I detailed my car, Armor All-ing every inch of it, and had my oil changed. I shampooed the interior, realphabetized my CDs, and, yes, cleaned the windows and windshield from the inside. This inspired me so much I tackled my room, stuffing four garbage bags with my closet discards for the thrift shop before hitting the clearance rack at the Gap, to stock up on new, college-me clothes. I was so industrious I shocked myself.</p><p>How had I gotten so disorganized? Once, keeping the vacuum cleaner lines even on my bedroom carpet was second nature. Now, struck with this sudden fervor, I found mud tracks in my closet, spilled mascara in my cosmetic drawer, one mismatched shoe-one!-stuffed far underneath my bed. It made me wonder if I\u2019d been in some sort of fugue state. Restoring order to my personal universe suddenly seemed imperative, as I refolded my T-shirts, stuffed the toes of my shoes with tissue paper, and arranged all the bills in my secret stash box facing the same way, instead of tossed in sloppy and wild, as if by my evil twin.</p><p>All week, I kept making lists and crossing things off them, ending each day with a sense of great accomplishment eclipsed only by complete and total exhaustion. This, I told myself, was exactly what I\u2019d wanted: a clean exit, smooth and effortless, every t crossed and i dotted. There were only a few more loose ends, a couple of items to deal with. But I already had a game plan set, the steps numbered and outlined clearly, and there was still plenty of time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Jess said darkly as we sat at Bendo. \u201cI know that look.\u201d</p><p>Chloe looked at her watch. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cit is about that time. You leave in three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Lissa cried, finally catching on. \u201cNot Paul. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, sliding my beer in a circle on the table. \u201cIt makes sense,\u201d I said. \u201cThe time I have left, I want to concentrate on being with my family. And you guys. There\u2019s no point in dragging it out so there has to be some big airport scene with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Chloe agreed. \u201cHe definitely hasn\u2019t been of airport status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like Paul,\u201d Lissa said to me. \u201cHe\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d I said. \u201cBut he\u2019s also temporary. As I am for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so, he joins the club,\u201d Chloe said, holding up her beer. \u201cTo Paul.\u201d</p><p>We drank, but even as I did so I flashed back to what Dexter had said to me in the parking lot of the Quik Zip, about how he\u2019d end up no different from the guy before, or the guy after. And he wasn\u2019t, really. Just a blip between Jerk Jonathan and Perfect Paul, one more summer boyfriend who was already fading from memory.</p> <p>Or was he? Dexter had been on my mind. I knew it was because things had, in fact, ended badly, regardless of our efforts. He was one thing that didn\u2019t get done as planned, and I couldn\u2019t check him off the way I wanted to.</p><p>Paul, on the other hand, had been inching that way for the last few days. But honestly, I hadn\u2019t really been in it from the get-go. It wasn\u2019t his fault. Maybe I was just tapped out and needed a break instead of starting something new. But so often I\u2019d felt like I was going through the motions, moving mechanically as we talked, or went to dinner, or hung out with his friends, or even made out in the darkness of his room or mine. Sometimes, when we weren\u2019t together, I had trouble even picturing him clearly. It seemed, in light of this, the right time to end things neatly and totally.</p><p>\u201cThe boyfriend club,\u201d Jess said now, leaning back in the booth. \u201cGod. How many guys has Remy dated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred,\u201d Lissa said instantly, then shrank back when I looked at her. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty,\u201d Chloe decided. \u201cNot less than.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at me. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are we talking about this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s topical. And now, as you are about to leave to spread your dating experience across not only this town but also the country -\u201d</p><p>Jess laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201c-it\u2019s only fair that we run through a greatest hits, if you will, of your past just as you embark on your present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cFirst!\u201d she said, ignoring me. \u201cRandall Baucom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Randall,\u201d Lissa sighed. \u201cI loved him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sixth grade,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cGod, how far back are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext,\u201d Jess said, \u201cseventh grade. Mitchell Loehmann, Thomas Gibbs, Elijah what\u2019s-his-bucket...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe one with the jug head,\u201d Lissa added. \u201cWhat was his last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never dated anybody with a jug head,\u201d I said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cThen we had the six months of Roger,\u201d Chloe said, shaking her head. \u201cNot a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was an asshole,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cRemember when he cheated on you with Jennifer Task and the whole school knew but you?\u201d Lissa asked me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said darkly.</p><p>\u201cMoving on,\u201d Chloe sang out, \u201cwe get to ninth grade, and the triple whammy of Kel, Daniel, and Evan, as Remy methodically works her way through the offensive line of the soccer team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, wait just a second,\u201d I said, knowing I was getting defensive, but God, I had to stick up for myself sometime. \u201cYou\u2019re making me sound like a total slut.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then they all burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cNot funny,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know you have,\u201d Lissa said earnestly, patting my hand in her sweet way. \u201cWe\u2019re just talking about the old days here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about you guys, then?\u201d I said. \u201cHow about Chloe and the fifty-odd people she\u2019s dated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cheerfully claim every one of them,\u201d she said, smiling at me. \u201cGod, Remy. What\u2019s up with you? Lost your touch? Not proud of your conquests anymore?\u201d</p><p>I just looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said.</p><p>The count continued, while I tried not to squirm. There were guys I didn\u2019t remember-Anton, who\u2019d worked selling vitamins at the mall-and guys I wished I didn\u2019t, like Peter Scranton, who\u2019d turned out to be not only a total jerk but also involved with a girl from a school in Fayetteville who\u2019d made the two-hour trip to town specifically to kick my ass. That had been a fun weekend. And still the names kept coming.</p><p>\u201cBrian Tisch,\u201d Lissa said, folding down a finger. \u201cHe drove that blue Porsche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward from Atlantic Beach,\u201d Jess added. \u201cThe two-week required summer fling.\u201d</p><p>Chloe took a deep breath, then said dramatically, one hand fluttering over her chest, \u201cDante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man!\u201d Jess said, snapping her fingers. \u201cThe exchange student. Remy goes international!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich leads us,\u201d Chloe said finally, \u201cto Jonathan. And then Dexter. And now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d Lissa said sadly, into her beer. \u201cPerfect Paul.\u201d</p><p>Who was now, as I watched, walking in the door of Bendo, pausing to get his ID checked. Then he saw me. And smiled. He started across the room, the same way Jonathan had, unaware of what was about to happen. I took a deep breath, telling myself that by now this should be second nature, like falling into the water and instantly knowing to swim. But instead I just sat there as he approached.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, sliding in beside me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand, wrapping his fingers around mine, and suddenly I felt so tired. Another breakup. Another end. I hadn\u2019t even taken the time to figure out how, exactly, he\u2019d react, the kind of prep work that had always come naturally before.</p><p>\u201cYou need a beer?\u201d he asked me. \u201cRemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, and the words came on their own, no thought required. It was just process, cold and indifferent, like plugging numbers into an equation, and I could have been someone else, listening and watching this, for all I felt. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cAnd for when she told that awful Mrs. Tucker to sit down and wait her turn...\u201d Talinga said, her glass wobbling.</p><p>\u201cAnd for the time she untangled the judge\u2019s wife from the overhead dryer...\u201d Amanda chimed in.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Lola said, louder than either of them, \u201cfor all the days she just wouldn\u2019t put up with our mess...\u201d</p> <p>A pause. Talinga sniffled, then wiped her eye with one very long, bright red, perfectly shaped nail.</p><p>\u201c... To Remy,\u201d Lola finished, and we let our glasses knock together, champagne sloshing onto the floor. \u201cGirl, we\u2019re gonna miss you.\u201d</p><p>We drank. It was all we\u2019d been doing, toasting and drinking, since Lola had officially closed down the salon for appointments at four o\u2019clock, two hours early, so we could celebrate my leaving in high style. It had hardly been a workday up until then, anyway. Talinga brought me a corsage, which she insisted I wear, so I\u2019d spent the day answering the phone and looking as if I was waiting for my prom date to pull up in his father\u2019s car. But it was a sweet gesture, as was the cake, the champagne, and the envelope that they\u2019d given me, which held five hundred bucks, all mine.</p><p>\u201cFor incidentals,\u201d Lola had said as she pressed it into my hand. \u201cImportant stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike manicures,\u201d Amanda added. \u201cAnd eyebrow waxing.\u201d</p> <p>It was almost enough to choke me up, but I knew that would only set them all off. Joie girls loved a good cry. But even more so, it reminded me that this was all really happening. Stanford. The end of the summer. The beginning of my real life. It was no longer just creeping up, peeking over the horizon, but instead lingering in plain sight.</p><p>The signs were everywhere. I was getting tons of stuff in the mail from school, forms and last-minute To Do lists, and my room was now lined with boxes, clearly labeled for what was going and what would stay behind. I did not entertain any notions about my mother keeping my room as some sort of a shrine to The Remy That Had Been. The minute my plane took off she\u2019d be in there poking around, trying to figure out if the new bookshelves she\u2019d been wanting to build a proper library around would fit within my walls. When I came home everything would be different. Especially me.</p><p>Everyone was getting ready to go. Lissa was the weepiest, even though her trip was only one across town, with the steeple of the church on her block visible from her dorm room window. Jess had a job lined up at the hospital, doing administrative stuff in the kids\u2019 ward, and started night classes right after Labor Day. And Chloe was busy with her own boxes, buying new stuff to take on her trip to a school just far enough away to provide new boys who didn\u2019t already know about her reputation as a pure-T heartbreaker. Our in-between time, which had once seemed to stretch into forever, was ending.</p><p>The night before, I\u2019d dug out my CD Walkman from the back of my closet, then sat down on my bed with it, carefully removing my father\u2019s CD from it and sliding it back into the case. The Walkman I was taking, but when I went to put the CD in the box with the others, something stopped me. Just because my father had left me a legacy of the expectation that men would let me down didn\u2019t mean I had to accept it. Or carry a reminder of it across the country. So instead I put it in a drawer in my now empty desk. I hadn\u2019t taped up the box yet, however, so there was still time to change my mind.</p><p>\u201cOkay, ladies,\u201d Lola said now, picking up the bottle of champagne, \u201cwho wants a refill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Talinga said, handing over her glass. \u201cAnd let\u2019s have more cake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need more cake,\u201d Amanda told her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need more champagne, either,\u201d Talinga replied. \u201cBut damned if that\u2019s going to stop me.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed, and then the phone rang and Lola scurried off, still holding the bottle, to answer it. I picked a rose off the top of the cake and popped it into my mouth, feeling the sugar melt on my tongue. I was supposed to be saving my appetite for the dinner my mother was having tonight, one of the final family celebrations before I left. The mood she\u2019d picked up in Florida still seemed to be lingering, making her work extra hard at playing Don\u2019s Wife. Her novel had clearly come to a lurching halt, and I wondered where Melanie was now. It wasn\u2019t like my mother to walk away from a story, especially so close to the end. But each time I felt that anxious pull, I reminded myself that she would be okay. That she had to be.</p><p>I walked to the front window, sipping my champagne, and looked out at the parking lot. Across the way I could see the door to Flash Camera was open, and I was feeling the champagne as I leaned into the glass, pressing my forehead against it. Truth Squad had come back a couple of days earlier. I\u2019d seen Lucas from a distance, eating a bag of potato chips in front of Mayor\u2019s Market, but knew better than to go up and ask him how things had gone in D.C. Ever since the day I\u2019d driven away from the yellow house, with them all out in the yard behind me, I\u2019d felt more clearly than ever that their fate was in no way entwined with mine.</p><p>Still, I did keep thinking of Dexter. He was the one loose end that still remained, and I hated loose ends. Making things right wasn\u2019t an emotional thing. It was more that I didn\u2019t want to go across the country feeling like I had left the iron on or forgotten to turn off the coffeemaker. It was about my mental health, I told myself. As in, necessary.</p><p>Just as I thought this, I saw him move across the open doorway of Flash Camera, recognizing him immediately from his gangly, crooked walk. Well, I thought. Perfect timing. I downed the rest of my champagne then checked my lipstick. It would be a good feeling to deal with this one last thing and still be home on time for dinner.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d Talinga called after me as I opened the front door. She and Amanda had now turned on the stereo we kept in the shampoo room and were dancing around the empty salon, both of them barefooted, while Lola helped herself to more cake. \u201cYou need more champagne, Remy! This is a party, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a sec,\u201d I said. \u201cPour me another glass, okay?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, then poured herself one instead, while Amanda cackled, swaying her hips wide and bumping into a display of nail polishes. They all burst out laughing, the door falling shut on the sound when I walked out into the heat.</p><p>My head was buzzing as I crossed the parking lot to Flash Camera. When I came in, I saw Lucas behind the counter, working the developing machine. He glanced up at me and said, \u201cHey. When\u2019s the prom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I started at this, then realized he was talking about my corsage, which was now hanging kind of limply, as if it, too, had consumed a bit too much champagne. \u201cIs Dexter around?\u201d</p><p>Lucas pushed back his chair, which was on casters, and rolled a bit, sticking his head through a door in the back. \u201cDex!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dexter yelled back.</p><p>\u201cCustomer!\u201d</p> <p>Dexter came out, wiping his hands on his shirt, with an easygoing, can-I-help-you kind of smile. When he saw me it shifted, but just a bit. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen\u2019s the homecoming dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeak,\u201d Lucas mumbled, pushing himself back to the machine. \u201cAnd late.\u201d</p><p>Dexter ignored this, coming up to the counter. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, picking up a stack of snapshots and shuffling them, \u201cwhat can we do for you? Need some pictures developed? Perhaps an enlargement? We\u2019re running a special on four-by-sixes today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, talking over the sound of the machine Lucas was working, as it made chunk-chunk noises, spitting out someone\u2019s precious memories. \u201cI just wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He kept messing with the pictures, not really looking at me. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow was D.C.?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cTed threw a fit, the whole artistic integrity thing. Stormed out. We managed to sweet-talk them into another meeting, but for now we\u2019re stuck doing another wedding tonight while we\u2019re left hanging. In the lurch. Happening a lot lately, it seems.\u201d</p><p>I just stood there for a second, gathering my words. He was being kind of a jerk, I decided, but pressed on anyway. \u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving soon, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Now he looked at me. \u201cNext week, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd I just wanted to, you know, make peace with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace?\u201d He put the pictures down. The one on top, I saw, was of a group of women posing around a quilt, all of them smiling. \u201cAre we at war?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t exactly part well the other night. At the Quik Zip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kind of drunk,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd, uh... maybe I wasn\u2019t dealing with your Spinnerbait relationship quite as well as I might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Spinnerbait relationship,\u201d I said slowly, \u201chas now been terminated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry about that. They are, like the biggest suckjob band, and their fans-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said. \u201cI know. Hate Spinnerbait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate Spinnerbait!\u201d Lucas mumbled.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Dexter leaned across the counter at me, \u201cI liked you, Remy. And maybe we couldn\u2019t be friends. But, God, you sure didn\u2019t waste any time, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never wanted it to be ugly,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd I did want us to be friends. But it just never works. Never.\u201d</p> <p>He considered this. \u201cOkay. I think you\u2019re right. Maybe we\u2019re both a bit at fault here. I wasn\u2019t exactly honest when I said I could deal with us being friends. And you weren\u2019t exactly honest when you said, you know, that you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, a bit too loudly. It was the champagne. \u201cI never said I loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not in so many words,\u201d he said, shuffling the pictures again. \u201cBut I think we both knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said, but I could feel it now, that loose end slowly winding up, closer and closer to tied tight.</p><p>\u201cIn five more days,\u201d he decided, holding up his open hand, \u201cyou would have loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is a challenge. Five days, and then-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDexter,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d He put the pictures down, and smiled at me. \u201cBut we\u2019ll never know, right? Could have happened.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>And there we had it. Closure. The last item of so many, eliminated from my list with a big, thick check mark. I could almost feel the weight of it lifting, the slow, steady feeling as all my planets aligned and everything, at least for now, was right with the world.</p><p>\u201cRemy!\u201d I heard someone yell from outside, and then turned around to see Amanda standing in the doorway to Joie, wearing a dye cap on her head and snapping her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the dance party!\u201d Behind her, Talinga and Lola were laughing.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Dexter said as Amanda continued her bump-and-grind, unaware of the elderly couple passing, carrying a bag of birdseed and eyeing her disapprovingly. \u201cLooks like we work at the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should get back,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but before you go, you should check these out.\u201d He pulled out a drawer, then took out a stack of glossy prints, spreading them on the counter in front of me. \u201cThe last and best shots for our wall of shame. Just look.\u201d</p><p>They were pretty bad. One was of a middle-aged guy posing bodybuilder style, flexing his muscles while his potbelly pooched over a very small Speedo bathing suit. Another featured two people standing on the bow of a ship: the man was grinning, loving it, while the woman was literally green, and you just knew the next picture featured vomit. Depravity and embarrassment was pretty much the theme of the collection, each one sillier or more disgusting than the last. I was so caught up reacting to a shot of what looked like a cat trying to mate with an iguana that I almost skimmed past a picture of a woman in her bra and panties, posing seductively, entirely.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dexter,\u201d I said. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou do what you gotta do. Right?\u201d</p><p>I was about to answer this when I suddenly realized something. I knew this woman. She was dark-haired, lower lip pouting seductively, sitting on the end of a bed with her hands on her hips so that her cleavage was enhanced, considerably. But even more importantly, I knew what was behind her: a large, ugly tapestry, depicting biblical scenes. Right over her head, to the left, was John the Baptist\u2019s head being served on a plate.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I said. It was my mother\u2019s room. And this woman on the bed was Patty, Don\u2019s secretary. I looked at the date stamp at the bottom of the picture: Aug 14. The previous weekend. When I\u2019d been staying at Lissa\u2019s and my mother was in Florida, deciding that everything was now going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cReally something, huh?\u201d Dexter asked me, peeking over the top of the picture. \u201cI knew you\u2019d like that one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked up at him, everything now falling into place. Closure. Yeah, right. This was Dexter\u2019s little revenge scheme, his way of poking me back when I wasn\u2019t even protecting myself. Suddenly I was so mad I could feel the blood rising in my face, hot and flushed. \u201cYou asshole, \u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is some little game?\u201d I snapped, throwing the picture at him. It hit him in the chest, the corner poking, and he stepped back, letting it fall to the floor. \u201cYou want to get back at me and you do this? God, I was trying to leave things right, Dexter. I was trying to be beyond this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d he said, holding up his hands. Behind him Lucas had pushed his chair back and was just staring at me. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah, right,\u201d I said. \u201cAll this talk about faith, and love. And then you do something like this, just to hurt me. And not even me! My family-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy.\u201d He tried to reach out and grab my hand, to calm me, but I pulled back, my wrist smacking wildly against the register, as if it wasn\u2019t even under my control. \u201cCome on. Just tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d I screamed, and my voice sounded so shrill.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d he yelled back, then ducked down, picking the picture up off the floor. He stared at it. \u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>But I was already walking across the store, toward the door. I just kept seeing my mother in my mind, floating toward me on a wave of perfume and hopefulness, trying so hard to make this, of all marriages, work. She\u2019d been ready to settle, to give it all up, even her own voice, just to stay with this man who would not only commit adultery but save the evidence on film. Bastard. I hated him. I hated Dexter. I had come so close to wanting to be wrong about the possibilities of what the heart could really do. Give me proof, I\u2019d said, and she had tried. It\u2019s not tangible, she\u2019d said, you can\u2019t mark it so clearly. But against love, the case was solid. Easily argued. And you could, indeed, hold it in your hand.</p> <p>Finding out about Don pretty much ended my party. Which was fine, actually, since Amanda had already fallen asleep on the table in the waxing room and Lola and Talinga were finishing off the cake and bemoaning whose love life was more pathetic. We said our final good-byes, and then I left, carrying the envelope they\u2019d given me, a freebie case of my favorite conditioner, and the burden of knowing that my mother\u2019s latest husband was the worst of the lot. Which was saying quite a bit, considering.</p><p>My head was clear as I drove home, blasting my air conditioner and trying to calm down. The shock of seeing Patty on my mother\u2019s bed, in my mother\u2019s room, had sobered me up quick, the way only bad news can. I was so mad at Dexter for showing me the picture, and as I drove I wondered why I\u2019d never seen this duplicitous, petty, evil side of him. He\u2019d hid it well. And it was low-down, bringing my family into it. Hurt me, fine. I could handle it. But my mother was different.</p><p>I pulled into the driveway and cut the engine, then just sat there as the A/C whined to a stop. I was dreading what I had to do. I knew that someone else might not have said anything, just letting the marriage, sham that it was, take its course. But I couldn\u2019t allow that. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave knowing that my mother was stuck here, living with that kind of deception. As a firm believer in the rip-it-off-like-a-Band-Aid school of bad news, I had to tell her.</p><p>As I walked up the driveway to the front porch, however, something was off. I couldn\u2019t say exactly what: it was more of a hunch, unexplainable. Even before I came upon the Ensure cans, which were scattered across the front walk, some in the grass, some rolled under the bushes, one just sitting upright on the steps, as if waiting to be retrieved, I had a feeling I was too late.</p><p>I pushed open the front door, then felt it hit against something: another can. They were everywhere, scattered across the foyer as I crossed it, going into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I said, and listened to my voice bounce off the countertops and cabinets, back at me. No response. On the table, I could see the food stacked for our big family dinner: steaks, corn on the cob, most of it still in the plastic bags from the supermarket. Next to them, a stack of mail, with one envelope, addressed to my mother in clean block writing, ripped open.</p> <p>I moved across the room, stepping over another Ensure, to the doorway of her study. The curtain was hanging down, the old busy-don\u2019t-bother-me sign, but this time I pushed it aside and walked right through.</p><p>She was sitting in her chair, in front of the typewriter. Sticking out of it was a copy of the picture I\u2019d thrown at Dexter. It was positioned the same way a sheet of paper would have been right before she rolled it in.</p><p>My mother, strangely, seemed very calm. Whatever fury had caused the explosion and scattering of Ensure cans had obviously passed, leaving her sitting there with a stoic expression as she considered Patty\u2019s face, so pouty and posed, staring back at her.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I said again, and then I reached out my hand and put it over hers, carefully. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, and nodded. I could tell she\u2019d been crying. Her mascara was smeared, black smudgy arcs underneath both her eyes. This, I thought, was the most disturbing thing of all. Even in the worst of circumstances, my mother always looked put together.</p><p>\u201cThey took it in my own room,\u201d she said. \u201cThis picture. On my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. She turned her head, looking at me quizzically, and I backtracked, knowing it was best to keep the fact that yet another copy existed to myself. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the quilt, right? Behind her.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze back to the snapshot, and for a second we both just looked at it, the only sound that of the refrigerator ice machine cheerfully spitting out a new batch of cubes in the next room. \u201cI missed him,\u201d she said finally.</p> <p>I put my hand over hers and sat down, pulling my chair closer. \u201cI know,\u201d I said softly. \u201cYou came back from Florida feeling really good, and then you find out he\u2019s such a rat bastard that he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said distractedly, interrupting me. \u201cI missed him. All those Ensures, and not a one made contact. I have terrible aim.\u201d And then she sighed. \u201cEven just one would have made it better. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for this to sink in. \u201cYou threw all those cans?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cI was very upset,\u201d she explained. Then she sniffled, wiping her nose with a Kleenex she was gripping in her other hand. \u201cOh, Remy. My heart is just breaking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whatever humor I might have been able to see in her pelting Don with empty Ensures-and it was funny, no question-left me as she said this.</p><p>She sniffled again, and clenched her fingers around mine, holding on tight. \u201cWhat now?\u201d she said, waving her Kleenex in a helpless way, the white blurring past my vision. \u201cWhere am I supposed to go from here?\u201d</p><p>My ulcer, long dormant, rumbled in my stomach, as if answering this call. Here I was, so close to my getaway, and now my mother was adrift again, needing me most. I felt another flash of hate for Don, so selfish, leaving me with a mess to deal with while he slipped away scot-free. I wished I had been here when it all came down, because I did have a good arm. I wouldn\u2019t have missed. Not a chance.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said to her, \u201cfirst, you should probably call that lawyer. Mr. Jacobs. Or Johnson. Did he take anything with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust one bag,\u201d she said, wiping at her eyes again.</p><p>I could already feel it happening, the neat click as I shifted into crisis management mode. It wasn\u2019t like it had been that long since Martin left. The path might have grown over a bit, but it was still there. \u201cOkay,\u201d I continued, \u201cso we\u2019ll need to tell him he has to set up a specific time to come back and get everything. He can\u2019t just come whenever he feels like it, and one of us should be here. And we should probably get in touch with the bank, just to be safe, and put a freeze on your joint account. Not that he doesn\u2019t have money of his own, but people do weird stuff in the first few days, right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer me, instead just staring out the window at the backyard, where the trees were swaying, just slightly.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll find that lawyer\u2019s number,\u201d I said, standing up. \u201cHe\u2019s probably not in, with it being a Saturday and all, but at least we could leave a message, so he\u2019d get back to you first thing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy.\u201d</p> <p>I stopped, midbreath, and realized she\u2019d turned her head to look at me. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset, but it\u2019s important that we-\u201d</p><p>She reached over for my hand, pulling me back into my chair. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, and then stopped. A breath, and then she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s time I handle this myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. Weird, but my first thought was that I was somewhat offended. \u201cI just thought-\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me, very weakly, and then patted my hand. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve dealt with enough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>I just sat there. This was it, what I\u2019d always wanted. The official out, the moment I was finally set free. But it didn\u2019t feel the way I\u2019d thought it would. Instead of a wash of victory, I felt strangely alone, as if everything fell away suddenly, leaving me with only the sound of my own heart beating. It scared me.</p><p>It was almost as if she sensed this, saw it on my face. \u201cRemy,\u201d she said softly, \u201cit\u2019s all going to be all right. It\u2019s time you worry about yourself, for a change. I can take it from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt feels right,\u201d she replied simply. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel it? It just feels... okay.\u201d</p><p>Did I feel it? Everything seemed so tangled, all at once. But then in my mind, I saw something. The country, spread out so wide, with my mother and me separated not only by our difference of opinions, but also by miles and miles of space, too far to cross with just a look or a touch. My mother was down, but not out. And she might have denied me some of my childhood, or the childhood I\u2019d thought I deserved, but it wasn\u2019t too late for her to give something in return. An even trade, years for years. Those passed for those to come.</p><p>But for now, I scooted closer, until we were touching. Knee to knee, arm to arm, forehead to forehead. I leaned into her for once, instead of away, appreciating the pull I felt there, something almost magnetic that held us to each other. I knew it would always be there, no matter how much of the world I put between us. That strong sense of what we shared, good and bad, that led us to here, where my own story began.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>In the hour before Chris and Jennifer Anne were due to show up for dinner, I gathered all the Ensure cans from the front yard and various spots in the house, depositing them with a satisfying clank in the recycling bin. My mother was taking a shower, having insisted we go ahead with our family dinner, despite what had happened. While I was doing my best to adjust to my new hands-off role in this separation, some habits died hard. Or so I told myself as I took down the big naked woman off the kitchen wall, sliding it behind the refrigerator.</p> <p>After our talk, my mother had filled me in on the gruesome details. Apparently the Patty thing had been going on for a while, since even before my mother and Don met. Patty had been married, and the affair had been a series of breakups and makeups, ultimatums and backsliding, finally ending with Don saying if she wasn\u2019t serious enough to leave her husband, he was moving on. Don\u2019s marrying my mother, however, was a catalyst for her subsequent separation, and while they\u2019d tried to stay apart they couldn\u2019t, in Don\u2019s words, \u201cfight the feeling.\u201d My mother winced as she repeated this phrase: I was sure I winced hearing it. It was Patty who\u2019d sent the picture, fed up with waiting. Don, according to my mother, hadn\u2019t even denied it, instead sighing and walking into the bedroom to pack a bag. This, I felt, said a lot. What kind of car salesman doesn\u2019t at least try to talk his way out of things?</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t,\u201d my mother said when I asked her this. \u201cHe loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an asshole,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt was unfortunate,\u201d she agreed. She was taking it so well, but I wondered if she was just still in shock. \u201cEverything, in the end, comes down to timing.\u201d</p><p>I considered this as I piled the steaks onto a plate, then went out to the fancy new grill, opening it up. After struggling for about fifteen minutes with the high-tech, supposed-to-be-moron-proof ignition system, I decided I liked having my eyebrows intact and instead dug out our old Weber grill from behind a stack of lawn chairs. A few handfuls of charcoal, some fluid, and I was in business.</p><p>As I poked at the coals, I kept thinking about Dexter. If once he had been a loose end, now it was a full hanging string, capable of pulling everything apart with one good tug. Chalk it up to another bad boyfriend story, one more added to the canon. It was where I\u2019d intended him to be, all along. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was in the kitchen, arranging some chips and salsa on a plate, when Chris and Jennifer Anne pulled up. They came across the lawn, carrying her trademark Tupperware, and they were holding hands. I could only imagine how Jennifer Anne, who\u2019d found my cynicism about this marriage to be completely abhorrent, would react to this latest family news. Chris, I figured, would instantly move into protective mode for my mother\u2019s sake while privately feeling grateful to have his bread back, butts and all.</p><p>They came in the front door, chatting and laughing. They sounded positively giddy, in fact. As they got closer to the kitchen. I looked up, noticing they were both flushed, and Jennifer Anne was as relaxed as I\u2019d ever seen her, as if she\u2019d had a double dose of self-esteem affirmations that day. Chris looked pretty happy too, at least until he saw the empty space on the wall over the breakfast table.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d he said, his face falling. Next to him, Jennifer Anne was still grinning. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cActually-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged!\u201d Jennifer Anne shrieked, thrusting her left hand out in front of her.</p><p>\u201c-Don\u2019s got a mistress, and he\u2019s left to be with her,\u201d I finished.</p><p>For a minute, there was total silence as Jennifer Anne caught up with what I\u2019d said, and I backtracked, clumsily, finally hearing her news. Then, at the same time, we both blurted out, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Chris groaned, stumbling back against the fridge with a thud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re engaged?\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just-\u201d Jennifer Anne said, putting a hand to her face. Now I could see a ring on her finger: a good-size diamond, so sparkly as it caught the light shining from over the sink.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d I heard my mother say, and turning around I saw she\u2019d come in behind me, and was now standing there, her eyes a bit watery, but smiling. \u201cOh, my. It\u2019s just wonderful. \u201d</p><p>It says something about my mother, and her utter and total belief in the love stories she not only wrote but lived, that she was able to say this then, not two hours after her fifth marriage had dissolved in a puddle of deceit, bad clich\u00e9s, and discarded Ensure cans. As I watched her move across the room, pulling Jennifer Anne into her arms, I felt an appreciation for her I would not have been capable of three months earlier. My mother was strong, in all the ways I was weak. She fell, she hurt, she felt. She lived. And for all the tumble of her experiences, she still had hope. Maybe this next time would do the trick. Or maybe not. But unless you stepped into the game, you would never know.</p><p>We ate at the table in the backyard, off paper plates. My mother\u2019s contribution: Brazilian beefsteaks, imported artichoke salad, and fresh Italian bread, baked just that day. Jennifer Anne\u2019s: macaroni and cheese, salad with iceberg lettuce and Thousand Island dressing, and a Jell-O mold with whipped cream. Worlds may have been colliding, but as the conversation began to roll around to wedding plans and preparations, it was clear there was a common ground.</p><p>\u201cI just have no idea where to start,\u201d Jennifer Anne said. She and Chris held hands all through dinner, which was somewhat disgusting but a bit tolerable, considering the newness of their engaged status. \u201cReception halls, cakes, invitations... the whole thing. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d I told her, spearing a bit of lettuce with my fork. \u201cJust get a folder, a notebook, and get second estimates on everything. And don\u2019t use the Inverness Inn because they overcharge and never have toilet paper in the bathrooms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, weddings are always fun!\u201d my mother chirped, sipping on her glass of wine. And for a second I caught her as a wave of sadness crossed over her face. But she shook it off, smiling at Chris instead. \u201cAnything you two need, help, money... let me know. Promise you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Chris said.</p><p>I gathered up the plates as they kept talking, discussing possible dates, places, all the things that I\u2019d been starting to think about this time last year, when my mother was the bride-to-be. There was something incongruous about one marriage ending the same day another began, as if there was an exchange program in the universe or something, a trade required in order to keep the numbers even.</p><p>As I pulled open the screen door, I turned around, looking again at the backyard, where the dark was now coming on. I could hear their voices rising and falling, and for a second I closed my eyes, just listening. Times like this it did seem real I was leaving, and even more that my family, and this life, would go on without me. And again I felt that emptiness rise up, but pushed it away. Still, I lingered there, in the doorway, memorizing the noise. The moment. Tucking it away out of sight, to be remembered when I needed it most.</p><p>After dinner and dessert, Jennifer Anne and Chris packed up the Tupperware and went home, armed with all the crap I\u2019d kept from planning my mother\u2019s wedding to Don-brochures, price lists, and phone numbers of everything from limo services to the best makeup guy in town. In my typical cynical fashion, I\u2019d had no doubt we would need it again, and I was right. Just not in the way I\u2019d thought.</p><p>My mother kissed me and headed off to bed, a bit teary but okay. I went up to my room and double-checked some of my boxes, reorganizing a few more items and packing up a few last things. Then I sat on my bed, restless, listening to the whir of the air-conditioning until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>When I pulled up to the Quik Zip, heeding the call of that Extra Large Zip Diet, I was surprised to see Lissa\u2019s car parked in front of the pay phones. I snuck up behind her in the candy section as she stood debating whether to get Skittles or Spree. She had one in each hand, and when I poked her in the small of her back, she jumped, shrieking, sending both flying.</p><p>\u201cRemy!\u201d She swatted at my hand, the color rising in her face. \u201cGod, you scared me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I told her. \u201cCouldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>She bent down, collecting the candy. \u201cNot funny,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cWhat are you doing out, anyway? I thought you were having a big family night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d I said, heading over to the Zip Fountain station. It was weird how even the smallest things were making me nostalgic now, and I had a moment of quiet respect as I picked a cup off the stack, then filled it with ice. \u201cI mean, I did. Bigger family night than you would even believe. You having a Zip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, and I handed her a cup. We didn\u2019t talk for a second as I filled mine, stopping at the right intervals to allow the fizz to die down. Plus, sometimes you got a new shot of syrup when you pushed in the Diet Coke button, which made them extra wonderful. Then I got a lid and a straw, as Lissa did the same with the 7UP. As I sipped mine, testing it for full flavor, I noticed that she looked very nice; she appeared to be wearing a new skirt, and had painted her toenails. Plus she smelled good, a light floral scent, and I was almost positive she had curled her eyelashes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cConfess. What are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>She smiled slyly, dropping the candy by the register. As the guy ran it up, she said, offhandedly, \u201cGot a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissa,\u201d I said. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree seventy-eight,\u201d the guy said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get hers too,\u201d Lissa told him, nodding at my Diet Zip.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She handed the guy a couple of folded bills. \u201cWell, you know that P.J. and I have been kind of circling lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said as she took her change and we headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd the summer is close to over. And today, when we were at this craft festival KaBooming, I just decided the hell with it. I was tired of waiting around, wondering if he was ever going to make a move. So I asked him out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLissa. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>She stuck her straw in her mouth and took a dainty sip, shrugging. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought, actually. It was even... kind of nice. Empowering. I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out, P.J.,\u201d I said as we came up to her car, both of us climbing up to sit on the hood. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d she replied, and we pressed our cups together.</p><p>For a minute we just sat there, watching the traffic pass on the road in front of us. Another Saturday night at the Quik Zip, one of so many in the years we\u2019d been friends.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said finally, prompted by this, \u201cmy mom and Don are over.\u201d</p> <p>She jerked her straw out of her mouth, turning to look at me. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! What happened?\u201d</p><p>I filled her in, going all the way back to seeing the picture at Flash Camera, stopping at certain intervals so she could shake her head, request specific details, and call Don all the names I already had that day, which didn\u2019t exactly stop me from chiming in again, for good measure.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said, when it was all done. \u201cThat sucks. Your poor mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I think she\u2019ll be okay. Oh, and Chris and Jennifer Anne are engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, shocked. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you stood there calm and cool, fixing a Diet Zip, and had an entire conversation with me when you had such big information, Remy. God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a long day, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed loudly, still upset with me. \u201cWhat a summer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that just a few months ago your mom and Don were getting married and I was getting dumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a shitty season for relationships,\u201d I agreed. \u201cEnough to make you give up on love altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said easily, not even considering this. \u201cYou can never really do that.\u201d</p><p>I took a measured sip of my drink, pulling my hair out of my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said to her. \u201cI did. I mean, I don\u2019t believe things can really work out. And this latest with Don just confirms it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfirms what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat relationships suck. And that I was right to break things off with Dexter, because it never would have worked. Not in a million years.\u201d</p><p>She thought about this for a second. \u201cYou know what?\u201d she said finally, crossing her legs. \u201cFrankly, I think that\u2019s a bunch of shit. \u201d</p><p>I almost choked on my straw. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d She pulled a hand through her hair, tucking a mass of curls behind one ear. \u201cRemy, as long as I\u2019ve known you, you always thought you had it all figured out. And then something happened this summer that made you wonder if you were right after all. I think you always believed in love, deep down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cThings have happened to me, Lissa. I\u2019ve seen stuff that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, holding up her hand. \u201cI am new to this, I\u2019m not disputing that. But if you truly didn\u2019t believe in it, why did you keep looking all this time? So many boys, so many relationships. For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex,\u201d I said, but she just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNope. Because a part of you wanted to find it. To prove yourself wrong. You had that faith. You know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d I told her. \u201cI lost that faith a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me as I said this, an expression of quiet understanding on her face. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t, though,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLose it, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just hear me out.\u201d She looked out at the road for a second, then back at me. \u201cMaybe, you just misplaced it, you know? It\u2019s been there. But you just haven\u2019t been looking in the right spot. Because lost means forever, it\u2019s gone. But misplaced... that means it\u2019s still around, somewhere. Just not where you thought.\u201d</p><p>As she said this, I saw a blur in my mind of the faces of all the boys I\u2019d been with, literally or just figuratively. They passed quickly, their features melting into one another, like the pages in one of my old Barbie dream date books, none of them truly distinct. They had certain things in common, now that I thought about it: nice faces, good bodies, so many of the qualities I\u2019d drawn up in my mind on yet another checklist. In fact, I\u2019d always approached boys this way, so methodically, making sure before I took even one step that they fit the profile.</p><p>Except, of course, for one.</p><p>I heard a horn beep, loud, and looked up to see Jess pulling in beside us. To my shock, Chloe was in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jess said as they got out, doors slamming, \u201cnobody said anything to me about a meeting. What gives?\u201d</p><p>Lissa and I just sat there, staring at them. Finally she said, \u201cWhat on earth is going on tonight, anyway? Has everyone gone crazy? What are you two doing together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Chloe said flatly. \u201cMy car got a flat over at the mall, and neither one of you was answering the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine my surprise,\u201d Jess added drolly, \u201cwhen I was her last resort.\u201d</p><p>Chloe made a face at her, but it wasn\u2019t a mean one, more just rankled irritation. \u201cI said thank you,\u201d she told Jess. \u201cAnd I will buy you that Zip Drink, as promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deal was Zip Drinks for life,\u201d Jess said, \u201cbut for now I\u2019ll just take one Coke. Extra large, light on the ice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chloe rolled her eyes and headed into the store. Lissa slid off the hood, shaking her own cup. \u201cRefill time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>I handed over my drink, and she followed Chloe in, one in each hand. Jess came over and sat on the bumper, smiling to herself. \u201cI love it that she owes me,\u201d she said, watching as Chloe fixed the drinks, with Lissa chattering away beside her. From the way Chloe kept glancing at her, her mouth dropping open, aghast, I knew she was getting the full story about my mother and Don. So I filled Jess in, getting much of the same reaction, and by the time they returned and we all had our drinks, everyone was more or less on the same page.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Chloe said decisively, taking a sip of her drink. Then she made a face, coughed, and said, \u201cYuck. This is regular Coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Jess said as they traded, both of them wincing now. \u201cBecause this stuff I\u2019m drinking tastes like shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u201d Chloe said, ignoring this. \u201cPatty sent the picture to your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cBut she got the pictures developed at Flash Camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>Chloe swallowed, considering this. \u201cAnd Dexter knew it was her, and what the implications were, so he showed it to you to get you back for dumping him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, during which all I could hear was the sloshing of ice, creaking of straws, and a few doubtful murmurings. Finally Jess said, \u201cI\u2019m not getting the logic of that, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither, now that I think about it,\u201d Lissa agreed.</p><p>\u201cThere is no logic,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was just being a jerk. He knew it was the one way he could really hurt me, so he did it, just when I\u2019d tried to make amends and had my guard down.\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, irritated.</p> <p>\u201cI think,\u201d Chloe began tentatively, \u201cthat there\u2019s really no proof that he even knew that you knew her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. He met her at my mother\u2019s cookout. And she was at Toyotafaire too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot naked,\u201d Lissa pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with it? Naked or not she still had the same face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Chloe said, \u201chow could he have known it was Don that took the picture? Or even that it was in your mom\u2019s room? I mean, I haven\u2019t even been in there. Has he?\u201d</p><p>Now, I was the quiet one, as this logic-if it was even that-suddenly began to click together in my head. I\u2019d just assumed, in my shock, that Dexter had seen my mother\u2019s bedroom, and especially that ugly biblical tapestry. But had he? For all he knew, it was just a picture of a woman who worked for my stepfather getting her kicks taking nudie lingerie pictures in someone\u2019s bedroom. Anyone\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for you being pissed at Dexter,\u201d Chloe said, tapping her nails on the hood of the car. \u201cBut it should be for a good reason. Face it, Remy Starr. You\u2019re in the wrong here.\u201d</p><p>And I was. I\u2019d been so ready to blame Dexter for everything, from my mother\u2019s marriage dissolving to making me trust him in a way I hadn\u2019t anyone else in a long time. But none of it was his fault.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I said softly. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo find him and apologize,\u201d Lissa said decisively.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it was a mistake, don\u2019t find him, move on,\u201d Chloe countered.</p><p>I looked at Jess, but she just shrugged and said, \u201cI have no idea. It\u2019s all you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d yelled at him. Told him to fuck off, thrown the picture at him, and stalked out even as he was trying to explain. I\u2019d dumped him because he\u2019d wanted more from me than to be a faceless, smelling-of-sunshine-and-chlorine summer boyfriend, made to order.</p><p>So what had changed? Nothing. Even if I did go to him, we\u2019d already be too late, no time left to make a foundation before we were flung to opposite coasts, and everyone knew that kind of relationship never worked.</p><p>It was just like my mother said. Everything, in the end, comes down to timing. One second, one minute, one hour, could make all the difference. So much hanging on just these things, tiny increments that together build a life. Like words build a story, and what had Ted said? One word can change the entire world.</p><p>Hey, Dexter had said that first day he sat down beside me. That was one word. If I\u2019d talked one minute longer with Don in the office, Dexter might already have been called away and gone when I came out. If my mother and I waited maybe another hour, Don might not have been at the dealership the day we went shopping for her new car. And if Jennifer Anne hadn\u2019t needed that oil change on that particular day of that particular week, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have ever looked over a Jiffy Lube counter and seen Chris at all. But something, somehow, had made all these paths converge. You couldn\u2019t find it on a checklist, or work it into the equation. It just happened.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Jess said suddenly, tugging at the cuff of my jeans. \u201cCheck this out.\u201d</p><p>I looked up, my mind still reeling. It was Don. He was driving a shiny, brand-new dealer-tagged Land Cruiser, which he parked on the other side of the Quik Zip. He didn\u2019t see us as he got out, hitting the remote door lock, and went inside, smoothing a hand over the thinning hair on the back of his head as he did so.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d I said. \u201cTalk about timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lissa whispered.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d We all watched as he moved down the aisle of the Quik Zip, picking up a bottle of aspirin and a bag of potato chips, which, I figured, was the chosen meal of adulterers. Even when he was checking out he didn\u2019t look at us, glancing instead at the headlines of the newspapers stacked by the register. Then he walked out, fiddling with the lid of the aspirin, and got back into his car.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Chloe said.</p><p>It was true. He\u2019d hurt my mother badly, and there wasn\u2019t much I could do to make her feel better. Except maybe one thing.</p><p>Don started the car and headed toward us. I lifted up my Diet Zip, feeling the weight in my hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Lissa whispered.</p><p>\u201cOn three,\u201d Jess said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see us until he was right next to Lissa\u2019s car, and by then I\u2019d already put my whole arm into it, my cup sailing through the air and smacking right against the windshield, exploding soda all over the shiny hood. He hit the brakes, swerving slightly, as two other cups crashed against the back door and sunroof, respectively. But it was Lissa\u2019s, surprisingly, that had the best hit. It nailed his half-open window perfectly, the lid breaking off on impact, sending a wave of ice and 7UP smack in his face and down his shirt. He slowed down but didn\u2019t stop, the cups sailing off as he jerked into traffic, the car leaving a wet trail as it drove away from us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d Jess said to Lissa. \u201cGreat arc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Lissa said. \u201cChloe\u2019s was good too. Did you see that impact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist,\u201d Chloe said, shrugging.</p><p>Then we just sat there. I could hear the buzz of the Quik Zip sign overhead, that constant hum of fluorescence, and for a minute I lost myself in it, remembering Dexter standing in this same place not too long before, waving after me. Arms open. Calling me back, or saying good-bye. Or maybe a little bit of both.</p> <p>He\u2019d always had that fearless optimism that made cynics like me squirm. I wondered if it was enough for both of us. I would never know from here, though. And time was passing. Crucial minutes and seconds, each one capable of changing everything.</p><p>I drove off, with my friends watching me go, all of them grouped on Lissa\u2019s hood. As I pulled onto the road, I glanced into the rearview and saw them: they were waving, hands moving through the air, their voices loud, calling out after me. The square of that mirror was like a frame, holding this picture of them saying good-bye, pushing me forward, before shifting gently out of sight, inch by fluid inch, as I turned away.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I knew from experience that there were nine decent reception halls in town. At the fifth one, I found Truth Squad.</p><p>I saw the white van as soon as I pulled into the parking lot of the Hanover Inn. It was parked around back, by the service entrance, next to a catering van. As I got out of my car, I could hear music, the faint beat of bass guitar. Through the long windows that broke up the building, I saw people dancing. The bride was in the center, a blur of white, trailing tulle, leading a conga line around in a wide, lopsided circle.</p> <p>In the lobby, I passed some girls in hideous baby blue bridesmaids dresses, complete with big bows on the back, as well as someone wheeling a big ice sculpture depicting wedding bells. The sign next to the door said MEADOWS-DOYLE reception, and I slipped in the far door and moved along the back wall, trying to stay hidden.</p><p>The band was onstage, in their G Flats garb. Dexter was singing an old Motown song, which I recognized as one of their regular covers, and behind him Ted was strumming his guitar with a bored, irritated expression, as if just standing there was paining him.</p><p>The song ended with a flourish, provided by John Miller, who then stood up for applause. It came, but barely, and he sat back down again with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cHello everyone,\u201d Dexter said into the microphone in his game show host voice. \u201cLet\u2019s give another big congratulations to Janine and Robert, the Doyles!\u201d</p><p>Now, a big cheer as the bride beamed, blowing kisses at everyone.</p><p>\u201cThis next song is a special one from the bride to her groom,\u201d Dexter went on, glancing at Lucas, who nodded. \u201cBut the rest of you, feel free to sing along.\u201d</p> <p>The band launched into the opening chords of a song I barely recognized as one from a recent blockbuster movie. It was a power ballad, totally schmaltzy, and even Dexter, who was usually the best sport of the bunch, seemed to deflate when he had to deliver a line about loving you till the stars are gone / and the heart I have just turns to stone... Around the second chorus, Ted actually started gagging, stopping only when he had to concentrate hard on the guitar solo that wound up the final verse. The bride and groom, however, seemed oblivious to this, staring into each other\u2019s eyes as they danced, their bodies pressed together so closely they were hardly moving.</p><p>The song finished and everyone clapped. The bride was crying, her new husband reaching up to wipe her eyes while everyone made ain\u2019t-it-sweet noises. Truth Squad left the stage squabbling, Ted and Lucas already at each other, with Dexter and John Miller lagging behind. They all disappeared out a side door as the canned music came on and the staff wheeled the cake, four tiered and covered with roses, onto the dance floor.</p><p>As the door shut behind them I moved to follow, but something stopped me, and I took a step back, pressing myself against the wall and closing my eyes. God, it was one thing to come over here on a wave of post-Don soakage euphoria, but another thing entirely to actually do this crazy thing. It was like driving on the wrong side of the road, or letting my gas gauge get down to flat empty before refilling, something that went completely against my nature and everything I had, up until this point, believed in.</p><p>But what had that gotten me so far, anyway? A string of boyfriends. A reputation as a cold, bitter bitch. And a secure bubble that I\u2019d drawn so tightly around myself that no one, not even someone with the best of intentions, could get in, even if I wanted them to. The only way to truly reach me was to sneak up, crash in, bust past the barricades on the equivalent of a kamikaze mission, end result unknown.</p><p>That night at the Quik Zip he\u2019d told me, so angrily, that everything he\u2019d said to me, from the first day, was true. Then, I had blanked, not remembering anything. But now, as I pressed my back into the wall, it came to me.</p><p>I just thought to myself, all of a sudden, that we had something in common, he\u2019d said. A natural chemistry, if you will.</p><p>That had been right after he\u2019d crashed into me. My arm had been still buzzing at the funny bone.</p><p>And I just had a feeling that something big was going to happen.</p> <p>I remembered, suddenly, how ridiculous this had sounded. A car dealership soothsayer, telling my fortune.</p><p>To both of us. That we were, in fact, meant to be together.</p><p>Meant to be. He hadn\u2019t known me at all. Just seen me from across a room.</p><p>You didn\u2019t feel it?</p><p>Not then. Or maybe, deep in some hidden, misplaced spot, I had. And when I couldn\u2019t find it later, it came looking for me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re about to cut the cake!\u201d some woman in a green, shimmery dress was calling out as I pushed away from the wall, headed to that side door. Halfway there I got lost in a mass of people, all depositing their empty drinks on tables and pressing toward the dance floor. I navigated through them, past suits and tuxedos, crinkly dresses and a thick cloud of mixed perfumes before finally coming out on the other side. The door to the parking lot was open now, and as I stepped through it I saw the band had disappeared, with only a few tangerine peels remaining, scattered around the curb.</p><p>From behind me, I heard a drum roll, followed by a crash of cymbals, and the best man was at the microphone, holding his glass aloft. John Miller was behind his drum set, picking at his teeth, while Lucas snuck some more beer into a cup off to the side of the stage. Ted was standing glumly next to his amp, as if he\u2019d lost a bet. I craned my neck, looking for Dexter, but then a large woman in a pink dress stepped in front of the door, blocking my view. And suddenly I just knew I was too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stepped back out into the fresh air, crossing my arms over my chest. Bad timing, again. It was hard not to think this was some kind of cue from the universe, letting me know that this wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. I tried, and failed. There. It was over.</p><p>But God! Who could live like this, anyway, with the kind of guesswork that was enough to make a person crazy, just sailing along, taking the bumps here and there, no course navigated whatsoever, with any big wave capable of just tipping and sinking you entirely. It was madness, stupidity, and-</p><p>Then I saw him. Sitting there on the curb, under a streetlight, knees pulled up to his chest. And for one second, it was like I could feel the timing clicking together, finally, pieces falling into place. Behind me, the best man was winding up his toast, his voice sounding tight, emotional. To the happy couple, he said, and everyone repeated it, their voices blending as one. To the happy couple.</p><p>And then I was walking toward Dexter, folding my fingers tight into my hands. I could hear the cheers as the bridal couple cut their cake. So I took the last few steps of this long journey fast, almost running, before plunking myself down and knocking into Dexter, just enough to tip his balance for a second. Because I knew, now, this was how it had to begin. The only way was to crash in.</p> <p>I knocked him sideways, startling him. But once he got his equilibrium, and his wits, back, he just looked at me. Not even one word. Because we knew it had to come from me this time.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I took in his dark curls, the smell of his skin, that cheap tuxedo with the loose threads on the cuff. He was just looking at me, not pulling back, but not moving closer either. And I felt a sudden whirl in my head, knowing this leap was now inevitable, that I wasn\u2019t just on the cliff, toes poking over, but already in midair.</p><p>\u201cDid you really believe, that first day, that we were meant to be together?\u201d I asked him.</p> <p>He looked at me and then said, \u201cYou\u2019re here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>There was only so much space between us, not even a real distance if measured in miles or feet or even inches, all the things that told you how far you\u2019d come or had left to go. But this was a big space, if only for me. And as I moved forward to him, covering it, he waited there on the other side. It was only the last little bit I had to go, but in the end, I knew it would be all I would truly remember. So as I kissed him, bringing this summer and everything else full circle, I let myself fall, and was not scared of the ground I knew would rise up to meet me. Instead, I just pulled him closer, my hand sliding up around his neck to find that one place where I could feel his heartbeat pulsing. It was fast, like my own, and finding it, I pressed down hard, as if it was all that connected us, and kept my finger there.</p><p>November</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Melanie knew she had a choice. There was a time when she would have run after Luc, and the security he\u2019d provided. And in another, more distant past, Brock would have seemed like the answer to all the questions that still woke her in the night, heart racing, wondering how she\u2019d gotten here. The choice was clear, and yet not clear at all. As Melanie boarded the train that would take her to the station in Paris, she picked a window compartment and sank into the seat, pressing one hand against the glass. The countryside would soon slip away, replaced by the beautiful skylines that were the backdrop for so much of her past. She had the entire trip to figure out what her next step should be. And as the train pulled away, gaining speed, she settled back into her seat, relishing only the forward motion, as it pulled her toward her destiny.</p><p>\u201cRemy?\u201d</p> <p>I looked up to see my roommate, Angela, standing in the open doorway of our room. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMail call.\u201d She came over and sat down beside me, dealing out envelopes into two piles. \u201cSchool crap. Credit card offer. Something from the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses... that must be yours...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for that forever.\u201d Angela was from L.A., taught aerobics part-time, and never made her bed. She wasn\u2019t a perfect match for me, but we got along okay.</p><p>\u201cOh, and this big one\u2019s yours,\u201d she said, sliding a large manila envelope out from under the calculus textbook she was carrying. \u201cHow\u2019s the book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d I said, marking my page and shutting it. It was only a bound galley of Barbara Starr\u2019s newest, The Choice, but already three girls on my hall had asked me to borrow it when I was done. I was thinking, though, that they would be surprised by the ending, just as my mother\u2019s editor and publisher had been. I\u2019d been a little shocked myself, reading the manuscript on the plane on the way out to school. I mean, in romance novels you just expected the heroine to end up with a man, some man, at the end. But Melanie, instead, made the choice of no choice, packing up her Paris memories and heading across the world to start anew with no lingering loves to hold her back. Not bad for an ending, I thought. It was, after all, the one I\u2019d planned for myself, not too long ago.</p><p>Angela left the room, headed to the library, as I picked up the manila envelope and opened it, dumping its contents into my lap. The first thing I saw was a bunch of pictures, bound with a rubber band: the one on the top was of me, squinting, the sun bright in my face. There was something wrong with the picture, though: it seemed out of balance. There was also a blurred edge on the top, and a weird kind of afterimage splayed across the left side. They were all a bit off, I realized, as I flipped through them. Most of them were of Dexter, and a few of me, with several featuring John Miller. Some were of inanimate objects, like a tire or a tangerine, with the same defects. Finally, I realized what they were, remembering all those warped wedding cameras Dexter and the rest of them had been toting around most of the summer. So the pictures had come out, after all, just as Dexter had predicted. They weren\u2019t perfect, though, as I\u2019d maintained. In the end, like so much else, they were good enough.</p><p>The other thing in the envelope was a CD wrapped in cardboard, taped carefully. The label on it said RUBBER RECORDS, and, beneath that, in smaller letters, TRUTH SQUAD. I knew the first cut well: it was called \u201cPotato Song, Part One.\u201d I knew the second song even better.</p><p>I picked up my Walkman and slid on the headphones, pressing the CD in and hitting play. It made that little whirring sound, finding the tracks, and then I pressed past cut one, as I knew most people would eventually do, to call up the second song. Then I lay back across my bed, hearing the opening chords, and picked up the last picture in the stack.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was of Dexter and me, at the airport, the day I\u2019d left for school. The top edge was a bit blurry, and there was a weird sun-burst of color in the bottom right corner, but otherwise it was a good shot. We were standing in front of a window, and I had my head on his shoulder, both of us smiling. I\u2019d been sad that day, but not in a final, end-of-story way. Like Melanie, I was heading off to my new world. But I was taking a part of my past, and the future, along with me for the ride.</p><p>The song was building in my headphones, the first words about to begin over the new, jazzy, retro-style start. I turned the picture over, and saw there was something on the back. Scrawled in black ink, smeared (of course), it said, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Austin... and you. I\u2019ll be there soon.</p><p>I reached over and turned up the volume, letting Dexter\u2019s voice fill my ears, smooth and fluid. And even though I had heard it so many times already, I still felt that little catch of breath as it began.</p><p>This lullaby is only a few words</p> <p>A simple run of chords</p><p>Quiet here in this spare room</p><p>But you can hear it, hear it</p><p>Wherever you may go</p><p>Even if I let you down</p> <p>This lullaby plays on...</p><p>I knew that there were no guarantees. No way of knowing what came next for me, or him, or anybody. Some things don\u2019t last forever, but some things do. Like a good song, or a good book, or a good memory you can take out and unfold in your darkest times, pressing down the corners and peering in close, hoping you still recognize the person you see there. Dexter was a whole country away from me now. But I had a good feeling he would get to me, one way or another. And if not, I\u2019d already proved I could meet him halfway.</p><p>But for now, I just sat there on the bed and listened to my song. The one that had been written for me by a man who knew me not at all, now sung by the one who knew me best. Maybe it would be the hit the record company predicted, striking a chord in our collective past, prompting a wave of nostalgia that would carry Dexter and the band everywhere they\u2019d ever dreamed. Or maybe, no one would hear it at all. That was the thing: you just never knew. Right now, though, I wanted not to think forward or backward, but only to lose myself in the words. So I lay back, closing my eyes, and let them fill my mind, new and familiar all at once, rising and falling with my very breath, steady, as they sang me to sleep.</p>  </body></html>"]
